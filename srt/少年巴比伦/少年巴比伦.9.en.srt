a person.

were stalked by him.

We were all scared.

00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,440

69
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,120

Yeah.

you left the party early yesterday

00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,240
in the future,

111
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,760

your work performance
has been outstanding.

114
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,080
So, upon my suggestion,

115
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,050
and with the unanimous agreement
of the bureau leaders,

116
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,240
it was decided

117
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,200
to allocate this graduate opportunity

118
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,560

122
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,720
That's not right.

123
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,320
I heard from people at the factory

124
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,720
that his son joined the army.

125
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,010
He's been bragging about it to everyone.

126
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,440
Wu from the police station knows him

127
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,880
and said he has a mental illness.

128
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,960
I guess Ding Dezhong
didn't want to lose face,

129
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,720
so he kept his son hidden at home

130
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,560
without telling anyone.

131
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,480
Where is he now?

132
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,450
I sent him to the Security Department.

133
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,520
But Wu said
he has a mental illness certificate,

134
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,340
so there's no way
to hold him accountable.

135
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,300
We can only ask Ding Dezhong
to take good care of him.

136
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,640
What does that mean?

137
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,680
Are we just going to let this slide?

138
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,320
What about those girls?

139
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,400
They were harassed for nothing?

140
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,240
Exactly.

141
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,520
Hey, could that
mental illness certificate

142
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,000
be fake

143
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,840
like the one Afang had?

144
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,760
If it's fake,

145
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,320
it won't pass scrutiny.

146
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,560
But if it's real,

147
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,920
he should be sent to a hospital.

148
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,280
If Ding Dezhong could handle him,

149
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,000
he wouldn't have been able
to do so many bad things.

150
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,520
Dajiang,

151
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,520

- Listen to me.
- Yu.

157
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,400
He did something wrong.
It's our fault as parents.

158
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,560
We didn't teach him well.

159
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,600
You can't treat him like this.

160
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,800
Listen to me, listen to me.

161
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,880
Captain Wu, listen to me.

162
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,120
If there's anything, tell us.

163
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,120
We adults are responsible.

164
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,320
- It's our fault.
- Let's get him to the hospital first.

165
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,880
- No, no.
- Are you planning to go home just like this?

166
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,320
Let's hospitalize the child first.

167
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,400
Your son has scared so many people.

168
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,990
Aren't you going to explain something?

169
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,840
I'm here.

170
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,080
- Mom's here. Don't be afraid.
- Dajiang.

171
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,640
- Don't be afraid.
- It's our family's trouble.

You've seen it all.

173
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,160
We're all family here. Do me a favor.

174
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,320

What are you doing?

178
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,120
You can't do this.

What are you trying to do?

184
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,120
Is there no law anymore?

185
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,840
Stop hitting.

186
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,320
Stop shouting!

187
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,160
I think

188
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,200
we should take him to the hospital.

189
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,440
In case something happens,

190
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,200
nobody can bear the responsibility.

191
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,120
- No, no.
- Is that right?

192
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,840
No one can take Yu away.

193
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,400
Yu can't leave me. No.

194
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,880
Mrs. Ding, listen to me.

195
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,960
Mrs. Ding, hear me out.

196
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,160
Auntie!

197
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,760
Yu!

198
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,240
Mom! Mom!

199
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,560
Yu! Yu!

200
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,840
Mr. and Mrs. Ding,

201
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,200
I'll go with him, okay?

202
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,760
- I'll go.
- Alright, alright.

203
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,120
Yu, I'm here.

204
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,640
Listen to me. Ma will be with him.

205
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,600
Yu!

206
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,520
Auntie.

207
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,560
Alright.

208
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,400
Lu Dajiang,

209
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,080
since you are ruthless towards me,

210
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,600
don't blame me for not showing mercy.

211
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,120
Let's wait and see.

212
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,560
No need to work in the Bureau today?

213
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,680
The task is over.

214
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,600
I'm back to where I came from.

215
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,240
I thought...

216
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,320
What did you think?

217
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,120
Thought being seconded to the Bureau

218
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,960
would turn me

219
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,920
from a small factory doctor

220
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,040
into an official who drives a sedan?

221
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,600
Actually, I wasn't thinking.

222
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,600
I was afraid.

223
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,960
I hate those petty officials

224
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,800
who act all high and mighty.

225
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,440
I can't even imagine

226
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,000
what if one day the person I like

227
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,520
becomes like that.

228
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,160
I...

229
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,000
I mean,

230
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,080
I still prefer
how you look in a white coat.

231
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,560
But I don't want

232
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,840
to be a sedan-driving official,

233
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,880
nor a factory doctor in a white coat.

234
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,480
So, what do you want to do?

235
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,600
I'm afraid Fucheng

236
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,360
isn't big enough for my dreams.

237
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,400
Come, I'll take you somewhere.

238
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,680
Where to?

239
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,640
Let's go.

240
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,080
Slow down.

241
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,800
(Gongyuan)

242
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,840
Ding Dezhong's niece?

243
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,010
Is there anything good about her?

244
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,920
What do you call her?

245
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,920
Little Pouter.

246
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,560
Well, it's mainly

247
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,720
because she's just very pretty and sexy.

248
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,360
You like her, but does she like you?

249
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,160
Women look for three things.

250
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,520
Talent,

251
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,520
looks,

252
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,040
or money.

253
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,840
Look in the mirror,

254
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,600
and feel your pocket.

255
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,840
What do you have?

256
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,840
Dajiang,

257
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,800
what do you have then?

258
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,000
Can't you see?

259
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,720
I have all of them.

260
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,640
As for you,

261
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,600
you've lost

262
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,200
the first two.

263
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,600
But money...

264
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,040
If you want to make money in my place,

265
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,600
you need to have the knack for it.

266
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,360
Come on, where are we now?

267
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,560
Dajiang.

268
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,840
Ladies and gentlemen,

269
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,560
welcome to the New Century Grand Theater.

270
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,520
I am Fucheng's famous singer

271
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,120
for love songs, Lu Xiaolu.

272
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,640
Today, I dedicate

273
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,960
my debut performance here

274
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,840
to the beautiful lady below,

275
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,960
Bai Lan.

How's that?

Good.

293
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,560
Aren't you afraid they'll kick us out?

294
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,000
You might not know

295
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,480
I'm a lifetime member of this theater.

296
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,320
The most brilliant moments of my life

297
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,480
both happened here.

298
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,840
- Really?
- Yes.

299
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,360
Tell me how brilliant they were.

300
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,840
The first time was
when I was in third grade.

301
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,200
My cousin and I were here

302
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,540
watching a movie, "Shaolin Temple".

303
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,420
The place was so packed,
and people were standing in the aisles.

304
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,920
While watching,

305
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,080
suddenly I noticed

306
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,260
smoke rising beside the screen,

307
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,760
and flames jumping.

308
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,160
I was the first to notice.

309
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,640
What happened next?

310
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,160
Then, my cousin and I

311
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,000
helped put out the fire
and evacuate the crowd.

312
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,410
Lucky, I spotted it early,

313
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:18,440
or it could have been too late

314
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,560
and killed someone.

315
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,760
Because of this, the school awarded me

316
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,480
a certificate for bravery.

317
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,920
This was the first award

318
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,880
I got in my life.

319
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,000
Seems your most brilliant times

320
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,120
were all when you were a child.

321
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,320
There were also times when I grew up.

322
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,050
In the second grade of junior high,

323
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,240
at that time,

324
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,440
I put shampoo

325
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,400
in our teacher's teapot.

326
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,610
As a result,

327
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,720
I was forced

328
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,240
to make a public apology here

329
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,000
during a school-wide movie session.

330
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,440
But that was because the teacher

331
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,520
was always picking on Li Guangnan

332
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,240
for being poor.

333
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,360
Hey, I'm telling you.

334
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,760
It was so funny.

335
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,200
While the teacher was scolding me,

336
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,800
he was also spitting out bubbles.

337
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,720
It was hilarious.

338
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,400
That sounds pretty interesting.

339
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,800
So, how did you make your apology?

340
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,160
At that time, I stood here

341
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,320
and recited a poem.

342
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,080
Over the vast sea,

343
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,360
where wild winds whip up the clouds,

344
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,840
between the clouds and the sea,

345
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,400
the petrel flies like dark lightning,

346
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,960
proudly soaring.

347
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,520
In its cries,

348
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,600
there's a longing for the storm.

349
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,840
In these cries,

350
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,800
the clouds hear the power of anger,

351
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,160
the flames of passion
and the confidence of victory.

352
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,520
The storm,

353
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,840
the storm is coming.

354
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,880
It's the brave petrel,

355
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,440
soaring proudly

356
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,720
over the roaring sea,

357
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,720

yet you're drinking it?

Aren't you disgusted?

388
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,440
What a waste.

It's okay.

drink from this bottle.

396
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,360

really that popular lately?

407
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,840
Don't know.

you were the class beauty,

of our food factory.

00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,160
Of course.

00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,360
I swear

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,800

00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,320
to talk or vent,

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,600

Can it make you forget
the bitterness in your heart?

especially for me, right?

470
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,480

you would be here,

Nothing.

00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,480
Just admit it's a love letter.

493
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,840
Only when writing love letters

494
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,280
does one get so serious and troubled.

495
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,160
It's okay if you don't admit it.

496
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,920
It's all written on your face.

No.

499
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,960
Why be shy about it?

500
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,880
You like Xiaolu, and he likes you too.

501
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,040
I don't like him.

502
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,640
Alright, I get it.

503
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,740
You're a college girl
with high standards.

504
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,200
Bi Zhigang is also pursuing you.

505
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,400
But our Xiaolu

506
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,480
is actually quite good.

507
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,000
Back in school, many girls pursued him.

508
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,520
He's a good guy.

509
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,880
It's not about him, it's about me.

510
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,600
Well,

511
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,280
what's wrong with you today?

512
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,160
Nothing. I'm going to freshen up.

513
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,480
Try this.

514
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,120
How is it?

515
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,960
The milk isn't fresh enough.

516
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,880
There's too much sugar.

517
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,080
And this tea.

518
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,050
Did you use flavoring additives
because they're cheaper?

519
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,960
You need to use fresh tea leaves.

520
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,760
If it's as bad as you say,

521
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,160
then why do people queue up for it?

522
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,680
That's because everyone's tired

523
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,080
of cola and Jianlibao.

524
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,840
They just want to try something new.

525
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,200
I have a good idea.

526
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,600
Do you want to join me?

527
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:13,960
Tell us.

528
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,280
Since our tastes are superior

529
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,440
and our formula is unique,

530
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,800
why don't we set up a stall?

531
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,040
Look, Lu, you handle the recipe,

532
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,200
I'll manage the sales.

533
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,800
Big Feet is talented and versatile,

534
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,880
so he can draw in customers.

535
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,440
We could set up our stall
right at the entrance of the skating rink.

536
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,680
Dajiang is the big boss.

537
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:34,940
Once we start making money,
we can share the profits proportionally.

538
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,440
If we find an outlet,

539
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,280
we can
open a shop and mass produce,

540
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,610
and even expand throughout the city.

541
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,680
Li,

542
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,760
come here.

543
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,400
Take your temperature.

544
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,480
Are you feverish?

545
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I'm not feverish.

546
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,680
This is the fire in my heart, Lu.

547
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,680
You're well off.

548
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,560
You have it all.

549
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,660
You can find a girlfriend easily.

550
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,120
But for people like me and Big Feet,

551
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,320
we have nothing.

552
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,760
I want to win over Little Pouter
and make her happy,

553
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,840
so my priority is to make money.

554
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,400
Alright.

555
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,240
Leave the recipe to me.

556
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,320
But let's get one thing straight.

557
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,160
We start with a trial stall.

558
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,840
We can't be successful overnight.

559
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,680
Well...

560
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,880
Don't worry about my cousin.

561
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,400
I'll convince him.

562
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,200
Thanks, bro.

563
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,440
Hey, hey, save it.

564
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,080
You've been fiddling
with that cassette all day.

565
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,400
Is it fixed yet?

566
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,760
Almost, almost.

567
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,640
Lu,

568
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,360
remind Dajiang.

569
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,560
Little Pouter passed a message,

570
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,080
saying Ding Dezhong might seek revenge

571
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:49,920
because of his son.

572
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,640
Dear Xiaolu,

573
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,640
I'm sorry.

574
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,680
Congratulations to me.

575
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,520
Does Xiaolu know?

576
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,400
I was just about to tell him.

577
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,440
Why are you suddenly going to Shanghai?

578
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,540
Aren't you afraid
Xiaolu will be heartbroken?

579
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,560
This is something
I've always wanted to do.

580
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,200
So,

581
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,040
after you finish
your sponsored postgraduate study,

582
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,520
will you come back?

583
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,080
I don't know.

584
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,400
You're being selfish.

585
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:10,920
Big Feet,

586
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,800
you're here alone?

587
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,660
You want to see Xiaolu, right?

588
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,760
He and Li Guangnan
are studying milk tea.

589
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:18,880
Milk tea?

590
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,520
Guangnan had a sudden inspiration,

591
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,120
thinking that the milk tea

592
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,520
Xiaolu gave you was especially delicious.

593
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,440
So,

594
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,120
he thought about making more

595
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,080
and then selling it.

596
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,050
Did you come here for something?

597
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,400
Nothing much.

598
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,440
What are you doing?

599
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,200
I'm working on a mobile milk tea cart.

600
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,760
Is this Xiaolu's table?

601
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,680
Yeah, that's right.

602
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,200
Then I'll be going.

603
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,400
When he comes back,

604
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,520
tell him to call me.

605
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,480
Sure.

606
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,000
- Bye.
- Bye.

607
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,760
Ding Dezhong wants to retaliate.

608
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,080
You go and make some inquiries.

609
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,750
- Who am I afraid of?
- That milk was really cheap.

610
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,960
Milk?

611
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,280
Wasn't it goat milk?

612
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,120
Milk.

613
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:20,280
- That's right.
- Here comes the milk!

614
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,640
So much.

615
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,320
How much did this cost?

616
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,720
Didn't cost a penny.

617
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,740
This was leftover
from the Cold Beverage Department.

618
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,430
The director said it would be a waste
to throw it away,

619
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,160
so he just gave it all to us.

620
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,320
Can such a good thing happen to us?

621
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,360
Do you know what this is called?

622
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,920
This is called perfect timing

623
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,360
and wealth flowing in.

624
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,400
Exactly.

625
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,480
- Try it.
- Here.

626
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,800
Hey, good.

627
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,240
Let me have a try.

628
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,520

You can't put it in.

631
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,040
Right.

632
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,000
Bai Lan, your call!

633
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,280
Coming.

There was no problem at all.

Look what happened

638
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,010
after drinking your milk tea.

639
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,400
If you don't
give me an explanation today,

640

I...

641
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,600
Are you alright?

642
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,280
- Sorry.
- Let's go.

643
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,720
No, no. Hurry. Give me some tissues.

644
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,800
- Here it is, here.
- Here. Here.

645

Tissues. Tissues.

646
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,360
Xiaolu.

647
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,200
Bai Lan,

648
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,040
you're finally here.

649
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,600
I think it's food poisoning

650
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,480
caused by unclean food.

651
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,240
Distribute these medicines now.

652
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,160
- Is it serious?
- Just a lot of people.

653
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,880
Three pills each.

654
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,400
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. I didn't drink it.

655
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,380
Get some cars

656
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:19,480
and get everyone to the infirmary.

657
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,240
Alright.

658
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,560
You're back.

659
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,400
How are you? Are you feeling any better?

660
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,840
I'm dying, Xiaolu.

661
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,920
If I really kick the bucket,

662
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,840
you'll have to look after my parents.

663
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,700
- What are you talking about?
- Get lost. What are you saying?

664
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,920
Dumb Jar, take him to the infirmary.

665
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,000

666

- Everyone, hold on a bit.

- Come with me to the infirmary.
- Let's go to the infirmary.

Let's go.

Let's go.

670
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,280
Come on.

671
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,320

00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,680

Let me take you out for some food.

Letter?

701
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,600

709
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,280
You lied, right?

710
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,720
That's because I'm tired.

711
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,200
Everyone, wait a moment.

712
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,160
Let me say a few words.

713
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,960
The factory leadership is already aware

714
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,560
of the food poisoning incident last night.

715
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,720
Secretary Hong takes it very seriously

716
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:57,960
and is very concerned.

717
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,800
He decided to rush back
from out of town today.

00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,520

719
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,320

720

Food hygiene and safety
are of utmost importance.

721
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:10,160
Such a serious, egregious,

722
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,840
and widely impacting incident

723
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,920
of food hygiene

724
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,200
in our public health facility

725
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,520
will not be tolerated or overlooked

726
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,000
by the factory leadership
and the Food Bureau.

727
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,080
We will definitely take strict actions

728
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,480
against these speculative profiteers.

729
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,520
These speculative profiteers...

730
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,360
Who are you calling speculative?

731
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,160
Li Guangnan,

732
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,560
did I name you?

733
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,280
Why are you rushing to confess?

734
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,280
You and Lu Xiaolu

735
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,640
will have to bear the consequences.

736
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,920
Neither of you can escape.

737
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,280
Alright,

738
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,240
since it has already happened,

739
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,400
please go home and rest well.

740
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,120
We will surely give everyone

741
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:46,960
a proper explanation.

742
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,040
Dismiss.

743
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,260
It's all my fault
for being greedy for a bargain,

744
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,920
insisting on using
that nearly expired milk.

745
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,800
We were too hasty.

746
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:25,920
But don't worry.

747
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,320
This started because of me.

748
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,440
I'll take full responsibility.

749
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,400
It won't affect you and Big Feet.

750
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:48,920
Uncle,

751
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,600
Li Guangnan has it tough.

752
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,360
Could you please...

753
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,560
Speak well of him

754
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,440
to Secretary Hong?

755
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,400
Why should I help him?

756
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,040
Let me ask you.

757
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,360
When they ganged up

758
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,120
to send your cousin
to the mental institution,

759
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,200
who helped me?

760
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,640
What were you doing then?

761
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,520
Why didn't you stand up

762
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,760
for your cousin?

763
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,040
He did this for me.

764
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,960
If we're really to blame,

765
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,640
I'm also responsible.

766
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,160
I know he's pursuing you,

767
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,800
but is he worthy of you?

768
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,720
Don't degrade yourself

769
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,840
by crawling into a rat's nest.

770
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,680
Tell him to be here.

771
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,320
I'll talk to him face-to-face.

772
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,120
Alright.

773
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,640
Xiaoying.

774
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,600
Wait a moment.

775
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,320
How prestigious Lu Xiaolu is!

776
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,480
He has never returned it himself.

777
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,560
Something happened
at the skating rink last night.

778
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,880
He was busy all night without rest.

779
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,320
Is he alright?

780
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:32,960
He should be fine.

781
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,160
Then I should serve him more.

782
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,520
How was the braised pork ribs last time?

783
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,920
They were especially delicious.

784
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,840
Especially delicious.

785
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,680
He said they were especially delicious.

786
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,480
You didn't sneak a taste, did you?

787
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,560
No, no, no.

788
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,440
I... I just smelled it

789
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,720
when he was eating,

790
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,080
and then felt it was especially delicious.

791
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,960
Alright then. Wait there,

792
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,840
I'll get it ready for you.

793
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,000
(Factory Workers are Like Family,
Love the Factory Like Home)

794
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,840
How is it?

795
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,040
What's this?

796
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,200
You got it wrong.

797
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,800
My milk tea is sold
at the entrance of the skating rink.

798
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,600
But what does this
have to do with Dajiang?

799
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,840
He just lent me a place.

800
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,680
Li Guangnan,

801
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,640
don't rush to play the hero.

802
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,880
You're a smart person.

803
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,760
You should know

804
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,800
this isn't just about selling milk tea.

805
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,480
I understand.

806
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,480
You're trying to take revenge, huh?

807
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:03,920
Revenge?

808
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:10,140
I'm just seeking justice
that's rightfully mine.

809
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Ding Dezhong, I'm telling you.

810
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,640
You've asked the wrong person.

811
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,000
I can't betray my friends.

812
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,400
Does Lu Dajiang
even consider you a friend?

813
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,640
He only cares

814
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,360
about his cousin, Lu Xiaolu.

815
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,120
Lu Xiaolu is my brother.

816
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:25,960
You...

817
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,720
You, Lu Xiaolu, and our Juan

818
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,960
have been old classmates
and friends for years.

819
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,960
But do you know

820
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,000
why I only asked you to be here,

821
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,040
instead of Lu Xiaolu?

822
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,120
Because Juan asked me to help you.

823
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,880
To help you, not Lu Xiaolu.

824
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:57,210
Really?

825
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,960
Let me tell you the truth.

826
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,000
This matter has blown up.

827
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,600
The Health Bureau
has informed the police.

828
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,680
The police called the factory management,

829
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,360
saying this was
an illegal unlicensed operation

830
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,880
and a serious
poisoning incident occurred.

831
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,280
If they really investigate,

832
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,080
a few years in jail
wouldn't be surprising.

833
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,880
I know the situation at your home.

834
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,760
What will happen to your family

835
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,720
if you end up in jail?

836
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,120
Can your father still see his doctor?

837
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,280
Will your mother survive?

838
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:35,920
I know

839
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,360
you've been pursuing Juan
for many years,

840
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,280
but even if she says yes,

841
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,440
do you think I'd let her

842
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,920
marry someone who has nothing?

843
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,600
Would I?

844
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,160
It's all been investigated.

845
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:52,790
The ingredients
that caused the food poisoning

846
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:54,360
came from the Cold Beverage Department.

847
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,400
Director He from the department admitted

848
00:43:56,430 --> 00:43:58,050
that he took a pack of cigarettes
from Li Guangnan

849
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,280
and then gave him

850
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,420
the two leftover buckets of milk.

851
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,280
Isn't this undermining socialism?

852
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,240
Meticulous inspection day and night

853
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,750
is not enough
to protect us from an inside job.

854
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,060
According to factory rules,

855
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,480
how should this be dealt with?

856
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,360
Per our disciplinary regulations,

857
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,160
Li Guangnan will be dismissed,

858
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,420
and Director He will receive a demerit
and have his salary suspended.

859
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,160
Good.

860
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:18,280
Proceed with the factory rules.

861
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,160
Handle it seriously

862
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,360
without leniency.

863
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,600
Listen.

864
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,880
Secretary Hong was furious

865
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,520
over this incident.

866
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,830
Mr. Ding, I beg you.

867
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:34,680
Please don't fire me.

868
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:35,520
My mom will kill me.

869
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,520
I beg you.

870
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,360
Get up.

871
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,160
Li,

872
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:41,880
I want to help you,

873
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,600
but the situation has developed

874
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,560
to this point.

875
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,280
Someone must bear the consequences.

876
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,200
If I don't fire you, who should I fire?

877
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,200
- I beg...
- Get up.

878
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,680
Some consequences

879
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,400
are not yours to bear.

880
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,360
Even if Lu Dajiang
loses the skating rink,

881
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,880
he can still thrive.

882
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,280
But can you?

883
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,320
You can't, kid.

884
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:11,920
What about Xiaolu?

885
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,240
He's innocent in this matter.

886
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,400
As long as Lu Dajiang leaves the factory,

887
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,440
we'll call it even

888
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,920
and won't involve anyone else.

889
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,240
You can be assured of that.

890
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:23,680
Sit.

891
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,320
I'm telling you all this

892
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,960
for my niece's sake.

893
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:38,840
Do you understand?

894
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:52,960
So, it was Lu Dajiang
who told you to do this,

895
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:53,960
right?

896
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,080
If there are no other issues,

897
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,560
just sign here.

898
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,640
(Confession Letter: Instructed by Lu Dajiang,
I illicitly used expired and spoiled milk...)

899
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:31,160
(Informant: Li Guangnan)

900
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,080
Isn't this better?

901
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:45,880
Okay.

902
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,240
If there's nothing else,

903
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:50,600
you can go.

904
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:46,720
You...

905
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,200
What are you doing, meditating?

906
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,560
Didn't you already say goodbye?

907
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:53,780
Why are you still not leaving?

908
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,240
Where's the letter?

909
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:03,720
It irritated me,

910
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:04,680
so I burned it.

911
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,640
What right do you have
to burn my things?

912
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,040
Fine then.

913
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:09,960
I didn't burn it.

914
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,080
- So, where's the letter?
- Burned it.

915
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,910
- You just said you didn't burn it.
- Didn't burn it.

916
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,500
- Did you burn it or not?
- Didn't burn it.

917
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:15,520
Burned it or not? Burned it or not?

918
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,360
Niu Xiaoying!

919
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,880
Bai Lan!

920
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,040
You think you can outshout me?

921
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,600
Can you?

922
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:29,880
I can't.

923
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,000
Alright then.

924
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:35,920
How did the letter end up with you?

925
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:38,880
Who told you to put the letter
in Lu Xiaolu's meal box?

926
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,200
I prepare

927
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,960
his meals every day.

928
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:44,800
Let it be burned then.

929
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:46,520
Maybe it's better that way.

930
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,260
Do you really not want it anymore?

931
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,440
Didn't you say it was burned?

932
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,440
You...

933
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,480
Gets me mad.

934
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,840
(Golden Peacock)

935
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,480
Attention, all factory workers.

936
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,680
This food poisoning incident

937
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,640
has caused serious consequences

938
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:09,880
and negative impacts.

939
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,600
After deliberation
by the Factory Affairs Council,

940
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,480
it has been decided
to shut down the skating rink immediately

941
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,960
and revoke the business license

942
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,440
of Lu Dajiang's Skate Land.

943
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,720
This incident reminds us

944
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,920
that Golden Peacock,

945
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
as a leader in the city's food industry,

946
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,400
- always puts a priority
- Don't run.

947
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,120
on health and safety in our work.

948
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,480
Bai Lan,

949
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:40,880
where are you going?

950
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,640
I'm thinking of walking by the river.

951
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,360
I'm going to see my cousin.

952
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:46,320
Let's walk together.

953
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:47,680
Sure.

954
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,120
Do you ever think

955
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,160
that I'm a very selfish person?

956
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,600
Didn't I already answer

957
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,280
this question for you?

958
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,480
Then maybe you don't really
know me at all.

959
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,060
Didn't you say
we were like two peas in a pod?

960
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,560
Since we are so alike,

961
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,640
shouldn't I understand you
as well as I understand myself?

962
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,600
Xiaolu,

963
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:16,800
I have something to tell you.

964
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,520
What is it?

965
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,320
I actually got...

966
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,280
Bai Lan!

967
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:23,960
- Bai Lan!
- Tian?

968
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:27,880
I've finally found you.

969
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,280
Please

970
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,360
cover my shift tonight.

971
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:32,400
Shift?

972
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,160
Bi Zhigang just called,

973
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,400
saying we absolutely need someone

974
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,500
on duty at the infirmary tonight.

975
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:37,800
But today,

976
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:38,680
it's my wife's birthday

977
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,000
and she really wants me to a movie.

978
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:41,040
If I don't go,

979
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,240
she'll threaten to divorce me.

980
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:43,360
You...

981
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:44,560
Alright, don't worry.

982
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:45,400
I'll cover your shift.

983
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:46,800
Happy birthday to your loved one.

984
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:47,640
Thank you.

985
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,120
Oh no, it's going to rain.

986
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,640
- I better hurry.
- Okay.

987
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,320
- Stay safe.
- Sure thing.

988
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:03,780
What are you thinking about?

989
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,760
Bi Zhigang said someone
needs to stay at the infirmary.

990
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,280
Has this ever happened before?

991
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,560
Before?

992
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,560
I don't recall it ever happening.

993
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,640
Could he know something

994
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:20,550
is going to happen tonight?

995
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,120
Remind Dajiang.

996
00:51:24,570 --> 00:51:26,040
Ding Dezhong might seek revenge

997
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,080
for his son.

998
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:28,910
Oh no.

999
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:31,330
Ding Dezhong wouldn't go
after my cousin, would he?
