Thank you.

27
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:09,350
Earlier, I had a bad temper

28
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,440
and spoke too harshly.

29
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,260
Don't take it to heart.

30
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:15,810
It's okay.

31
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,960
You have your difficulties.

32
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,520
You've seen it all.

33
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,960
The issue with the cold storage
isn't just about me.

34
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,480
Li Guangnan just got married
to Little Pouter

35
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,280
and still owes a mortgage.

36
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,720
Xiaoying has been working tirelessly

37
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,160
to support Big Feet's dream.

38
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,560
Over these years,

39
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,920
we have experienced

40
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,720
hardship and obstacles together.

41
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,200
Even if I want to help you,

42
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,040
I can't ignore their feelings.

43
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,680
You all have been through a lot.

44
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,720
But who hasn't?

45
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,560
Yes,

46
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,560
I understand.

47
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,160
You have your life

48
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,040
and your job.

49
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,600
But these people in Fucheng

50
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,240
all used to be your friends.

51
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,080
I've long forgotten what happened

52
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,160
here in the past.

53
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,560

the characters
in "The Return of the Condor Hero".

64
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,000
Even after 16 years apart,

65
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,040
they could pick up where they left off.

66
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,120
Looks like those martial arts novels
are all fake.

67
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,360
She isn't the Dragon Lady,

68
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,600
you aren't Yang Guo.

69
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,400
And Shanghai

70
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,160
is definitely not the Valley of Woe.

71
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,360
Let me tell you,

72
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,960
a woman like her

73
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,080
is probably free and carefree

74
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,800
in that flashy world of Shanghai.

75
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,280
What are you to her?

76
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,440
Just a fleeting memory,

77
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,680
gone in an instant.

78
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,200
We even wanted to use
the past memories to persuade her.

79
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,400
We've failed before we even start.

80
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,520
Honey,

81
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,200
please help me talk to him.

82
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,720
The one who backed out back then

83
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,000
was not Bai Lan,

84
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,520
but you, Lu Xiaolu.

85
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,240
You came back to Fucheng.

86
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,840
You have family, a job,

87
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,840
and relatives.

88
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,040
What about Bai Lan?

89
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,640
She was alone in Shanghai.

90
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,320
She couldn't finish her master's degree.

91
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,480
She had no money, no house,

92
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,760
nothing.

93
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,840
What did you just say?

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,800
She couldn't finish

95
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,720
her master's degree?

96
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,960
What do you mean?

97
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,920
See for yourself.

98
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,760
Over these five years,

99
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,120
we've been in contact.

100
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,640
Although she never

101
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,960
complained in her letters,

102
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,240
I can feel that

103
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,080
she's had it tough.

104
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,720
You two have been exchanging letters?

105
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,760
Why don't I know that?

106
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,960
(Bai Lan)

107
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,280
In 1997,

108
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,120
she was expelled from school,

109
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,480
had nowhere to live,

110
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,960
and even slept in the company's
storage room.

111
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,120
In 1998,

112
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,760
she became a regular employee,

113
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,240
was promoted several times
in three months,

114
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,080
but because of her busy work

115
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,960
and determination,

116
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,400
she got gastritis.

117
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,160
In 1999,

118
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,840
she went to Europe alone

119
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,680
and successfully signed

120
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,760
the first contract
between British clients and China.

121
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,360
In 2001,

122
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,560
she happened to be in Beijing

123
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,350
when the Olympics were successfully bid.

124
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,400
There was a live broadcast,

125
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
and she said she was especially happy

126
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,840
standing at Tian'anmen Square

127
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,400
with over 400,000 people
watching the flag-raising.

128
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,040
Lu Xiaolu,

129
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,720
during her most difficult times,

130
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,640
you weren't by her side.

131
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,880
Now,

132
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,920
her career is her armor.

133
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,200
What right do you have

134
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,120
to think she would compromise for you?

135
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,280
Don't worry, no one followed us.

136
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,720
Master Niu,

137
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,600
everyone from the workshops is here,

138
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,640
waiting for your command.

139
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,640
I heard yesterday
that the Security Department

140
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,960
clashed with Xiaolu's group.

141
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,840
It seems Bai Lan isn't even

142
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,240
considering Lu Xiaolu's feelings.

143
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,040
You don't understand.

144
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,880
When former lovers meet,

145
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,440
it's even more contentious
than meeting enemies.

146
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,240
I never thought Bai Lan

147
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,080
was easy to deal with back then.

148
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,960
Now that even Lu Xiaolu isn't
accommodating her,

149
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,200
why should we care about her?

150
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,160
In my opinion,

151
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,400
we should just kick her out of the factory.

152
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,840
With so many of us,

153
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,040
what's there to fear from her alone?

154
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,880
Am I right?

155
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,720
Exactly!

156
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,280
Guys! Guys!

157
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,920
Guys!

158
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,520
We are workers,

159
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,080
not thugs.

160
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,480
Besides, she's a woman.

161
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,080
Master Niu,

162
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,800
don't just see her as an ordinary woman.

163
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,240
She acts like she's tougher than ten men.

164
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,160
If we don't show her some backbone now,

165
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,480
who knows who she'll target next?

166
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,120
The older you get,

167
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,960
the more...

168
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,200
Not being thugs

169
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,160
doesn't mean we're timid.

170
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,120
Master,

171
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,400
what's your plan now?

172
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,320
Everyone,

173
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,760
do you know how

174
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,840
the Soviet Union disintegrated?

175
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,920
Yes, we do.

176
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,480
To achieve victory in our struggle,

177
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,000
we don't necessarily

178
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,120
need weapons.

179
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,000
So are you saying

180
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,680
we should refuse to work

181
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,160
until we get paid?

182
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,120
♪We always on time♪

183
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,200
As long as we're united,

184
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,240
I don't believe we can't outlast her.

185
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,920
Master is right.
I think this plan will work.

186
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,320
That's how we will do it.

187
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,960
Alright,
let's conclude today's meeting here.

188
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,560
Everyone, go home.
Let's not bring this up again,

189
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,440
especially you, Dakang.

190
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,160
Let it go, okay?

191
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,720
Let's go.

192
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,000
Let's go.

193
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,600
When will this end?

194
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,360
What are you thinking?

195
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,320
Haven't you heard?

196
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,400
The factory is going to implement

197
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,000
layoffs and reassignments.

198
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,720
This means they'll lay off
all of us who haven't performed well.

199
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,320
Where did you hear this?

200
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,120
Don't scare yourself.

201
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,480
How am I scaring myself?

202
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,320
This is being prepared for the future.

203
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,640
If you don't prepare now

204
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,000
and Bai Lan puts

205
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,600
your name on the layoff list,

206
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,760
you'll regret it.

207
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,640
What are you planning to do then?

208
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,760
Master Niu is a gentleman.

209
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,800
I'm not.

210
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,880
Hey, Dakang!

211
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,240
Dakang!

212
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,120
(What about Bai Lan?)

213
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,720
(She was alone in Shanghai.)

214
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,440
(She couldn't finish her master's degree.)

215
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,000
(She had no money, no house,)

216
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,400
(nothing.)

217
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,680
(The one who backed out back then)

218
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,920
(was not Bai Lan,)

219
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,320
(but you, Lu Xiaolu.)

220
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,920
(You came back to Fucheng.)

221
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,320
(You have family, a job,)

222
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,320
(and relatives.)

223
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,680
(What about Bai Lan?)

224
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,280
You all have been through a lot.

225
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,040
But who hasn't?

226
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,080
- Bai Lan!
- Xiaolu!

227
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,240
Xiaolu!

228
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,760
Bai Lan, are you okay?

229
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,600
I'm fine.

230
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,040
- Are you hurt?
- No.

231
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,280
I slipped

232
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,000
and broke the light cord.

233
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,480
(Gongyuan)

234
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,040
You couldn't tell who he is?

235
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,120
I really didn't see clearly.

236
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,760
When I went in,

237
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,280
I saw blood all over the walls,

238
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,160
which startled me,

239
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,120
so I slipped

240
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,240
and broke the light cord.

241
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,520
Okay.

242
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,360
Did you see anything?

243
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,640
I vaguely saw a blurry figure,

244
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,040
quite tall.

245
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,000
This is really terrible.

246
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,000
Wu. I've been in this factory for decades

247
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,520
and nothing like this has ever happened.

248
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,120
Don't worry, though.

249
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,800
We have surveillance cameras
in the factory.

250
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,950
We'll definitely be able
to identify this person.

251
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,160
- You have surveillance?
- Yes.

252
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,640
Then it's simple.

253
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,080
Let's go check the surveillance footage.

254
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,920
Yeah, let's go.

255
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,960
There's no need to look.

256
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,680
The one who threw pig's blood

257
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,760
- is me.
- Hey, Master Niu!

258
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,720
Don't joke around.

259
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,760
Master,

260
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,960
it couldn't be you.

261
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,000
Why couldn't it be?

262
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,640
Yesterday, at the cold storage,

263
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,640
my daughter

264
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,680
was surrounded and pushed

265
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,120
because of her.

266
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,840
You know,

267
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,560
as a father,

268
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,520
watching your daughter being bullied,

269
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,960
what would I do?

270
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,680
Since that's the case,

271
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,560
Master Niu,

272
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,840
come back to the police station with me.

273
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,040
Sure, let's go.

274
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,400
- No, no, no.
- Uncle Wu.

275
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,240
Wait a moment.

276
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,840
Officer,

277
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,120
I withdraw the report.

278
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,320
You...

279
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,440
This is an internal issue
within our own factory.

280
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,760
We'll handle it ourselves.

281
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,080
Yes, that's right.

282
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,480
Have you thought this through?

283
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,800
If you withdraw your report,

284
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,800
more serious incidents may occur
in the future.

285
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,240
I've thought it through.

286
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,040
Thank you for your trouble.

287
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,520
Alright.

288
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,160
Let's go.

289
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,800
Wu, thank you for your hard work.

290
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,320
Master Niu,

291
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,480
I trust you.

292
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,000
You're an upright person

293
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,120
and wouldn't do something like this.

294
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,480
I understand you want to protect someone,

295
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,840
but please believe me,

296
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,120
I don't want to hurt them.

297
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,200
Stop!

298
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,480
Come here.

299
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,360
Come here.

300
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,960
What...

301
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,760
What were you doing?

302
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,600
I...

303
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,040
Did you commit murder or slaughter a pig?

304
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,120
You won't talk, huh?

305
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,360
Fine, I'll have

306
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,720
Officer Wu come and question you.

307
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,560
Hey, Master Niu.

308
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,440
I just wanted to teach Bai Lan a lesson.

309
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,560
A lesson?

310
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,600
Do you know

311
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,840
what time it is now?

312
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,440
If you make even the slightest mistake,

313
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,640
you'll be the first one

314
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,280
they come after.

315
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,400
Do you understand?

316
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,720
Hurry up, find a place where no one is

317
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,560
and clean up this blood.

318
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,720
- Alright, alright.
- Quickly.

319
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,680
Thank you, Master Niu.

320
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,920
Nobody wants to be a villain,

321
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,840
but someone always ends up getting hurt.

322
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,160
I'll take you to a safe place.

323
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,720
Although we're not friends right now,

324
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,740
I still don't want anything bad
to happen to you.

325
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,360
Tomorrow,

326
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,080
we can continue being enemies.

327
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,120
You are still living here

328
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,440
after so many years?

329
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,120
I've gotten used to it

330
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,720
and can't be bothered to move.

331
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,800
I'll tidy up the room for you.

332
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,040
You can stay here tonight
with peace of mind.

333
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,000
In the whole Fucheng,

334
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,480
no one dares to harm you.

335
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,600
Thank you.

336
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,280
Dajiang.

337
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,920
You're back.

338
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,400
You're back, too.

339
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,360
It's different.

340
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,360
You've returned in glory,

341
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,800
while I...

342
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,840
I'm not who I was already.

343
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,480
I hope you don't hold a grudge against me

344
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,720
for handing you over to the police.

345
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,560
What are you saying?

346
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,080
I should thank you.

347
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,520
If it weren't for your words back then,

348
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,800
I might not have

349
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,080
understood many things.

350
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,840
Besides,

351
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,240
how could I hate

352
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,600
my cousin's woman?

353
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,720
Alright, enough talking.

354
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,760
This place is all yours.

355
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,880
Dajiang,

356
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:05,920
where are you going?

357
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,720
The neighborhood committee
arranged a job for me.

358
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,240
I'm leaving.

359
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,480
(First Love)

360
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,800
You've kept these things all this time.

361
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,320
I thought you would have
thrown them away.

362
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,480
I don't like throwing things away.

363
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,400
But some things aren't important anymore

364
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,240
and can be discarded.

365
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,040
But what if the memories are too deep

366
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,880
to forget?

367
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,560
Then it becomes a burden for yourself

368
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,560
and others.

369
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,960
I'm sorry.

370
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,200
Sorry for what?

371
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,840
It's only today that I learned about

372
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,880
you being expelled
from school in Shanghai.

373
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,760
It wasn't a big deal.

374
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,640
And it's long past.

375
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:53,920
After that,

376
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,800
did you live the life you wanted?

377
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,120
Have you become the person
you wanted to be?

378
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,840
I don't know.

379
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,840
Over these years,

380
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,200
all I've known is that I have to

381
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,600
keep running forward,

382
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,240
but it seems I don't know
where the finish line is.

383
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,360
It wasn't until today when I came to
your office looking for you,

384
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,400
almost thinking I'd never see you again,

385
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,600
that I realized

386
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,440
my finish line isn't in the future

387
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,360
but in the past.

388
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,360
If I could go back to a certain time
in the past...

389
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,680
If I could have

390
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,560
made a different choice back then...

391
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,240
Hello?

392
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,640
I knew you hadn't rested yet.

393
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,760
Must be tough, huh?

394
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,360
I was just about to rest.

395
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,960
Is everything going smoothly?

396
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:31,920
Still working on it.

397
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,280
OK.

398
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:37,560
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

399
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,520
You've still got me.

400
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,680
Tomorrow, I'll personally
make a trip to Fucheng.

401
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,280
Do you doubt that I can handle it myself?

402
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,120
No,

403
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,480
I just want to see for myself

404
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,160
this beautiful city you speak of.

405
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,320
Why? You don't want me there?

406
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,520
As soon as the negotiations were over,

407
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,360
I booked the earliest flight for tomorrow.

408
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,160
Alright,

409
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,960
I'll go pick you up at the airport.

410
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:07,920
Your boyfriend?

411
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,040
Get some rest.

412
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,240
Tomorrow morning,

413
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,960
I'll take you to the best hotel in Fucheng.

414
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,920
Lu Xiaolu,

415
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,480
even if we could go back to the past,

416
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,000
you wouldn't have had a second choice.

417
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,000
The choice you made was the only one.

418
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,680
Get some rest.

419
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,280
Are you going to
give me the money or not?

420
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,200
I told you, all the money
was gambled away by you.

421
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,560
- No more left.
- Stop talking nonsense

422
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,400
and give me the money.

423
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,160
What do you want?
Are you trying to rob me?

424
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,780
- Are you giving it to me or not?
- I told you there's none.

425
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,160
- Give it to me.
- I told you...

426
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,520
- Let go!
- You...

427
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,360
Let go.

428
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,200
Speak nicely.

429
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,040
Don't hit a woman.

430
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,120
I'm teaching my woman a lesson.

431
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,120
What's it to you?

432
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,400
What's it to you?

433
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,360
Mind your own business.

434
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,720
Look at your stupid face!

435
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:44,960
I'm sorry.

436
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,200
I shouldn't have intervened.

437
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,360
You are sorry?

438
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,200
Now you are sorry?

439
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,960
You're not so tough now, huh?

440
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,680
Get off me.

441
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,360
- Enough.
- Stupid dustman.

442
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,740
- That's enough.
- You'll be a dustman forever.

443
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,840
- How stupid.
- Enough, let's go.

444
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,360
Give me the money.

445
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,000
I don't have any left.

446
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,920
How could you have none left?

447
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,800
Go apologize to the cleaner.

448
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,480
Who do you think you are

449
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,320
to ask me to apologize?

450
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,800
Go and apologize,

451
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,120
and you'll get this money.

452
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,440
Will you do it or not?

453
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,720
Alright,

454
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,680
I'll go now.

455
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,160
Wait a moment.

456
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,320
Give this to him.

457
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,760
Well,

458
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,320
dude.

459
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,080
I was wrong just now.

460
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,480
I apologize to you.

461
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

462
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,600
I see your hands are bleeding.

463
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,640
Use this

464
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,720
to wrap it.

465
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,440
Sorry, dude.

466
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,360
Hurry up.

467
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,880
Ms. Tao,

468
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,280
do you know that person?

469
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,360
An old friend.

470
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,960
Old friend?

471
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,400
Do you want to go say hello?

472
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,000
Forget it.

473
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,960
When he wants to see me,

474
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,040
he'll come.

475
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,760
When I was in Hong Kong,

476
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,240
a client gave this to me.

477
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,200
Take this as a reward
for the task in Fucheng.

478
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,880
But Mr. Huang,

479
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,840
you're mistaken.

480
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,920
I'm doing this task for myself.

481
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,800
Since it's for myself,

482
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,760
why do I need a reward?

483
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,600
Lyu,

484
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,200
take this watch.

485
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,160
When you have a girlfriend in the future,

486
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,040
you can give it to her.

487
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,240
Oh, and

488
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,400
I've already arranged your accommodation

489
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,000
at the best hotel in Fucheng.

490
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,360
Tonight,

491
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,320
I have dinner plans
with an important figure in Fucheng.

492
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,760
Arrange it at this hotel for me.

493
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,800
Okay.

494
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,720
I don't have appetite.

495
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,120
Xiaoying,

496
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,280
bring me the liquor.

497
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,640
You can't drink again!

498
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,120
Did you recover
from last night's drinking?

499
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:23,960
And you want more?

500
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,320
My heart is troubled

501
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,600
until the matters in the factory

502
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,440
are resolved.

503
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,360
You're at such an age,

504
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,240
why are you so temperamental?

505
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,480
What about you?

506
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,120
You're out there every day

507
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,120
fighting and causing trouble.

508
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:42,920
Dad,

509
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,760
you'll retire next year.

510
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,840
Why not enjoy some peace and quiet?

511
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,320
I fight and cause trouble

512
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,960
to protect our business

513
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,800
and earn a bit more money

514
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,760
for your retirement.

515
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,960
Huh, bah!

516
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,480
Don't think I don't know that

517
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,840
you send

518
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,680
most of the money

519
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,200
to Big Feet.

520
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,760
I'm investing in love.

521
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,120
If Big Feet succeeds in the future,

522
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,320
who will be proud?

523
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,360
It's you, the master.

524
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,200
Who will benefit from it?

525
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,360
It's you, the father-in-law.

526
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,480
Oh, come on.

527
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,720
You are hardly a couple,

528
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,160
and now I'm his father-in-law already?

529
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,240
As a young girl,

530
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,000
aren't you embarrassed?

531
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,840
I learned it from you,

532
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,680
cheeky Master Niu.

533
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,840
Let me tell you,
I don't approve of you two.

534
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,720
Big Feet is my apprentice.

535
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,600
I know him well.

536
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,760
People say

537
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,080
you can see a person's future

538
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,280
when he's at seven.

539
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,200
He used

540
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,880
to be worthless,

541
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,440
and growing up won't change that.

542
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,400
What are you saying?

543
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,720
How can you say that?

544
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,680
He's successful now.

545
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,840
Just the other day, he told me

546
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,080
he wrote a new song,

547
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,560
and several big bosses

548
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,800
are fighting to sign him.

549
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,800
You're just bragging,

550
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,880
you know.

551
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,080
You never understand.

552
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:20,920
Who is it?

553
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,600
- Did you invite someone?
- No.

554
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,800
Xiaoying,

555
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,000
I'm back.

556
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,880
How... You...

557
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,280
Dad,

558
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,200
guess who's back.

559
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,440
Master.

560
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,920
I thought you'd never come back.

561
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,840
I almost didn't recognize you

562
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,080
after all these years.

563
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,360
What's with this long hair,

564
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,120
you look like a woman now.

565
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,920
Artists are all like this.

566
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,040
So cool!

567
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,000
Stand there,

568
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,880
and look at what you're wearing.

569
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,280
With those big and small holes,

570
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,200
they'd think
you're begging on the streets.

571
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,400
Rock'n'roll

572
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,840
is all about attitude.

573
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,480
And look at this outfit.

574
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,240
You are dressed like a street thug.

575
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,520
Singer is a proper profession,

576
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,440
destined to become a big star.

577
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,760
You mean singing

578
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,040
can fill up your wallet?

579
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,520
So is it fair

580
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,200
for those hard-working laborers?

581
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,760
You won't understand anyway.

582
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,120
Master,

583
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,480
I brought some specialties
from Beijing for you.

584
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,800
Roast duck,

585
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:50,960
dried fruits.

586
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,080
Look.

587
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,840
And herbal jelly.

588
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,720
Have you ever tried it?

589
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,280
You've lived for so long,

590
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,050
but have you ever been to Beijing?

591
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,840
He brought you Beijing roast duck.

592
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,760
I've tried it before.

593
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,480
When Debao went to Beijing years ago,

594
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,720
he also brought back roast duck.

595
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,600
You also ate it.

596
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,560
Besides,

597
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,720
are you out of your mind

598
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,160
or what?

599
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,240
We work in a food factory,

600
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,160
and you bring dried fruits from Beijing?

601
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,800
These are from Beijing.

602
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,120
I'll eat them if you won't.

603
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,840
I...

604
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,960
Master, you're right.

605
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,840
I've been...

606
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,120
You don't need to be afraid of him.

607
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,120
The older he gets,
the more sour his temper gets.

608
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,880
Go tidy up,

609
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,400
I'll call Xiaolu and the others,

610
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,400
and we'll have a feast tonight

611
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,240
to welcome you back.

612
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,800
Let me take this.

613
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,560
Master, I'll go tidy up then.

614
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,840
Why are you staring at me?

615
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,600
Before,

616
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,240
why didn't I notice

617
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,120
you are so handsome?

618
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,040
- Alright, enough.
- Stop staring, Xiaoying.

619
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,760
You look like you are gonna eat me.

620
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,560
When they come in later,
it'll be embarrassing.

621
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,320
I'm staring.

622
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,360
I'll eat you up when we get back.

623
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,520
Chen Guowei!

624
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,760
They are here.

625
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,320
Guangnan!

626
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,760
What's wrong with you?

627
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,600
You went to Beijing
and never returned in years.

628
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,760
I thought you forgot us
after becoming a big star.

629
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,120
- Not at all.
- He wouldn't dare.

630
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,920
He came to see you
right after he came back.

631
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,320
And he brought you gifts.

632
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,320
That's not necessary.

633
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,560
Take it. Come on.

634
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:08,960
Alright.

635
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,360
Welcome home.

636
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,040
Xiaolu.

637
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,480
- Ms. Tao.
- Ms. Tao.

638
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,560
Is this room satisfactory?

639
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,830
I've reserved the largest one for you.

640
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,040
- Yes.
- Of course.

641
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,080
Ms. Tao.

642
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,880
Big Feet, you've seen him before.

643
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,560
He is now a big star.

644
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,840
- A big star?
- Not at all.

645
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,760
Not bad.

646
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,000
In the future,
if you have a concert in Fucheng,

647
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,240
I will arrange it for you.

648
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,680
Great! Come on, say thank you.

649
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,360
Alright, enjoy your time.

650
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,800
- I'll leave first.
- Okay, sure.

651
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,240
- Have fun!
- Thank you, Ms. Tao.

652
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:41,960
In the next few days,

653
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,560
I'll introduce you to some people.

654
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,840
This is my first time in Fucheng.

655
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,240
Come in.

656
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,360
Sorry for being late.

657
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,720
Let me introduce.

658
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,960
She is the project manager of our company

659
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,800
and also in charge of

660
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,000
this Fucheng Food Factory project.

661
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:02,760
Her name is Bai Lan.

662
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,240
Manager Bai,

663
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,200
nice to meet you.

664
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,000
Mr. Huang,

665
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,480
you may not know,

666
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,320
but when I was in the SLI Bureau,

667
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,240
I worked with Miss Bai.

668
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,760
She was my subordinate.

669
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:23,920
Back then,

670
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,760
I had high hopes for her.

671
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:28,960
Is that so?

672
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,480
I never expected that.

673
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,800
Without Vice Mayor Bi,

674
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,120
I'm afraid I wouldn't be
where I am today.

675
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,920
Well, if that's the case,

676
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,080
Miss Bai,

677
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,680
you must

678
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,760
toast me a drink.

679
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,600
Come in.

680
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,280
- Mayor Bi.
- Hello, Ms. Tao.

681
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,080
Here, these are a gift for your friends.

682
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,760
- Great.
- Would you like to join us?

683
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,240
You have important matters to discuss,

684
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,240
and I don't want to disturb you.

685
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,400
When you're free,

686
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,520
I'll invite you to the bar upstairs

687
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,160
for a drink.

688
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,320
Sure.

689
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:20,920
Enjoy yourselves.

690
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:21,880
Okay.

691
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,160
Miss Bai doesn't handle alcohol well.

692
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,840
Let me drink for her.

693
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,120
Mr. Huang,

694
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,760
everything is destined.

695
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,880
For example,

696
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,160
the connection between

697
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,920
your company and the food factory,

698
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,640
and my connection

699
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,720
with Miss Bai.

700
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,480
These are irreplaceable.

701
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,240
Am I right, Miss Bai?

702
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,640
Vice Mayor Bi is right.

703
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,360
With our connection,

704
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,000
we definitely need to drink.

705
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,760
But one drink cup is not enough.

706
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,800
If we're drinking,

707
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,840
let's have a bottle each.

708
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,000
If we don't finish it tonight,

709
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,840
no one leaves.

710
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,080
What do you think?

711
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,840
Okay.

712
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,320
Are you alright?

713
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,640
Why are you here too?

714
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,680
These past few years,

715
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,720
many have been

716
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,960
eyeing the food factory.

717
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,360
There was a local tycoon before

718
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,880
and foreign capital after,

719
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,360
but

720
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,440
nothing came of it.

721
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,920
So, Mr. Huang,

722
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,400
be prepared for fruitless efforts.

723
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,960
I never do anything without certainty.

724
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,240
I always have a backup plan

725
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,040
to avoid coming back empty-handed.

726
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,320
Good.

727
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,480
It looks like

728
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,320
you've already prepared a backup plan.

729
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,720
I'm sure you understand the situation

730
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,080
of the food factory better than me.

731
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,840
I'll take your advice.

732
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,560
This food factory

733
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,360
is indeed

734
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,920
a fat piece of meat.

735
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,080
Everyone wants it.

736
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,040
But

737
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,720
have you ever thought that...

738
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,280
The bones are the most valuable part.

739
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,280
Actually,
I've thought about it before coming.

740
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,720
The production cycle is long,

741
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,680
and the profit margin is thin,

742
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,360
not worth it.

743
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,320
With such a prime location,

744
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,480
the food factory could be maximized

745
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,760
by developing real estate.

746
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,240
Very clever.

747
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,360
But

748
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,880
I must remind you,

749
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,520
some leaders in the city committee

750
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,360
have strong sentiments towards

751
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,640
Golden Peacock Food Factory.

752
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,440
They can't bear to see it collapse.

753
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,240
But the most difficult part

754
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,560
is dealing with the factory workers.

755
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,240
If you

756
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,560
really want this piece of land,

757
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,520
first,

758
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,120
you should deal with

759
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,680
the resistance from the workers.

760
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,360
Understand.

761
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,280
Come in.

762
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,920
- This is...
- Let me introduce.

763
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,400
This is Mr. Huang.

764
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,160
Hello, Mr. Huang.

765
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,760
- You're from Guangdong?
- Yes, I am.

766
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,040
This is Mr. Hu

767
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,080
of Lide Construction Company.

768
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,800
People call him Boss Hu.

769
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,480
Mr. Huang, if you ever encounter

770
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,200
any problems you can't solve,

771
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,000
Boss Hu will help you handle them.

772
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,360
I don't have any special skills,

773
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,560
but over these years in Fucheng,

774
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,240
I've gained some abilities

775
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,280
to handle some small matters.

776
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,360
Come on.

777
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,320
Mr. Huang,

778
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,800
a toast to you.

779
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,280
Call me if you need me for anything.

780
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,760
Thank you.

781
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,280
You have important matters to discuss,

782
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,680
I won't disturb you.

783
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,520
Sure.

784
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,160
You can go.

785
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,840
Where is Miss Bai?

786
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,360
I'll go check on her.

787
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,520
Big Feet is back

788
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,950
and we are having dinner together.

789
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,880
Do you want to join us?

790
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,680
I have a business dinner.

791
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,760
Please send my regards to him.

792
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,400
Since it's about work,

793
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,840
why must you drink so much?

794
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,160
What do you think

795
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,160
my work was like over these past years?

796
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,680
I've seen all kinds of difficult situations.

797
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,320
This is nothing at all.

798
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,640
What took you so long?

799
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,560
Are you alright?

800
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,360
I'm fine.

801
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,440
This is...

802
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,240
He's a friend of mine from Fucheng.

803
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,760
Nice to meet you.

804
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,760
Nice to meet you too.

805
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,640
Let's go.

806
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,520
Xiaoying,

807
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,360
you've invested in a promising stock.

808
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,560
Things will be good in the future.

809
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,400
Speaking of which,

810
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,760
Big Feet, you're really something.

811
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,760
When you went to Beijing alone back then,

812
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,120
it's the bravest

813
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,640
and wisest decision

814
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,080
I've seen you make so far.

815
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,280
Look at our factory now.

816
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,720
Many people
can't even receive their wages.

817
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,000
I regret not going to Beijing with you.

818
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,720
Oh, yes, I heard

819
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,200
he's really famous in Beijing.

820
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,360
The big bosses who want to sign him

821
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,400
are lining up from Tian'anmen Square
to the Great Wall.

822
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,240
- Is that true?
- No.

823
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,760
No, it's not.

824
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,500
You know,

825
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:21,600
it takes a day and a night to walk

826
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,880
from Tian'anmen Square to the Great Wall.

827
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,160
Besides, I just sing

828
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,320
in a bar street,

829
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,040
and there are hardly
any audience members.

830
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,360
It would take more than a day and a night?

831
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,800
- Beijing is so big?
- It's quite big.

832
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,960
I haven't been there yet.

833
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,480
Hey, how about this?

834
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,200
When we go on our honeymoon,

835
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,040
let's go to Beijing.

836
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,440
You always say that,

837
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,720
but you never have time.

838
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,560
You keep delaying.

839
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:43,150
- I don't believe your nonsense.
- I'll wait for you.

840
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,360
Oh, it's because of work.

841
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,200
Chen Guowei,

842
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,000
didn't you write a song for me?

843
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,160
When will you sing it for me?

844
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,640
- I...
- Don't forget about us.

845
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,200
Write a song for us too.

846
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,840
We are not greedy.

847
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,800
We just want one.

848
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,800
No problem.

849
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,000
Then Xiaolu's song should be...

850
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,320
What can he get?

851
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,240
"A Song for a Single Man"?

852
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:03,880
Of course not.

853
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,800
His song should be

854
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,680
"When Love Becomes the Past".

855
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,400
You're really mean.

856
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,080
Xiaolu, come on, cheers.

857
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,720
Cheers, come on.

858
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,760
