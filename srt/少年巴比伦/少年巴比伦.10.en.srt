- Let's go. Hurry.
- Let's get out of here.

Impressive, Lu Dajiang.

54
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,590
Even with a limp, you run so fast.

55
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,740
You're killing me.

56
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,030
Keep it up, huh?

57
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,150
Keep clashing with the factory.

58
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,300
I'm telling you.

59
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,510
You've killed a man.

60
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,860
You're done for!

61
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,420
I've been a hero all my life.

62
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,950
Never thought I'd die at the hands
of a bug like you.

63
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,740
Bug?

64
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,070
You sent my son
to the mental institution.

65
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,070
Do you think
I'd let you get away with it?

66
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:05,830
Keep running.

67
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:19,650
How is it?

68
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,630
Did he break a bone?

69
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,420
It doesn't look good.

70
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,890
He needs to go to the hospital right now.

71
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,860
No way.

72
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,150
Going to the hospital now

73
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,390
would be walking into a trap.

74
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,730
But he's bleeding too much.

75
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,180
He needs to take care of it right away.

76
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,300
I'm fine. I won't die.

77
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:34,940
Stay here.

78
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,470
I'll go to the infirmary.

79
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,750
- What for?
- I'm getting medical supplies.

80
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,780
Tell me what you need.

81
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,220
Can't you be rational?

82
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,540
I can't watch my cousin go to jail.

83
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:43,530
Wait for me.

84
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,010
Lu Xiaolu!

85
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:46,150
Wait for me to come back!

(Gongyuan)

87
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,030
Sooner or later, you'll get caught.

88
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:33,010
You'll end up in jail.

89
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,610
You might as well turn yourself in now.

90
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:35,650
You might get a lighter sentence.

91
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,050
If it were you, what would you choose?

92
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,930
I would never be as stupid as you

93
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:43,990
and end up like this.

94
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,980
Even if I had to die in the wilderness,

95
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,820
I wouldn't go to jail.

96
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,860
At worst, I'll go to Hong Kong

97
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,220
and never come back.

98
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,380
What about Xiaolu?

99
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:55,650
What will happen to him?

100
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,250
That's between me and him.

101
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,090
It's none of your business.

102
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,910
Xiaolu's business is my business.

103
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,470
He's so young, so talented.

104
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,150
He has a bright future.
I can't let you ruin him.

105
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:12,890
Dajiang!

106
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,030
I'm back, Dajiang.

107

- Let's go.
- Wu.

111
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:37,690
- Thank you.
- That's it.

112
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,030
I'll keep you posted if anything happens.

113
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:39,700
- Wu.
- Okay.

114
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,860
I heard you've been
looking for me everywhere.

115
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:45,890
Lu Dajiang.

116
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,620
No need to bother.

117
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:48,700
I've come myself.

Xiaolu,

120
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,330
don't be sad.

121
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,550
If something really happens to Dajiang,

122
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,460
we'll seek justice together.

123
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,030
What justice is there to speak of?

124
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,330
Wait a minute.

125
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:02,850
Well,

126
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,180
I have a letter for you.

127
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,990
I thought about it for a long time,
and I shouldn't keep it from you.

128
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,910
Here, take it.

129
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:14,940
It's not my fault.

130
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,150
Bai Lan didn't want it.

131
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,350
Dear Xiaolu,

132
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,210
I'm sorry.

133
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:36,990
This is the most important

134
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,940
and the hardest decision

135
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,950
of my life so far.

136
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,560
But in your eyes,

137
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,200
it might seem the most selfish one.

138
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,560
I've been lucky to meet you

139
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,680
during my days in Fucheng.

140
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,800
Thank you for everything
you've brought to me.

141
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,440
You've lit up my dreams.

142
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,520
Everyone dreams.

143
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,680
What's in your dream?

144
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,920
Do I appear in it?

145
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,080
Of course,

146
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,960
you are

147
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,320
in my dreams too.

148
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,400
But there's a slight difference.

149
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,200
In my dream,

150
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,720
we're not under the chimneys
of the food factory,

151
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,840
but by the Huangpu River.

152
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,240
Fucheng is your hometown.

153
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,320
You love this place.

154
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,680
You're attached to it.

155
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,160
I'm even a bit jealous

156
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,920
that you have a place to miss

157
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,680
and long for.

158
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,360
But I haven't found

159
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,560
such a place worth staying for myself.

160
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,040
So, I must keep moving.

161
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,600
I didn't come to Fucheng for you.

162
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,840
I came here to leave.

163
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,680
That was my plan

164
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,080
from the day I arrived.

165
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,680
Please forgive me

166
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,080
for not being able to change my dream

167
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,520
and my steadfast path for you.

168
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,560
Xiaolu,

169
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,080
are you alright?

170
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,880
Don't be like this.

171
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,520
I know it's hard for you.

172
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,400
What exactly happened that night?

173
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,080
How did my cousin get taken away?

174
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,120
I'm sorry.

175
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,960
Why couldn't you
wait for me to come back?

176
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,050
You went to work as a translator
at the Second Light Industry Bureau

177
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,200
just to get a sponsored position, right?

178
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,920
You've always wanted to leave Fucheng,

179
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,160
but you kept it from me.

180
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,720
I wish you all the best

181
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,560
and a bright future.

182
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,840
Xiaolu,

183
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,040
pass me the file.

184
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,600
Master,

185
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,000
you forgot

186
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,580
that Xiaolu hasn't been here
for several days.

187
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,200
Mr. Ding,

188
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,480
what brings you here?

189
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,160
Where's Lu Xiaolu?

190
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,200
Ding,

191
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,920
your head is wounded,

192
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,150
yet you're still looking for trouble.

193
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,240
Lu Xiaolu and his cousin gathered a crowd

194
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,640
to beat people.

195
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,000
If I see him,

196
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,560
I'll kick him out right away.

197
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,840
Don't scare me.

198
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,840
Whether my apprentice stays or goes
is up to me.

199
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,840
What you said

200
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,160
is just nonsense.

201
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,240
What are you doing?

202
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,400
A bunch of savages.

203
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,600
I won't stoop to your level.

204
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,680
You...

205
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,530
Master, this...

206
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,000
Look at him.

207
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,480
Master,

208
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,360
Dajiang is so capable,

209
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,960
yet he ended up in prison.

210
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,480
Xiaolu must be really upset.

211
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,840
Get to work.

212
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,960
You're finally back.

213
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,050
Uncle's situation is troublesome.

214
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,360
Right, Juan.

215
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,360
Do me a favor.

216
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,840
Give this to Xiaolu for me.

217
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,080
You're asking for my help?

218
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,880
What is it?

219
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,600
A joke book?

220
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,320
After Lu Dajiang's incident,

221
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,760
Xiaolu has been feeling quite down.

222
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,200
I was thinking about
how to cheer him up.

223
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,400
No, I...

224
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,280
I never thought

225
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,720
you'd do something so childish.

226
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,640
Childish?

227
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,840
I think it's pretty good.

228
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,240
Very childish.

229
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,520
Why don't you give it to him yourself?

230
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,960
I don't want to see him.

231
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,200
And I wouldn't know what to say if I did.

232
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,200
Alright then.

233
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,600
By the way,

234
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,680
can you cook?

235
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,480
A little.

236
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,480
Then teach me how to cook.

237
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,560
Sure.

238
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,760
What do you want to learn?

239
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:13,920
Fishball soup.

240
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,640
Fishball soup?

241
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,800
And

242
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,800
something with beef.

243
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,760
There's a lot of seafood here.

244
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,800
So what should we make?

245
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,000
How about clam soup?

246
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,840
It moistens and cools.

247
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,920
These are razor clams, not clams.

248
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,160
Alright, let's go.

249
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,600
Thank you for agreeing to teach me.

250
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,760
This one isn't sweet.

251
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,200
This kind is sweet.

252
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,240
You don't have to thank me.

253
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,320
My uncle and aunt

254
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,200
treated you badly before

255
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,760
and even sent you down
to the boiler room.

256
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,720
You should hate me.

257
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,280
That way, I'd feel more at ease.

258
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,480
Didn't you hate me before too?

259
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,000
We're even now.

260
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,000
I disliked you before

261
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,720
because I liked Lu Xiaolu.

262
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,400
So, you don't like him now?

263
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,880
I just think he's actually
not that handsome.

264
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,080
He's childish and self-centered,

265
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,720
and he always does

266
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,120
weird things.

267
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,000
That's annoying.

268
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,040
I think there must be someone else

269
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,960
in this world worth liking.

270
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,560
Someone else?

271
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,160
Like Li Guangnan?

272
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,240
I didn't say him.

273
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,560
Actually, Xiaolu's mom

274
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,160
and Xiaoying are both pretty good cooks.

275
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,480
Why don't you ask them for help?

276
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,800
I just want to make something
for him myself.

277
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,000
Ah, of course.

278
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,560
If I were you,

279
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,920
and the person I like was in such a state,

280
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,050
I wouldn't be able to leave in peace.

281
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,480
This one is Chinese style.

282
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,720
Mine is Western style.

283
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,480
This one has three dishes and one soup,

284
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,370
with a full range of flavors.

285
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,400
Mine has a nutritionally balanced mix
of meat and vegetables.

286
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,720
These are all Xiaolu's favorite dishes.

287
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,720
I deliver them to him every day,

288
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,040
and he always eats them all up.

289
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,160
When have I ever eaten all of it?

290
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,120
He... He definitely doesn't always

291
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,200
eat it all up, right?

292
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,520
Sometimes when he leaves a bit,

293
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,080
I help him finish a couple of bites,

294
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,360
right, Xiaolu?

295
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,760
Yes.

296
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,320
Hey, please

297
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,200
don't bring me food again.

298
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,440
Don't come to see me anymore.

299
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,840
I'm fine at home,

300
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,320
eating well and sleeping well.

301
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,560
Stop worrying unnecessarily.

302
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,320
Then why aren't you coming to work?

303
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,040
Yeah, everyone is worried about you.

304
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,080
Is it because of Dajiang?

305
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,080
And Bai Lan.

306
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,080
Hey, Xiaoying.

307
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,680
Alright, stop worrying unnecessarily.

308
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,840
I just want to be alone at home for a bit.

309
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,880
I'll be back in a few days.

310
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,040
Don't worry.

311
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,480
Then come back soon.

312
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,560
We're waiting for you.

313
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,000
Let us know if you need anything.

314
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,240
Alright.

315
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,720
Well, we're leaving then.

316
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,560
Let's go. I'll see you out.

317
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,080
- Remember to eat.
- Have your meals.

318
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,400
- Eat mine.
- You guys focus on work.

319
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,240
Stop coming to see me.

320
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,040
Go.

321
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,480
Don't worry.

322
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,840
Having known Xiaolu for so many years,

323
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,120
always bustling and bustling,

324
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,520
I've never seen him this quiet.

325
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,760
Right. He says he's fine,

326
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,080
but he's lost a lot of weight.

327
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,840
It's your fault.

328
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,750
What are you doing here
with your lousy cooking skills?

329
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,000
If it weren't for you,
Xiaolu would have eaten mine long ago.

330
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:34,920
What do you mean?

331
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,880
Is it only you
who can care about Xiaolu?

332
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,480
You're hanging on to Li Guangnan

333
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,560
and still care about Xiaolu.

334
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,400
Aren't you ashamed?

335
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,240
What? Come on.

336
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,560
I don't need to explain to you.

337
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,680
Whatever!

338
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,320
She's crazy!

339
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,480
Don't get angry. Don't get angry.

340
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,840
Maybe he just wasn't feeling well today.

341
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,920
But I gave him his favorite dishes.

342
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,160
Is your information wrong?

343
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,920
No.

344
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,120
It can't be.

345
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,920
Think about it.
Eating the same thing for months,

346
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,600
he must get tired of it,

347
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,440
right?

348
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,840
Isn't he coming back in a few days?

349
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,960
You have a couple of days

350
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,880
to think about the recipes, right?

351
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,160
(Safe and Civilized Community)

352
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,000
That makes sense.

353
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,760
What should I add then?

354
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,180
Roast chicken with crispy skin.

355
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,440
No, that won't do.

356
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,800
Fried pork with vinegar.

357
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,720
Oh wait, he likes sweet things.

358
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,160
Still thinking about your cousin, huh?

359
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,720
Ever since I was little,

360
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,420
I've always thought my cousin

361
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,480
was the most incredible person
in the world.

362
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,280
As long as I was behind him,

363
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,560
nobody dared to bully me.

364
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Although

365
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,200
he wasn't well-educated,

366
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,240
not particularly handsome,

367
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,920
and sometimes not the sharpest,

368
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,720
in my heart,

369
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,760
he has always been a hero.

370
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,760
So what?

371
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,920
Now your cousin isn't a hero?

372
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,720
When heroes defeat villains,

373
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,240
shouldn't they have a happy ending?

374
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,960
My cousin caught the stalker

375
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,800
and gave Li Guangnan a spot

376
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,560
to sell milk tea.

377
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,240
He did so many good things.

378
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,040
Why did it end up like this?

379
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,480
Was he wrong in the first place?

380
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,840
Xiaolu,

381
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,760
have you ever thought

382
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,880
about why your cousin gave you this coat?

383
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,720
He said I looked like Boss Ma in it

384
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,820
and that it could help me win Bai Lan.

385
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,680
Did Boss Ma have a happy ending?

386
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,240
Even so,

387
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,960
aren't there still many people

388
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,160
who want to be like Boss Ma?

389
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,240
Aren't there countless heroes?

390
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,720
Time for dinner.

391
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,080
Stop chatting. Let's eat.

392
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,240
Mom, Dad,

393
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,440
I need to go somewhere.

394
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,240
(Billing of Hospitalization)

395
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,160
Hello,

396
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,240
is there a patient named Zhao Dabao here?

397
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,880
The one with the head injury?

398
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,720
Yes, right.

399
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,320
Oh, the room at the end of the hallway.

400
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,040
Thank you.

401
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,760
(Neurosurgery, Ward 18)

402
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,040
Hello,

403
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,480
are you related to Zhao Dabao?

404
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,880
Who are you?

405
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,230
I'm Lu Xiaolu.

406
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,620
Lu Dajiang is my cousin.

407
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,240
I came to check on Zhao Dabao for him.

408
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,520
Get out!

409
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,720
Get out!

410
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,960
Get out of here!

411
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,640
All of the Lus are murderers!

412
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,240
I'm sorry.

413
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,720
You're sorry?

414
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,080
My son is only 20.

415
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,480
His head was smashed by you guys.

416
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,800
Now he can't even hear.

417
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,640
What will he do in the future?

418
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,200
You all are murderers!

419
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,000
- Mrs. Zhao...
- Murderer!

420
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,800
Xiaolu.

421
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,920
What are you doing here?

422
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,080
I heard from the nurse

423
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,320
you've been staying with him.

424
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,680
You even helped find the ward.

425
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,040
I'm a doctor, after all.

426
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,400
I can take care of him better than others.

427
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,880
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

428
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,960
You don't need to thank me.

429
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,680
It was your cousin
who asked me to do this before he left.

430
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:19,960
He's a good person.

431
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,640
You don't need to apologize.

432
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,440
I was too impulsive that day.

433
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,800
And I know

434
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,580
you meant well for my cousin.

435
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,240
I also know

436
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,760
you have your pursuits.

437
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,520
Though, I...

438
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,200
Let's not talk about this now.

439
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,080
When did we become
so formal with each other?

440
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,560
So, how about you?

441
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,680
How have you been recently?

442
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,760
Me?

443
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,000
I'm doing quite well.

444
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,000
Everyone's been really nice to me.

445
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,040
Li Guangnan helped me take leave.

446
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,440
Big Feet helped me with my work.

447
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,480
Xiaoying sometimes brings me meals.

448
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,520
But Little Pouter...

449
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,640
She's been acting strange.

450
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,120
What's wrong with her?

451
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,720
She used to be a little princess
who couldn't cook.

452
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,880
Suddenly, she's cooking for me,

453
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,120
bringing me burnt steak

454
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,480
or undercooked vegetables.

455
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,840
Do you think she's doing it on purpose

456
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,160
and trying to give me diarrhea?

457
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,400
Oh, and also,

458
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,800
she keeps cutting

459
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,480
jokes from magazines out for me.

460
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,000
But those jokes...

461
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,400
Aren't they funny?

462
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,760
They're from the Reader's Digest.

463
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,000
Do you think those are funny?

464
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,640
They're worse than the jokes
my high school principal used to tell.

465
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,720
If I have that much spare time,

466
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:44,110
I might as well
go back to the repair class

467
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,440
and listen to Mr. Niu tell me jokes.

468
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,520
Now that's fun.

469
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,360
What's wrong?

470
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:53,920
Are you upset?

471
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,400
You're Lu Xiaolu,

472
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,680
and you're Bai Lan?

473
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,200
Why is it always you two?

474
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,160
Come with us then.

475
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,440
On the night of the fight
at the skating rink,

476
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,600
where were you?

477
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,200
I was in the food factory's infirmary.

478
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,800
Who were you with?

479
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,040
By myself.

480
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,280
Can anyone vouch for that?

481
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,720
What's the matter, officer?

482
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,080
Be serious.

483
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,440
Ding Dezhong
from your factory reported

484
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,080
that someone attacked him that night.

485
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,810
(Severe Punishment to Resistors)
According to his clues,

486
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,080
the suspect who attacked him

487
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,680
is between you and Bai Lan.

488
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,560
That night I indeed
was at the food factory.

489
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,520
Dr. Tian went home
to celebrate his wife's birthday.

490
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,720
He asked me to cover his shift.

491
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,080
That's all?

492
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,000
After 10:30 pm,

493
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,840
I went out.

494
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,560
Where did you go?

495
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,000
Near the skating rink.

496
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,120
What were you doing there?

497
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,000
Here's the thing.

498
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,960
Ding Dezhong
had a grudge against my cousin.

499
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,960
We heard

500
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,020
that the infirmary
received a notice from the factory

501
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,720
that someone must be on duty that night.

502
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,850
We were worried something might happen
at the skating rink,

503
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,920
so we tried to go and stop it.

504
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,280
But we were too late.

505
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,880
When we arrived,

506
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,400
we saw Ding Dezhong attacking my cousin
with an electric baton.

507
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,440
So you grabbed a stick

508
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,680
and hit Ding Dezhong first, right?

509
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,160
I was the one who hit him.

510
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,440
You hit him?

511
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,520
Yes.

512
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,200
But it was self-defense.

513
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,200
What?

514
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,480
You don't believe me?

515
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,280
If you don't believe me,
you can check my record.

516
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,240
When I graduated from college,

517
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,480
I got in trouble for assault.

518
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,200
Just ten minutes ago,

519
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,240
Lu Xiaolu just admitted

520
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,000
he was the one
who attacked Ding Dezhong.

521
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,200
Young man,

522
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,640
you need to think this through.

523
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,640
Crimes can't be admitted to carelessly.

524
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,520
Once you're charged,

525
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,440
you'll be fired from the factory.

526
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,000
I know that.

527
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,720
If it wasn't me, I wouldn't admit it.

528
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,050
Everyone should be responsible
for their own actions.

529
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,720
This has nothing to do with Bai Lan.

530
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,800
Let her go.

531
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,760
From the motives and capabilities,

532
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,080
Lu Xiaolu's suspicion

533
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,160
is indeed much greater than yours.

534
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,760
Comrade Bai Lan,

535
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:04,960
think about it again.

536
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,320
If you have no objections

537
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,160
to Lu Xiaolu's confession,

538
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,560
you can sign here.

539
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,560
But officer,

540
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,760
isn't this supposed to be about evidence?

541
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,520
How can you calculate probabilities?

542
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,080
You're educating me now?

543
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,280
Since you're a college graduate,

544
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,040
you should know the consequences

545
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,300
of fighting and injuring someone.

546
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,440
If it's serious, you could end up in jail.

547
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,560
It's precisely because
I know the consequences

548
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,000
that I can't wrongfully
accuse a good person.

549
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,720
But every word I say is the truth.

550
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,720
I've handled many cases,

551
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,200
but this is the first time
I've seen someone

552
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,160
eager to confess to a crime.

553
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,480
Then you both better think it over again.

554
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,080
When you figure it out,

555
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,720
we'll release one of you.

556
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,200
This girl is really tough.

557
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,560
She didn't eat a thing we sent in.

558
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,720
Not a bite

559
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,320
all day.

560
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,120
Good for you.

561
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,280
Director Bi,

562
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,080
I really didn't expect you to show up.

563
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,920
We haven't known each other long,

564
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,760
but

565
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,800
I really admire you.

566
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,440
When I saw you,

567
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,560
I felt an immediate connection.

568
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,480
You're particularly like my...

569
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,240
Daughter?

570
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,960
Do I really look that old?

571
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,480
I think I'd better
ask the questions clearly

572
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,450
before I start eating.

573
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,640
Why exactly are you helping me?

574
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,400
You want the truth, right?

575
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,560
Alright, I'll be straightforward.

576
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,640
It's strange,

577
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,800
but I can't stand to see you get wronged.

578
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,560
I felt like I should come over.

579
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,240
You need someone to protect you,

580
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,760
and to believe in you.

581
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,000
What if I told you

582
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,720
you believed the wrong person,

583
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,920
and the one who hit him was indeed me,

584
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,080
not someone else?

585
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,640
To me,

586
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,240
that doesn't matter.

587
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,440
This seafood porridge

588
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,920
is a dish from our hometown.

589
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,720
With some ginger,

590
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,760
it removes the fishiness

591
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,640
and warms the body.

592
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,360
Here.

593
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,040
Have some.

594
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,440
Actually,

595
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,080
I didn't specifically

596
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,200
invite you here.

597
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,640
I've been

598
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,720
having dinner here lately.

599
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,680
I...

600
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,640
couldn't find anyone to talk to
about my feelings.

601
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,480
I'm sick

602
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,000
of those official receptions.

603
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,720
My son has grown up,

604
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,080
and he always avoids me.

605
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,920
His mother...

606
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,480
We

607
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,160
don't have anything in common anymore.

608
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,720
Now we're going through a divorce.

609
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,160
It's been a while.

610
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,560
Enough about that.

611
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,920
I just think you're particularly

612
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,240
like the outstanding female classmates
I had in college.

613
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,640
Smart,

614
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,800
beautiful,

615
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,880
elegant, and graceful.

616
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,800
You have a real personality.

617
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,280
Honestly, meeting you makes me

618
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,720
feel like

619
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,640
my life was reignited,

620
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,800
full of energy.

621
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,480
Bai Lan,

622
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,040
I really hope

623
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,160
you could be the one to have dinner
with me in the future.

624
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,040
With just one word from me,

625
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,200
this sponsored position

626
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,360
is yours.

627
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
You mean

628
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,520
I have to sleep with you.

629
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,360
Don't make it sound so unpleasant.

630
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,200
You...

631
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,240
Actually,

632
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,960
I also really like Shanghai.

633
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,960
I could go to Shanghai to see you.

634
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,840
We could walk on the Bund together

635
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,680
and eat at the Peace Hotel.

636
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,480
None of that matters.

637
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,080
What's important is

638
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,600
I can protect you

639
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,440
and your friend.

640
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,360
How would you protect us?

641
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,400
If you agree,

642
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,160
your friend

643
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,480
can walk out of the police station

644
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,960
safe and sound tomorrow.

645
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,640
(Good Cat Restaurant)

646
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,560
I just had a shower.

647
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,160
No, you just came out of the station.

648
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,200
You gotta wash off properly.

649
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,760
Otherwise, bad luck will stick to you.

650
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,440
Careful, careful.

651
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,920
Here comes the brasier.

652
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,600
Come on, jump over it.

653
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,680
Isn't that a bit too much?

654
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,840
- Hurry.
- Can't skip the ritual.

655
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,760
- Jump over.
- Jump.

656
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,760
Let's go, come on.

657
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,320
Come on, let's have one. Come on.

658
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,160
- Cheers.
- Come on.

659
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,360
- Cheers.
- Congratulations.

660
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,320
Tell us.

661
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,800
What did you say to them?

662
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,400
How did they let you out?

663
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,960
I don't know what happened.

664
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,200
Suddenly, they just dropped it.

665
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,200
Could it be

666
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,520
someone changed his mind?

667
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,600
Ding Dezhong isn't that kind-hearted.

668
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,080
Little Pouter.

669
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,360
You just called your uncle
by his full name.

670
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,640
Are you guys crazy?

671
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,080
No, no.

672
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,320
Could it be

673
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,320
Bai Lan took all the blame

674
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,520
on herself?

675
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,560
Right, where is Bai Lan?

676
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,400
I'm here.

677
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,960
Hey, Bai Lan.

678
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,160
Come here.

679
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,000
Come and sit by me.

680
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,080
Come on.

681
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,480
Let's have a toast.

682
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,520
To celebrate our exoneration.

683
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,480
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

684
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,680
Congratulations.

685
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,520
Honestly,

686
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,920
I should thank you.

687
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,640
You saved my cousin.

688
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,480
What's there to thank for?

689
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,440
Anyway, it was me who hit him.

690
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,080
I'll toast to everyone.

691
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,520
Actually, I came today

692
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,680
to say goodbye.

693
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,600
I'm planning to leave the food factory.

694
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,200
What do you mean?

695
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,760
Attention, all factory workers.

696
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,400
Due to provocation

697
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,080
and intentional injury,

698
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,260
with multiple charges combined,

699
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,320
the former worker Lu Dajiang

700
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,480
(Notification)
was sentenced to five years

701
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,680
in prison.

702
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,900
Justice is extensive and meticulous,

703
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,960
and it spares no one.

704
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,760
Let this serve as a reminder to all staff

705
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,960
and officials in our factory.

706
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,520
Take this as a warning.

707
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,200
Those who play with fire
will eventually get burned.

708
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,080
Additionally,

709
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,480
Lu Xiaolu, a worker at the repair class,

710
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,480
has not only been absent multiple times,

711
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,880
violating factory regulations,

712
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,680
but has also been involved

713
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,440
in Lu Dajiang's illegal activities.

714
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,400
Wasn't Xiaolu caught

715
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,640
along with Bai Lan?

716
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,000
How come only Xiaolu is being punished?

717
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,360
Bai Lan is unscathed.

718
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,480
She's not demoted but promoted.

719
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,840
What does that mean?

720
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,840
Yes.

721
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,280
As for the sponsored position,

722
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,720
the entire Second Light Industry Bureau

723
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,600
only has one slot per year.

724
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,600
And a fine of 200 yuan...

725
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,880
What does this tell us?

726
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,320
What?

727
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,000
It shows Dr. Bai has her tactics.

728
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,560
What kind of brilliant tactics could it be?

729
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,120
Xiaolu was so good to her,

730
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,280
yet she climbed up by stepping on him.

731
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,000
How can Xiaolu
help her to go to Shanghai?

732
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,800
It might not be that simple.

733
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,320
Let's not talk about it anymore.
We'd better go.

734
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,600
Let's go.

735
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,800
Let's go.

736
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,000
This kid...

737
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,840
He's so mad.

738
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,880
Really?

739
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:31,960
Such a loyal friend.

740
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,080
