285 yuan in all.

26

I'm sorry, I was

27
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,650
in a rush when I came

28
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,860
and didn't bring enough money.

29
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,700
How about this?

30
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,060
I'll leave my ID here

31
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,860
and come back to settle the payment
another day, okay?

32
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,540
This really won't do, sir.

33
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,030
That's against our rules.

Well, how about this?

I'll give you 20 yuan now,

36
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,140
and you wait for me a bit.

37

I'll go home and get the money.

- No, sir.
- You have to trust me.

Listen,

I've been friends with the owner

of your hotel for many years, really.

42
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,370
Sir, this really won't work.

43
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,520
I'm sorry about this.

44
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,160
Big Feet, I didn't expect you
to be doing so well.

45
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,310
Just treating us to a meal
won't be enough.

No matter how much you earn,

47
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,140
you should have come to the wedding.

48
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,330
What's going on with you?

49
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:34,840
Let Big Feet arrange another one for you.

50
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,520
No, Juan won't agree.

51
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,530

52
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,420
We have to go home.

53
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,280
We'll meet again another day.

54
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,520
You must treat us again.

55
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:45,910
We're leaving now.

56
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,090
- Bye.
- Let us know when you get home.

00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,520

59
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,070
tell me anytime.

60
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:03,770
I'll smoke a cigarette.

61
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:04,820
You two go home first.

62
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,910
- Okay.
- Take care.

63
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,310
I'll call a taxi.

64
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,750
No need.

65
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,070
I've had a bit too much to drink.

66
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:14,960

70
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,320
And then it's finished.

71
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,080
Another cup?

72
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,920
Can you still handle more?

73
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,200
Let me tell you the truth.

74
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,000
I usually

75
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,320
don't come out to drink,

76
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,280
but tonight,

77
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,200
I must drink

78
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,860
until I can't drink anymore.

79
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,960
Bottoms up.

80
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,280
Let's have another bottle.

81
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,680
Okay, okay.

82
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,920
- Okay.
- Waiter.

83
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,960
Enough.

84
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,080
That's enough for today.

85
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,240
Let's drink another day.

86
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,880
Why postpone it?

87
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,720
Listen, Mr. Huang,

88
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,560
I have some issues with you.

89
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,360
From the start, you've been
caring for her, defending her.

90
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,440
Why is that?

91
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,080
Tell me clearly today

92
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,920
what's going on between you two.

93
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,480
Otherwise, we must

94
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,800
continue this drink.

95
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,760
Is that okay?

96
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,880

97
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,520
Waiter.

98
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,480
Miss Bai is my fiancée.

99
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,640
I can't bear to see her drink more.

100
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,840
Mr. Huang,

101
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,520

102
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,120
Alright,

103
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,000
since that's the case,

104
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,680
I wish you both well.

105
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,600
I wish you both well.

106
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,120
Are you okay?

107
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,000
Luckily, the room is upstairs.

108
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,000
You go back and rest first.

109
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,800
I'll come back after dropping him off.

110
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,640
Your acting was good.

111
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,640

I'm sorry.

122
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm just afraid that when I come back...

123
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,920
What are you afraid of?

124
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,160
That I won't like you anymore
because you are not doing well?

Xiaoying,

129
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,200
I know that you have been

130
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,200
doing business with Xiaolu
to make money these years

131
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,360
just to support me,

132
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,680
to support my singing career.

133
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,080
But I feel really guilty.

134
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,560
I know how hard you've worked.

135
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,640
Xiaoying, more than once,

136
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,160
I've told myself

137
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,360
to just forget it,

138
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,920
come back and settle down.

139
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,760
But I really can't face you like that.

140
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,160
I've also told myself more than once

141
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,520
to hold on a little longer,

142
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,880

But Xiaoying,

00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,320
I really tried my best.

00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,240

00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,280
that old thing surnamed Bi

190
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,880
kept trying to get me drunk.

191
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,000
I saw through him at a glance.

192
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,360
He used to do this too back then.

193
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,960
But guess what?

194
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,040
What?

195
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,400
I got him drunk.

196
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,080
I'm not bad, am I?

197
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,040
Yeah, you're the best.

198
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,120
After several years,

199
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,910
how come your drinking capacity
has improved so much?

200
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,400
It's not always been this good.

201
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,680
I remember

202
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,080
the first time
negotiating at a drinking table,

203
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,680
I ended up in the hospital
getting my stomach pumped.

204
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,720
Another time,

205
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,440
I got drunk

206
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,760
and hit someone,

207
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,440
messed up a deal,

208
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,440
and had to apologize to the client.

209
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,720
But

210
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,320
things are different now.

211
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,200
I'm really good now.

212
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,640
It's safe to say

213
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,440
I'm second to none.

214
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,480
I've conquered the drinking scene
in Shanghai.

215
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:28,960
Didn't you say

216
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,560
you've been doing well these years?

217
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,960
Yeah,

218
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,960
I have.

219
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,800
Come on, get up.

220
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,320
If I don't say it like this,

221
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,160
I'll lose.

222
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,760
Let me help you lie down.

223
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,520
The floor is so cold.

224
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,200
Come on, get up now.

225
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,320
I'll stay on the ground.

226
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,240
You just said "lose".

227
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,480
What do you mean?

228
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,160
I just don't want to lose to Lu Xiaolu.

229
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,720
I want to tell him that

230
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,920
even without him,

231
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,680
I can still live well.

232
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,960
I, Bai Lan,

233
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,120
can live well without anyone.

234
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,680
What are you looking at?

235
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,360
Don't believe it?

236
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,640
If I had known you'd go through so much,

237
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,520
I would never have left you.

238
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,840
Who do you think you are?

239
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,320
A savior?

240
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,960
Let me tell you,

241
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,880
even though I've had

242
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,920
a tough time these years,

243
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,520
I do have savings.

244
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,480
Soon, I'll have my own company,

245
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,160
my own projects.

246
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,760
By then, I won't have to talk business

247
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,280
by drinking anymore.

248
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,840
No,

249
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,720
more accurately,

250
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,120
I'll drink when I want to drink

251
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,760
and won't when I don't want to.

252
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,040
No one can force me.

253
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,040
So, this food factory project

254
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,760
is important to you, right?

255
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,640
Go to hell.

256
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,480
I don't want to live
this kind of life anymore.

257
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,560
But

258
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,640
if I stop drinking,

259
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,440
won't my great capacity

260
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,680
go to waste?

261
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,240
I have a good idea.

262
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,360
I've decided to pass on
my drinking skills to you.

263
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,640
How about that?

264
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,200
Will you be my disciple?

265
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,440
Alright.

266
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,960
I'll accept it.

267
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,640
But not today.

268
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,600
You're already too drunk

269
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,520
to pass your skills.

270
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,080
Let me help you lie down.

271
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,280
Get up.

272
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,360
- No.
- Come on.

273
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,440
- No, I won't.
- Come on.

274
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,520
I'll just lie on the ground.

275
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,840
I'll go get you some water.

276
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,680
Wait for me.

277
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:51,680
I don't want water.

278
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,560
I want alcohol.

279
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,760
You're already drunk.
You can't drink anymore.

280
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,640
I'm not drunk.

281
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,040
I want to drink.

282
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,640
I'll pass that to you today.

283
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,680
Okay, okay.

284
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,760
I'll go buy you some alcohol.

285
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,600
Yeah.

286
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,320
Excuse me.

287
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,640
Please get me two dozens of beer.

288
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,800
Sir, which brand do you prefer?

289
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,080
Double Deer, Aoke,

290
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,160
or Singo?

291
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,720
Never mind.

292
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,240
Just give me two yogurt

293
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,520
and a can of honey.

294
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,360
Alright.

295
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,560
Didn't you say
you won't compromise this time?

296
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,680
Are you really sure about this?

297
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,160
(Director's Office)

298
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,000
I see.

299
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,800
Simply put,

300
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,040
the factory has lost control

301
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,280
over the workers.

302
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,280
That's why someone maliciously threatened

303
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,680
Manager Bai's personal safety.

304
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,400
No, this factory has always had

305
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,120
unresolved issues like unpaid wages

306
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,160
and medical expenses.

307
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,320
The workers have no choice.

308
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,600
After such an incident,

309
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,680
why didn't you report it?

310
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,520
- Well, you see, they are...
- It was my decision.

311
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,760
Manager Bai.

312
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,520
Your friend?

313
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,520
Yes.

314
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,880
He should be fired.

315
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,680
Why?

316
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,120
Doing this will only backfire.

317
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,280
He's your friend.

318
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,440
I won't pursue legal action against him,

319
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,160
but I can't pretend nothing happened.

320
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,720
Mr. Huang,

321
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,760
this worker has been

322
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,000
an outstanding worker in the factory

323
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,880
for many years

324
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,800
and was even awarded

325
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,160
as a city-level labor model.

326
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,240
But now, he's neither outstanding

327
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,320
nor exemplary.

328
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,000
I... I'll step out for a moment.

329
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,360
(Director's Office)

330
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,760
Do you have to be so arbitrary?

331
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,360
Didn't we agree that I would

332
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,520
handle this matter entirely?

333
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,200
Why don't you listen to my advice?

334
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,120
Only by doing this
can the workers understand

335
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,800
that causing trouble
will never achieve their goals,

336
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,880
no matter how long they've worked

337
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,920
or how high their status is.

338
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,160
I don't want to

339
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,360
see such things happen again.

340
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,120
You are just using violence
to control violence.

341
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,240
I don't think firing anyone

342
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,240
can solve the problem.

343
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,000
If you insist on doing this,

344
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,600
just fire me too.

345
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,320
Before completing this task,

346
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,560
you have no right to leave.

347
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,280
Manager Bai,

348
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,320
the keys to the cold storage.

349
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,560
The workers aren't entirely unreasonable.

350
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,280
I've reported to you before

351
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,240
about the cold storage issue.

352
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,840
They have returned the keys.

353
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,800
It's surprising that someone in the factory
has such awareness.

354
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,240
What's his name?

355
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,840
Lu Xiaolu.

356
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,320
Master Niu,

357
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,480
even Xiaolu has backed down,

358
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,560
what should we do?

359
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,640
Well...

360
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,560
You need to figure out a solution.

361
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,360
(Refrigerated Truck)

362
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,320
Master,

363
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,400
don't worry about it.

364
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,120
- Let's go.
- But...

365
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,840
Who is that person?

366
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,320
Veteran fitter Master Niu.

367
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,320
The model worker who splashed

368
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,400
pig's blood?

369
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,240
All of us

370
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,600
can put in some effort

371
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,920
to tide over this situation.

372
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,560
To others,

373
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,360
this might solve a big problem.

374
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,360
Why are you still thinking about others?

375
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,240
When Ma led people
to take the ice storage,

376
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,480
your attitude was not like this.

377
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,760
I'll pay for the rent
of the new cold storage.

378
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,720
I won't implicate you.

379
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,520
Do you think we're afraid to spend money?

380
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,440
We just don't want you

381
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,560
to be manipulated by Bai Lan every time.

382
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,920
That's enough.

383
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,360
I know.

384
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,240
This is the last time.

385
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,760
It won't happen again.

386
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,440
You all know that

387
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,280
I left Shanghai

388
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,160
without saying goodbye.

389
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,160
I owe it to her.

390
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,240
This time,

391
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,280
consider it as me repaying her.

392
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,600
Hello?

393
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,800
What?

394
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,200
They might fire Master Niu?

395
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,760
Okay, okay, I got it.

396
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,600
Lu Xiaolu,

397
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,920
look what you did.

398
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:54,000
♪Escaping the night in moonlight♪

399
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,080
♪Avoiding the guards using darkness♪

400
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:09,440
♪Lost and no longer lost♪

401
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:17,480
♪You go find a spaceship♪

402
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:24,680
♪I'll lead away the guards♪

403
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:32,640
♪I don't have a spaceship♪

404
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:39,450
♪So we can't reach♪

405
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:43,580
♪The moon♪

406
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,480
Doctor Bai?

407
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,320
Big Feet.

408
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,000
Long time no see.

409
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,880
Long time no see.

410
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,040
Well,

411
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,960
it's been a while since I last came.

412
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,760
I really missed here.

413
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,360
So I came to take a look.

414
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,200
Me too.

415
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,000
How have you been doing
in Beijing these years?

416
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,040
Beijing

417
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,360
is great,

418
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,360
a big city.

419
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,360
But

420
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,600
there are many people

421
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,460
with the same dreams as mine.

422
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,320
There are more stages, too.

423
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,360
Doctor Bai,

424
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,880
do you know?

425
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,080
In Beijing, there's a bar street

426
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,040
where I perform

427
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,400
every night.

428
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,560
Many people come to watch me sing.

429
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,720
It's lively.

430
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,280
When you release an album,

431
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,640
remember to send me a copy.

432
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,160
Do you remember?

433
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,840
Xiaolu sneakily

434
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,040
fixed your bike there

435
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,680
back then.

436
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,320
It was so many years ago.

437
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,240
Was it that long ago?

438
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,640
It's like

439
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,040
yesterday to me.

440
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,000
It's been a long time.

441
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,920
Things have changed.

442
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,520
But you

443
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,960
finally won Xiaoying's heart.

444
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,040
Xiaolu

445
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,440
argued with Guangnan

446
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,440
for you today.

447
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,400
Is it about the cold storage?

448
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,240
Yeah.

449
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,440
You know, Doctor Bai,

450
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,720
Xiaolu never stands by

451
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,720
when you're in trouble.

452
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,560
Technically, I should thank him,

453
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,840
but I don't want to see him now.

454
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,400
Do you not want to

455
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,360
or are you afraid?

456
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,240
It's been a long time

457
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,480
since we drank together, right?

458
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,320
Yes, Dad.

459
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,320
I've spent little time with you
these years.

460
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,440
You don't have to accompany me.

461
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,680
I'm quite comfortable

462
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,720
here by myself.

463
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,440
I understand.

464
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,040
Our house is full of memories
of you and Mom.

465
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,240
That's right.

466
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,240
Your mother

467
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,160
used to complain that
my cooking was too oily

468
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,080
and salty,

469
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,240
but I could never change.

470
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,320
Now that she's gone,

471
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,440
whenever I cook,

472
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,720
I feel like she's nagging at me.

473
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,760
I just...

474
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,120
That's insane. Come on.

475
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,200
They say time can make you
forget everything,

476
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,320
but it's not that easy.

477
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,280
I've heard about

478
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,280
Bai Lan's situation.

479
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,600
After all these years,

480
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,160
she seems like a different person.

481
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,160
I don't know if I should believe her.

482
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,640
Do you

483
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,360
believe in yourself?

484
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,800
Believing in myself?

485
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,200
I mean

486
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,880
do you believe you are right about her?

487
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,320
Dr. Tian.

488
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,040
- Long time no see.
- Long time no see.

489
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,120
I called you out in a hurry

490
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,760
because an old friend
also wants to see you.

491
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,360
- Okay.
- I hope you don't mind.

492
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,800
- No problem.
- Please.

493
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,360
Master Niu.

494
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,000
Please sit.

495
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,320
Please.

496
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:51,880
Thank you.

497
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,120
Coming.

498
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,080
Dr. Tian,

499
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,920
I heard about your wife's matter.

500
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,600
Tian's wife

501
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,720
had no job.

502
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,920
The factory used to

503
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,560
reimburse some of her medical expenses,

504
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,040
but then they stopped.

505
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:16,960
Her hepatitis

506
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,280
turned into cirrhosis,

507
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,560
and then liver cancer.

508
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,680
Tian sold his house

509
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,120
to treat his wife.

510
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,360
Ah, let's not talk about this.

511
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,880
Let's have a drink.

512
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,840
Let's drink.

513
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,240
Okay.

514
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,160
By the way,

515
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,720
these are the medicines you often take.

516
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,600
I remember they're
hard to find in Fucheng,

517
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,480
so I brought some
from Shanghai for you.

518
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,360
Thank you.

519
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,360
You are so thoughtful

520
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,080
and even care about an old man like me.

521
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,880
It's been years.

522
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,960
I was worried you wouldn't

523
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,120
like the Fucheng dishes,

524
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,960
so I made some sandwiches for you,

525
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,480
just like

526
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,480
you taught me back then.

527
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,640
(Good Cat Restaurant)
Our factory hasn't been performing well.

528
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,400
They can't pay salaries,

529
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,120
so they distribute canned goods
from the inventory

530
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,080
to everyone.

531
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,640
I use bread

532
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,000
and various canned goods

533
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,760
to make different flavored sandwiches.

534
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,400
I remember back in the factory,
the canned fish

535
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,520
was the most popular.

536
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,560
Every Friday, you would rush off work

537
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,400
to line up and get some.

538
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,360
Yes.

539
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,040
I didn't expect
you still remember these things.

540
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,720
But you should also remember that

541
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,440
you were once

542
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,520
part of our food factory, right?

543
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,840
Are you blaming me

544
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,840
for something?

545
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,680
You two must

546
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,720
have a lot to say to me.

547
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,640
I'm all ears.

548
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,520
Dr. Bai,

549
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,160
I'll still address you

550
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,800
the way we did

551
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,040
in the factory.

552
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,160
Us workers

553
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,160
don't have big demands,

554
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,880
just pay us our wages

555
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:19,920
and cover

556
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,400
our medical expenses.

557
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,800
Then we'll do whatever

558
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,800
you ask us to do.

559
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,920
But if you drive me away,

560
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,240
will that solve the problem?

561
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,760
Salaries still won't be paid,

562
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,360
medical expenses won't be covered,

563
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,910
and the factory
will continue to deteriorate

564
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,720
until it closes.

565
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,240
Workers will be laid off.

566
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,800
Not to mention the whole country,

567
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,800
how many factories

568
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,280
in Fucheng have closed?

569
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,080
So what I need now is

570
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,360
for everyone to trust me.

571
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,360
As long as we revive this factory,

572
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,120
these lingering issues will all be solved.

573
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,880
How can we trust you?

574
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,480
The factory has promised us
many times before.

575
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,400
But each time,
it's just an empty promise.

576
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,720
They keep delaying, day after day.

577
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:05,960
So many people,

578
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,320
so many families,

579
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,280
have been dragged down by this.

580
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,600
But this time is different.

581
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,760
We're all in the same boat.

582
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,760
Our goals are the same.

583
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,920
Yes,

584
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,480
reforming definitely has risks,

585
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,360
but it's only temporary.

586
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,840
Once we have a modern corporate system

587
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,960
and improved management,

588
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,760
the food factory
will definitely be revived.

589
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,760
When the factory is profitable,

590
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,280
medical expenses and wages
won't be a problem anymore.

591
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,440
And in the future, we will expand

592
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,240
and introduce new equipment
and develop new products,

593
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,920
don't you look forward to that?

594
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,640
Why should we believe you?

595
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,800
I will convince the Italians

596
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,760
to cooperate with us.

597
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,280
When I succeed,

598
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,240
you will believe me, okay?

599
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,360
Really?

600
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,160
I'll be honest with you.

601
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,960
I made a bet.

602
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,320
If I can't revive the factory,

603
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,640
I lose.

604
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,760

608
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,760
Did you arrange this?

609
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,280
Since you did,

610
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,480
why didn't you come out yourself

611
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,320
but let your master talk to me?

612
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,840
It is good to make it clear

613
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,040
to Master Niu.

614
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,920
He has authority in the factory.

615
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,360
Everyone listens to him.

616
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,480
I know.

617
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,920
But the pig blood incident last time

618
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,320
really had nothing to do with him.

619
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,840
Will he still be fired?

620
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,160
Don't worry about that.

621
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,880
With me around, it won't happen.

622
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,680
That's good.

623
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,400
Thank you.

624
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,600
For what?

625
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,880
For the cold storage.

626
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,360
No need.

627
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,080
I did it for myself.

628
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,120
Is that so?

629
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:27,960
Yes.

630
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,040

633
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,280
Alright, I'll leave then.

634
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,480
Go talk to your master.

635
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,600

There's progress on the workers' side.

645
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,880
Master Niu promised me that

646
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,520
he can convince the workers
to resume work.

647
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,240
Really?

648
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,400
They changed their minds so quickly?

649
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,480
Because deep down,

650
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,720
they all love the factory

651
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,000

the last bit of hope.

Master,

655
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,640
the factory really didn't fire you?

656
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:06,960
Of course.

657
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,080
What do you think we are doing?

658
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,560
Taking some parts

659
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,680
and selling them for retirement?

660
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,640
We all agreed that

661
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,960
if you were fired,

662
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,120

Why were your eyes closed?

691
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,160
You also scared me!

- Tall or short?
- Fat or thin?

697
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,960
I didn't see clearly.

some books

705
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,880

710
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,240
I brought Mr. Huang here to see you.

711
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,600
Don't get up.

712
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,440
Hello, Master Niu.

713
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,040
It's regrettable what happened.

714
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,640
I promise you and all the workers that

715
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,560
we'll get to the bottom of this

716
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,960
and catch the real culprit.

717
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,680
Thank you. Thank you.

718
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,560
It's a Greek gift.

719
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,560
I heard you've been working hard

720
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,240
to ensure the factory resumes smoothly.

721
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,440
Why not take this opportunity to rest?

722
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,080
The hospital expenses
will be covered by the factory.

723
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,320
Alright, Manager Bai?

724
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,120
No problem.

This is a matter of the factory.

735
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,400
As far as I know,

736
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,920
you're no longer part of the factory.
