Boss Hu,

25
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,810
I see the articulated truck has arrived.

26
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,470
Are we handling
some big business again soon?

27
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,670
Definitely.

28
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,720
Once we finish this job,

29
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,350
I'll take you to Singapore,
Malaysia, and Thailand.

30
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,200
Great.

31
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,750
Where's Laowu?

32
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,560
He's cutting the watermelon.

33
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:06,740
It's been a while.

34
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,590
Laowu!

35
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:09,570
Boss Hu!

36
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,420
Boss Hu!

37
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,630
Surprised to see you here,

38
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,000
Lu Dajiang.

39
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,030
You timed it perfectly to join us
for watermelon, didn't you?

40
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,240
I warn you.

41
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,020
Don't mess with my cousin again.

42
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,120
Hey, Lu Dajiang,

43
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,790
you're wrong here.

44
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,350
Your cousin and I

45
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,810
have no grievances.

46
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,820
I'm just getting paid to do a job.

47
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,790
Besides,

48
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,280
what has your cousin been up to?

49
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,440
Don't be impulsive. Listen to me.

50
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,420
Your cousin's been undermining
others' businesses,

51
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,720
and messing with others' women.

52
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,650
If this were the underworld,

53
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,030
that would get him killed.

54
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:44,450
Dajiang,

55
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,210
you'd better go back

56
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,840
and advise your cousin to stop.

57
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,050
Don't be impulsive.

58
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,190
Let's talk this out calmly.

59
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,910
I'm a law-abiding citizen now.

60
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,750
I don't want to get physical with you.

61
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,590
But my cousin is my red line.

62
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,190
If you dare touch him again,

63
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,960
even if it means I end up in jail forever

64
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,840
or pay with my life,

65
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,790
I won't let you off.

66
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,310
I promise you.

67
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,630
- Boss Hu!
- I swear.

68
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,060
If I touch your cousin again,

69
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,870
may lightning

70
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,210
strike me down.

71
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,400
Alright?

72
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,060
What era does he think this is?

73
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,400
Still playing that with me.

74
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,240
I'll find a way to settle this
once and for all.

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:56,480
=Episode 24=
=Never Thought of Parting=

76
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:57,910
After all this,

77
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,070
I didn't even get you to the hotel.

78
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,560
Stay here for the night.

79
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,440
I've got everything prepared for you.

80
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,350
I know you're worried.

81
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,000
If you stay here,

82
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,000
Huang Qing might do something to me.

83
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,280
He didn't want the factory to restart,

84
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,910
so he had someone beat up Master Niu.

85
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:22,890
He didn't want us to collaborate,

86
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:23,960
so he had someone beat you.

87
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,100
I really don't know

88
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,640
what he might do next.

89
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,990
From the day I returned to Fucheng,

90
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,400
I've been losing.

91
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,060
What's more ridiculous

92
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,320
is how much I trusted him.

93
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,110
I thought he would help me.

94
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,910
I thought
I could revive the food factory.

95
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,350
Turns out

96
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,430
I was too naive.

97
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,230
I don't want you to get hurt.

98
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,990
Please try this. Have a taste.

99
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,420
Sure.

100
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,660
Does everyone have it?

101
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,450
Here, give it a try.

102
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,160
- I have one too?
- Sure.

103
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:52,280
Try it.

104
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,410
- What's this?
- I've never seen it before.

105
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,890
This drink was personally mixed
by Mr. Lu for you guys.

106
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:57,880
You can have a try.

107
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,100
Is it good?

108
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,550
Over the years,

109
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,330
our company's sales network

110
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,920
has been able
to spread throughout the province,

111
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,350
all thanks to our wholesale partners.

112
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,320
I sincerely thank everyone here.

113
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,290
Mr. Lu,

114
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,970
by calling us here today,

115
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,200
are you planning to distribute money?

116
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,780
You won't want

117
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,110
my little money.

118
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,000
Actually, today I invited everyone here

119
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,400
to ask for a favor.

120
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,720
What favor?

121
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,240
Looks like such a big deal.

122
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,680
As you know,

123
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,080
I was also

124
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,120
a part of the food factory.

125
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,360
Recently, an investment company
from Shanghai

126
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,050
became the major shareholder
of the food factory

127
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,380
and even plans to demolish the factory
for land redevelopment.

128
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,400
This not only means

129
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,200
the workers
wouldn't get the money they're owed,

130
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,840
but they would also be laid off.

131
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,280
These past few years,

132
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,320
such cases have been
too numerous to count,

133
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,480
all mired in disputes,

134
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,820
and nobody can do anything about it.

135
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,920
But we can't just watch the workers

136
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,480
struggle to make ends meet.

137
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,840
So,

138
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,960
my good friend from Shanghai,

139
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,120
the experienced investment manager
Bai Lan,

140
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,640
and I have decided

141
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,680
to develop a new product

142
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,640
for the food factory

143
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,120
for the workers to produce.

144
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,320
We'll handle the sales,

145
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,160
allowing them to earn their due wages

146
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,640
through their labor.

147
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,280
What's this new product?

148
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,480
The one you're holding now.

149
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,480
Try it again.

150
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,040
It tastes

151
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,800
a bit like the popular
Taiwanese milk tea recently,

152
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,800
but the flavor of jasmine

153
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,400
seems a bit stronger.

154
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,720
Our new product

155
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,880
is the "Golden Peacock Milk Tea".

156
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,960
This milk tea powder

157
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,760
was personally developed by Mr. Lu.

158
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,440
Besides having a unique flavor,

159
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,120
it's also easy to transport

160
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,200
and has a long shelf life,

161
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,720
suitable for sales nationwide.

162
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,760
Bai Lan and I will invest together

163
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,280
to retrofit the existing equipment.

164
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,680
The production might not be large,

165
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,480
but we're not aiming to make a profit,

166
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,600
just to ensure the workers

167
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,360
can live normally.

168
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,600
I must say

169
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,160
if the initial production volume is small,

170
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,640
distributors like us

171
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,080
might not see much profit.

172
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,640
If it doesn't sell well,

173
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,000
then we're all doomed.

174
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,840
That's right.

175
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,520
I understand.

176
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,680
If it loses money,

177
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,160
I, Lu Xiaolu,

178
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,320
owe everyone a debt.

179
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,760
I will repay it,

180
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,150
even if it means
selling everything I own.

181
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,840
But if it makes money,

182
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,520
aside from the workers' share,

183
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,360
I want nothing.

184
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,990
All profits will be distributed
among you all.

185
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,840
Mr. Lu,

186
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,320
that would be

187
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,880
too great a sacrifice for you.

188
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,200
If Mr. Lu's money isn't enough,

189
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,480
I can share the burden with him.

190
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,120
Anyway, our promises are written

191
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,040
in the contracts.

192
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,920
If we fail to fulfill them,

193
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,480
you can sue us.

194
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,720
We know Mr. Lu's character.

195
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,040
We still trust him.

196
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,640
I have no problem

197
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,560
with giving it a try.

198
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,400
I agree.

199
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,640
What about you all?

200
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,160
Sure.

201
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,680
Mr. Lu,

202
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,520
you really haven't left any way out
for yourself, have you?

203
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,160
It's so nice of you
to help the food factory like this.

204
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,080
I truly admire you

205
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,840
from the bottom of my heart.

206
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,920
So,

207
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,760
if there's anything you need,

208
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,440
just tell me.

209
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,280
Just tell us.

210
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,800
Sure.

211
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,440
Thank you, everyone.

212
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,880
Let's have a toast then.

213
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,440
- Let's do it.
- Come on. Cheers!

214
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,280
Come on.

215
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,400
Come on.

216
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,400
Take care on your way out.

217
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,480
Thank you. Thank you.

218

Take care.

219
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,440
- Take care.
- Thank you, thank you.

220
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,510
- Hey, sir.
- Take care, take care.

221
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,140
- Thanks for your support.
- You're too kind.

222
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,480
Just send me ten cases to start, okay?

223
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,760
No problem, no problem.

224
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,720
- Take care.
- Remember that.

225
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,960
- Take care.
- No problem.

226
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,480
Definitely. We've got you covered.

227
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,600
- All set, all set.
- Thanks, thanks.

228
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,760
Take it easy. Slow down.

229
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,800
Thanks!

230
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,720
- Keep in touch.
- Take care.

You're really decisive.

Mr. Huang,

274
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,040
if you want to fire me,

275
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,200
there's nothing I can do.

00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,320
if you want to drive away my brothers,

00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,240
My biggest worry right now

282
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,600
is this Huang Qing.

283
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,080
He's capable of anything,

284
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,050
and I'm afraid the workers
won't be able to withstand it.

285
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,240
The workers are the owners
of the factory.

286
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,360
Even if Huang Qing
wanted them to leave,

287
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,440
it wouldn't be easy.

288
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,320
So, this battle

289
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,600
is not yet decided.

290
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,880
You guys go ahead and talk.

291
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,400
I need to step out and make a few calls.

292
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,440

The Italians breached the contract,

295
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,840
and Bai Lan got fired.

296
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,080
You came just to tell me this?

297
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,800
Xiaolu,

298
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,880
I've said it before.

299
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,520
Let's go.

300
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,000
There's no need
to keep fighting for the factory.

301
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,920

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,480
We have a bright future ahead.

303
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,600
I've said it before too.

304
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,400
Once I've decided something,

305
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,040
I won't give up easily.

306
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,040
I just don't understand.

307
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,240
Everything's gotten to this point,

308
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,920
and you still
can't see the situation clearly.

309
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,440
Their mess has nothing to do with you.

310
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,160
People are wicked,

311
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,360
and your kind heart

312
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,840
might not lead to a good outcome.

313
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,840
If you keep going, you'll end up hurt.

314
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,560
So what if I end up hurt?

315
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,280
Did you know me just now?

316
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,110
Lu Xiaolu, haven't you grown at all

317
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,920
over these years?

318
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,080
The moment you see Bai Lan,

319
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,560
you forget everything you've said,
don't you?

320
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,680
She's just using you.

321
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,000
Can't you see that?

322
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,600
I've reported the situation
of the food factory

323
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,200
to the city officials.

324
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,920
They've agreed in principle

325
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,760
to buy 100% of the food factory's shares

326
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,680
and then build a commercial plaza

327
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,640
on the site.

328
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,400
If everything goes smoothly,

329
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,080
we should be

330
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,920
putting out a tender soon.

331
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,600
Don't worry.

332
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,640
As for that,

333
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,760
I'll handle it.

334
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,800
I've prepared all the documents,

335
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,800
so let's sign the share transfer contract
as soon as possible,

336
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,920
to avoid any more complications.

337
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,040
Of course.

338
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,240
How are things on the worker's side?

339
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,120
Don't worry.

340
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,600
I have both soft

341
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,320
and hard measures prepared.

342
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,120
I've blocked every path
to save the factory.

343
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,000
They have no other choice now.

344
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,920
Good.

345
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,040
Then I'll be leaving now.

346
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,320
I look forward to hearing good news.

347
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,600
That person over there
has been following us for two days.

348
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,240
Who is he?

349
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,680
I've checked him out.

350
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,120
He's Lu Xiaolu's partner,

351
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,080
named Li Guangnan.

352
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,040
He seems troubled.

353
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,680
Maybe we should help him.

354
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,880
So you really resigned?

355
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,120
Then all your years of effort

356
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,640
are wasted.

357
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,480
Let it be.

358
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,800
If it's the wrong path,

359
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,920
the further you go,
the harder it is to return.

360
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,320
Have you heard the story
of the little fish searching for the ocean?

361
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,920
Once,

362
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,640
there was a little fish

363
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,440
aimlessly swimming in the water.

364
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,040
One day,

365
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,720
another fish told it

366
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,440
that far, far away,

367
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,640
there was an ocean

368
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,240
where the waters were much broader,

369
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,360
and it might
live a different life there.

370
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,200
So this little fish

371
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,120
began searching for the ocean,

372
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,840
swimming hard every day,

373
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,400
exhausted to the brink of death.

374
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,800
Until one day,

375
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,240
it couldn't swim anymore.

376
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,720
It followed a big fish
swimming in the river

377
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,040
and asked it,

378
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,000
"Do you know where the ocean is?"

379
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,720
The big fish said,

380
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,080
"This is the ocean."

381
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,880
I feel like over these years,

382
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,560
I've been like this little fish,

383
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,280
searching for the ocean.

384
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,640
I've worked tirelessly,

385
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,640
trying to become stronger,

386
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,040
because only then

387
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,200
will others not bully me.

388
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,760
But according to your story,

389
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,680
isn't the little fish getting closer

390
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,160
to its ocean?

391
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,200
Not really.

392
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,720
Because the path to success

393
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,000
has no end.

394
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,560
It was only during my return to Fucheng

395
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,240
that I realized

396
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,320
during my time in Shanghai,

397
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,480
I worked relentlessly,

398
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,440
always pushing forward,

399
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,840
but I had forgotten

400
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,600
what I was searching for.

401
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,560
You always make decisions so resolutely,

402
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,600
following your heart,

403
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,560
without even a fallback plan.

404
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,280
Should I call you brave

405
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,960
or crazy?

406
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,960
That's what life means.

407
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,120
Living freely,

408
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,920
and doing what you want.

409
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,480
Loving who you should.

410
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,400
I've truly come to terms with it.

411
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,640
You should be happy for me.

412
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,320
So, have you found the person you love?

413
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,400
I've seen how things have developed

414
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,040
between you and Xiaolu.

415
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,400
Why don't you try

416
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,760
following the call of your heart?

417
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,600
Following what call?

418
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,880
Right.

419
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,480
How are things with Li Guangnan?

420
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,800
Ever since he fell out with Xiaolu,

421
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,120
he's been like a lost soul,

422
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,400
wandering outside every day,

423
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,000
coming home late

424
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,280
with a smell of alcohol.

425
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,200
I really don't understand these two.

426
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,080
They've been brothers for so long.

427
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,440
Why can't they just talk it out?

428
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,320
They've been partners for many years.

429
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,960
Li Guangnan has given a lot.

430
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,160
If it were me,

431
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,400
I'd feel terrible too.

432
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,040
Speaking of giving,

433
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,840
Xiaolu has given the most.

434
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,280
You don't know

435
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,280
how hard he's had it these years.

436
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,040
Big Feet is working outside,

437
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,440
so he's been giving his salary

438
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,840
to Xiaoying,

439
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,880
even when he made no money.

440
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,960
Li Guangnan

441
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,360
is big-handed in his business,

442
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,640
always wanting to invest

443
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,160
with what he's earned for more profits.

444
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,960
He often lost more than what he gained.

445
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,040
In the end, it was always Xiaolu
who took care of his mess.

446
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,360
Sometimes,

447
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,240
I feel he's had it tough,

448
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,280
but he's like someone in a frenzy.

449
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,200
Without Xiaolu,

450
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,520
none of us

451
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,000
would be where we are today.

452
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,600
But both of them are stubborn.

453
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,560
Neither is willing to back down.

454
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,560
Spend more time with Li Guangnan.

455
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,560
After I'm done with my busy days,

456
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,880
I'll invite him for a meal

457
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,720
to make amends.

458
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,520
Yeah.

459
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,520
He's so stubborn.

460
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,400
Left to his own,

461
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,840
he'd come up with nothing.

462
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,000
His birthday is coming.

463
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,760
Let's properly spoil him.

464
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,840
Mr. Huang, you asked me to meet you.

465
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,160
Isn't it because you were interested
in me first?

466
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,680
Looks like you know everything.

467
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,920
Catching mice is no fun.

468
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,320
I like to be straightforward.

469
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,520
Mr. Li,

470
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,320
have some coffee.

471
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,720
Since you like to be straightforward,

472
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,120
let's skip the pretense.

473
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,280
Tell me. What do you need?

474
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,440
Mr. Li, there's no need
to be hostile towards me.

475
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,960
Although you're Lu Xiaolu's partner,

476
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,640
I'm Miss Bai's boss,

477
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,640
and we stand on different sides,

478
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,040
we don't necessarily have to be enemies.

479
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,760
What do you mean?

480
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,560
I'm well aware of your current troubles,

481
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,800
because I face the same troubles.

482
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,760
Why don't we collaborate

483
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,760
to set things back on track?

484
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,040
You mean

485
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,200
you want me to help you
stop their cooperation.

486
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,560
We both understand

487
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,640
their impulsive actions

488
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,160
will result in mutual destruction,

489
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,040
which neither of us

490
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,960
wants to see.

491
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,640
You underestimate them.

492
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,800
Together,

493
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,960
they're like one person.

494
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,480
I can't separate them,

495
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,040
neither can you.

496
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,200
It seems you really understand them.

497
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,800
Compared with my wife,

498
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,240
Lu Xiaolu might be the one
I know more about.

499
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,160
You wouldn't want

500
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,960
all of Xiaolu's efforts over the years

501
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,480
to go to waste, right?

502
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,400
Once this is done,

503
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,440
I'll leave Fucheng with Bai Lan,

504
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,360
but I know your business is expanding.

505
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,120
After it's settled,

506
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,160
I can help you
enter the East China market,

507
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,000
and even

508
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,720
invest in you.

509
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,000
Forget about investing.

510
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,640
It looks like
you invested in a food factory,

511
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,360
but you're really
just interested in the land.

512
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,200
Working with someone like you

513
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,520
would probably cost me sleep.

514
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,920
Mr. Li, that's a fresh perspective.

515
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:17,960
I like it.

516
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,320
Stop pretending.

517
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,760
The food factory has long been defunct.

518
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,360
It's worthless.

519
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,880
It's just that the land is still valuable.

520
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,600
You really think I don't know

521
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,460
that little scheme of yours
with Mayor Bi?

522
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,560
What are your demands?

523
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,880
Don't touch Xiaolu,

524
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,640
or the people at the food factory.

525
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,000
Come on.

526
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,400
I'm just doing business.

527
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,920
It was your men

528
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,150
who hit my master and Lu Xiaolu, right?

529
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,160
You could never

530
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,520
let Xiaolu and Bai Lan
revive the factory.

531
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,680
Just say it outright.

532
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,080
What's your next step?

533
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,040
Are you planning
to remove Xiaolu as an obstacle

534
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,800
or to dismantle the food factory?

535
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,200
That depends on which one
you least want to see.

536
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,560
Give me some time.

537
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,520
I'll help you stop their cooperation.

538
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,680
Good.

539
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,760
I like working with smart people.

540
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,680
Now, Mr. Li,
will you drink the coffee I offered?

541
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,720
Sure.

542
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,640
But

543
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,600
after you acquire the land,

544
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,440
I want permanent leasing rights

545
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,760
to the piece
on the east side of the factory.

546
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,440
I didn't expect it to be so popular.

547
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,280
That land used to belong

548
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,560
to the hottest skating rink in Fucheng,

549
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,920
and it's something I owe someone.

550
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,560
It seems you value your promises.

551
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,160
But sorry,

552
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,240
that land has already been claimed
by someone else.

553
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,120
Then it depends

554
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,920
on whether you think I'm worth it or not.

555
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,760
Are you hungry?

556
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,920
Here, have some water.

557
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,200
You haven't come to see me these days,

558
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,200
nor answered my calls.

559
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,440
What have you been doing?

560
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,080
I've been a bit busy these days.

561
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:25,920
Dajiang,

562
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,240
would you consider

563
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,600
becoming the security manager

564
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,960
at the hotel?

565
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,800
Don't you want to work with me
every day?

566
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,640
I can see you every day
even as a street sweeper.

567
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,040
Being a sanitation worker is so free.

568
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,280
Unless you despise me now.

569
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,120
I...

570
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,320
I don't despise you.

571
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,400
How could I possibly despise you?

572
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,920
I just can't stop worrying about you.

573
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,840
Are you going to
keep hiding things from me?

574
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,280
I run a hotel.

575
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,560
All sorts of people come and go.

576
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,040
What news don't I hear?

577
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,720
That Huang Qing from Shanghai

578
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,880
is going against Xiaolu
with Boss Hu, right?

579
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,680
You're not the person you used to be.

580
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,920
Now, you're no match for Boss Hu.

581
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,680
Huang Qing and Mayor Bi

582
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,800
are his backing.

583
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,680
Xiaolu is no match for them.

584
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,840
But I can't just watch him be bullied.

585
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,240
You're too naive.

586
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,920
Boss Hu is just looking for a chance
to retaliate against you.

587
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,840
Don't deliver yourself to him.

588
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,080
Dajiang,

589
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,200
have you thought about leaving Fucheng

590
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,240
for a different life?

591
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,960
I have a few friends in Southeast Asia

592
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,720
who want me to expand my business there.

593
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,720
I'm thinking of buying a hotel

594
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,520
in Pattaya, Thailand,

595
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,240
and then you can help me run it.

596
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,240
We could get away from Fucheng,

597
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,440
away from Boss Hu and our enemies.
How about that?

598
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,480
What about here?

599
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,800
I've talked to Xiaolu about it.

600
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,320
He fully supports you leaving with me.

601
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,920
Later, I'll gradually

602
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,000
liquidate the assets here.

603
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,800
Do we really have to go?

604
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,000
Yes.

605
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,320
Let's go to a place

606
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,440
where no one knows us,

607
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,640
away from all these grudges.

608
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,440
I believe you'll start to be happy.

609
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,520
Then do me a favor.

610
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,920
Huang Qing is so bold.

611
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,120
Surely, he's in league with Mayor Bi.

612
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,320
I need to know what they're really up to.

613
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,640
You're right.

614
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,800
Sticking with Xiaolu hasn't helped much.

615
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,480
I have to find their weakness.

616
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,680
That's the only way to truly help him.

617
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,720
After this is dealt with,

618
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,520
will you leave?

619
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,120
I've told you.

620
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,880
I won't leave you again.

621
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,360
Wherever you go,

622
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,600
I'll follow.

623
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,160
Mr. Li,

624
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,920
what are you and Mr. Lu up to?

625
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,400
Surely, you two

626
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,680
are not just joking with us, right?

627
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,640
How could that be?

628
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,720
There's something
you might not know yet.

629
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,080
I've split from Mr. Lu.

630
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,400
I stand here today

631
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,720
to represent Shanghai Huaxing Group.

632
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,800
Mr. Huang of Shanghai Huaxing

633
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,720
is about to buy the land
of the food factory

634
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,360
to build the largest

635
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,560
and most luxurious shopping plaza
in Fucheng.

636
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,240
Actually, I know

637
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,600
Mr. Lu asked for your help
with the food factory

638
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,280
to help the workers earn more money,

639
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,760
but this act

640
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,120
has seriously interfered
with the city's plans

641
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,120
for the food factory.

642
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,360
Your endeavor is doomed to fail,

643
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,520
and you won't gain any benefits.

644
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,280
What exactly are you trying to tell us?

645
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,840
It's simple.

646
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,320
Terminate your cooperation
with the food factory.

647
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,800
Of course,

648
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,640
we won't let you walk away empty-handed.

649
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,720
Mr. Huang has said

650
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,120
that if you agree
to terminate the cooperation,

651
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,440
when the shopping plaza opens,

652
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,840
if you want to rent a shop,

653
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,920
you'll receive a substantial discount.

654
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,360
And

655
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,800
Mr. Huang has prepared 200,000 yuan.

656
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,840
If you agree today

657
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,320
to terminate the cooperation,

658
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,560
you can take the money right away.

659
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,440
Mr. Li,

660
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,920
you're really

661
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,400
undermining Mr. Lu here.

662
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,040
No, no, no.

663
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,840
I'm saving him.

664
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,880
Even if you team up,

665
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,480
you're destined
to lose against Mr. Huang.

666
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,680
If you still remember

667
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,200
the good Mr. Lu once did for you,

668
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,680
then don't hurt him anymore.

669
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,760
Mr. Li,

670
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,240
we've already promised Mr. Lu,

671
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,640
remembering his kindness to us,

672
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,920
so we won't do anything dishonorable.

673
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,760
Don't speak so absolutely.

674
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,080
We're all businessmen here.

675
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,760
Who doesn't want to make money?

676
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,600
Today, we're not making it hard for you.

677
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,520
If you agree,

678
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,960
this crisp 10,000 yuan

679
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,400
is yours to take immediately.

680
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,120
Mr. Li,

681
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,120
whatever personal grievances

682
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,400
you have with Mr. Lu

683
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,440
are none of our business,

684
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:14,960
but a man's promise

685
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,200
is worth its weight in gold.

686
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,120
We can't just back out

687
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,840
of our agreement with Mr. Lu.

688
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,240
- Yes, exactly.
- Right.

689
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,840
- Makes sense.
- So,

690
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,720
we definitely can't

691
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,440
take this money.

692
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,880
We can't accept it.

693
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,800
Mr. Li,

694
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,960
in this world,

695
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,920
the word "'honor''

696
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,560
must be engraved in our hearts.

697
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,720
Honor?

698
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,000
Are you all blind?

699
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,200
Turning down easy money?

700
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,640
Are you mad?

701
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,480
Mr. Li,

702
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,200
sorry,

703
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,800
but this is money

704
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,360
we can't afford to enjoy.

705
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,200
- Right. Let's go.
- Let's leave.

706
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,960
Don't just drink.

707
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,240
It's bad for your stomach.

708
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,200
If it hurts, it hurts.

709
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,080
I probably won't live
many more years anyway.

710
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,440
Stop saying that.

711
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,960
Nonsense.

712
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,200
You're not that old.

713
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,280
You still have to contribute to society.

714
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,160
Contribute?

715
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,400
The factory is nearly gone.

716
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,760
What contributions can I make?

717
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,880
China is so big.

718
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,120
You can contribute anywhere.

719
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,040
Why stick to this broken factory?

720
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,760
You don't understand.

721
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,040
When I was this tall,

722
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,360
I entered this factory.

723
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,560
I've touched every machine,

724
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,440
every pipe,

725
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,960
every valve,

726
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,600
every switch

727
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,560
in the factory.

728
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,600
For decades,

729
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,400
I've watched them

730
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,400
from shining bright

731
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,480
to rusty now.

732
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,000
They're broken

733
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,400
and leaking.

734
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,600
Whenever it's windy and rainy,

735
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,360
I seem to hear them calling to me,

736
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,840
"Master Niu,

737
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,520
come,

738
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,800
and have a drink."

739
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,600
Dad,

740
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,440
I need to talk to you.

741
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,160
Just talk.

742
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,840
Why are you taking my cup?

743
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,760
You know

744
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:16,880
that Xiaolu

745
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,640
merged his business with the factory,

746
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,320
and because of this, he and Li fell out.

747
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,320
Logically,

748
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,720
I support Li,

749
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,120
but emotionally,

750
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,880
I can't blame Xiaolu.

751
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,040
He's not wrong,

752
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,680
and he just did

753
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,240
what many people wish to do

754
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,680
but dare not.

755
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,280
But being caught in the middle,

756
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,160
I feel really down.

757
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,640
So, I talked it over with Big Feet,

758
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,760
and we've decided to leave Fucheng.

759
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,640
You can go wherever you want.

760
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,280
No one is stopping you.

761
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,800
I want you to leave with us.

762
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,920
How can I leave you here alone?

763
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,840
I was born in Fucheng,

764
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,640
grew up in Fucheng,

765
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,120
and I'll die in Fucheng.

766
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,520
Dad...

767
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,720
With the factory facing such difficulties,

768
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,240
you expect me to leave?

769
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,600
I can't do it.

770
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,000
- Dad.
- I...

771
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,280
It's about to rain.

772
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,920
I need to go check on the factory.

773
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,640
You've just had a drink.

774
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,480
It's okay.

775
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,560
I'm fine.

776
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,160
You old fool,

777
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,600
if I wasn't afraid of you
being bullied again,

778
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,240
do you think I'd want to leave Fucheng?

779
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,600
Something's wrong!

780
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,640
Hurry!

781
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,640
Master Niu,

782
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,640
someone's trying to smash
our golden peacock statue!

783
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,200
Smash it!

784
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,080
- What are you doing?
- Stop!

785
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,200
Get down from there!

786
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,200
Stop! Stop!

787
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,160
What are you doing?

788
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,120
Hurry down!

789
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,880
Who are you guys?

790
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,080
What unit are you from?

791
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,000
What does it matter to you
who I am, which unit I'm from?

792
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,720
- I...
- The factory's shut down.

793
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,960
Why do you need this thing anyway?

794
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,800
Smash it!

795
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,800
Stop! What are you doing?

796
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,400
What are you doing?

797
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Don't hit anyone!

798
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,120
Stop messing around!

799
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,000
We have orders from our leaders.

800
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,160
The whole factory has to be demolished.

801
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,240
It's no use resisting.

802
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,480
Which leader said that?

803
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,760
Name them.

804
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,040
Which leader?

805
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,280
- Try smashing it!
- Stop!

806
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,760
I'm telling you.

807
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,000
If you dare smash it again,

808
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,960
today you won't leave

809
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,840
without severe injuries.

810
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,480
- Right!
- Watch your stick!

811
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,800
I'm telling you the truth.

812
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,200
The Golden Peacock Food Factory,

813
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,640
this broken factory,

814
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,640
is going to be demolished
to build a shopping plaza.

815
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,480
Plaza?

816
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,000
If it's not today,

817
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,760
it'll be demolished tomorrow.

818
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,050
You can continue this commotion.

819
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,520
There's a reason

820
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,720
behind your failure.

821
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,720
Let's go.

822
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:57,960
- Get out!
- Get out!

823
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,000
- Don't be afraid!
- Get out of here!

824
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,280
They came to deliver a message.

825
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,520
We weren't raised to be scared.

826
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,960
Mr. Ma,

827
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,640
we probably need to keep someone
at the workshop overnight.

828
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,600
- Right.
- Otherwise,

829
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,640
these kids will cause trouble.

830
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,700
There's nothing else we can do.

831
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,480
- Okay, I'll go notify everyone now.
- Sure.

832
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,280
You guys keep an eye on the main gate.

833
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,120
Alright.

834
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,960
You two go up and check.

835
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,240
If anything's loose,

836
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,280
secure it.

837
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,000
Otherwise, it could fall
and hurt someone.

838
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,560
- Alright, Master.
- Go and check.
