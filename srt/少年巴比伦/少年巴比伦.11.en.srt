That's right.

135
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,280

Do you still take this place
as your home?

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,280
is where my cousin used to live.

190
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,720
He's not here anymore,

191
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,360
so it's under my care now.

192
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,560
You can stay here without worry.

193
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,080
No one will bother you.

194
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,760
Lu Xiaolu...

195
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,360
Stop.

196
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,320
Don't thank me.

197
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,480
I won't listen.

198
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,440
I'm afraid of your thanks.

199
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,280
Then let me buy you a drink.

200
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,680
Sure.

201
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,120
Rock, paper, scissors.

202
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,360
Again.

203
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,440
Rock, paper, scissors.

204
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,840
Finally, I won.

205
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,960
Okay, okay, fine.

206
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,520
It's my turn to lose one round.

207
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,560
Then let me ask you a question.

208
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,440
When was the last time you wet the bed?

209
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,560
That's too far back.

210
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,560
I really don't remember.

211
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,200
Let me think.

212
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,360
I only remember
when I was in elementary school,

213
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,000
the first time Li Guangnan

214
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,880
went to a fight with me.

215
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,720
Guess what happened?

216
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,560
He got scared and wet his pants.

217
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,760
You remember him wetting his pants,

218
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,240
but you don't remember you doing that?

219
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,720
I really don't remember.

220
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,360
If you don't believe me, ask another one.

221
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,280
If that's too far back,

222
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,400
I'll ask something more recent.

223
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,040
Bring it on.

224
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,280
I'll answer truthfully.

225
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,080
I was the one who hit him,

226
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,960
but you're the one being punished.

227
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,880
Why didn't you ask anything?

228
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,920
If you're determined to go to Shanghai,

229
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,320
then all I can do

230
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,600
is support you.

231
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,760
Weren't you afraid
that I might betray you?

232
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,840
When the police asked me to choose,

233
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,000
what if I chose myself?

234
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,680
You wouldn't.

235
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,920
Why?

236
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,400
Because I'm sure I won't betray you.

237
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,840
So, I'm equally sure
that you won't betray me.

238
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,160
It's that simple.

239
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,320
I'll unconditionally
support all your choices.

240
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,280
Including going to Shanghai?

241
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,600
You are leaving this place

242
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,520
for the life you want.

243
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,840
But I

244
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,520
don't even know

245
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,360
what I want.

246
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,600
What reason would I have
to stop you from leaving?

247
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,440
Everyone chooses

248
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,640
their own path.

249
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,120
No one has the right

250
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,880
to stop others from choosing their path,

251
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,600
no matter how much they like them.

252
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,760
So, ask me a question.

253
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,920
Sure,

254
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,480
what question?

255
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,760
Ask me,

256
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,760
"Bai Lan,

257
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,320

Hey, Bai Lan.

287
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,520
Director Bi,

288
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,880
I left the documents you asked me

289
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,200
to translate on your desk.

290
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,760
Good.

291
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,360
Hey, Bai,

292
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,400
how's your work at the SLI Bureau?

293
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,240
Are you getting used to it?

294
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,780
I'm quite used to it.

295
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,240
Good.

296
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,380
If you encounter
any difficulties in the future,

297
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,280
just come to me

298
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,120
without hesitation.

299
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,800
Sure.

300
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,920

(Let's meet at the park after work. Bai Lan)

302
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:16,240
(Vice Director's Office)

303
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,280
Bai Lan, you're early.

304
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,640
This place is nice.

305
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,680
The scenery is beautiful

306
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,600
and it's quiet.

307
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,120
- Director Bi.
- Oh, don't call me Director Bi.

308
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,360
That's too formal.

309
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:46,520
Just call me Bi.

310
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,040
- Bi.
- That's right.

311
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,520
Regarding Ding Dezhong's matter,

312
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,160
I want to thank you in person.

313
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,920
Look at you being so polite again.

314
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,680
This matter,

315
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,600
I did it willingly for you.

316
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,840
Besides,

317
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:02,960
I'm very happy about

318
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,000
you inviting me here today.

319
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,440
I understand your intentions,

320
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,480
but after all,

321
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,320
you have a wife.

322
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,120
Oh,

323
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,240
if this matter
is making you uncomfortable,

324
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,680
to be honest,

325
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,880
this marriage

326
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,360
has been

327
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,880
torture for me.

328
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,440
I've been trying to end it.

329
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,040
Don't worry.

330
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,260
I won't let you

331
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,600
become a mistress.

332
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,720
But what if your wife
doesn't agree to divorce?

333
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,520
I heard that

334
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,240
old comrades like you

335
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,760
often deceive young girls.

336
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,560
I don't know how others deceive them,

337
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,400
but

338
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,520
I promise

339
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,280
I'll never deceive you.

340
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,120
We've come this far.

341
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,560
She has to agree.

342
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,640
When you say things like this,

343
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,840
you don't sound like a leader at all.

344
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,360
Leaders can't always

345
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,960
have a serious face, right?

346
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,600
I'm a cheerful,

347
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,200
sincere,

348
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,440
and humorous leader.

349
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,640
In Fucheng,

350
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,750
only I am

351
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,200
worthy of you.

352
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,880
Secretary Bi,

353
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,480
show yourself.

354
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,160
You heard all that, right?

355
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,640
Secretary Bi received the same note

356
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,240
as the one you received today.

357
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,160
Why would you do this?

358
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,120
I do want to go to Shanghai,

359
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,560
but I don't need you to do this.

360
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,760
Trying to bribe me with

361
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,440
this piece of paper won't work.

362
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,320
Bai Lan,

363
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,920
you shouldn't act like this.

364
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,040
It's too much.

365
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,480
You too!

366
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,160
- You jerk!
- Xiaolu!

367
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,200
Xiaolu!

368
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,720
You old jerk!

369
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,800
Lu Xiaolu! Lu Xiaolu!

370
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,320
- Xiaolu!
- Don't forget you just

371
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,160
got out of jail.

372
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,920
If you go back in,
you won't get out easily.

373
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,800
Xiaolu, let's go.

374
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,160
I'm sick of arguing with them.

375
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,440
Let's go.

376
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,240
No wonder the police let us go so easily.

377
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,160
Now I understand everything.

378
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,760
Does it hurt?

379
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,240
I'm fine.

380
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,240
I should've killed those jerks.

381
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,440
After all that's happened,
don't you understand?

382
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,560
Even if we beat them up,
what will change?

383
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,560
Here, we can't change anything.

384
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,960
(New Year's Celebration)

385
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,080
Isn't that the banner from last year?

386
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,000
That character is missing a stroke,

387
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,880
and you're still using it.

388
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,520
The factory won't pay for a new one.

389
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,840
What can we do?

390
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,960
Well, at least fix that missing stroke.

391
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,800
I think

392
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,440
we should let the leaders see it first.

393
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,120
Attention, everyone.

394
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,600
At 2:30 this afternoon,

395
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,840
all staff are required in the auditorium

396
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,880
for the New Year's recognition ceremony.

397
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,000
There will be important announcements.

398
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,800
Attendance is mandatory.

399
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,000
Hey, this can't be about announcing

400
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,480
no year-end bonuses again this year,
can it?

401
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,400
I...

402
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,400
What do we do now?

403
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,850
(Gongyuan Golden Peacock Food Factory
New Year's Recognition Ceremony)

404
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,840
Another new year has arrived.

405
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,430
On behalf of our factory's leadership team,

406
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,620
I extend New Year's blessings

407
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,700
to all employees and their families.

408
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,000
Great!

409
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,360
At the same time, we thank
Secretary Hong for taking office

410
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,760
and leading our Fucheng Food Factory

411
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,200
to make new achievements.

412
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,240
Nice!

413
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,320
What's the use of blessings?

414
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,120
When are we getting our year-end bonuses?

415
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,120
Yeah!

416
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,000
Don't just give us

417
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,200
towels and soap again.

418
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,680
That's right.

419
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,120
- Right.
- Enough.

420
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,480
Everyone, please quiet down.

421
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,960
Let me reiterate the issue of discipline.

422
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,840
Discipline

423
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,520
is crucial for production.

424
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,080
For those who disregard factory rules

425
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,600
and act recklessly,

426
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,360
we must offer serious criticism.

427
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,440
Why criticize people during the New Year?

428
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,720
Stop talking nonsense

429
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,480
and just give us
our year-end bonuses already.

430
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,320
Unbelievable.

431
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,200
That's right.

432
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,760
It's ridiculous.

433
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,560
Now, let me call out names.

434
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,980
Kang Dali from the boiler room

435
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,920
Here!

in the cake department.

437
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,120
- Good for you.
- Wu Hongjun from maintenance

438
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,560
played cards during work hours.

439
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,320
Chen Guowei from maintenance

440
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,640
stole materials from the factory

441
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,240
and produced substandard products.

442
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,120
I didn't do it.

443
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,400
Li Guangnan from maintenance

444
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,440
engaged in sideline activities
without reporting them.

445
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,880
- You're smart.
- After the factory's deliberation,

446
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,000
the aforementioned individuals

447
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,240
will have 50%
of their year-end bonuses deducted.

448
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,160
The total amount is only 20.8 yuan.

449
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,240
And now 50% is deducted.

450
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,400
We may as well play more rounds of poker.

451
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,560
- Exactly.
- That's right.

452
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,520
Why bother working?

453
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,480
Also,

454
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,880
Lu Xiaolu from the warehouse

455
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,560
was absent without reason,

456
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,080
caused disturbances,

457
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,960
assaulted superiors,
and sought personal revenge.

458
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,120
He has done all kinds of evil deeds.

459
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,320
Therefore, 100% of his year-end bonus
will be deducted.

460
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,120
- Is Lu Xiaolu here?
- There are too many sacks today.

461
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,770
He went to shower and will be here soon.

462
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,720
Bring him here now.

463
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,760
We can't have him
coming here naked, right?

464
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,360
Everyone, quiet down.

465
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,800
Do you all see that?

466
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,480
Since Lu Xiaolu

467
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,920
was transferred to the warehouse,

468
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,880
he has continued to disregard factory rules

469
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,560
and act recklessly.

470
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,120
Although he escaped

471
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,640
imprisonment this time,

472
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,760
with his

473
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,960
current behavior,

474
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,280
his future prospects
are undoubtedly bleak.

475
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,680
I hope everyone
won't be influenced by him

476
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,520
and will learn from this lesson.

477
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,040
There's another person

478
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:03,960
who is even more

479
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,040
hopeless and stubborn

480
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,440
than Lu Xiaolu,

481
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,520
and that's Bai Lan from the medical room.

482
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,640
Bai Lan has

483
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,480
chaotic relationships,

484
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,200
and moral corruption,

485
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,960
bringing extremely negative impacts

486
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,120
on our factory and society.

487
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,280
After discussion by the factory leadership,

488
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,040
Bai Lan will be suspended indefinitely
without pay,

489
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,320
effective immediately.

490
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,280
Now,

491
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,800
those who were named,

492
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,840
come up and reflect deeply.

493
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,680
Did Director Bi instruct you to say this?

494
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,200
Of course not.

495
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,720
What does this have to do
with Director Bi?

496
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,360
This conclusion was reached jointly

497
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,760
by our factory and the police station.

498
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,120
Let me ask you,

499
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,440
were you alone with Lu Dajiang

500
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,360
before his arrest?

501
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,480
Yes, I was.

502
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,280
So what?

503
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,120
Does that prove

504
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,240
my chaotic relationships?

505
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,200
Isn't it obvious?

506
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,880
Ding,

507
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,960
stop accusing others.

508
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,960
Talk about yourself.

509
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,160
What happened between you

510
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,280
and Afang on the balcony?

511
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,480
Yeah, tell us about that.

512
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,400
You...

513
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,120
I was wrongly accused.

514
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,040
Always blaming others.

515
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,240
- Xiaolu?
- He finished showering?

516
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,520
Esteemed leaders,

517
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,080
comrades,

518
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,600
I must reflect deeply.

519
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,960
Since being transferred to the warehouse,

520
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,160
I've been carrying bags

521
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,970
and reflecting on myself.

522
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,400
Indeed,

523
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,050
I shouldn't have skipped work
without reason,

524
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,440
insulted my superiors,

525
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,640
or resorted to violence to solve problems.

526
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,640
But what's worse

527
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,120
is letting the villains succeed,

528
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,050
allowing the wrongdoers to prevail,

529
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,480
and leaving the bullied without justice.

530
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:53,960
As the saying goes,

531
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,360
to err is human,

532
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,400
to forgive divine.

533
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,680
So today, I'm here

534
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,480
to rectify my grave mistakes.

535
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,560
- Lu Xiaolu!
- What are you doing?

536
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,320
- Come down here!
- Security!

537
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,320
What are you doing?

538
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,800
Where's the security team?

539
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,560
What do you want?

540
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,240
Have some rest.

541
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,480
Let's go up and reflect.

542
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,760
What are you doing?

543
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,880
What are you doing?

544
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,840
Let me tell you,

545
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,640
if you stand with Lu Xiaolu,

546
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,160
I'll discipline all of you together.

547
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,520
I beat my superiors up,

548
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,960
punish me!

549
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,040
Sorry, leaders.

550
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,720
I not only harassed young girls

551
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,720
but also dated them during work hours.

552
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:44,960
Ding Dezhong,

00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
what did your mother feed you?

554
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,720
I insulted you, so what?

555
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,320
I stole bricks from the factory

556
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,320
to build a house.

557
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:01,280

Don't care about

Big Feet, and Little Pouter.

Even if you can't

589
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,040
got to Shanghai to study,

590

as long as we're here,

591
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,320
no one will dare to bully you.

592
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,280
Staying here

593
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,520
means forever under the oppressive rule

594
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,000
of Director Bi and people like him.

595
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,320
Only by going to a bigger world

596
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,160
will you find freedom.

597
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,600
I can't stand it here anymore.

598
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,440
Regardless,

599
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,360
I will leave this place.

600
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,520
Would you like to leave with me?

601
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,720
I...

602
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,320
Actually,

603
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,680
regardless of your answer,

604
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,460
I want to tell you that

605
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,340
although I don't want to stay in Fucheng,

606
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,840
meeting you here will be

607
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,040
the most unforgettable experience for me.

608
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,760
Dajiang,

609
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,120
it's almost New Year.

610
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:24,960
I came to see you.

611
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,120
How's your leg?

612
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,840
It's okay. The doctor said
it'll take one or two months to heal.

613
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,680
Good.

614
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:32,960
I hope you recover soon.

615
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:37,880
Dajiang,

616
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,240
did they find out your involvement

617
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,080
with the Hong Kong underworld?

618
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,080
I made all that up.

619
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,520
You made that up?

620
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,480
I worked on a cruise ship in Hong Kong

621
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,320
as a waiter.

622
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,120
It's just that everyone watched
too many Hong Kong movies

623
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,050
and thought
I was involved with the triads.

624
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,600
They were scared to death of me.

625
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,080
But I don't mind.

626
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,800
It saved me a lot of trouble.

627
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,000
Oh my.

628
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,040
So you haven't been involved in that?

629
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,760
I've been reflecting recently.

630
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,200
Let me tell you something.

631
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,480
When I came back from Hong Kong,

632
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,520
I had some money in my pocket

633
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,480
and thought I could make

634
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,480
something happen in Fucheng

635
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,080
and give you a better life.

636
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,560
But now

637
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,200
I can't even hold onto a skating rink.

638
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,520
So I understood one thing.

639
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,200
The factory will only get worse.

640
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,840
That's why you need
to think of another way out.

641
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,200
You're smarter than me.

642
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,480
Don't end up like me.

643
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,520
Dajiang,

644
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,320
if I can't come to see you often
in the future,

645
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,600
will you be mad at me?

646
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,640
Where do you want to go?

647
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,480
I haven't decided yet.

648
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,000
Just talking casually.

649
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,280
You are not talking casually.

650
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,400
If you want to stay in the factory,

651
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,440
you will either become like me

652
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,640
or like Ding Dezhong.

653
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,920
Who do you want to become?

654
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,200
Alright, time's up.

655
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,400
You're not like me.

656
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,840
You've gone to high school,

657
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,200
you're educated.

658
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:31,960
Anyway,

659
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,040
you need to go out and explore.

660
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,320
Alright.

661
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,440
When I get out,

662
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,840
if you're still here,

663
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,100
I'll beat you up.

664
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,520
Enough, time's up.

665
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,360
Did you hear me?

666
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:42,920
Hurry up.

667
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,000
Time is up.

668
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,040
Xiaoying,

669
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,400
when will that dish be ready?

670
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,880
Oh, right away.

671
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,640
Only one dish to go.

672
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,840
Xiaolu's favorite fried liver.

673
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,040
Xiaolu?

674
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,120
Who said Xiaolu was coming?

675
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,480
Didn't you say you have a disciple

676
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,620
coming to spend New Year's with us?

677
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,540
Besides Xiaolu, who else could it be?

678
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,720
Master.

679
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,680
Master,

680
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,760
happy New Year.

681
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,320
Xiaoying, happy New Year.

682
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:31,960
It's him.

683
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,720
How come it's you?

684
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,400
Sorry, I'm late.

685
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,000
Why are you glaring at me?

686
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,600
Xiaolu is spending New Year's at home.

687
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,440
Why call him?

688
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,120
Big Feet isn't coming home this year.

689
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,960
Can't let him spend New Year's alone.

690
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,160
Stop drinking.

691
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,400
I...

692
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,320
Dad,

693
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,640
Mom,

694
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,080
how are you both?

695
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:24,960
It's New Year.

696
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:33,000
It's a bit cold in Fucheng this winter,

697
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,120
but don't worry.

698
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,040
I have enough money

699
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,440
and clothes.

700
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,440
This year, I was promoted,

701
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,360
and my salary increased
by a few dozen yuan.

702
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,360
I've grown up

703
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,120
and can support myself.

704
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,320
I just...

705
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,520
I just miss you all.

706
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,720
It's really nice.

707
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,680
Your dad's cooking has improved.

708
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,200
Not bad.

709
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,000
Thank you, honey.

710
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,480
Come on,

711
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,840
let's eat.

712
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,920
It's just that Dajiang

713
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,040
is not with us, every year

714
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,440
he used to come to our house
for New Year's Eve dinner.

715
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,480
I don't know how he'll have

716
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,640
New Year's Eve dinner tonight.

717
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,480
How about this?

718
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,200
What?

719
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,560
I'll find a picture of Dajiang

720
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,680
and put it here.
And I'll give him a red envelope.

721
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,960
It'll feel like we're eating together.

722
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,560
- Isn't that nice?
- What is wrong

723
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,920
with you?

724
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,720
Dajiang is just in prison.

725
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,200
If you prepare him tableware

726
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,080
and put his picture here,

727
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,200
it will look like

728
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,280
he's already...

729
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,360
Oh my goodness.

730
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,840
This is bad luck on New Year.

731
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,840
Alright, forget it, forget it.

732
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,680
Let's not do that.

733
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,960
- Look at your dad...
- Well...

734
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,040
Eat, Xiaolu.

735
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,760
Here,

736
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,640
Xiaolu.

737
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,280
I need to say something.

738
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,640
See what happened

739
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,080
to your cousin?

740
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,560
Is his situation good?

741
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,280
Even if

742
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,880
Ding Dezhong's wrong,

743
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,200
you guys can't confront him head-on.

744
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,160
It's like hitting a rock with an egg.

745
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,800
And

746
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:53,960
that Bai Lan,

747
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,320
why is she

748
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,360
suspended?

749
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,440
Just because she has a strong personality

750
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,600
and offended the leaders.

751
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,400
But she's a

752
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,200
university graduate.

753
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,360
She can find a job anywhere.

754
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,600
You're different.

755
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,600
You need to be more low-key.

756
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,640
You still have to stay in the factory,

757
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,800
right?

758
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,560
Dad,

759
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:16,960
Mom,

760
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,960
what if I can't stay there anymore?

761
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,840
What are you saying?

762
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,400
If you don't stay in the factory,

763
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,240
where will you go?

764
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,480
I can do maintenance work.

765
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,640
I can be an electrician.

766
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,080
I won't starve anywhere.

767
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,120
If all else fails,

768
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,240
I'll repeat a year

769
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,050
and try the college entrance exam again.

770
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,400
Hey,

771
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,640
why are you bringing up old things?

772
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,320
It was you
who refused to go to university.

773
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,710
And now you want to do that?

774
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,410
Let me tell you,

775
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,590
when you refused to repeat a year,

776
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,200
I was really upset.

777
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,040
I...

778
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,400
Alright,

779
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,440
let's stop.

780
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,160
I've

781
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,040
figured it out now.

782
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,400
I've talked with your dad.

783
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,920
Your job in the factory

784
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,440
is stable.

785
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,440
You can get a salary anyway,

786
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,640
right?

787
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,240
If you work harder

788
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,040
and be a shiftleader at maintenance,

789
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,120
find a good girl,

790
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,560
get married

791
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,800
and have some children,

792
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,160
your dad and I

793
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,560
will be so happy

794
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,280
and satisfied,

795
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,640
right?

796
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,680
Hey, Xiaolu.

797
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:20,880
Xiaolu,

798
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,520
your mom said this for your own good.

799
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,840
I know,

800
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,640
I'm just feeling stifled.

801
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,040
I want to go out for a walk.

802
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,440
Look at this child.

803
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,000
Where are you going?

804
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:38,530
Where are you...

805
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,680
Eat this.

806
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,400
Thanks.

807
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,120
It's still warm.

808
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,560
Oh, by the way,

809
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,000
after you finish eating,

810
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,840
use my card

811
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,200
to call your parents again.

812
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,400
I think you didn't get through just now.

813
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,240
It's not about the card.

814
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,280
I don't even have their numbers.

815
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,080
How can I call them?

816
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,000
Actually, when I was very young,

817
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,600
my parents divorced

818
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,160
and sent me to my uncle's house

819
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,080
because my cousin is mentally ill.

820
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,400
My uncle

821
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,160
agreed to adopt me.

822
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,600
If it weren't for my uncle,

823
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,560
I'd be homeless now.

824
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,240
I've known you for so long,

825
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:26,050
and this is the first time
I've heard you say these things.

826
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,960
Don't talk nonsense.

827
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,920
You don't know anything.

828
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,840
If anyone else knows it,

829
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,800
you're finished.

830
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,480
I didn't hear anything you said just now.

831
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:41,880
That's more like it.

832
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,560
Little Pouter,

833
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,480
there's something I want to tell you.

834
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,840
Qin Juan,

835
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,920
if you ever feel wronged again,

836
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,720
don't make a fake phone call.

837
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,560
Treat me as your phone booth

838
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,280
and let me be your family,

839
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,200
okay?

840
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,000
Did I say something wrong?

841
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,480
From now on, you'll have family.

842
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,320
Okay.

843
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,960
- Cheers!
- To you, Master.

844
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:07,840
Eat.

845
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,680
Eat.

846
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,320
Oh, silly kid.

847
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:15,920
Why are you not eating?

848
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:16,840
I'm not hungry.

849
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:17,840
Well...

850
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,040
Xiaoying, how about this?

851
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,480
I brought a lot of things

852
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,320
including firecrackers.

853
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,480
After you eat something,

854
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,420
why don't you go find Xiaolu
and set off some fireworks?

855
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,160
Really?

856
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,160
Go, go, go.

857
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,880
I'll watch the Spring Festival Gala.
Just go.

858
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,030
You should eat something first.

859
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:37,880
I don't want to.

860
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,200
- Let's go.
- I'll bring you a drumstick.

861
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,120
I don't want it.

862
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:43,840
Have some.

863
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,120
Why did you bring me here?

864
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,480
When I was little,

865
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,600
my cousin always brought me here to play.

866
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,840
The big bridge wasn't there back then.

867
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,640
When we were feeling down,

868
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,200
we'd look at the sky

869
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:11,440
and watch the seagulls.

870
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,400
It felt like we could fly as high as them.

871
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,380
When the college entrance exam ended,

872
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,240
it was also here

873
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:19,720
when he asked me

874
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:21,920
what kind of life I wanted in the future.

875
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,800
What did you say?

876
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,240
I said

877
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,280
I wanted to be like him.

878
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,080
But he told me

879
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,480
life isn't a movie.

880
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,840
It's much harder than that.

881
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,260
Now I think I understand a bit.

882
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,680
If you hadn't met me,

883
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,600
maybe you would have passed the exam

884
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:54,920
and become a university student.

885
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,640
But then I might have
skipped class every day,

886
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:00,840
got into trouble all the time,

887
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:01,880
and not studied well.

888
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,120
Maybe I would have

889
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,160
even dated

890
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:06,560
a pretty female university student.

891
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,680
But then I wouldn't have met you.

892
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:11,240
You're dreaming.

893
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,800
Actually, my cousin was right.

894
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,600
I couldn't become another him.

895
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,840
I should go out and explore the world.

896
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:27,920
Bai Lan, do you know?

897
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:30,600
Before I met you,

898
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,120
I never imagined my future.

899
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,320
It was your letter

900
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,080
that opened a new window for me.

901
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:41,920
It made me realize that

902
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,600
life could have a different path.

903
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,200
You told me that

904
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,040
you didn't come to Fucheng for me,

905
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:54,920
but I want to tell you that

906
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,080
the reason I'm leaving Fucheng

907
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,280
is because of you.
