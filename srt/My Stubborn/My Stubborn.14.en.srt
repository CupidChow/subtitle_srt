1
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,960
Hey, you.

2
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,440
Hm?

3
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,320
So, about you dating Hia Sorn…

4
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,320
Does the whole office really know?

5
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,720
Yeah, they all know. Hia Sorn went and told Korn, even though I told him again and again not to.

6
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:08,720
That’s good, though. You’ve been with him so long better to make it official so people stop bothering both of you and besides…

7
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,920
I don’t know how anyone couldn’t see it.

8
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,760
You and Hia Sorn are glued together.

9
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,640
No way that’s just “brothers.”

10
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,000
Ugh…

11
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,840
But at the office…

12
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,640
Hia Sorn and I…

13
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,720
We barely even talk.

14
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,720
Mostly just argue.

15
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,120
You guys have been together a while. Has it been a year yet?

16
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,640
Since he asked me out? Next week will be a year.

17
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,400
Whoa.

18
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,320
That’s pretty fast.

19
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,640
You’re his boyfriend, and you even moved in with him.

20
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,560
Hia Sorn should be proposing to you already, right?

21
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,520
What the hell are you even saying?

22
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,520
alking nonsense.

23
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,880
I’m just saying what I see.

24
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,600
Marriage is important, you know.

25
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,080
The law’s passed too.

26
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,640
If he’s serious about you, he’ll have to propose.

27
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:24,320
Honestly, I feel like Sorn and I are happy with our life right now. I don’t see why we need to rush to that step.

28
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,440
Or maybe he’s not serious about you?

29
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,480
Maybe he’s tired of taking care of you.

30
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,880
I mean, you’re living in his house.

31
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,200
Do you actually do anything for him?

32
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:46,920
I do plenty. Housework, helping him with work, splitting utilities I pull my weight.

33
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,960
I mean, like… other stuff. Taking care of him.

34
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,079
Did you get it done?

35
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,520
Take care of him how?

36
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:07,560
Like when he comes home tired, I massage his shoulders and cook for him…

37
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,560
Or just little things like that.

38
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,840
You sound like an expert. Where’d you learn this?

39
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,880
I watch too many dramas.

40
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,920
Damn.

41
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,680
You really just talk nonsense.

42
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,920
No, I’m serious.

43
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,720
Stuff like this matters.

44
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,200
If you do it…

45
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,320
I guarantee…

46
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,280
Hia Sorn will be head over heels for you.

47
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,280
Who knows…

48
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,640
On your anniversary…

49
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,600
He might even propose.

50
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,800
You’re talking impossible.

51
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,360
Order food.

52
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,000
You’re the one who won’t stop talking.

53
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,520
What?

54
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,600
Hmph.

55
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,400
Hey.

56
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,560
Hm?

57
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,200
The person behind you.

58
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,080
Doesn’t their face look familiar?

59
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,400
Feels like I’ve seen them somewhere before.

60
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,280
I don’t know.

61
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,920
No, I really recognize them.

62
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,520
You’re imagining things.

63
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,560
Is he following you?

64
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,400
I saw him secretly staring at you over there.

65
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,680
Maybe he likes you?

66
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,000
Damn it, how do you even come up with that?

67
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,840
Talking nonsense.

68
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,000
Hmph

69
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,080
Well, you’ve gotten better-looking. Not weird if someone likes you.

70
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,680
What the hell are you saying, huh?

71
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,760
Say it again and I won’t talk to you anymore.

72
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,760
Are you ordering food or not?

73
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,680
Scolding me again. Are you mad?

74
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,440
There, there. Don’t be mad, okay?

75
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,159
If you pout, I won’t let you see.

76
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,480
I mean it I won’t let you see.

77
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,880
Are you making it up to me yet?

78
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,880
Then I won’t let you eat.

79
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,360
You’re paying, right?

80
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,280
Yeah, sure.

81
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,320
Really?

82
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,240
Really.

83
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,320
Then let’s do it, my dear friend.

84
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,240
But don’t stay mad at me.

85
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,600
Yeah.

86
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:10,000
When you stayed at my place, did you ever do anything for me… like cooking?

87
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,200
Mmm.

88
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,680
Hmm?

89
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,040
Is it good?

90
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:29,480
Mm-hmm

91
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,720
Want another bite?

92
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,480
It’s good.

93
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,840
This dipping sauce is so tasty.

94
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,560
You ate so messy.

95
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,600
Should I add anything else, Hia?

96
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,000
Want me to add something?

97
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,440
What’s wrong with you?

98
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,640
Nothing’s wrong.

99
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,560
Don’t you like me taking care of you like this?

100
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,920
There’s no way I wouldn’t like that, Jun.

101
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,559
I’m just afraid that… you’ll get bored of me.

102
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,039
I’ll never get bored of your weirdness.

103
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,520
Feed me one more bite.

104
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,440
It’s hot.

105
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,600
Blow on it for me.

106
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,800
See the steam?

107
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,080
Whoa, you blew too hard now it’s all your spit.

108
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,200
Mmm

109
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,040
Nom nom.If you want it, you have to eat it yourself.

110
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,800
No way I’m feeding you

111
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,800
Why not?

112
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,640
Feed me, will you

113
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,840
Pleeease.

114
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,880
Who should this piece of pork go to, I wonder?

115
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,280
Who would it belong to…?

116
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,480
Come on, act cute for me.

117
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,920
Whoever acts cute gets to eat it.

118
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,200
Can I have this piece of pork, please?

119
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,000
I don’t see you being cute at all.

120
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,760
Can you be even cuter for me?

121
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,160
May I have a bite of the pork?

122
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:12,880
Please.

123
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,800
Pleeeease.

124
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,960
Promise me first you won’t ever get bored of me.

125
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,000
What are you cooking?

126
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,160
Just trying it out.

127
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,480
Yeah?

128
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,480
But I’m hungry. Can I have some first?

129
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,840
Looks delicious. I’m starving.

130
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,280
Hey Hia, no, it’s burnt!

131
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,000
It looks so good, let me try it first.

132
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,680
I’m hungry.

133
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,320
Please?

134
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,840
But it’s burnt.

135
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,480
Still edible.

136
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,640
Whoa.

137
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,600
My baby here…

138
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,680
You made it look delicious.

139
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,840
You’re exaggerating.

140
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,920
Want to eat?

141
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,440
You eat it, Hia Sorn.

142
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,520
Come on, just a bite

143
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:22,960
Hmph.

144
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,760
Is it good?

145
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:30,920
It’s really good.

146
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,040
You’ve got to eat it like this too.

147
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,200
Tasty, huh?

148
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,760
Since you’re living with him now, do you even do anything for him?

149
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,880
P’Sorn.

150
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,400
Hm?

151
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,640
Come here.

152
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,360
Why?

153
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,160
Dress properly, will you?

154
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,720
Stop showing off your muscles.

155
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,080
Why, is it so hard to dress like this?

156
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,360
I’m jealous.

157
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,880
And also the office sign.

158
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,480
Here you go.

159
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,680
I like this scent.

160
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:22,960
Smells good now.

161
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
The other side too.

162
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,360
There, now you look handsome.

163
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,160
Now go get yourself dressed.

164
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,320
Go on, my wife.

165
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,720
Get dressed.

166
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,360
Okay.

167
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,560
See you.

168
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,560
I don’t come out here often.

169
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,480
The weather’s amazing

170
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,040
Hmm.

171
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:03,080
Since you’re living with him now, do you even do anything for him?

172
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,560
Yeah.

173
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,320
What are you looking at?

174
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,280
Is it good?

175
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,960
It’s good.

176
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,880
Not eating?

177
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,800
Better than before?

178
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,280
It’s insanely good.

179
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,000
How was it?

180
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,560
You’re amazing

181
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,080
How’s it going?

182
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,120
You’re crazy good.

183
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,920
Why are you so good?

184
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,360
Who taught you?

185
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,360
Taught me what?

186
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,280
You were the one who taught me.

187
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,840
Do it again next time.

188
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,280
I’m done.

189
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,400
That’s all I’ve got.

190
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,280
Don’t call it “just that.”

191
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,920
Call it damn good.

192
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,040
You know what?

193
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,560
The only reason I managed that is…

194
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,440
Win told me.

195
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,800
Did he teach you?

196
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,640
No, he didn’t.

197
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,360
He just—

198
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,440
Did Win teach you this?

199
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:46,800
Gave me some advice and—

200
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,920
Told me to do whatever it takes to make you like me more.

201
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,960
Anniversary…

202
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,240
What?

203
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,960
Did you forget?

204
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,320
I didn’t forget.

205
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,000
I remember.

206
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,000
How could I ever forget?

207
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,440
Next week we’re going to the beach, remember?

208
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,920
Do you want to go?

209
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,240
Hm…

210
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,600
I’ve never been on a yacht before.

211
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,440
It’d be nice if we had the chance.

212
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,880
But don’t go buying or renting a yacht. it’s expensive.

213
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,440
Then I’ll buy you seven of them.

214
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,560
What do you mean, seven yachts?

215
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,880
Everyone’s here, right?

216
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,120
Who’s that?

217
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:23,640
This is my friend, Aun. He owns a resort down south.

218
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,280
Oh.

219
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,120
But hey… his face looks familiar.

220
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,320
You’ve met him before, actually.

221
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,600
Really?

222
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,600
Yeah, back when I wasn’t around.

223
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,720
I asked him to keep an eye on you.

224
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,600
Seriously, you go that far?

225
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,960
In case you had someone else.

226
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,440
I get jealous.

227
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,200
Jealous, huh… yeah, jealous.

228
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,000
Can you guys wait a sec?

229
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,000
My stomach hurts.

230
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,360
I need to hit the bathroom.

231
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,200
Didn’t you already say that a while ago?

232
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,440
Yeah, I’ll be quick.

233
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,840
How many places did you follow me to, anyway?

234
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,360
Just a few.

235
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,840
Eh, forget it. So, what should we bring to the beach?

236
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:29,200
Just myself and my heart… though my heart’s in the bathroom right now.

237
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,480
All I’ve got is a ball.

238
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,920
How can we go without music, man?

239
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,960
Hey

240
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,240
Oh, shit!

241
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,200
That’s the porn clip I sent you this morning!

242
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,400
Whoa…

243
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,400
Don’t tell me he’s in the bathroom and…

244
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,160
Damn, P’ Sorn…

245
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,400
Not bad at all, huh.

246
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,120
Ehh

247
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,360
That voice sounds familiar, Sorn.

248
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,040
Feeling better after just now?

249
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,639
Oh!

250
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,520
I thought the video didn’t have sound.

251
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,000
Did you like it?

252
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,000
I was just watching, that’s all.

253
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:33,400
Anyway, let’s head to the beach.

254
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,960
Can you still drive?

255
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,840
You worn out yet?

256
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,400
Not yet.

257
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,960
Still got plenty left in me good for a few more rounds.

258
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,400
About what you asked…

259
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,719
You can go. I already called and told them.

260
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,320
You and Hia Sorn are glued together.

261
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,080
Don’t worry, Thanu will be there, dumbass.

262
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,480
Won’t he get suspicious?

263
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,960
Me suddenly disappearing on my own like that?

264
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,240
No one’s gonna suspect anything.

265
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,600
Let the kid breathe a little.

266
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,720
You two are glued together way too much.

267
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,560
I love what’s mine.

268
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,880
Yeah,Mr. Lover Boy.

269
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,680
Come on,P' Thanu.

270
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,160
Let me.

271
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:43,800
Thanu, look at your brother totally whipped. His whole heart belongs to the kid now.

272
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,400
I just swallowed a big gulp.

273
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,240
He kept saying he doesn’t like kids, doesn’t like kids…

274
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,600
Yeah right, look at him now.

275
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,960
So sweet it gives me chills.

276
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,360
You guys talk like I’m not even here.

277
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,040
Oh, so you can get embarrassed?

278
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,800
Jun.

279
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,200
They’re teasing me.

280
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,280
Don’t join in with them.

281
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,760
They’re troublemakers.

282
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,560
Hmph. Idiot.

283
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,040
Hey P'Sorn, where did P'Aun and P'Thanu go?

284
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,800
The moment we got to the beach, they ran straight into the bedroom.

285
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,960
Guess we can’t hang out with them then.

286
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:44,120
Hmm… but it’s actually nice, right? Getting to spend the holiday at the beach together like this.

287
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:47,880
Do you like it?

288
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,000
Yeah… I do.

289
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,960
You like the beach?

290
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,600
Mm-hmm.

291
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,000
But if I had to choose what I like more…

292
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,520
it’d be the beach with you in it.

293
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:51,960
Which angle looks good?

294
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,640
Wanna try?

295
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,320
Okay.

296
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,040
You choose the spot then.

297
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:55,960
Alright.

298
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:56,640
Mm.

299
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,200
Whoa.

300
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,840
Legs that long you must be at least 180 cm tall.

301
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,760
Here.

302
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,320
Does it look good?

303
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,320
Pretty. Can I try standing too, bro?

304
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,360
Sure.

305
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,720
Come here.

306
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,360
Mm, mm, mm.

307
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,440
Okay.

308
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,640
Alright.

309
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,520
I’ll send it to you. I’ll send it.

310
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,320
Uh… P' Thanu

311
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,360
where did P'Sorn go?

312
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,600
Uh… he’ll come soon.

313
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,760
You look suspicious.

314
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,160
Suspicious?

315
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,040
You’re talking nonsense.

316
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,360
Go post over there, the light’s better.

317
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:03,840
Babe, put it on faster. Just putting it there won’t protect from the sun, you know?

318
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:09,240
Honey, just stay still. It’ll be done in a sec.

319
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,320
But you’re so slow.

320
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,320
Mhm, here too.

321
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,080
Send it to me too, okay?

322
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,320
No problem.

323
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:19,880
Okay.

324
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,960
Hey, babe.

325
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:27,840
Yes?

326
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I ran into Sorn today.

327
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,480
Mm.

328
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:40,320
But he was with another boy who looked a lot like Jun. Same build, same face… almost Jun, but not Jun.

329
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,720
Don’t tell me… Sorn broke up with Jun?

330
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,400
What? No way.

331
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,440
So, what were they doing?

332
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:54,520
That’s the strange part they were picking out rings.

333
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:13,760
Friends don’t normally do that, right?

334
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:20,920
What if… Sorn’s living a double life? Babe, we should tell Jun.

335
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:25,840
But maybe it’s their private matter. We shouldn’t interfere.

336
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:41,360
Do you think P'Sorn really loves me?

337
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,640
My brother really loves you, Jun.

338
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,560
Even Mom knows about you two.

339
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,440
He’s even planned the future with you. I’m telling you.

340
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,960
he’s not messing around with your feelings this time.

341
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,000
But P'Sorn’s been gone the whole day.

342
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,840
He didn’t answer my calls.

343
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,160
Didn’t even read my texts, let alone reply.

344
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,320
Yeah, he went to take care of some business.

345
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,400
He’ll come pick you up for dinner later.

346
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,800
What business?

347
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,800
So important that he has to vanish like this?

348
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,880
Just gone without a trace?

349
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,440
If you want answers…

350
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,680
Ask my brother yourself this evening.

351
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,240
He’s got all the answers you need.

352
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,080
Not eating?

353
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,600
Do you have something you want to tell me?

354
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,080
What’s wrong with you?

355
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:13,080
I’m just asking if there’s something you want to tell me.

356
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,560
If you’re suspicious of something, just ask me directly, Jun.

357
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:38,760
Well… someone told me you went to buy a ring with another guy.

358
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,280
Shit.

359
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,880
Are you cheating on me?

360
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,560
Listen to me first.

361
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,400
I love you so much.

362
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,080
I would never cheat on you.

363
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,080
I did go to buy a ring.

364
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,600
I heard you say....

365
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,920
The other day that our anniversary is coming up.

366
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:41,800
But I’m no good at choosing.

367
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,680
If I chose on my own, you’d probably end up with some plain ring.

368
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,200
So I asked Aun’s boyfriend to help me pick one.

369
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,000
So you could have a beautiful ring to wear.

370
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,600
So you won’t be embarrassed in front of others.

371
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,600
Listen to me.

372
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,600
Hia loves Jun.

373
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,200
You’ve been mine for so long.

374
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,800
I’ve raised you since you were little.

375
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:28,600
But now…

376
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,840
My wife’s gorgeous.

377
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,280
I’d never cheat on you, Jun.

378
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,040
Why are you being so sweet?

379
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,200
Can’t I be sweet to you?

380
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:51,840
Mm.

381
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,040
I’m blushing

382
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,720
Since you already bought it…

383
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,200
Then put it on me.

384
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,960
Which finger do you want me to put it on?

385
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,200
Hmm…

386
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,560
You chose it...

387
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,080
so you decide which finger.

388
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,360
You’re letting me choose?

389
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,160
Well hello, hello!

390
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:54,600
Oh wow.

391
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:56,920
that’s really sweet.

392
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,840
Mind if I join? Mind if I sit down?

393
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:03,480
Oh.

394
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,040
Aun.

395
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,760
There’s another pair, you know.

396
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:07,800
Whoa.

397
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:08,480
Sit here.

398
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:20,760
This is Nice.

399
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:22,480
Aun’s boyfriend.

400
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,480
His family’s in the jewelry business.

401
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,320
So I asked him to help pick out the ring.

402
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,520
Hello, my name’s Nice.

403
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:33,760
He’s my boyfriend.

404
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:39,080
Whoa, the whole table already knows, you’re always showing off.

405
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,680
Well my boyfriend’s this cute.

406
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,600
How could I not show him off?

407
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:53,920
Well, since we’re all here congrats to my brother and my future brother-in-law.

408
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:57,600
Thanks.

409
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:00,520
Let’s eat.

410
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,120
I need another plate first.

411
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,400
No kiss before the meal?

412
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:06,960
What?

413
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,840
Oh, acting all shy now, huh? My dear brother-in-law.

414
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,760
I feel like staying in the bathroom all day.

415
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,080
I believe you.

416
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,040
I could do this for you forever, you know.

417
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:36,320
Hey, P'Sorn… don’t tell me this boat is yours.

418
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:39,840
It is.

419
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:41,720
Why?

420
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:42,680
Whoa…

421
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,440
Why did you buy it?

422
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,120
You’re that rich?

423
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,840
Buying random stuff like this…

424
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,160
Calm down. Let me explain.

425
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,560
Do you remember when my dad got shot?

426
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,360
Yeah…what about it?

427
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:14,760
When I went back to handle things at home.

428
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:19,160
My mom gave the money to me and Thanu to manage.

429
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,240
My mom probably didn’t want to use the money from Dad’s death.

430
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,720
So I took the money I got…

431
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:28,560
…and invested it.

432
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,680
Became a partner in Fan’s shop.

433
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:32,240
Bought a house.

434
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,000
Bought a car.

435
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,080
And this boat.

436
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,000
Aun recommended it.

437
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,440
I barely use it myself.

438
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,280
Mostly...

439
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,920
I rent it out for income.

440
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,480
You’re incredible, P'Sorn.

441
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,240
I’m just doing what I should.

442
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,240
And besides…

443
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:13,480
now I have you in my life.

444
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,600
And I already promised Go-Nung…

445
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,520
…that I’d take care of you the best I can.

446
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,680
So I have to make enough money.

447
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:28,720
Especially since you eat so much.

448
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,000
Hey.

449
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,400
Well, it’s tasty.

450
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:34,760
Want some?

451
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,280
You wanna eat?

452
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:41,960
Is it good?

453
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:51,040
Hey, I wanna ask you something.

454
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:57,880
If you’re already this rich, why do you still work at the company?

455
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,080
If it were me

456
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,520
I’d just sail around the world.

457
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:05,760
Why though?

458
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,040
Back when I was studying…

459
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:14,160
Mm.

460
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:16,720
Uncle Long really helped me out.

461
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:21,720
He sent me and Champ to finish school overseas.

462
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:28,000
Even though life’s easier for me now…

463
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,360
I still have to help with the company.

464
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:35,800
Make sure it’s stable first.

465
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,960
And when that day really comes…

466
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:47,000
I’ll probably go live with my mom down south.

467
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,200
Will you come live with me, Jun?

468
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,200
No matter what you do or where you live…

469
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,080
I’ll stay with you.

470
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,080
Always by your side.

471
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,240
You’ll stay too, right?

472
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:15,920
I’ll stay forever.

473
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,160
You said it yourself.

474
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:19,880
Mm.

475
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:22,400
Mm.

476
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:26,800
Eat.

477
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,560
I’ll get drunk.

478
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,600
Don’t you have any beer, bro?

479
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:46,000
The weather’s so nice.

480
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,240
Really?

481
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:49,480
Do you like it?

482
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:51,520
I do.

483
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:53,760
Cheers.

484
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,000
Tastes good.

485
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,000
Tastes good.

486
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:15,480
What do you mean?

487
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:18,240
Champagne.

488
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,000
Well, it really is good.

489
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:30,720
Do you wanna come again?

490
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:34,320
Do you want me to?

491
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:36,960
You’re gonna come anyway, right?

492
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,840
Then let’s do this more often.

493
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:41,600
Okay.

494
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:48,760
Do I have to feed you?

495
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:49,120
Here.

496
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:01,200
Why are you so cute today?

497
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,520
I’m cute every day.

498
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:07,480
You just noticed today.

499
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:12,360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what’s this?

500
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:12,880
What’s what?

501
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:19,480
Give me a kiss first.

502
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,280
Then why are you so cute today?

503
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,360
Mmm…

504
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:31,400
I’m cute every day, aren’t I?

505
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:34,200
Really?

506
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:34,720
Yeah.

507
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,520
Then stay cute forever, okay?

508
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:17,840
What are you looking at?

509
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,000
Can’t I look at the driver?

510
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:22,880
We’re at the beach, look at the sea.

511
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:28,720
Pretty, right?

512
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:31,720
You?

513
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:32,960
The sea.

514
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:35,320
You’re prettier

515
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:44,680
Come up.

516
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:49,320
Right here

517
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,160
Was that easy?

518
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:52,560
Yeah.

519
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:58,160
This one’s straight, this one’s straight I remember.
