1
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,880
You’re so drunk.

2
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,759
They only poured mine.

3
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:43,360
You’re so drunk.

4
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,880
You’re so drunk.

5
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,880
P’Son.

6
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,960
P’Son, you drink too?

7
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,400
When did you get here?

8
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,360
What Son? I’m Thanu, dumbass.

9
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,080
Who’s Son?

10
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,320
P’Son...

11
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,880
Jwin, what the hell?

12
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,200
You’re drunk like a dog.

13
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,720
Thanu!

14
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,400
What the hell did you let him drink so much for?

15
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,120
This is P’Son.

16
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,720
That’s also P’Son?

17
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,760
There are two Sons…?

18
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,360
What the hell are you doing?

19
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,000
Go home.

20
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,760
Whoa.

21
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,600
Let’s go home, P’Son...

22
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,320
Why are you even taking care of me?

23
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,680
Now you're mad again.

24
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,320
You always get mad and yell at me.

25
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,560
Old man always nagging.

26
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,840
Take that!

27
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,440
I don’t even know what to say to you, Jun.

28
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,720
Wherever they invite you, you just go.

29
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,960
Not even one call to me.

30
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,360
I drove around looking everywhere for you.

31
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,200
Look at you now.

32
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,519
drunk like a dog.

33
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,880
You little shit.

34
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,360
Go take a shower.

35
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,680
Take your shirt off.

36
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,080
Aha.

37
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,480
You’re doing this because you care about me, right?

38
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:06,600
Yeah, if I didn’t care, would I waste all this time yelling at you, you brat?

39
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,160
You like scolding me.

40
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,400
I scold you because you’re stubborn.

41
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,440
If something had happened to you, I wouldn’t even know where to return someone like you.

42
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,480
You little menace...

43
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,240
There’s no one else like you.

44
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,120
Even if you like yelling at me.

45
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,200
I still like you.

46
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,480
Let me ask you something.

47
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,320
Hmm...

48
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,560
You said you like me more than before.

49
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,600
Do you mean like more than you like Tai or Champ?

50
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,400
Hmph.

51
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,200
This time I mean it.

52
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,840
It’s not just more than before—I really like you.

53
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,640
I told you I like you.

54
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,600
Say something back.

55
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,840
Come on, P’Son, please.

56
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,440
I said I like you, so you have to say it back.

57
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:12,880
Please, I want to hear it. Please, P’Son.

58
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,760
You’re way too drunk, Jun.

59
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,880
Go shower and get to bed.

60
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,360
I really like you.

61
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,360
Thanks...

62
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,400
You’re such an idiot.

63
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,600
Look at you now.

64
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,760
Acting tough—drank too much and now you’re hungover.

65
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,800
My head is killing me.

66
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,480
If you’re gonna puke, hurry up. My mom’s waiting to give alms.

67
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,480
Ughhh… can you stop nagging? I’ve got a headache and I’m still processing the guilt.

68
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,360
May you be blessed.

69
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:37,800
*Reciting Buddhist chant*

70
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,720
Amen.

71
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,520
You holding up okay, Jun?

72
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,600
I’m fine, Mom.

73
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,080
Thanu! Always dragging him off into trouble.

74
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,800
There’s some lime in the fridge, okay?

75
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,240
I’ll make you some lime juice. Come on, let’s go.

76
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,360
You can take him inside first, Mom. I’ll clean up.

77
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,160
Come on, sweetie.

78
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,960
Oh hey, Son.

79
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,480
When did you get back?

80
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,000
Yesterday.

81
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,200
I heard your mom bought all of Aunt Noi’s land? Is that true?

82
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,440
Oh, I didn’t know. My mom and Thanu handled everything.

83
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,080
Heh...

84
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,720
Hey Son, if you’re free today, stop by the house.

85
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,480
Mali keeps saying she misses you.

86
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,360
Yeah… if I’m free, I’ll drop by.

87
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,160
Anyway, let me head inside first.

88
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,520
Don’t forget to come by. I’ll head off now.

89
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,280
Next time, go get yourself drunk like a damn dog again.

90
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,720
Wow, that mouth of yours.

91
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:37,600
You actually look like a person now that you’ve showered. You were a total mess this morning.

92
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,040
P’Son!

93
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,280
You’re yelling at me now? Must mean the hangover’s gone.

94
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,160
Good, now I don’t have to worry.

95
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,640
Wow, Mom! You’re so hardworking.

96
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,280
If my house had space like this, I’d help Son plant trees too.

97
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:30,640
It’s really simple, son. Just water them and make sure weeds don’t take over.

98
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,160
Otherwise the soil gets poor.

99
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:40,040
She saw this space was free, so she cleared it for me.

100
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,440
That’s so nice, Mom.

101
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,760
Can I try planting something?

102
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,440
Of course, go ahead!

103
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,520
Thank you.

104
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,680
Just three or four months, and it turns out this pretty.

105
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,960
It’s beautiful, Mom.

106
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,200
What are you smiling at?

107
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,880
You… you done working out?

108
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,600
Yeah, I’m done.

109
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,800
Looks like your boy gets along with our mom pretty well.

110
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,920
Jun good with people.

111
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:46,040
The only one he’s not close to… is me.

112
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,840
Are you sulking because of the kid?

113
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,040
Maybe it’s because you don’t like kids—that’s why he keeps his distance.

114
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,440
But they seem pretty close to me.

115
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,560
Why else would he come back home with you?

116
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,920
He just likes going places.

117
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,760
He likes going places... or maybe he likes *you*?

118
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,840
What the hell are you talking about?

119
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,720
I’m done with this nonsense.

120
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,280
Come eat, Jun. You too, Mom.

121
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,360
Come on, sweetie. We’re almost done.

122
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,160
Mom, where do I turn off the water?

123
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,400
Over there, sweetie. Turn it off.

124
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,000
Oh Son.

125
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,280
If you’re free today, let’s go visit Aunt Mai. She’s always asking about you.

126
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,800
Sure.

127
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,400
You coming with me?

128
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:48,920
Where are you going?

129
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,920
I’ve got some errands in town.

130
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:58,160
then I’ll stop by to see some relatives. Want to tag along? Staying here’s boring anyway.

131
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,520
Oh right, you’re going to talk about the road access to the orchard?

132
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:06,400
Yeah, I’m going to talk to Uncle Nui about fencing the new plot.

133
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,120
You have to come along too, Mom.

134
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:17,680
Then let’s drop Mom at the temple first. I haven’t been to the Kathin festival this year. I want to see how far they’ve come.

135
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,760
I think I’ll skip this one, bro.

136
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,560
You’re gonna stay home alone?

137
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,000
Hey, he’s not alone. I’m here too.

138
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,600
Next thing you know, you’ll be throwing another drinking party.

139
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:49,400
No way. If we drink again, I’ll be knocked out for sure.

140
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,560
Man, why do you worry so much?

141
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,040
I’ll be back.

142
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,280
You sure you don’t wanna come?

143
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,360
Nah, I’ve got a photo shoot planned with Thanu.

144
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,800
Let me kiss you.

145
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,000
No way.

146
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,360
Someone might see.

147
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:45,960
What are you scared of? Thanu’s not here, and Mom’s in her room.

148
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,000
Come on.

149
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,760
Thanu!

150
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,280
Where’s Son?

151
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,040
I don’t know.

152
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,480
Mom, should we go now?

153
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,840
Yeah, let’s go, son.

154
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:51,600
Dear, Uncle Nui and Madam Kasorn are waiting. Let’s get this sorted once and for all.

155
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,760
You stay home and look after him, alright?

156
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,840
Yes, Mom.

157
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,680
Psst, hey!

158
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,880
Where’s Jun?

159
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,360
He’s around here somewhere.

160
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,840
Don’t bother taking him out.

161
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:19,400
I’ve been wondering something—does Jun have a boyfriend?

162
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,360
Ever since he got here, I haven’t seen him on the phone with anyone.

163
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,360
He doesn’t. Why?

164
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:32,200
Nothing, just... if he’s single, maybe I’ll shoot my shot.

165
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,600
You don’t even like guys.

166
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,240
Yeah, but… he is kinda cute.

167
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,520
Thanu!

168
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,440
Son, let’s go now. Don’t be late.

169
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,640
What’s wrong? Are you not feeling well?

170
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,120
Just a bit under the weather.

171
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,240
Hmm… you’ve got a fever.

172
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,280
Have you eaten or taken any medicine?

173
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:45,320
Then rest up. I’ll take care of you.

174
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,920
Hey Praew, what are you doing here?

175
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,000
P’Tai, I’m leaving Namrin with you for a sec, I’ll be back.

176
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,600
Leaving her?

177
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,280
Yeah yeah, just a minute!

178
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,240
Hey, where are you going? Praew!

179
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,840
Who’s this kid? Yours?

180
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:28,000
Nah, I just ran into Praew. She left the kid with me and rushed off. No idea what’s going on.

181
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,760
What’s your name, sweetie?

182
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,200
Namrin.

183
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,080
You came with Auntie Praew?

184
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,360
Yes.

185
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,960
Whew. Thanks, P’Tai. Oh! Hi there, Win.

186
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,000
Whoa, slow down. Breathe. What happened?

187
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:52,560
I brought Namrin, Mod’s kid from accounting, out to eat—but I forgot my wallet in the car. So lucky I ran into you.

188
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,680
And you didn’t cause any trouble with Uncle Tai and Uncle Win, right?

189
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,800
Nope.

190
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,040
Good girl.

191
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,960
She wasn’t naughty… just heavy.

192
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,760
Hey.

193
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,080
Still not used to being called “uncle,” man.

194
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,160
Seeing this… kinda makes me wanna have a kid too.

195
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,200
It’s cute and all, but being called “uncle” still hits weird.

196
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,320
Let’s go grab some ice cream, bro.

197
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,960
So, how is it? Pretty?

198
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,680
So damn pretty.

199
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,760
I never thought a place like this existed near your home.

200
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,760
Gorgeous, right?

201
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,520
Super gorgeous.

202
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,320
There’s a photo spot over there. Lots of people come here for pics.

203
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,840
Can you take some for me?

204
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,840
Of course! No problem.

205
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,280
Thanks!

206
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,960
Shall we go?

207
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,960
Let’s go.

208
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,080
Try standing here.

209
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:02,800
Here?

210
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,520
Yeah, right there.

211
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,720
P’Son’s calling.

212
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:21,120
Don’t pick up. He’s just gonna nag you for not being home.

213
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,800
Alright, camera’s ready. Let’s go.

214
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,760
Shall we take the shot?

215
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,240
Ugh!

216
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,240
Come here.

217
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,480
Why the hell do you keep calling?

218
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,360
Dude, let me talk to Jun.

219
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,880
He’s not here.

220
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,320
Hurry up.

221
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,120
That’s it. I’m busy.

222
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,720
Thanks, man. Really.

223
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,600
How can you let him boss you around like that?

224
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,680
You don’t have to answer every call.

225
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,320
Take some time for yourself.

226
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:14,120
Like right now—I’m taking your photos. Let’s fill up that memory card.

227
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,040
Alright. 1, 2, 3, snap!

228
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,640
Got it here, bro.

229
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,600
Okay, let’s try—1, 2, boom!

230
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,880
Did it turn out okay?

231
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,920
Let me see—did you get it?

232
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,120
Huh? That’s all?

233
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:38,880
Pretty cool, right?

234
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,120
That’s perfect.

235
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:49,360
I’m posting this on IG—bet it’ll get tons of likes.

236
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:56,560
Hey, if I blow up, I’m hiring you as my personal photographer. Deal?

237
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,560
Whoa!

238
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,320
If it pays more than my garden gig, I’m in.

239
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:11,640
Wait, your garden gig pays that much?

240
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,440
Nah, it’s not expensive—just a hundred grand a month.

241
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,920
A hundred grand?!

242
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,320
You’re exaggerating!

243
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,520
What? I’m just telling the truth.

244
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,040
Go home and ask your mom how much she pays me.

245
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,080
Maybe I should ask your mom for a job instead.

246
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,080
Huh?

247
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:33,960
Can I, please?

248
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,440
What? Not hiring me anymore?

249
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,720
Can you hire me instead?

250
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,200
What, you’re not gonna hire me now?

251
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,520
Hey, what’s up, Win?

252
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:57,760
You ditched me, asshole. Who took that pic? P’Son? Nah, no way—your skills are way better than his.

253
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,560
(Laughs)

254
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:03,160
Who’s laughing? Is that P’Son? P’Son!

255
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:08,040
Hey, that’s not P’Son… it’s P’Nu.

256
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,680
He’s P’Son’s younger brother.

257
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:15,480
Oh, P’Nu! You’ve met already, right? Say hi for me—tell him I miss him.

258
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,920
Tell him yourself!

259
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:17,960
P’Nu

260
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,720
Win wants to talk.

261
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,520
What’s up, Win?

262
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,640
P’Thanu, I miss you.

263
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,440
Yeah, miss you too. Come visit sometime, alright?

264
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,640
Sure thing. See you soon.

265
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,120
Yup, see ya.

266
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:43,960
Hey Win, next time you come, you’ve gotta take pics with me, alright?

267
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,920
The view here is insanely gorgeous.

268
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:53,080
I’m thinking of posting the pics on IG—make sure to like them!

269
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,120
Yeah right—just don’t sneak off with P’Son alone again.

270
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:03,320
It’s not like that! I didn’t come with P’Son. P’Nu brought me out here.

271
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,800
So where are you now?

272
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,120
Just finished watching a movie. I’m with P’Tai.

273
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,120
Hia Tai?

274
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,680
Hey, tell Hia Tai he owes me a treat next time!

275
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:20,840
Wow, sneaking off with P’Son and didn’t even tell us—now you’re begging for food?

276
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:25,480
It was last-minute, bro. I didn’t tell anyone.

277
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:31,280
Just don’t fight with Son, okay? When you’re back, I’ll treat you.

278
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:36,000
For real? Aww thanks, you’re the best.

279
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:41,720
See, Win? I told you he’s always sweet to me.

280
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:46,840
Hey Win, I gotta go. I want more pictures.

281
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,400
Yeah yeah, you friend-ditcher.

282
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,240
I’m out.

283
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,360
Huh? What’s wrong?

284
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,360
I don’t know, but I’m so itchy.

285
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,200
Shit. You’re probably allergic to the grass!

286
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,160
Hurry home and take a shower.

287
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:58,120
Nu! What the hell did you take him through? He’s red all over!

288
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,520
We were shooting in a field—it was beautiful!

289
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,040
What happened to him? Why’s he all red?

290
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:15,400
It’s Nu’s fault—he took me through that grass. Idiot move, both for going and for dragging me along.

291
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:20,840
Hey hey! Don’t panic! It’s just grass, not like he got shot!

292
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,240
Still, you’re the one who got him into this mess.

293
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,640
Wasn’t there literally anywhere else to take pictures?

294
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,640
Alright, enough! Go take him to shower! Come on, sweetie, time to wash up. Go go go.

295
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:38,360
Go on—look what you caused.

296
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,880
Told you it’d end in disaster.

297
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,680
Move it!

298
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,280
What?

299
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,480
Take off your shirt.

300
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,040
Why the hell go to a place like that? It's just grass!

301
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,360
P’Sorn.

302
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,320
What?

303
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,760
If you had a wife, would you still nag this much?

304
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,760
Just take it off.

305
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,000
Get up here.

306
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,480
Why?

307
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,240
I’m checking your rash.

308
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,520
Get up.

309
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,040
What are you looking down at?

310
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,840
What's yours?

311
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,920
P’Sorn.

312
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,960
You done yet?

313
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,120
I wanna shower.

314
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,800
Please continue a little longer.

315
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,600
Hey Jun!

316
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,199
Yeah?

317
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,159
You finished showering?

318
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,159
All done, bro.

319
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,600
And...

320
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,280
why did you change clothes?

321
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,080
None of your business.

322
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:13,600
Hey Jun, there’s a fair tonight. Wanna go walk around with me?

323
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,480
Tonight? Yeah, let’s go!

324
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,480
I don’t approve.

325
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:40,480
Sorn, you brought him here—don’t coop him up inside. Let him go have some fun, alright sweetie?

326
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,560
But eat first, okay? Eat up.

327
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,200
What’s this called, Mom?

328
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,760
That’s called “Nam Chup Kuey,” sweetie.

329
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,000
“Kuey” means shrimp paste, right?

330
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,360
That’s right.

331
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,960
Whoa, smart kid!

332
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,640
I know, I know!

333
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,440
You eat it with fresh veggies.

334
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,480
Ohh.

335
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,680
I don’t eat veggies.

336
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,720
I heard P’Sorn loves vegetables.

337
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,680
He does.

338
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,640
That one’s cucumber.

339
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,160
I thought you already left.

340
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,680
How could I leave? I stayed to check on you.

341
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,600
Thank you.

342
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,080
Don’t mention it. I’m happy to.

343
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,280
Do you...

344
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:10,000
Have someone new in your heart?

345
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,160
How could I? It’s always been you.

346
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,800
So? Let me see how you’re feeling.

347
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,400
Still feel warm?

348
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,960
Feeling better.

349
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,640
Are you hungry?

350
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,720
Want some?

351
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,040
Sure, why not.

352
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,040
- This is delicious.
- See? I told you!

353
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,080
Tastes good, right?

354
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,640
Whoa, bro.

355
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,280
I want that one.

356
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,200
That one? The stuffed toy?

357
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,080
It’s cute!

358
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:36,400
Give it a shot. Let’s win it for you.

359
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,760
Thanks!

360
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,240
You sure you know how to shoot?

361
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,520
Please, I’m a pro.

362
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,000
Just watch and learn

363
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,240
Show me then.

364
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,400
First try.

365
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,120
First try... just practicing.

366
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,080
This is hard, man.

367
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:15,680
Okay, I bet there’s more fun inside. Wanna give it a go?

368
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,200
Your a rhino!

369
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:26,320
Chill, bro. How much money did I spend to get this big rhino?

370
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,560
Didn’t spend a dime. I fought the store owner for it.

371
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,720
Just kidding, relax.

372
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,040
It’s not even that hard. Took me just a few shots.

373
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,040
I can even shoot with my feet.

374
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,160
Wow!

375
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,960
P’Sorn!!!

376
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,840
Are you okay?

377
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,880
I'm fine. Just tired.

378
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,120
Hey, Jun.

379
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,640
Hmm?

380
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,080
Want me to get you another plushie?

381
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:40,720
Oh no, one’s enough. I don’t even know how I’m getting this one home.

382
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,320
I’ll have Thanou ship it to you.

383
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:54,400
No need, really. Just leave it here. Don’t bother Nu.

384
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:06,160
It’s yours. Should stay with you, right? Just take it home.

385
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Mali's my ex-girlfriend.

386
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,640
We dated in high school.

387
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,200
And you're telling me this because...?

388
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,640
Thought you’d wanna know.

389
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,800
I’m gonna go shower.

390
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,080
Wait!

391
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:06,160
I’ll shower with you. Save time.

392
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,920
What? No way.

393
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:12,960
But I wanna. What are you gonna do? It’s my house.

394
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,960
Oh!

395
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,760
Why’d you bite my neck?! It’s gonna leave a mark.

396
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,120
If you really wanna shower, just go first. I’ll wait here.

397
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:48,480
Fine, fine. I won’t tease anymore. Go already.

398
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:03,920
Hello?

399
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:08,840
Where’s Jun? Can I talk to him?

400
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:13,040
He’s showering. Why do you keep calling?

401
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,800
Uh, just tell him to call me back when he’s done.

402
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:21,720
Yeah, yeah. I’ll tell him.

403
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:49,600
What’s with you? You were following that kid around earlier.

404
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:55,160
What the hell are you even saying? I’m not hearing this.

405
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:01,800
You fought with Jun, didn’t you?

406
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:08,400
I didn’t. He’s just so damn stubborn.

407
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:17,920
Stubborn how? He listened to me just fine today. Bit cheeky though.

408
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:35,160
Seriously, what’s up with you and Jun?

409
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:44,160
You wanna be with him or just toying around?

410
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:49,760
What the hell, man. Just get back to work.

411
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:59,720
You’re obviously jealous. Why don’t you just date him already?

412
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,760
I’m not jealous.

413
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,440
You know I don’t like younger guys.

414
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:13,280
Not liking kids, sure. But not liking Jun?

415
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:19,920
I’ve never seen you not like him.

416
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:25,760
What are you trying to say?

417
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:31,040
Don’t play dumb, Sorn. You know exactly what I mean.

418
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:37,720
You’re acting like this and want me to believe you’re just senior-junior?

419
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,800
Siblings don’t kiss, bro.

420
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,400
You saw that?!

421
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,520
I don’t wanna like Jun.

422
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,560
Why not?

423
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,920
He’s still a kid.

424
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:19,200
Are you nuts?! He’s in his fourth year. He’s not a kid anymore.

425
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:26,320
He’s younger than us. Have you ever seen me date someone younger before?

426
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:36,520
Because of Mali, right?

427
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,720
Mali.

428
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:51,520
I don’t think it’s right for us to be alone like this.

429
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:59,000
It’s fine. I just wanna spend some time with you, just the two of us. No interruptions.

430
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:14,960
Mali, what if someone sees us?

431
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,840
It’s really okay.

432
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:20,800
Are you sure, Mali?

433
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,480
Of course.

434
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:37,400
Hey! What’s going on here?!

435
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:42,080
Dad! Help me! Sorn tricked me into coming here!

436
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,440
Dad, I didn’t—

437
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:46,840
You bastard, Sorn!

438
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:51,640
Dad, wait, please don’t get the wrong idea. Mali, tell him—I didn’t do anything!

439
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,280
Yeah.

440
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:07,800
Sorn, Jun’s not Mali. That was ages ago. You still haven’t moved on?

441
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:15,040
Don’t you remember? I almost went to jail that day. Lucky Uncle Kamnan cleared it up.

442
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:21,920
Of course I remember. Our parents had to apologize even when you weren’t wrong.

443
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,960
If I have to fall in love with someone younger

444
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,480
That person can't be Jun.

445
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:55,520
Since you came back from the South, you've been avoiding me. What's wrong with you?

446
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,680
If P’Sorn tells you that he likes you, will you go out with him?

447
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:09,120
How many times have you had sex? When you did it, did you think he was my younger brother?

448
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:14,880
From today on, you and I won't get involved with each other anymore—no matter what it's about!

449
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:18,520
And you can stop meddling in my life too.
