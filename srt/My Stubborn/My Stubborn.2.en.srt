1
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,160
You dare mess with my boy, asshole?

2
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,240
Who the hell is your boy?

3
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,080
Right here—he's mine.

4
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,960
Get in the car.

5
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,600
Ouch!

6
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,280
Ouch!

7
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,400
You started it first.

8
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,120
How was I supposed to know that guy already had a boyfriend?

9
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,040
Next time, open your damn eyes and look properly.

10
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,960
What now? Tried to beat me, huh?

11
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,000
All you got was a kick in return.

12
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,079
Can you stop complaining already?

13
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,080
If you keep nagging, then stay out of it.

14
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,920
I’m leaving.

15
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,000
Why did you suddenly decide to help me?

16
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,120
When I got punched, I saw you just standing there doing nothing.

17
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,280
It’s good for you to get some sense knocked in.

18
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,560
So you’ll know to listen when an adult speaks.

19
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,920
When did you told me?

20
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,800
I told you your kissing sucks, which means you shouldn’t be kissing anyone yet.

21
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,240
Since you don’t listen, better let you taste some kicks instead.

22
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,200
I only stepped in because that bastard was out to kill you.

23
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,079
I don’t even have clothes for your funeral.

24
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,320
You kiss like crap, you know?

25
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,920
Was I really that bad?

26
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,440
From what I saw—yeah.

27
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,640
Why?

28
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,000
Are you that bothered?

29
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:19,240
If you think kissing is just putting your mouth over someone else's and sucking like a starving
suckerfish, then yeah, it’s terrible.

30
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,280
I’m so embarrassed.

31
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,160
Want me to teach you how to kiss?

32
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,159
Sure. Why not?

33
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,000
Didn’t you say you already used what I taught you on someone else?

34
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,440
Stop talking so much. Are we starting or not?

35
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,280
No. Not right now.

36
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,360
Why not?

37
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,480
It’s just a kiss, right?

38
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,840
Your breath smells like alcohol and you’ve got blood on you—totally kills the mood.

39
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,600
Go take a shower first.

40
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,280
Where are you rushing off to, Jun?

41
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,960
You seriously forgot everything I taught you?

42
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,760
Who could remember all that?

43
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,360
Then how do you usually do it?

44
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,400
Show me.

45
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,000
That’s it?

46
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,720
I just don’t want to use my tongue.

47
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,520
Why not?

48
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,520
Because when I use my tongue, you get turned on.

49
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,920
And if you don’t use your tongue, how are you going to arouse someone?

50
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:58,040
If you can make me feel something without that, then you’ll prove me wrong, Jun.

51
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,960
You have to take it slow. Don’t rush.

52
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,520
Was it really that bad?

53
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,920
Don’t worry.

54
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:37,440
I’ll teach you. You’ll be amazing after I’m done.

55
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,720
Have you ever done this kind of thing with anyone else?

56
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,080
What do you mean?

57
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:16,400
Like this... the way you're helping me...

58
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,600
Just remember—you’re my student, Jun.

59
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,040
Huh?

60
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:32,640
Until I finish training you, don’t you go doing this with anyone else, okay?

61
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,960
So I’m really your student?

62
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,480
I’m serious.

63
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,000
Fine, alright.

64
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,000
I’ll master it then use it all at once—flawlessly.

65
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,160
So they’ll fall head over heels.

66
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:08,200
Hey, you can’t tell anyone about this. Seriously, don’t tell a soul.

67
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,480
Have I ever broken a promise to you?

68
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,200
No, but you love to mess with me.

69
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,280
Well, you’re just too fun to tease.

70
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,080
Ugh, what should I do with you?

71
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,560
You really sleep like you’re ruling the world—just like your dad said you would.

72
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,200
Sure, my place is near the office, but that doesn’t mean you get to sleep in like a log.

73
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,200
Hurry up. I’ll be late for work.

74
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,040
Why do you keep nagging?

75
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,320
And why didn’t you wear the shirt I hung up for you?

76
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,120
Didn’t want to.

77
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,360
Why?

78
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,880
Because people might realize it’s yours.

79
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,960
Student uniforms may look the same, but your smell... not so much.

80
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,760
That’s not funny.

81
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,880
Spit it out. What are you holding it in for—waiting for your dad?

82
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,520
I was savoring it.

83
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,640
You wanna recover faster or not?

84
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,280
Yeah.

85
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,800
Let me kiss you.

86
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,240
Whoa, what are you saying?

87
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,480
Give me your LINE.

88
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,520
I gave it to you before but you never added me.

89
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,960
Not giving it now.

90
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,880
Last time you weren’t around. Now you are.

91
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,760
So we can talk about steamy stuff at night.

92
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,960
What are you on about?

93
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,240
I’m hurt, you know.

94
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,520
Just sit down.

95
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,400
You’re always being so suggestive.

96
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,880
And about what I asked you to teach—it was just for that.

97
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,600
Not to satisfy your urges.

98
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,520
I was just messing with you—unless you actually want me to.

99
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,400
Maybe I do.

100
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,560
Give me your LINE—just LINE.

101
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,360
I’m not robbing you or anything.

102
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,920
Why do you have three and I only get two?

103
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,120
That’s it.

104
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,080
Ugh, I’m so full.

105
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,960
What?

106
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,120
For snacking during the day.

107
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,800
Thanks.

108
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,280
Hey, what’s up, Win?

109
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,960
You disappeared, bastard. How many rounds did you finish?

110
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,320
I’m heading to the office.

111
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,160
That’s a dodge. Not answering means something happened...

112
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,760
You’re silent now, huh? Jun, I’m telling Tai you’ve gone wild.

113
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,440
Yeah, I’ve been wild for a while now. Go ahead, tell him.

114
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,720
I heard there was a fight at the club last night—someone almost got stabbed. Did you see it?

115
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,120
Oh, and your boy Pop or whatever was with another guy too.

116
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,920
So... did you get someone new?

117
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,040
Yeah, I got someone new. Forget about Pop.

118
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:15,800
Dude, I’m telling you—it was a whole new experience. I met him by the bathroom.

119
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,160
So damn good. First time I’ve felt this way.

120
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,600
I’m just worried you’ll mess with the wrong person and get yourself killed before graduation.

121
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,760
Why are you so worried about me?

122
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,960
I feel bad for your dad and your sister.

123
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,480
Damn you.

124
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,960
For stuff like this, talk to Hia Sorn. That guy’s a pro.

125
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,960
Everyone says his moves in bed are unmatched.

126
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:46,880
Anyway, I gotta get to work. We’ll talk later.

127
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,720
What’s spicy-hot now?

128
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,600
The sausage just now—he asked what I ate.

129
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,160
Right, whatever.

130
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,560
So how was last night? Did Jun tell you what happened?

131
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,040
Nope, he said it wasn’t that Pop guy.

132
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,880
But he found someone new—outside the bathroom.

133
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,560
I really worry about him. He’s not as hardened as Sorn.

134
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,800
Why’s that?

135
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:32,320
Back when Sorn was abroad, he changed partners constantly.

136
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,200
Almost got his ass beat so many times.

137
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:39,680
No joke. Lucky for him, he’s good at dodging trouble.

138
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,720
Man, I really wanna be his student.

139
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,800
Win!

140
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,040
Just kidding, Hia. Like I’d actually dare.

141
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,000
Don’t let me catch you, though.

142
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,960
When did I say you could eat that?

143
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,160
During the day.

144
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,640
And what time is it now?

145
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,360
Still the day!

146
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,520
You’re not gonna thank me for last night?

147
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,480
Already claiming that? You helped me once, that’s it.

148
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,440
But you finished twice.

149
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,720
Sorn, you jerk.

150
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,000
Watch how you call me. I’ll smack that mouth of yours.

151
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,200
Alright, thanks for the help.

152
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,520
Do you have a mask in your car? I forgot my lip is busted.

153
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,000
It’s in the back. Grab it.

154
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,880
What’s with you?

155
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,680
Isn’t Win tired? Driving between your house and the factory every day?

156
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,320
Probably. He’s always complaining about it.

157
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,360
He should rent a condo near the factory. Better to rest than waste time driving.

158
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,880
Exactly. It’s risky to drive when you’re exhausted.

159
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,360
Yeah.

160
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:53,080
Hey, that’s Jun. Why’s he with Sorn? Don’t they not get along?

161
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,160
Yeah, I gotta go ask.

162
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,800
Why are you with Jun?

163
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:19,880
Saw him get off a bus and walking alone. Felt bad, so I picked him up.

164
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,680
Jun, why are you wearing a mask? Are you sick?

165
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,040
Yeah.

166
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,840
You okay, Jun? If not, just say so—I’ll write you a sick leave.

167
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,400
Do you have a fever?

168
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,480
Why’re you blocking me? Let me check on him.

169
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,600
I asked him already. He said he’s sick.

170
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:59,920
Then what’re you doing just standing here, Jun? Get inside! You won’t pass the internship like this!

171
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,960
Pae, Aei—I’m coming too.

172
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,880
I’ll head in first, Hia. See you.

173
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,520
So you’re not picking on the kid anymore?

174
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:15,000
Nope. Let him stop acting like a kid first—then I’ll treat him better.

175
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,640
Go to work.

176
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,720
Hey P’ Phut, good morning.

177
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,520
Yeah, morning.

178
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,120
What’s wrong with you? Why are you wearing a mask?

179
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,440
I’m not feeling well. Don’t want to spread anything to others.

180
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,480
Why’re you here so early today?

181
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:56,320
Had some errands to run, so I left home early.

182
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:04,080
Those errands wouldn’t happen to involve that fingerprint on your face? That hurt?

183
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,400
Hurt like hell.

184
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,280
Still not as bad as getting dumped.

185
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,600
Hey, you can’t cry here. People will see.

186
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I really loved her, you know? But no matter what I said, she never listened.

187
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,400
Alright, let me ask you one thing.

188
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:43,920
That person you’re talking about… is it the one you kissed by the fire escape?

189
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,400
You saw that!?

190
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:56,160
Don’t worry, I just happened to see it. Wasn’t snooping.

191
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,360
Alright, just don’t tell anyone.

192
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,880
Their name’s Vee.

193
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,000
And yeah… I cheated before.

194
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,560
But I’ve stopped now. For real.

195
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,760
You believe me, right?

196
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,800
Yeah, I do.

197
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,520
What should I do now?

198
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,600
Honestly, I don’t know either.

199
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,280
Help me out, will you?

200
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,760
Hold on, just a sec.

201
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,120
“You done talking to Phut yet?”

202
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,120
I gotta go now. Work’s piling up.

203
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:44,240
Hey, don’t leave yet. And thanks—for listening to me.

204
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,480
But… please don’t tell anyone, yeah?

205
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,560
Okay, I won’t. But you better sort yourself out.

206
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,000
No one meant for it to end like that.

207
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,680
Keep this between us, alright?

208
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,760
Jun, stay quiet about it, okay?

209
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,360
What were you talking to Phut about for so long?

210
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,640
Well, hey...

211
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,080
Someone’s going to notice those marks.

212
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,560
I just wanted to check your wound.

213
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,080
Why keep checking? You already saw it earlier.

214
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,440
Fine then. Get to work.

215
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,080
You’re here as an intern but always slacking off. I swear I’ll—

216
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,880
Old man, stop whining so much.

217
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,440
Why do kids always slack off these days?

218
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,280
Exactly. Slackers! Bleh!

219
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,640
I’m going.

220
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,240
Jun.

221
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,760
What now?

222
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,440
Come kiss me.

223
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,840
What the hell!?

224
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,440
What kind of crap are you saying!?

225
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,600
If you want to be an expert, you gotta practice often.

226
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,320
No. It’s work hours.

227
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,960
No one’s watching.

228
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,480
Yeah yeah, just pretend it’s practice.

229
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,600
I’m going to work.

230
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,640
“Why didn’t you come down for lunch?”

231
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,240
“How’d you know?”

232
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,840
“Because I’m smart.”

233
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,040
“Still working. I’ll go down later.”

234
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,880
“What do you want to eat?”

235
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,920
“Noodles.”

236
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,840
Why’d we come out in this heat? Why not just order delivery?

237
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,880
Because the Tokyo place I wanted doesn’t deliver.

238
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,720
It’s tough being your senior.

239
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,160
That’s Jae Tai and Jae Champ. Should we go say hi?

240
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,080
So what exactly do you want to eat?

241
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:43,160
Anything’s fine. Up to you. What do you want?

242
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:47,080
We’re standing in front of a chicken rice place. You want me to get basil pork or what?

243
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,200
Then just get chicken rice.

244
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,680
James said this place is pretty good.

245
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,040
“Pretty good” equals...?

246
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,720
Equals good, obviously.

247
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,960
Whoa, calm down. I was just teasing.

248
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,080
So are we eating or not?

249
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,040
Yes, we’re eating!

250
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,520
Alright then, let’s go. Don’t take your hangry out on me.

251
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,040
Hey Jun, getting a coffee too?

252
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:20,680
Yeah.

253
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,320
Don’t forget to add a little heart for me.

254
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,640
Geez, always teasing.

255
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,480
What’s a little flirting gonna hurt?

256
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,880
Hey, look over there.

257
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,320
You think P’ Sorn’s really seeing her?

258
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:41,400
Of course. Look at how tight they are.

259
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,600
They’re practically glued to each other these days.

260
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:52,160
To get in bed with P’ Sorn, you’ve got to be hot, pretty, and have a killer body.

261
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,320
If you’re not top-notch, there’s no way he’d sleep with you.

262
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,160
Alright, alright, back to work!

263
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,640
Come on, hurry up!

264
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,960
Hey! You eating or what?

265
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,560
What’s wrong with you?

266
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:07,040
This is like... an indirect kiss between you and me, huh?

267
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,360
You asshole.

268
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:14,680
What the hell are you even saying? Just eat already.

269
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,120
Hey Jun, your documents are done. I took care of it.

270
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,800
Thanks.

271
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,720
Delivery here!

272
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,360
Sorry!

273
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,880
It’s alright.

274
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,440
Just be careful next time, or you’ll crush everything.

275
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,960
Hello, food delivery.

276
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,560
Thanks!

277
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,960
Everything’s here.

278
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,960
Get together already. Just don’t break up, alright?

279
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,000
Ugh, my back hurts.

280
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,240
Hey guys.

281
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,320
You look wiped out.

282
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,160
Starving like hell.

283
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:43,400
Wanna hit convenient store? Fastest option. I’m craving snacks too.

284
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,120
Yeah, looks like we’ll have to.

285
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,240
I’m starving to death. Haven’t eaten since lunch.

286
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,680
If you’re that hungry, why didn’t you go grab something downstairs?

287
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,240
Still replying to emails.

288
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:03,080
Same here. Been running between the meeting room and the copy room all day.

289
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,560
Stop complaining or you’ll get fired.

290
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,640
Being an intern is so damn exhausting.

291
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,120
Hi, P’Penny.

292
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,040
Hello!

293
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,440
Hi there! What are you all up to?

294
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:23,000
We’re heading to get food with Jun. He hasn’t eaten since noon.

295
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,840
Alright then, enjoy. Just don’t come back too late.

296
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,320
Got it!

297
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,480
Let’s go

298
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:34,840
Let’s go?

299
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:41,920
Jun!

300
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,760
Why do you look so down?

301
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,360
I’m just hungry...

302
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,040
Okay, Let’s go!

303
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,760
I’m very hungry

304
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,720
Sorry, Jun. You’re soaked.

305
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,760
Thanks... for the umbrella.

306
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,000
No worries. It’s nothing.

307
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,880
Ooh my god, Jun’s actually kinda hot, huh?

308
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,920
Not even half as hot as me though, right?

309
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,040
We’re equal, bro.

310
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,720
Jun, you’re soaking wet. This ain’t “a little damp.”

311
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,640
What the hell did you do? You look like a drowned puppy.

312
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,560
What, does your convenient store have a leaky roof or something?

313
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,120
And you, Korn—how about finishing that task as fast as your eyes chase guys?

314
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:18,880
Well, P’ Sorn, Jun’s this hot—how could I not look?

315
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:26,800
Jun’s all wet—want me to help dry him off?

316
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,120
Great job drying, P’ Korn.

317
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,440
Korn!

318
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,120
I’ll get back to work, okay?

319
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,520
Let’s go, Phut, Aei, Pae. Follow me.

320
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,840
I’ll take you to dry—oops! I mean, get to work!

321
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,880
Bye for now~

322
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,600
Hey, let me have some too.

323
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,720
Here, take this shirt.

324
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,720
And this one’s for the office. It’s cold in there.

325
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,600
Thanks, Hia.

326
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:22,360
You done with your own work? Then quit poking into my brother’s business and get to yours.

327
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,640
You overthink too much.

328
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,800
I’m not messing with your brother, alright?

329
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,440
I need to piss—I swear I’ll do it in a bottle right here.

330
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,200
Dude, chill.

331
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,920
P’ Sorn, pass the shirt.

332
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,600
Why the hell did you let yourself get this soaked?

333
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,800
Lunch break was already over.

334
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,840
Wait, you really haven’t eaten since noon?

335
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,240
Why do you care? Just give it.

336
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,520
Answer me.

337
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:26,560
Why do you even care? It’s none of your business.

338
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,560
I never said I was gonna buy it for you.

339
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,960
Well, I wasn’t counting on you either.

340
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,920
There’s too much work. No time to eat.

341
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,720
I’ll treat you to dinner tonight to make it up—so stop sulking.

342
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,400
Who’s sulking? I’m not mad at you.

343
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,160
Then what’s with that sour face and pouty lips?

344
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:09,640
Why are you always touching my lips? God knows where those hands have been.

345
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,840
On you, obviously.

346
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,440
P’ Sorn, you jerk.

347
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:30,200
Why do you always slap “jerk” in front of my name? Learn to show me some respect, like Tai and Champ do.

348
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:38,240
Then act like someone worthy of respect! You always tease and take advantage.

349
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:43,040
Take advantage? I told you—more kisses equals more practice.

350
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:48,960
Aren’t we kissing too often? My lips are going numb. Once a day is enough.

351
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,040
If we do it too much, I’ll get bored of you.

352
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,000
And if I end up using these skills on someone else, won’t it go dull?

353
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,840
On who?

354
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,360
Why are you raising your voice?

355
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,640
You just said you’d use it on someone else. I told you—don’t.

356
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,960
Or you’ll embarrass yourself out there.

357
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,680
If you haven’t finished training, I’m not letting you go flirt with others.

358
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,840
I was just joking. Why so serious?

359
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:26,120
Even joking—don’t. I don’t like it.

360
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:32,200
And tonight—wait for me at the car after work. Don’t forget.

361
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,960
Oh hey, Jun.

362
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:56,600
Where’ve you been? Hey, I brought donuts for you.

363
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:03,800
Donuts may have holes, but my care for you is whole—P’ Korn’s always here ❤️

364
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,960
Thanks.

365
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,240
Dude, I’m blushing.

366
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:10,400
Hey Jun, what happened to your face?

367
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:18,680
Oh no! What happened? Does it hurt?

368
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,320
Let me see.

369
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,160
It’s nothing, Hia.

370
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,960
Don’t lie to me.

371
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,280
What did you do? Does it hurt?

372
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,680
It’s just...

373
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,400
Let’s go to Police station with me —now.

374
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,680
It’s fine, Hia. Just a small wound—it’ll heal soon.

375
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,520
Small or not, you still have to report it.

376
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,680
Was he trying to kill you or what?

377
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,520
What’s with Sorn? He knew about this and didn’t tell me?

378
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,920
Sorn! Come here.

379
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,160
You, get back to work upstairs. I’ll handle this.

380
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,640
So you knew about this?

381
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:24,480
You didn’t think to tell me? You disappeared yesterday—got into a fight, didn’t you?

382
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:30,160
What if something had happened to Jun? Could you take responsibility?

383
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:35,920
Calm down, will you? What are you getting so worked up for?

384
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,000
It’s over now. I helped your boy, didn’t I?

385
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,240
He didn’t get gutted. He’s back at work, safe and sound.

386
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,040
Are you two... something?

387
00:40:53,360 --> 00:41:02,360
It’s Sorn—last night Jun got into a fight at the club. Sorn knew, but didn’t say a word to me.

388
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,520
Whoa, really? Is he okay?

389
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,240
Jun’s still just a kid.

390
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:23,320
But he’s not a toddler anymore. He’s got his own life to live.

391
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,000
Let him learn things on his own a bit.

392
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,000
But his dad entrusted him to me!

393
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:35,440
Don’t you trust me to look after him?

394
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:41,840
If you look after him, you’ll just keep teasing him. He’ll end up hating you.

395
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,360
I’m not that much of a jerk, am I?

396
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,800
Sorn...

397
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,680
You’re a jerk.

398
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,720
You asshole.

399
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,720
Once you’re done, send it to me.

400
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,720
Got it. See you.

401
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,680
Bye.

402
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,640
You done?

403
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:28,240
I’m staying at the condo tonight.

404
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,520
Why?

405
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,120
Because I have to be at the factory tomorrow.

406
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,280
Oh right, I forgot.

407
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,240
How you getting back?

408
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,320
Probably just take a taxi.

409
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:52,080
A taxi? Nah, I’ll give you a ride. Easier that way.

410
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:57,760
You’ll be dead tired driving around like that and get home super late.

411
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:02,480
Don’t worry, I’m off tomorrow. I’ll drop you off. Chill.

412
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,800
Alright, up to you.

413
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,400
You act like a total sneak, you know that?

414
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,800
I just don’t wanna deal with Hia Champ and Hia Tai’s questions.

415
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,120
Why’s that?

416
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:39,280
You and I don’t get along, yet we’re hanging out—don’t you think that’s weird?

417
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:46,720
If they start asking questions, ugh, I’m too lazy to answer.

418
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:51,040
So what are you gonna say if they ask?

419
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,640
I dunno. Haven’t thought about it.

420
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,840
Just tell them you’re my boy. If you’re mine, you’ve got nothing to worry about.

421
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,280
If they have questions, they can come ask me directly.

422
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,360
You’re just spouting nonsense.

423
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,720
Hey, what are you doing?

424
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:23,880
It’s hot! Hia Tai gave me two shirts, I’m wearing the short-sleeve one.

425
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,240
Asshole

426
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,920
Cheers?

427
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,640
Name’s Penny.

428
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:04,720
Ugh, I’m so full. I can barely walk now.

429
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,000
Hey, I’m just stopping to check out some clothes real quick.

430
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:33,080
Whoa, this one’s really nice!

431
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,880
How much?

432
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,160
2,500 baht.

433
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:48,560
not buying?.

434
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:57,000
It’s expensive. I need to save up. Don’t want to burden Jae Poy.

435
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,680
Jae Poy? Your sister, right?

436
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,080
Yeah.

437
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,160
If you like it, I’ll get it for you.

438
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,280
No thanks. Too pricey.

439
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,800
Won’t make me go broke or anything.

440
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:41,080
Don’t come collecting later—I’ve got nothing to pay you back with.

441
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:47,200
You talk too much. I’ll just shut you up with a kiss.

442
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:52,000
Here you go, customer. Thank you!

443
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:53,720
Can I grab one more?

444
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:57,160
Go ahead, but I’m not paying for that one. Let’s go.

445
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,640
Let’s go

446
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,720
Jun.

447
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,040
Jun!

448
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,560
We’re here.

449
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:34,240
Thanks, bro.

450
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:43,200
Jun, don’t forget to take your meds. You still feel warm.

451
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,360
I’m heading out now.

452
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,520
“Win...”

453
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:42,600
“If someone you don’t like acts like they care about you... would your heart still skip a beat?”

454
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,760
“No one gets butterflies for someone they don’t like, man.”

455
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:50,440
“It only happens when you actually like them.”

456
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,640
Thanks a lot for the ride.

457
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,240
No big deal.

458
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:35,840
Wanna come up, grab a bite before heading back?

459
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,720
Sure, why not?

460
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,160
Let’s go.

461
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:52,360
This is all I’ve got—just something to fill you up for now.

462
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,080
It’s delicious already.

463
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,480
Wait... what are you doing?
