1
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,840
What would you like?

2
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,039
One iced mocha, less sweet.

3
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,800
Sure. Please wait a moment.

4
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,880
Thanks.

5
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,120
Hey there.

6
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,600
Hey.

7
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,280
Oh, P’Phut! Hello!

8
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,120
Sup, man.

9
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,120
I’ll have an iced mocha, too.

10
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,759
Got it. Please wait a moment.

11
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,520
Hang on. Have you eaten? I’ll treat you—pick anything.

12
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,640
No thanks, I’m on a diet.

13
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,080
Good, saves my money.

14
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,520
So what will you do next?

15
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,720
Probably back to the same old workroom.

16
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,320
So, has Sorn been rough on you?

17
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,440
All the time.

18
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,760
One hot chocolate, please.

19
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,680
Alright. Please wait a moment.

20
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,800
P’Yo, you’re in early today.

21
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,320
I always come at this time. You know that.

22
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,120
How have you been?

23
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,800
I’m good. and you?

24
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,040
I’m good too.

25
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,720
Where are you going next?

26
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,079
Phut!

27
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,360
Hello P’Vee.

28
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,480
Jun, I’m off to work!

29
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,480
Excuse me, your drinks are ready.

30
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,880
I’m heading back to work.

31
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,920
Oh...

32
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,120
Wow, such dedication.

33
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,079
Of course. Hardworking people, you know?

34
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,520
Jun.

35
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,160
Me and Aey walked past the café earlier.

36
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,720
Saw a girl. Know her? Looked like she had beef with Phut.

37
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,440
Oh, that’s Vi. She’s Phut’s girlfriend.

38
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,440
P’Vee?

39
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,120
Yeah.

40
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:05,160
Hey Jwin, your wound’s healed? Looking good again, huh?

41
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,680
That day I was so shocked. I thought my ass was broken.

42
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,440
The wound has healed.

43
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,480
It's good to come back handsome.

44
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,600
I look handsome when I have a wound.

45
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,000
Okay, I think so too.

46
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,279
P’Sorn seems to care about Jun a lot.

47
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,600
If I weren’t rooting for P’Penny...

48
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,920
I’d have shipped Sorn and Jun a long time ago.

49
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,120
What the hell are you talking about?

50
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,760
Uh.

51
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,280
You’re just dreaming.

52
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,200
Hey, if we really get together, we'll give you credit.

53
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,320
Talking nonsense.

54
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,520
keep working.

55
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,240
Wow, what are you up to?

56
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,680
Putting away snacks.

57
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,440
Why’d you buy so much?

58
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,680
It’s for my dog.

59
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,320
Eats a lot.

60
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:27,680
Some dogs, especially picky ones, might not even eat that.

61
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,120
How would you know? You a dog or something?

62
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,120
I don’t. I guessed. Got it?

63
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:52,640
Try and see. If it doesn’t eat, I'll stuff it in your mouth.—like last night.

64
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,920
P’Sorn.

65
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,440
I....

66
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,920
Not now, I have to work first.

67
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,800
Really can’t?

68
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,520
You're so naughty.

69
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,640
It’s your fault, P’Sorn. You’re like this.

70
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,159
Why?

71
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,440
Come on.

72
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,920
Jun!

73
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,200
It’s very thrilling.

74
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,520
Ahh!!!

75
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:16,000
Hmm? Who gave you this, P’Penny? Someone I know?

76
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,920
No idea.

77
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,440
Alright.

78
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I’ll just leave it here, then.

79
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,320
Go ahead and leave it.

80
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,800
What’s wrong.

81
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,600
Hey, P’Phut?

82
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:04,840
I know I was wrong, but Vi didn’t have to rub it in like that.

83
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:13,760
I feel terrible. So bad I don’t even know what’s good enough to earn her trust back.

84
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,600
Don’t, P’. Don’t be like that.

85
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:25,120
Come here. Don’t cry

86
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,840
Thanks, man.

87
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,960
What happened to your neck?

88
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,800
It’s nothing.

89
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,680
Turn around.

90
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,280
It’s nothing.

91
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,480
I can see it.

92
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,120
How’s that “nothing”?

93
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,160
It really is nothing.

94
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,240
Turn around.

95
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,440
Isn’t it my personal business!!!

96
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:53,040
I’m sorry, didn’t mean to.

97
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,880
I’m sorry too. I didn’t mean to say that.

98
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,280
I get it. It’s fine. I’m your bro, just worried about you.

99
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,800
Whatever, let’s eat.

100
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,800
Here he is—my beloved little bro! Let me walk you through the menu—

101
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,240
Okay.

102
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,040
Whoa! You’re eating before I finish!

103
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,280
Tasty.

104
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,240
First, spicy papaya salad with pickled crab. Second, blue crab salad.

105
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,600
Great taste

106
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,400
And the best—spicy Vietnamese pork salad with salted egg yolk.

107
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,400
Whoa, why’d you order so much?

108
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,000
For you, bro. My treat!

109
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,400
Oh really?

110
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,520
Only the best for my favorite bro.

111
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,760
I’m deeply moved!

112
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,560
Is it okay?

113
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,160
Sure.

114
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,520
New Caption

115
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,720
I come here often. Vee likes it too…

116
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,120
Oho, caught ya.

117
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,160
Isn’t that P’Phut, Vee’s boyfriend?

118
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,200
Yeah, but who’s he with?

119
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,680
Try this one.

120
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,800
What now?

121
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,400
Salted egg yolk salad.

122
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,520
I don’t really like salted yolk. It’s kinda gross.

123
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:09,880
That hurts, man. Just try it once—for me.

124
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:16,160
And as thanks for letting me cry on your shoulder.

125
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:16,800
Whoa.

126
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,520
Just a bite, okay?

127
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,320
Nah…

128
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,720
I’ll feed you train-style!

129
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,440
Fine. Just once.

130
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:30,720
Alright, here it comes—choo choo, open wide!

131
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,440
Great taste?

132
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,000
Hey, snap a pic. I’m telling Vi her boyfriend’s cheating again.

133
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,920
Is the angle good? Zoom in—yeah, right there! Snap it!

134
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,000
Does it feel sinful?

135
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,360
Mmm.

136
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,800
Did it burst in your mouth?

137
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,520
Mmm-hmm.

138
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,640
Damn, how was it?

139
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,920
Tastes good, but I don’t like it.

140
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,440
Why not?

141
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,440
This one’s better.

142
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,880
Oh, really? Dig in, then!

143
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,800
Give the whole shell

144
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,840
It doesn't have crab meat.

145
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,200
What is this, Phut!?

146
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,960
It’s not what you think, Vee. You misunderstood.

147
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,360
Misunderstood? You two were hugging in public!

148
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,840
Why believe others? It’s not like that!

149
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,320
It’s because I can’t trust you. That’s why I get betrayed like this.

150
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,440
Vee, calm down.

151
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,240
Why would you do this, Phut? Huh!?

152
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,000
Just listen to me!

153
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,040
P’Puth, what’s going on?

154
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,480
You’ve been hooking up with Phut, haven’t you?

155
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,600
Wait, no! You’ve got it all wrong!

156
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,520
Hey, that’s enough! Stop it, Vee!

157
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,520
Then call me wrong? How could you!

158
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,880
You hug her like that.

159
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,040
Vee!!

160
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,280
How could you do this?

161
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,720
Vee, stop! Don’t hurt him!

162
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,280
Oh, My god!!

163
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,440
It’s not what you think, Vee!

164
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,680
P’Sorn, bad news! Jun’s in trouble!

165
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,320
Where?

166
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,000
Downstairs! Phut’s girlfriend is slapping him like crazy!

167
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,720
How did she get a mark like that?

168
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,880
Vee!!

169
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,280
Vee, please stop! It’s not like that!

170
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,720
What the hell are you doing?

171
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,040
What are you doing to my kid!?

172
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:25,200
Sorn, I’m sorry. My girlfriend misunderstood. She thought I was with Jun.

173
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,640
It’s not a misunderstanding. That girl is sneaking around with Phut!

174
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:33,040
Look at the red mark on her neck! Isn’t that proof enough? Still protecting her?

175
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:39,680
When would my junior and your boyfriend even have time to do anything? He’s been with me the whole time.

176
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,720
You’re so paranoid over your man, you’re turning on everyone. Are you insane?

177
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,240
Praew.

178
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:53,880
Yeah.

179
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,200
Take Jun back to the office.

180
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,440
Come on, Jun.

181
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,840
Does it hurt a lot?

182
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,480
And you, Phut. You and your girl—we need to talk.

183
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:20,680
Sorn, listen. I’m really sorry, but there’s nothing between me and Jun!

184
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,120
I know.

185
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,560
But even I don’t know where that mark on him neck came from. I didn’t do it.

186
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,000
It was me.

187
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,920
I was messing around with Jun. I don’t want your girl blaming him.

188
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,320
And how do I know that mark was from you?

189
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,360
Maybe you’re just covering for him.

190
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,960
Vee, I told you—there’s nothing going on.

191
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,160
And how can I trust you, Phut?

192
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,120
Then what do you want me to do?

193
00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:01,200
Then from now on, stay away from that kid. Don’t even talk to him!

194
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:08,119
Vee, that’s crazy! We work at the same company. I can’t avoid him completely!

195
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:12,800
I don’t know what your solution is…

196
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,119
But what you both need to do is apologize to Jun.

197
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,079
He’s done nothing wrong.

198
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,720
And you, Phut…

199
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,600
Just admit the mark on his neck and end it.

200
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:50,360
Why is it every time I’m not around, Jun ends up in trouble?

201
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,440
Guess I need to have a talk with Phut. Can’t let this keep happening.

202
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,080
What happened?

203
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,240
Phut’s girlfriend started drama with Jun. Over who knows what.

204
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,240
Damn, what’s going on, Sorn?

205
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,440
Just a small misunderstanding.

206
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,000
It’ll be sorted. No big deal.

207
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,960
But what was it even about? I can’t find Jun anywhere!

208
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,480
Phut’s girlfriend got jealous—she thinks Phut and Jun are lovers.

209
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:32,400
Seriously? What kind of logic is that? Phut and Jun? must be blind. See an eye doctor.

210
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,600
And you, stop overworking. Pack up and go home.

211
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,960
Get home safe.

212
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,880
Where are you?

213
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,880
Home, obviously.

214
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,480
What? You didn’t wait for me?

215
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,000
Come on, it’s late! Who would wait?

216
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,160
Typical you. Anyway, want anything? I’m about to head back.

217
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,000
Nah, I just ordered food.

218
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,840
From where? That place near the village?

219
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,040
Nope. I called Je Jom’s place.

220
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,520
There it is, the rice has just arrived.

221
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,880
Wait! Turn your camera on.

222
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,560
Why?

223
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,800
I don’t trust you.

224
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:35,000
Ugh, seriously? I’m getting my food. Bye now.

225
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,440
Don’t bother with that food. Looks like you’ve got backup.

226
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,560
It’s shrimp over rice. I’m saving it for tomorrow.

227
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,560
You close with Jom or what?

228
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,280
Not really. He’s just easy to talk to.

229
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,000
And what about me?

230
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,200
Are we close now?

231
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,440
Why are you asking?

232
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,520
You said you only call people “hia” if you’re close.

233
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:37,800
You call Jom “hia,” but me? Just “P’”

234
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,280
Sometimes even “damn P’.”

235
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,760
I don't know if we're close or not.

236
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,240
I just know that...

237
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,160
I like you more than before.

238
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,320
What’d you buy?

239
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,000
Check it out.

240
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,040
Bamboo shoot curry.

241
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:39,920
Sorry again for scolding you in that meeting.

242
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:50,040
Don’t worry about it. I messed up too. Just felt embarrassed, but I’m okay.

243
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,080
Penny.

244
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,440
Can I ask for a chance?

245
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,560
I really care about what we have.

246
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,480
I want us to be something real.

247
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,640
Will you give me that chance?

248
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,760
Actully...

249
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,920
I feel so good with you.

250
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:35,440
But I still love my freedom. I’m not ready to commit.

251
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,360
Okay. I get it.

252
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,200
You get what?

253
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,080
I get…

254
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,000
Like this.

255
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,920
I’ll go grab a towel.

256
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,160
Wait.

257
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,000
Don’t. Just stay with me.

258
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,320
Do you like that?

259
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,760
I like it.

260
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,800
Can it be more than this?

261
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,560
You heading home tonight?

262
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,480
Yeah.

263
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,360
Want me to drop you off?

264
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,560
It’s okay, P’. I can go by myself. Don’t want to bother you.

265
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,200
Who said it’s a bother?

266
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:56,760
Sorn, don’t go yet. I need to talk to you.

267
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,560
So, want that ride or not?

268
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:09,400
It’s fine, you go talk.

269
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,920
Where are you?

270
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,160
Waiting for the car.

271
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,640
I'll go pick it up.

272
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,400
Jun.

273
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,960
Yeah? What is it?

274
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,520
Want to visit my hometown?

275
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,280
I’ll think about it and let you know.

276
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,600
Dad, Sis—can I talk to you for a sec?

277
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,040
What’s up?

278
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,680
Can I go visit P’Sorn’s place in the South?

279
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,080
Please, Dad?

280
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,680
It’s up to Dad. He’s grown now anyway.

281
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:11,800
Fine. Go if you want. But don’t be a burden on Sorn.

282
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,600
Come on, Dad. I’m not a kid!

283
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:21,280
Oh look, P’Sorn’s here. Talk to him yourself.

284
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,560
Uncle Nueng, hello.

285
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,640
Hello.

286
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,200
Want some iced tea, Sorn?

287
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,960
Thank you.

288
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,000
I’m coming too, Sis!

289
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,680
Jwin said you invited him to your place in the South.

290
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,040
When are you heading out?

291
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,320
Late this morning. I already got plane tickets.

292
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,320
Jun, pack your bags. Don’t miss that flight.

293
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,560
Take care of him for me, alright?

294
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,720
Of course.

295
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,320
Hey!

296
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,520
Oh! Hello, P’Thanu!

297
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,360
Just call me Nu.

298
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:25,600
That Tai little brother? Doesn’t look like him.

299
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,440
Nah, he’s Tai younger friend.

300
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,840
Yes.

301
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,800
Cool. Let’s go inside.

302
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,280
Sorn, all this yours?

303
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,520
Nah, it’s my mom’s.

304
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,560
Your mom’s loaded.

305
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,160
Wanna be her daughter-in-law?

306
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,120
Hey you—come here.

307
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,920
You and him close or what?

308
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,120
I’ve known him since he was little.

309
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,760
Dang, raising a sugar baby, huh?

310
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,000
The hell are you even saying?

311
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,160
He’s tai fave.

312
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:24,320
He’s staying with me now, so I’ve gotta take care of him. Or Tai kill me.

313
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:30,880
Wow, Ty must mean a lot to you. You’re spoiling this one.

314
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:37,240
But I’ve never seen you hang with a kid more than 5 minutes.

315
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,800
I’m just not used to it.

316
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:46,680
Yeah yeah, get inside. Jun, let’s go.

317
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,000
How’s Aunt Noi’s deal going?

318
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:11,239
She bought it. Your mom wasn’t gonna miss it. Still complained at her, though.

319
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:18,440
I kept following up, but Madam won’t listen to anyone—except you.

320
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,000
What is this hell you, elder brother?

321
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,679
What are you looking at, my little sister?

322
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,280
Your brother’s cool.

323
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,000
I like him.

324
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,520
Why’d you do that!?

325
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:03,040
You’re even jealous over your brother? I just looked!

326
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:08,600
You just met Nu and already said he’s cool—and you like him?

327
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,760
You fall too fast.

328
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,480
I just said what I thought.

329
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,560
So I’m not cool?

330
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:15,920
Nope.

331
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,080
I’ll make you say I’m cool—right on my chest, Jun.

332
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,080
Wait here. I’ll be back.

333
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,280
Where you going?

334
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,840
To pee. Wanna help me hold it?

335
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,960
is it? Do you need help carrying it?

336
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,720
Are you serious?

337
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,640
Why do I look so much better in photos?

338
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:47,280
Ugh, it’s burning hot out! Just a short drive to the market and I’m roasted.

339
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,200
Mom!

340
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,760
Oh my! When did you get here? Why didn’t you tell me?

341
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,200
why didn’t you tell her?

342
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,960
Jun.

343
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,640
this is my mom.

344
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,960
Mom, this is Jun—Tai beloved friend I told you about.

345
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,720
Hello, Auntie.

346
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:13,320
Hello, dear. Just call me Mom like Sorn’s friends do.

347
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,200
Yes, mom.

348
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,920
What’re you cooking, Mom?

349
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:33,280
I made “aw-dib” curry. Aunt Noi brought it, so I made it with fish.

350
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,040
Jun, do you know what aw-dib is?

351
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,920
No, Ma’am.

352
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:46,160
It’s like taro stems but not quite. People usually make sour curry with it. Pretty bland.

353
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:51,080
It’s kinda crunchy but has no taste on its own.

354
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:58,720
The flavor comes from the sour curry seeping into it. Can you handle spicy food, Jun?

355
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,280
Totally! I can eat spicy.

356
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,880
Go scoop some rice, dear.

357
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,800
Mom, better make a separate bowl.

358
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:12,360
Last time I made fish kidney curry, he was panting like a dog.

359
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,040
I’m fine, Mom. No need for that.

360
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,120
Go on, get some rice.

361
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:35,040
Mom, seriously… has he always had such a mouth?

362
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,240
That’s just how he is, dear.

363
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,600
No wonder y’all don’t keep dogs—his mouth’s already full of bark.

364
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:46,440
Just don’t say that around him. You can tell me, though.

365
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:51,240
Heh, your face is so sweet, Mom. I say that and he slaps me!

366
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,880
Whoa!

367
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,520
All this is your mom’s?

368
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:08,840
Yes.

369
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,680
From that corner all the way down—it’s all ours.

370
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,520
Damn. That’s rich.

371
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,400
Uncle Nui! Hello!

372
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,680
Oh hey, Sorn.

373
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:36,480
This is Uncle Nui, Mom’s helper. Uncle, this is Jun, my junior.

374
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,440
Nice to meet you.

375
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,120
Hello there. Good-looking, huh?

376
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,600
Thank you, Sir.

377
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:45,800
Uncle Nui, how’s the palm plantation going?

378
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:57,600
Oh, that? Gotta keep the workers watering and fertilizing. Otherwise, it won’t make it.

379
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:06,880
I already talked to Nu about getting someone to mow. Look at it—it’s a jungle out there!

380
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,600
What about the other side?

381
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:24,880
Oh, that side? Almost ready for sale. With that much land—hoo boy, I’m gonna be rolling in money!

382
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,040
Time for a photo.

383
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,480
Want me to help? I’m good at taking pics.

384
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,040
Sure, P’Nu. Thanks! Here.

385
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,520
Stand right there.

386
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,920
Okay, one more. Just one more!

387
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,080
Take another picture.

388
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,440
So cool, I'm telling you.

389
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,400
Really.

390
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,880
Whoa, you’re amazing at this.

391
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,720
Yeah, I love this one.

392
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,240
New Caption

393
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,400
Hey Jun.

394
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:01,440
just a few meters down—something fun’s happening. Wanna check it out?

395
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,600
Yeah, let’s go!

396
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,720
Is that booze? Go for it.

397
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,280
What, no invite for me?

398
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:26,800
Hey little bro, come drink! Try some! Come on!

399
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,000
Can I join you guys?

400
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,080
Why are you standing there? Sit, sit!

401
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,000
Come here.

402
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,600
Hello, everyone.

403
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,000
Hey there, kid. Come, have a seat.

404
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,680
Whose is this? Take it, take it.

405
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,440
Whoa, so many snacks today.

406
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:46,960
Man, they love drinking moonshine around here. You ever tried it?

407
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:56,480
Never, bro. I think it’s too strong. If I get drunk, P'Son will scold me again.

408
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:06,720
What are you so scared of?

409
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,280
Go on, go on. Give it a try, kid.

410
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,440
That’s enough, that’s enough!

411
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,360
Just a little, please.

412
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,160
Smell good?

413
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:37,600
That’s insanely bitter, bro. What the hell is this taste?

414
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,080
Hey, bro, wake up!

415
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,000
Hey,Jun.

416
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,200
Bro, wake up.

417
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,600
Jun are you drunk?

418
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,480
Wake up.

419
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,360
Junnn!

420
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,800
Ugh… I can’t… I’m wasted.

421
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,560
You made me drink alone…

422
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,920
Ugh… I can’t… I’m wasted.

423
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,280
You drunk or what?

424
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,840
You’re looking kinda hot now.

425
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,800
Jun, you’re totally drunk.

426
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,520
Oh, Mom. You're so hardworking.

427
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,560
Looks like your boy gets along with my mom.

428
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,080
I’ve been wondering about something.

429
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,920
Does Jun have a girlfriend?

430
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:08,200
Hey Jun, wanna go walk around the temple fair with me?

431
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,600
Yeah, let’s go!

432
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,800
You’re doing this ‘cause you care, right?

433
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,400
Yeah.

434
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,800
Even if you always yell at me... I still like you.
