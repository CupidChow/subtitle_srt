1
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,520
Do you still remember me?

2
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,840
I’m still the same Jun.

3
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,880
Now I’m officially a full-time employee at RT Design.

4
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,600
Not long after graduation.

5
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,960
I started working here right away.

6
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,080
Everyone at the company is still the same.

7
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,080
P’Put and P’Wi already broke up.

8
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,720
And things didn’t work out with P’Yo either.

9
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,120
Unlike P’Korn and P’Preaw—

10
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,880
They’re still the company’s gossip duo as always.

11
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,680
And what about Hia Tai and Hia Champ?

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,360
They ran off abroad for their honeymoon together.

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,800
Oh, and when Hia wasn’t around

14
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,560
P’June got even stricter.

15
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:11,720
Luckily, I still had P’Penny to look out for me.

16
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,160
But most importantly

17
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,480
No one in the company

18
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,720
has any idea that

19
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,480
Sorn and I…

20
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,280
are…

21
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:21,960
Jun.

22
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,240
What is it, Sorn?

23
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,640
Come here for a bit.

24
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,079
What’s up?

25
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,160
What are you doing?

26
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,160
Just finishing up some work.

27
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,760
What is it?

28
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,160
You’re late.

29
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,280
Did you finish packing my stuff?

30
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,280
What did you pack?

31
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,720
Umm…

32
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,360
Three pairs of socks.

33
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,040
Five pairs of underwear.

34
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,480
Oh, and that pair of socks

35
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,000
Save it for tomorrow.

36
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,960
All the clothes are packed,

37
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,720
plus toiletries.

38
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,000
And most importantly,

39
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,600
your razor.

40
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,920
Everything’s complete, nothing’s missing.

41
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,600
I’m only gone for a week.

42
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,040
You packed like I’m moving abroad.

43
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:34,840
Well,

44
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,160
better be prepared, right?

45
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,720
What if your beard grows out again like last time?

46
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,200
If a client sees you…

47
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,240
and cancels the deal, what then?

48
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,520
Hia Tai will kill you.

49
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,520
So don’t forget to shave.

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,920
I don’t even want to go.

51
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,920
This time it feels too long.

52
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,120
Don’t try to act all clingy now.

53
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,680
Last time you left

54
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,040
you didn’t say any of this.

55
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,720
But this time, it’s longer than usual.

56
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,320
Can I just not go?

57
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,279
I just want to stay with my baby.

58
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,360
Can James go in my place?

59
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,880
Stop acting spoiled.

60
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,600
Just go do your job.

61
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,120
Earn lots of money

62
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,120
so you can buy me snacks.

63
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,960
I’m not acting spoiled.

64
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,200
But you didn’t pack everything yet, you know.

65
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,000
Belt.

66
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,760
Everything’s done.

67
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,080
Nothing’s missing.

68
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,680
All set?

69
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,280
Not yet.

70
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:00,920
Really?

71
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,200
Clothes.

72
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,320
Shoes.

73
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,400
They’re all there, Sorn.

74
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,800
What’s not complete?

75
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,920
I didn’t forget anything.

76
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,680
This piece right here.

77
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,240
Can’t I just pack you in my bag?

78
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,240
I’ll be gone for so many days.

79
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,640
I’ll miss you like crazy.

80
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,440
Feel better now?

81
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,080
No.

82
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,800
I still miss you.

83
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,400
Hm.

84
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,480
That’s enough.

85
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:22,960
Not enough.

86
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,400
Fine, go all out then.

87
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,760
Fold yourself in and pack up.

88
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,800
Can I take you with me?

89
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,440
Double-check everything, okay?

90
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,840
You’ve got your passport, right?

91
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,720
The tablet’s in your bag.

92
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,520
You didn’t forget anything, right?

93
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,400
Didn’t forget, babe.

94
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,440
We should hurry.

95
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,520
I’ll end up missing the flight.

96
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,600
Mm.

97
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,080
While I’m gone

98
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,400
Don’t go acting too flirty.

99
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,120
Why do you always dress up so sharp anyway?

100
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,360
It annoys the hell out of me.

101
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,760
Especially when people scream for you.

102
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,360
“Jun this, Jun that” all the time.

103
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,720
Look who’s talking.

104
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,240
When you go out, all the girls go crazy over you.

105
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,720
Hmph.

106
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,960
Besides, P’Penny says you’ve got major charm.

107
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,040
Even more now that you’re taken.

108
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:46,920
Hmph.

109
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,320
Want me to bring you something back from Japan?

110
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,880
Snacks.

111
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,320
Same as always, huh.

112
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,160
Well, they’re tasty.

113
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,360
Give me a kiss.

114
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,840
Didn’t you kiss me this morning already?

115
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,200
Can you go now?

116
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,080
Okay.

117
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,320
Hurry back.

118
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,280
I will.

119
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,720
Hey Win,

120
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,280
doesn’t your family get mad about you dyeing your hair like that?

121
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,320
Nah, Dad and Mom don’t care.

122
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,360
Only Tai nags me.

123
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,720
Morning and night, nonstop.

124
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,720
Says the color looks unprofessional when talking to clients.

125
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,480
But I work at the factory, man.

126
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,320
All I see every day are warehouses and piles of wood.

127
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,320
Like I really need to look formal for that.

128
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,960
And besides...

129
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,600
He’s not even here to nag me right now.

130
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,960
You jerk.

131
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,240
He’s only gone for two weeks.

132
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,720
On his honeymoon.

133
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,560
How can you talk about him like that?

134
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,040
So what?

135
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,800
He’s gone for two whole weeks.

136
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,240
Doesn’t he miss his little bro at all?

137
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,360
Oh right, and Sorn went on a business trip to Japan.

138
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,720
Yeah

139
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,400
but just for a week.

140
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,480
That’s still long.

141
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,160
You’re not dying of heartbreak?

142
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,480
Normally you two are glued together.

143
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,240
Of course I miss him

144
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,120
but

145
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,440
we talk every day.

146
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,360
What about you? Do you talk to your brother at all?

147
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,080
Hah. He’s just busy with his wife.

148
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,520
Wife

149
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,080
Fine, you pick up then.

150
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,520
Hello, bro!

151
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,920
Win, you little shit.

152
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,520
Where’s my wife?

153
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,480
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

154
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,880
First thing you ask is about your wife?

155
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,280
Don’t wanna talk to your little brother first?

156
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,280
Who the hell wants to talk to a brat like you?

157
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,640
Fine, fine, I’ll let you talk to him.

158
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:07,920
But first,

159
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,040
say it nicely like

160
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:17,640
“Win, my dear brother, may I please talk to my beloved husband?”

161
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,640
You’re dead when I see you.

162
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,440
What’s he saying?

163
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,640
You’re annoying

164
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,800
Hey, what’s up, Sorn?

165
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,360
You with Win right now?

166
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,880
Yeah, we’re out grabbing something to eat.

167
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,200
What about you?

168
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,800
What are you doing?

169
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,880
Just finished dinner.

170
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,200
Once you’re done, head straight home.

171
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,760
I’ll call you tonight.

172
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,280
Okay.

173
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,240
Take care of yourself,Sorn.

174
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,440
Bye.

175
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,680
Told you he calls me all the time.

176
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,120
What does he even call for?

177
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,800
Just random stuff.

178
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,120
Ohh.

179
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,920
What the hell are you grinning at?

180
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,600
I’m not.

181
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,920
Bullshit, Win.

182
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,360
I know exactly what’s going through your head.

183
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:12,840
Okay

184
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,200
Hey, what’s up, Sorn?

185
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,040
Have you showered?

186
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,840
Mhm, I did.

187
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,800
I was out all day. Win invited me to play badminton.

188
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,880
I was all sweaty. So I quickly showered.

189
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,520
Good.

190
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,720
At least you had Win to play with so you wouldn’t be lonely.

191
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,920
That’s not the same, Sorn.

192
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,120
Aren’t you in a hurry to get back?

193
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,440
Why, what’s up?

194
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,680
Don’t say it like that.

195
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,480
If I’m not supposed to say it to my wife, then who should I say it to?

196
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,840
How can you say that when we’re far apart like this?

197
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,120
If you were close

198
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,120
I’d just tackle-hug you until I stopped missing you.

199
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,040
Please don’t say that.

200
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,760
Especially when I’m alone.

201
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,520
You’re just too adorable.

202
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,280
How could I not miss you?

203
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,680
Come on, show me what are you wearing to bed?

204
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,400
No need,

205
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,800
stop being naughty.

206
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,880
Please.

207
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,160
Come on.

208
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,680
I want to sleep having sweet dreams.

209
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,320
Please.

210
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,800
Don’t screenshot this, okay?

211
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,000
Damn,

212
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,800
with you that handsome, how could I not miss you?

213
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,560
Can I kiss the screen?

214
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,760
Sorn,

215
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,000
if you say that again I’ll hang up for real.

216
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,200
I’m not teasing.

217
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,960
I really miss you, Jun.

218
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,600
It’s just not the same without you.

219
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,000
Everything feels so quiet.

220
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,920
Then hurry back.

221
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,960
Okay.

222
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,800
I’ll hurry back to see my wife.

223
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:02,960
Jun

224
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,880
Huh?

225
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,680
I want...

226
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,640
Want to sleep?

227
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,000
Want to do it?

228
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,640
Do what, Sorn?

229
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,800
It’s because we’re not together.

230
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,080
the more I see your face,

231
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,120
the more I miss you

232
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,680
Let me see your shoulder, Jun.

233
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,880
Can I see yours first?

234
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:49,880
Already open.

235
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,960
If you were close right now

236
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,000
I’d nibble those muscles off.

237
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,080
Come on, let me see your shoulder.

238
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,160
Give me a sec to set the camera.

239
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,600
Take it off.

240
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,080
Please.

241
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,000
I miss you.

242
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,800
You’re even more adorable now.

243
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,079
I want to be close to you.

244
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,599
Don’t you think I want it?

245
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,599
I want to go back right now.

246
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,640
Wait, Sorn.

247
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,560
Yes?

248
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,480
Sorn

249
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,680
Ahh, it feels so good!

250
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,040
Sorn, I’m about to come.

251
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,680
I’m about to...

252
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,000
Sorn

253
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,280
Go wash up.

254
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,880
Turn off the camera and go wash first.

255
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,320
Hello, Piang, what’s up?

256
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,120
Hi P’Jun, did you get the package yet?

257
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,880
Yeah, I’m opening it now.

258
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,240
Piang

259
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,400
So, what do I have to do?

260
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,440
I don’t really use lotion though.

261
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,080
Hm, it’s not hard.

262
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,000
Just film yourself applying it and say what I put in the brief.

263
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,440
It’s really easy, just follow the brief.

264
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,360
I’m not that confident, Piang. I’ve never done a review before. What if

265
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,480
What if it turns out bad and the brand complains?

266
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,000
Brands don’t always want someone who’s super smooth.

267
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:57,760
Just try. They picked you for this, it won’t be that hard.

268
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,960
Okay, I’ll give it a try then. Thanks a lot, Piang.

269
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,680
Apply it on the arm.

270
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,480
Hey, Sorn.

271
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,960
You’re back.

272
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,320
I missed you so much.

273
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,200
Bet you missed me a lot, huh?

274
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,400
I missed you a lot.

275
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,200
And the souvenirs.

276
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,720
My snacks, Sorn.

277
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,120
Here.

278
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,080
You tease what did you even buy?

279
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,200
Just kidding.

280
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,320
this one’s yours.

281
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,560
And this one’s for Jie Poi and Dad. Don’t eat it all yourself.

282
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,280
Okay.

283
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,960
Kiss on the cheek to say thank you.”

284
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,600
What did you buy?

285
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,280
It’s packed full.

286
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,200
And what’s that lotion on your arm?

287
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,640
You got a rash?

288
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,400
No, not that.

289
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:47,760
Umm...

290
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,280
I just took a product review job.

291
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,800
I wanted to make some extra income.

292
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,480
So I can help ease your burden.

293
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,480
Piangrak got me all of these.

294
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,600
Look, the whole table’s full.

295
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,080
So, have you filmed any yet?

296
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,760
Hm.

297
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,040
I’m not confident, Sorn.

298
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,160
I’m scared it won’t turn out good.

299
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,680
Do whatever you want.

300
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,080
Just be a good person.

301
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,560
But don’t push yourself too hard, got it?

302
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,640
Mm.

303
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,960
Then take this upstairs for me.

304
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,400
Why’d you buy this?

305
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,120
You’ll see.

306
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,720
Like this, Sorn?

307
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,160
Looks fun.

308
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,080
Yeah.

309
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,840
Ready?

310
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,920
Here, nice shot, right?

311
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:05,920
Yeah.

312
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,440
Think this would work as content?

313
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,240
Uh-huh.

314
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,040
Wait, is that food?

315
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,480
That way the comments will blow up.

316
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,720
Yeah, people cursing you out.

317
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,360
Just film it, no need to talk.

318
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,080
Skincare

319
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,400
Skincare

320
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,760
I see it now.

321
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,400
Jun.

322
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,360
Take these things upstairs.

323
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,960
It’s all over the place.

324
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,240
Okay.

325
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,520
Give me a hand.

326
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,240
Can you manage?

327
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,600
Whoa.

328
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,160
Smells so good, Sorn.

329
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,760
Fried chicken.

330
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,720
Hm?

331
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,320
Why is it so salty?

332
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,760
I made it to eat with rice, not as a snack.

333
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,160
Try it.

334
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,760
Hey!

335
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,240
Why’d you bite my finger?

336
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,800
Mmm, Sorn.

337
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,760
How are you so good at cooking?

338
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,080
Teach me how to cook too.

339
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,240
Please?

340
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,800
No need, I’ll just cook for you.

341
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,360
Mhm

342
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,800
But if you’re ever not here, I can cook for myself.

343
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,960
And why wouldn’t I be here?

344
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,120
I’ll be with you till I die, Jun.

345
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,160
I’ve taken care of you this much.

346
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,440
I’m not leaving you that easily.

347
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,280
What are you even saying?

348
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,560
You’re making me blush, you know.

349
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,760
And you’re taking it out on me?

350
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,040
So you really won’t teach me?

351
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,400
Nope.

352
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,160
What’s with you?

353
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,560
Sorn

354
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,680
I’m washing the dishes.

355
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,320
I can do that later.

356
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,600
I forgot the condoms.

357
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,680
Hold on.

358
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,120
Harder, Hia Sorn.

359
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:32,720
Can you aim?

360
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,320
Ya.

361
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,560
Jun.

362
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,200
Huh?

363
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,400
Is that message in?

364
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,680
Probably about work… or maybe from Win.

365
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,360
Jun.

366
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,360
I think it’s getting too much.

367
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,440
Watch out

368
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,320
maybe your house is on fire already.

369
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,800
Hiiiii~

370
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,920
Today I’ll have an-

371
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,320
Ice Latte

372
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,640
with oat milk,

373
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,800
large size

374
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,920
less sweet

375
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,240
please. Thank youu

376
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,080
Work again…

377
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,160
Win just texted me about it.

378
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,720
All done!

379
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,200
It’s nothing

380
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,560
really…

381
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,280
Wanna keep playing?

382
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,480
This story needs to be expanded!

383
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,560
Preaw!

384
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,760
Hey Preaw!

385
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,720
I have an update for you!

386
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:05,920
This is

387
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,160
super secret, okay?

388
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,920
Guess who I saw today

389
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,600
I saw Sorn and Jun!

390
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,680
But not in a normal way, you know.

391
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:18,400
I saw them kissing on the cheek!!

392
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,080
Screams

393
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,160
Ugh, girl!

394
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,880
Why’d you scream like that? My eardrums are about to burst!

395
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,240
You ruined the mood.

396
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,040
I’m hungry…

397
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,960
wanna grab something to eat outside?

398
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,120
Maybe they were just joking around, you sure? And I’m not exaggerating, girl.

399
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,280
I saw it

400
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:39,200
with my own eyes fresh from my LASIK surgery with 0.2 sharpness.

401
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,240
Plus, I was wearing

402
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,840
my angle grey contact lens.

403
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,600
No way I missed this.

404
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,480
Oh shit

405
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,440
they’re here! Sorn and Jun are coming gotta go!

406
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,080
Sorn, Jun~

407
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,360
Hellooo

408
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,800
Hi, P’Korn.

409
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,240
Hello, Jun.

410
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,840
Did you come to get coffee?

411
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,040
Well,

412
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,680
I was craving coffee,

413
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,160
so I came for some.

414
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,480
By the way

415
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,120
P’Sorn

416
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,920
Jun

417
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,360
What are you two here for?

418
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,120
Play snooker.

419
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,360
snooker..?

420
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,520
So...

421
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,280
P’Sorn and Jun..

422
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,320
Are you two dating?

423
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,880
Jun and I are dating.

424
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,240
oopss

425
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,440
But don’t tell anyone, okay?

426
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,360
It wouldn’t look good.

427
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,560
Oh, Sorn

428
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,960
About this

429
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,960
I’d never spill something like this.

430
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,800
You can trust me.

431
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,920
So…

432
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,320
P’Sorn

433
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,600
and Jun

434
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,560
are officially together now~

435
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,360
Babe

436
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,040
what are you doing?

437
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,280
speaks in Korean

438
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,160
Coffee

439
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,560
I

440
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,760
I gotta go now.

441
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,760
Byeee~

442
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,600
Why did you tell him we’re dating?

443
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,360
You know exactly what he’s like.

444
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,560
What are you smiling for?

445
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,040
Why’d you tell Korn?

446
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,720
By tomorrow the whole company will know.

447
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,600
Exactly

448
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,760
I know what he’s like.

449
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,200
I actually want people to know that-

450
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,600
you and I are together.

451
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,440
Didn’t you say you don’t like kid?

452
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,600
I don’t just like you.

453
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,800
I’m crazy in love with you.

454
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,000
Why do you always make me blush?

455
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,480
Can i hit you back

456
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,520
Nahh, let’s grab something to eat.

457
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,720
Hello, Piang

458
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,920
I’m sorry.

459
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:35,400
I was the one who introduced the brand owner to you.

460
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,560
Who would’ve thought he’d call you like that?

461
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,600
Hmm, whatever.

462
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,640
It’s not your fault.

463
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:50,920
I already told him to mind his own business, but he still messages.

464
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,800
What..Really?

465
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,280
Hey Jun

466
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,360
you mustn’t

467
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,480
let Sorn find out

468
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,840
he’s super jealous.

469
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,720
If he finds out, trust me, it won’t end well.

470
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,880
I think the same as you do.

471
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,280
You..

472
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,720
What do you think I should do?

473
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,160
Just reject him.

474
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,760
Be direct

475
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,640
tell him you’re taken.

476
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,040
Piang

477
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,200
I already told him I have a boyfriend.

478
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,400
but he doesn’t believe me.

479
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,120
You know I’ve posted photos with Sorn on IG.

480
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,320
Why doesn’t he just check my feed?

481
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,000
Then post more photos make it obvious so he’ll see.

482
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,280
You know me, I keep my IG aesthetic.

483
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:53,600
Ugh. keep your aesthetic or dump your man? Your choice.

484
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,960
Piang

485
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,800
why are you like that?

486
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,760
Fine, Bye

487
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,280
My IG aesthetic comes first.

488
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:17,960
You asleep yet?

489
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,080
I miss you, Jun.

490
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:42,680
The sun might make your face warm, but this message will make it blush.

491
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,240
Ugh, help me out here.

492
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,560
I wanted to message you all cool, but in the end I just miss you.

493
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,920
Come on, back me up a little.

494
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,520
Oh my  what is he doing?

495
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,880
I don't mean to bother you, I just want to be on your mind all day.

496
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,320
What’s his deal?

497
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,120
I'm tired of looking at a screen  I’d rather see your face for real.

498
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,720
Why are you sleeping shirtless?

499
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:08,960
It’s hot

500
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,320
If it’s hot, then I can’t cuddle you.

501
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,200
That’s why I took it off

502
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,040
so we can cuddle.

503
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,280
Wearing a shirt makes it even hotter.

504
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:42,600
Can I bite you?

505
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:44,400
Gently.

506
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:45,320
Mhm.

507
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,280
Ah

508
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,440
ouch!

509
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:53,120
That hurt.

510
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,840
Can I say sorry?

511
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,240
Then let me bite you back.

512
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:02,720
Go ahead

513
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:04,760
but gently.

514
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,600
Too soft

515
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:11,720
you’re scared of hurting me, huh?

516
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,320
My wife will get a mark

517
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,080
I’ll go to the bathroom first.

518
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,320
For what?

519
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,560
Can’t I take care of something private?

520
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,360
I’ll be quick.

521
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:43,920
Hurry back.

522
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:44,880
Um.

523
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,040
I miss you.

524
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,560
I’m back

525
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,880
So...

526
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:07,600
The thing is…

527
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,400
Honestly,

528
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,760
the brand owner didn’t text me about work.

529
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:18,840
He was..

530
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,840
He was actually flirting with me.

531
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,520
Please don’t be mad at me, Sorn.

532
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,600
Please

533
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,320
So what are you going to do about it?

534
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:41,040
I...

535
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,240
I told him straight up

536
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,280
don’t bother me, don’t mess with my personal life.

537
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:50,760
But

538
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,520
I never wanted to hide it from you.

539
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,520
I was just scared that if I told you directly..

540
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,760
you’d get mad like this.

541
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,360
And when were you planning to tell me

542
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:10,720
huh?

543
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:13,880
If I hadn’t seen it myself,

544
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,560
would I even know?

545
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,120
Sorn..

546
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,080
there’s nothing going on between me and him.

547
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,040
You’ve read it all

548
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,640
I clearly told him I wasn’t okay with it.

549
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,960
Please don’t be mad at me, Sorn.

550
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:46,960
I’m not mad at you.

551
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:48,720
Huh?

552
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:51,640
You already rejected him

553
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:54,960
I saw the messages.

554
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,560
Then why’d you raise your voice just now?

555
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,040
I just wanted to tease you.

556
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,040
You’re really not mad?

557
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,320
Mhm.

558
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,080
You’re the sweetest.

559
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:26,680
But

560
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,440
what should we do about him?

561
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:36,480
I’ve got my own way.

562
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:43,120
Calling this late… you must miss me, right?

563
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,520
Hello, Jun? Why aren’t you saying anything?

564
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:48,600
What’s that sound?

565
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,640
Jun, what are you doing… with someone else?

566
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:52,120
No…

567
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,960
why are you doing this to me?

568
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:55,840
Stop it.

569
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,840
Jun!!

570
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,240
P’Thanu

571
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:15,720
when did you get here?

572
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,440
Just now, when you saw me.

573
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,760
How many days are you staying this time?

574
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:22,800
I’ll have Jun open up a room for you.

575
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:24,840
I’ll be here a few days.

576
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,600
But I’ll head into the city to meet a new pharma factory

577
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,480
and also take care of some errands for mom.

578
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,360
No need to set up a room for me. I’ll crash at a friend’s place.

579
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,160
Why?

580
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:34,960
What?

581
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,360
How could I sleep here?

582
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,160
You two make too much noise when you… you know.

583
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,680
P’Thanu!

584
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:48,440
Wait,

585
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,360
are you really staying at a friend’s…

586
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,120
or with a

587
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:54,560
A friend!

588
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:58,000
Keep your wife in check.

589
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:01,480
He’s my sister-in-law, but he’s younger than me, you know.

590
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:04,320
Goodboy.

591
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:06,240
Huh?!

592
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:08,720
Hey P’Thanu

593
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,400
when you’re at your friend’s,

594
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:14,920
don’t be too loud, okay?

595
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,320
Jun!

596
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,240
You’re lucky Sorn’s around.

597
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:23,480
So what?

598
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,240
I’m with Sorn all the time. I’m not scared of you.

599
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:27,040
Yeah.

600
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:32,320
I’m out.

601
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,280
Too much sickly love here.

602
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,360
Go on then! Bleh!

603
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,200
And you go put your stuff away.
