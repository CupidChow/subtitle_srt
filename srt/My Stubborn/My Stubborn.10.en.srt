1
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,960
Ouch!

2
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,880
shit...

3
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,440
Hey, are you okay?

4
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,880
Shit! Blood!!

5
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,120
What’s up?

6
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,200
Tai, there’s blood! Blood!

7
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,240
Champ, where are you?

8
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,000
At Sorn’s place!

9
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,360
What’s happening?

10
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,280
Champ!

11
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,440
Champ!

12
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,840
Are you alright?

13
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,800
Where’s the blood?

14
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,320
It’s on my foot.

15
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,560
Here.

16
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,880
That’s a big wound.

17
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,040
Want me to call an ambulance?

18
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,840
Shit…

19
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,640
Tai…

20
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,560
please just tell me

21
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,320
where Jun is.

22
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,800
When you were doing stuff behind my back

23
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,120
you didn’t tell me

24
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,240
so why should I tell you now?

25
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,080
Tai…

26
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,280
just help him out, please.

27
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,360
You’re close with HR at the company.

28
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,320
That’s your hint.

29
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,680
If you still don’t get it

30
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,920
you’re dumb.

31
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,080
Damn…

32
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:39,280
how could I be this stupid?

33
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,000
If you two are gonna get it on,

34
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,240
make sure to lock the house, okay?

35
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,000
Hey,

36
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,240
what’s going on here?

37
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,560
I’ll go check it out, baby.

38
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,200
Who is it?

39
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,240
I want to see P’Penny.

40
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,880
We need to have a talk.

41
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,120
I need help.

42
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,240
You only come when you need help.

43
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,159
But how many times have you left her before?

44
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,760
You act like I’m the only one you’ve got.

45
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,400
I’m not being sarcastic,

46
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,159
just telling the truth.

47
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,080
Next thing I know you’ll say

48
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,680
you didn’t want Jun to be lonely or some crap like that.

49
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,840
I feel sorry for Jun,

50
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,640
If I didn’t know

51
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,080
you didn’t like kids,

52
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,680
I’d think you two were...

53
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,200
I’m looking for jun.

54
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,760
You know where he’s doing his internship right now.

55
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,680
Why?

56
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,720
Is...

57
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,760
I and jun.

58
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,400
Jun and I had a fight.

59
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,960
It been gone from home for more than a week now.

60
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,480
I don’t know where to find him.

61
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,200
Well...

62
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,720
What did tai say?

63
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,400
He helped Jun, of course.

64
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,240
Even Tai

65
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,080
helped Jun escape?

66
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,920
So what’s going on?

67
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,600
Do you actually

68
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,720
like a kid now?

69
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,880
So what, you came here

70
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,080
to ask me to put out a missing person alert?

71
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,400
Can you save the teasing for later

72
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,880
and just tell me where the hell he is?

73
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,000
Hey,

74
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,320
calm down.

75
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,080
Take it easy. Think clearly.

76
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,440
Hmm...

77
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,360
Tai said

78
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,240
Jun is still interning at the company, right?

79
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,920
Yeah.

80
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,640
Then it’s simple.

81
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,400
If not at the office,

82
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,400
where else could he be interning?

83
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,840
Our company doesn’t have that many branches.

84
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,760
You bastard,

85
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,080
you made a fool out of me!

86
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,520
Mmm...

87
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,880
focus!

88
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,200
Hey Sorn, haven’t found Jun yet?

89
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,520
He’s probably too out of it to think straight right now.

90
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
And...

91
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,280
so what?

92
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,320
It’s nothing.

93
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,680
I just feel bad for him.

94
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,800
Don’t overthink it.

95
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,760
Come here,

96
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,360
sit down, and stop frowning

97
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,000
your pretty face will wrinkle, babe.

98
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,640
What are you thinking about?

99
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,920
Sorn.

100
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,760
He finally realized how he feels, huh.

101
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,400
At least now

102
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,280
he knows he loves Jun.

103
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,440
Maybe it's a bit late,

104
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,280
but there’s still a chance.

105
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,200
is that Boss Sorn?

106
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,080
Dude—shit!

107
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,800
No way he’s here—move!

108
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,000
Quick, quick—hold on,

109
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,320
this is all I got!

110
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,920
Hello, Boss Sorn.

111
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,720
Yeah.

112
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,600
I’m here to see Jun.

113
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,200
Jun hasn’t been at the factory, boss.

114
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,880
Sorn, where the hell are you? You're still not at the office?

115
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,320
I'm out looking for Jun.

116
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,520
Dude, you're seriously losing it.

117
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,480
I'll be at the office later this afternoon, alright?

118
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,680
No can do. It's urgent. Get your ass here now.

119
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,800
Alright, alright. I'm on my way.

120
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,600
I’m heading off.

121
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,880
Okay, boss. Safe travels.

122
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,440
Is he gone?

123
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,240
Yeah, he’s gone, dude.

124
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,520
But how did Sorn know I was here?

125
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,680
No idea.

126
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,000
Boss Tai didn’t say anything.

127
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,680
Why the hell are we gossiping now?

128
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,160
Dude, if you saw Sorn’s face earlier,

129
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,400
I swear—he looked shocked.

130
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,280
He looked so rough I thought he was a forest bandit.

131
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,080
Maybe he’s changing his vibe.

132
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,920
Changing his vibe or heartbroken from not finding you?

133
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,840
What the hell, man—get back to work!

134
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,240
Oh, Sorn.

135
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,880
What are you doing here?

136
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,000
Oh,

137
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,800
I came to deliver a corrected order.

138
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,560
This one’s fixed.

139
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,160
Ah, I see. Thought it was something else.

140
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,960
Hey, are you looking for someone?

141
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,440
Oh, no.

142
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,320
Anyway, I apologize for the earlier mistake.

143
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,400
It’s alright.

144
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,080
Good thing you checked—no major damage yet.

145
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,000
Yes.

146
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,720
Thanks.

147
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,160
Hello.

148
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,680
yes, sure.

149
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,520
I’ll grab the documents and check the stock real quick.

150
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:10,280
Okay, I'm done. I'll head down in a sec.

151
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,960
Got it.

152
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,000
Got you now.

153
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,600
Let go, P’Sorn.

154
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,200
Did you miss me at all?

155
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,640
Hmph, no.

156
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,280
But I missed you.

157
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,400
But... I didn’t miss you.

158
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,400
You’re lying.

159
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,400
If I really missed you,

160
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,040
I would’ve come back a long time ago.

161
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,880
Then talk to me properly, would you?

162
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,640
I told you clearly

163
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,880
I don’t want to see you.

164
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,160
No want talk to you.

165
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:57,280
or be involved with you anymore.

166
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,280
But I want to be involved.

167
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,240
You don’t have to miss me,

168
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,240
but I miss you.

169
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,000
I’m sorry for what...

170
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,720
I did that made you angry before.

171
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,200
I...

172
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,320
I... didn’t think it would hurt you that much.

173
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,840
I didn’t mean to.

174
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,240
You never really mean anything you do, do you?

175
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,280
What do I have to do to make you forgive me?

176
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:01,040
You know I suck at apologizing.

177
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,080
I’ve been trying, Jun.

178
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,160
Ever since you left.

179
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,560
I really tried to find you.

180
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,720
If you're mad that I was late…

181
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,040
I’m sorry.

182
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,080
I tried everything I could.

183
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,760
But Tai didn’t help at all.

184
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,560
I had no one on my side.

185
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,560
Win!

186
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,560
didn’t say a word about you.

187
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,840
Even damn Champ

188
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,040
didn’t know a thing.

189
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,160
Because Tai didn’t say shit to anyone!

190
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,720
I like you, Jun. I really do.

191
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,840
Be honest

192
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,880
when you talked to P’Thanu,

193
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,800
you said there’s no way you’d like me.

194
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,080
do you really not remember?

195
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,480
Or are you pretending you never said it?

196
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,320
What else did you find out?

197
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,680
Tell me everything,

198
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,440
so I can clear it all up today—once and for all.

199
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,920
I said that to Thanu.

200
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,080
But now, I’m talking to you.

201
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:36,400
I’ll believe what I heard the first time, thanks.

202
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,280
Where are you going?

203
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,880
I’m not finished talking.

204
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,760
I’ve got work to do.

205
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,960
If you don’t, that’s your problem.

206
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,680
You’re so stubborn, Jun.

207
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,360
I tried to talk to you calmly,

208
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,800
but you won’t listen.

209
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,240
You reject everything

210
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,680
what the hell do you even want?!

211
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,120
I told you I like you,

212
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,800
but you don’t believe me.

213
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,040
I already told you we’re done.

214
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,760
Can you respect that?

215
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,960
Not even as friends or brothers?

216
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,920
Yes!

217
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,200
So that’s it? That’s what you want?

218
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,440
You’re really gonna cut me off?

219
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,880
Fine, I’ll just keep chasing you like this then.

220
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,480
Chase what exactly, huh?

221
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,960
Chase you! Woo you!

222
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,560
Hello?

223
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,600
Hi P’Yim,

224
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,080
this is Sorn.

225
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:39,040
Sorry, Jun was just discussing something with me,

226
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,000
From now on, don’t block my number

227
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,440
or my LINE.

228
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,160
You don’t have to answer or read anything,

229
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,440
it’s fine.

230
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,720
You’re such a pain…

231
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,880
I’ll come see you again tomorrow.

232
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,920
Want anything to eat?

233
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,520
I’ll bring it.

234
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,560
Yes, P’Tai.

235
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:56,360
Sorn found Jun, right? What happened? Did he do anything?

236
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,880
He didn’t do anything, but...

237
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,720
P’Sorn told me he likes me.

238
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,760
And what did you say?

239
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,360
I didn’t believe him.

240
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,360
You really want me to trust someone like P’Sorn?

241
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:18,600
I don’t know what to do, P’Tai.

242
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,720
I can’t help you with that.

243
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,360
You’ll have to ask your own heart.

244
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,600
I’m scared, P’Tai.

245
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,760
P’Sorn is... intimidating.

246
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,360
He might be scary, but deep down,

247
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,720
Jun want to open up to him, right?

248
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,560
Honestly,

249
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,360
if I could let him go, I would’ve done it a long time ago.

250
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,600
Then give him a chance to prove himself.

251
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:56,680
So you’ll know—do you love him because he’s Sorn,

252
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:00,200
or because he gives you what you want?

253
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,440
Okay,

254
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,320
thanks, P’Tai.

255
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,320
Jun knows the job.

256
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,400
He’s a sharp kid.

257
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,360
Let him take you.

258
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,440
Jun!

259
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,720
Can you take Mr. Sorn to check the stock over there?

260
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,880
He had to come down himself ‘cause they were rushing him.

261
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,520
I’m counting on you.

262
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,280
This way, Mr. Sorn.

263
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,640
Where do you usually eat lunch?

264
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,200
Is the food here any good?

265
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,720
I’ve never tried it.

266
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:02,640
I heard the curry rice place at the end of the alley’s good.

267
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,680
Wanna go?

268
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,920
Here, the documents.

269
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,720
Check them fast so I can do other stuff.

270
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,240
The house feels so empty without you.

271
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,240
Can you come back and live with me?

272
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,840
You can keep interning here.

273
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,360
I’ll drop you off and pick you up every day.

274
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,240
All I ask is...

275
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,560
Can you come back and live with me again?

276
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,800
Noo already sent the plush toy.

277
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,840
It’s waiting for you to come home and name it.

278
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,280
I missed you like hell.

279
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,000
These two weeks without you—more

280
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,880
Can you go back to being my Jun again?

281
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,000
Since when was I yours?

282
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,520
Since the moment I wanted you to be.

283
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,920
I asked—when?

284
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,160
Why do you even want to know?

285
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,080
If you can’t answer, then let it go.

286
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,520
I’m going back to work.

287
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,600
It’s hot, and you keep hugging me.

288
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,160
Then you answer me first

289
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,800
when did you start liking me?

290
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,760
Why do you even care?

291
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,200
You haven’t even answered how you feel yet.

292
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,720
Jun....

293
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,680
Well...

294
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,760
Don't come any closer.

295
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:22,320
Saying you like me doesn’t just make everything okay, you know.

296
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,360
You’re such a jerk.

297
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,600
I really thought...

298
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,560
I already thought that...

299
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,040
you liked me too back then.

300
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,080
That’s why I confessed to you.

301
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,000
Do you even know...

302
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:15,640
It took everything I had to gather the courage to say it.

303
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,360
You... damn it...

304
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,200
I’m sorry.

305
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,800
I didn’t know you were this hurt.

306
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,080
But you were drunk, so I thought you were just messing around.

307
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,360
I...

308
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,520
damn it...

309
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,040
Noo even warned me.

310
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,239
I know how you feel.

311
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,120
Now I know you’re dumb too.

312
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,880
Cry then insult me—nice timing.

313
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,480
Let go, Sorn—someone’s coming.

314
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,159
I’m not letting go.

315
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,480
Answer me—will you wait for me?

316
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,320
I brought this for you.

317
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,160
Here.

318
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,160
Oops.

319
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,840
You good?

320
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,720
Come on, be a man a little.

321
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,320
Come on, come here.

322
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,000
Let’s try again.

323
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,880
Try again, man!

324
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,640
Win.

325
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,400
Oops.

326
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,920
Jun!

327
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:00,920
Shit.

328
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,040
Ow!

329
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,160
Ow!

330
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,920
What about Win?

331
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,880
Just a little scratch, bro.

332
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,880
Oww, it hurts a lot!

333
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,640
You’ll be fine soon.

334
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,520
Yeah, I get hit all the time.

335
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,520
Here.

336
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,480
Hey!

337
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,040
That’s my shirt!

338
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,840
You wiped with it—what am I supposed to wear back now?

339
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,720
You’re not even wearing it now.

340
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,560
Don’t you love being shirtless?

341
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,600
You’re flashing everyone.

342
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,440
The whole factory’s probably your fan club now.

343
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,160
don’t act shy.

344
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,640
Why take your mood out on me?

345
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,400
Just stay quiet. Show off that body.

346
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,920
Look, all the ladies and aunties are drooling.

347
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,400
I’m blushing.

348
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,200
Jun.

349
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,320
you need to see a doctor,

350
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,320
Even if it’s not serious...

351
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,360
you still should go.

352
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,160
No,

353
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,240
I’ll be fine soon.

354
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,720
How do you know?

355
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,200
I fall a lot.

356
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,800
I’ll be all healed by morning.

357
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,400
Fine, I’ll take you to the hospital myself.

358
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,840
No need.

359
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,840
I’ll take him.

360
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,000
You two are too close—you’d just take his side.

361
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,960
My car, let’s go.

362
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,760
Let’s go.

363
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,680
Not going.

364
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:07,720
Go.

365
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,640
Let go, Sorn.

366
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,760
If you don’t let go, I’ll really get mad.

367
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,720
You act like you’re not mad at me anymore.

368
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,440
Get in.

369
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,880
Okay, I’ll help him walk.

370
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,960
You’re so damn stubborn.

371
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,920
I’m way more stubborn than you think, Jun.

372
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,400
Let’s go.

373
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,280
Hey, grab his shoes for me, will ya?

374
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,080
Do you treat everyone you’re flirting with this well?

375
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,680
Of course, gotta take good care of the person I’m courting.

376
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:15,880
But I’ve never courted anyone but you, you know?

377
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:27,720
Even P’Tai doesn’t take care of me as well as you do.

378
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,240
I like you

379
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,640
I have to treat you right.

380
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,240
What are you even saying? You’re so... ugh.

381
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,200
Alright, I’m heading out.

382
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,600
Why are you giving me a lollipop?

383
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,760
If I wanna make up with a kid,

384
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,400
I gotta give them what they like, right?

385
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,680
I’m outta here.

386
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,120
He’s dead serious.

387
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,160
Ever since he went to see you at the factory.

388
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,760
I respect him for that, man.

389
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,000
Yeah.

390
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,040
What’s up, bro?

391
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,000
You’re getting too chummy.

392
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,640
yeah—hey.

393
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,360
Let’s go, Jun.

394
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,600
You seriously drive from the city every day just to pick up Jun?

395
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,720
Man, you’ve got it bad, boss.

396
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,800
Yeah, are you rich or what?

397
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,720
Your family make oil or something?

398
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,480
So what if I wanna drive to pick you up? Big deal.

399
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,360
Still, wouldn’t hurt to save some money.

400
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,040
Come on,

401
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:22,560
I’m already here—don’t waste the trip.

402
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,720
I didn’t ask you to come pick me up.

403
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,800
Yeah,

404
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,680
you didn’t.

405
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,200
I wanted to come myself.

406
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,760
I just wanted to see that pouty face for a few minutes

407
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,880
then I can go back to work and earn money to feed my wife.

408
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:42,600
Sorn! Quit running your mouth!

409
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,280
Gotta go.

410
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,720
Later, bro.

411
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,600
Take care of Jun, alright?

412
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,840
Win, you’re ditching me?

413
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,280
What?

414
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,720
Damn you, Win.

415
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,240
Jun,

416
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
let’s get going.

417
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,440
Why are you talking so nicely?

418
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,200
It’s giving me chills.

419
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,800
Well, every time I talk nice, you pay attention.

420
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:19,360
So I figured I’d use that to get your attention again.

421
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,720
Let’s go.

422
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,240
Thanks...

423
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,040
Don’t just thank me.

424
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,920
Give me something more.

425
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,160
Want me to bow with my foot or something?

426
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,200
You know exactly what I want.

427
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,280
Please...

428
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,960
before I head in to work?

429
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,800
Nope.

430
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,760
Don’t you feel sorry for me?

431
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,680
No, I don’t.

432
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,120
You didn’t feel sorry for me

433
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,480
when I was the one liking you alone all this time.

434
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,360
Always dodging the truth,

435
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,320
blaming everything else.

436
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,160
But now I’m clear about how I feel.

437
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,680
What do you want, Jun?

438
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,720
You wanted clarity

439
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,360
now I’m giving it to you.

440
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,360
But I need to know how long it’ll take.

441
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,160
Because if I have to keep chasing after you like this forever,

442
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,840
I can’t handle it, man.

443
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:18,680
I’ve been late for work almost every day lately

444
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,600
One day, I might get fired.

445
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,680
I’d have no job,

446
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,200
no money.

447
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,440
And then how would I buy you all your favorite food, Jun?

448
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,480
If it comes to that,

449
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,240
I’ll have to go back and work for my family.

450
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,680
But I don’t wanna be away from you. Not at all.

451
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,200
What if I have to fly to see you every week?

452
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,320
My mom would nag me until I go deaf.

453
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:57,560
I’d probably have to ask you to move in with me and my mom.

454
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,360
I like you this much

455
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,360
I’m not gonna give up on you easily, Jun.

456
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,800
I’m waiting to take you home... as my mom’s son-in-law, you know.

457
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,960
So…

458
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,200
this Saturday at 11, I was thinking of going to the mall.

459
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,320
If you’re free...

460
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:46,880
then…

461
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,440
Then...?

462
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,280
Figure it out yourself.

463
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,080
Don’t play dumb.

464
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,440
Idiot.

465
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,000
You’re up?

466
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,560
Going anywhere today?

467
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:42,400
Planning to do laundry... and clean up.

468
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,920
Wanna see a movie?

469
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,160
but I have to clean...

470
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,520
but I kinda wanna go too.

471
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:07,320
Don’t tell me it was you...

472
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,320
Bro?

473
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:56,960
What are you doing here this early?

474
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,920
It’s only 8 AM.

475
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,560
Looking for someone?

476
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:02,480
Jun?

477
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,680
He’s not here.

478
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,120
Then I’ll wait.

479
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,320
I made plans with him earlier.

480
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,200
Oho~ things

481
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,160
are moving forward, huh boss?

482
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,880
Man, I really hope so.

483
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,000
Chasing a kid

484
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,200
is exhausting as hell.

485
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,960
Didn’t you say you don’t like younger guys?

486
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,400
Look at you now

487
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,320
from morning to night!

488
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,120
I still don’t get when that spark even happened!

489
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,400
Aww,

490
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,320
that’s sweet, boss.

491
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,080
I’m out

492
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,000
enjoy your day!

493
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:06,760
Hello.

494
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,840
Jun, you free lately?

495
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,480
I’m trying out new dishes at the shop.

496
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:12,760
Wanna come eat?

497
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,080
I’ll come pick you up.

498
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,960
Wow, your shop must be rich.

499
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,400
giving customers a VIP pickup service now?

500
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,640
Huh? Who is this? Isn’t this Jun?

501
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,760
Let’s just say I’m his man.

502
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,160
And don’t bother calling again.

503
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,600
Whoa,

504
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,880
when did you get here?

505
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,400
I’m about to shower.

506
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:49,600
Jun!

507
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,520
What the hell!

508
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:54,120
Why are you in here? Get out!

509
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:56,560
Aside from me...

510
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,680
who else is trying to hit on you?

511
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,480
Can you get out first?

512
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:01,840
I’m about to take a shower!

513
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,280
Come on. Just answer me.

514
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,720
I’m naked, dude!

515
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,640
I’ve seen it all already.

516
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:08,720
Why be shy now?

517
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,480
Answer me.

518
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,160
Ugh...

519
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,560
No one!!

520
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,960
No one else but you,

521
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,680
okay!? Happy now?!

522
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,120
Get out!

523
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,480
Hey! Shut the door at least!

524
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,000
I’m not closing it!!

525
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,320
Damn it!!

526
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:48,360
Hey!

527
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,240
What are you doing?!

528
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:54,920
Jun...

529
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,720
I’m asking you seriously now.

530
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,200
Ask what?

531
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,160
Let me kiss you.

532
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:10,960
Please.

533
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,160
Please…

534
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,360
Wait!

535
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,360
Lips only!

536
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,600
No tongue!

537
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:35,600
Okay.

538
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:03,480
Hey!

539
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,600
I said no tongue!

540
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,200
I won’t!

541
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,440
Let me try again.

542
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:34,760
Hey!

543
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:36,960
Get out!

544
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,720
What is wrong with you?!

545
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,920
Why did you bring me here?

546
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,120
I just wanted to take a break.

547
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,680
My legs are sore from driving too long.

548
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,680
Were you happy today?

549
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,640
What did you say?

550
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,600
I asked—do you like me?

551
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,320
I used to, yeah...

552
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,800
but now, I need time to think.

553
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,040
But I like you.

554
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,240
So what now?

555
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,120
Didn’t you say

556
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:24,680
you’d make me your wife?

557
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,120
Now you’re just asking to be my boyfriend?

558
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,480
As if you’d say yes.

559
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,560
You didn’t even respond when I asked you to be my boyfriend.

560
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,320
And how did that make you feel?

561
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,160
Honestly? I’m disappointed.

562
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,080
I knew you’d say yes eventually.

563
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:55,560
just like when I told you I liked you.

564
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,560
I thought you’d say you liked me too.

565
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:02,120
you’d say...

566
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:03,480
you liked me too.

567
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,160
When I first met you,

568
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,360
your attitude was annoying as hell.

569
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
I really don’t get...

570
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:27,800
how a little brat like you

571
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,640
could get along so well with other adults.

572
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:34,840
Because...

573
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,400
they’re not as easily annoyed as you.

574
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,880
And now that you like me…

575
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:43,520
are you really okay with being with someone younger?

576
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,440
Are you really sure you like me?

577
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,160
I’m way younger than you.

578
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,480
I’m the same Jun.

579
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,400
you once said...

580
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,200
If I ever liked a kid

581
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,080
it wouldn’t be him.

582
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,720
Then let me ask you first.

583
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,560
when did you start liking me?

584
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,320
Two years ago?

585
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,800
Or when we started living together?

586
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,520
Well...

587
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,440
Does that even matter?

588
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:24,760
I think...

589
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:26,760
the fact that...

590
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,160
I confessed first

591
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:29,960
I like you.

592
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,520
that matters more.

593
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,480
I don’t know about that.

594
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:37,800
but I’m sure.

595
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,440
I liked you before you liked me.

596
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,720
What do you mean?

597
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,280
Those shoes…

598
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,520
why do you think I bought them.

599
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,120
if I didn’t care about you?

600
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,280
Well...

601
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,840
maybe you just saw me as Tai’s little bro?

602
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,320
Plus you said they were the wrong size.

603
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,800
Then why not give them to Win instead?

604
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:13,600
I lied—to Tai,

605
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:15,400
to you,

606
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,520
and to myself.

607
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:20,520
Then how do I know...

608
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:22,360
you won’t shut me out again?

609
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:24,920
Or...

610
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,800
Won’t deny me again?

611
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,720
That’s up to you, Jun.

612
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,480
If you want assurance from me.

613
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,240
but aren’t ready to accept it,

614
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,600
we won’t get anywhere.

615
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,440
We’ll just stay stuck right here.

616
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,320
Did you know?

617
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:06,480
Tai’s dad offered me a position in Vietnam.

618
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:12,080
But do you know why I didn’t go?

619
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:19,480
Because of your family?

620
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:24,440
No.

621
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:27,320
It was because Tai told me...

622
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:31,600
you were going to intern at the company in two weeks.

623
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:37,840
So I decided staying in Thailand was better.

624
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,400
I wanted to see that kid I left in the car two years ago...

625
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:54,520
the one I never said goodbye to.

626
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:04,600
I wanted to know if he kept the promise he made to me.

627
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:23,720
I wanna keep working at the factory for one more week.

628
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:26,040
What kind of married couple lives apart, huh, Jun?

629
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,400
Aren’t you even a little embarrassed saying that out loud?

630
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,680
Not at all. It's the truth.

631
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:31,880
He's waiting for you, you know.

632
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:33,320
Yeah? Well, I’m waiting for you right here.

633
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:36,840
I told you, I’ll be at your place on Saturday.

634
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:38,400
I’m sleeping in this room tonight.

635
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,480
I don’t approve.

636
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:42,040
I’m just too lazy to knock every time I wanna have sex with you.

637
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:44,600
God, you’re such a perv.
