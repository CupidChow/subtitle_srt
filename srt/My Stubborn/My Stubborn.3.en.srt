1
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,760
I think I’d better go take a shower.

2
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,440
What’s up, sis?

3
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:00,880
What’s with you? Disappeared for a week without a call or update… How’s the internship with Tai going?

4
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,240
It’s fun, but kinda hectic too.

5
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:11,640
Just don’t go breaking anything, alright?... So, when are you coming home? Dad’s been complaining every day.

6
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:18,360
Hmm… Probably Monday. I'll stay the night and head back tomorrow.

7
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:25,920
That’s good. Dad hasn’t been feeling well lately. Guess he misses his troublemaker son—can’t eat, can’t sleep.

8
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:35,760
You’re exaggerating, sis. Tell him I’m coming home tonight then. And ask him to grill some fish for me!

9
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,640
Ugh, such a foodie! See you tonight then.

10
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,320
Alright, sis. See you!

11
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,480
..Grilled fish, woohoo!

12
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,280
Dad!!

13
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,880
What?

14
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,120
Jun said he’s coming home today. And tonight, he wants you to grill fish for him.

15
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:06,880
What? He’s interning and Tai’s even giving him a salary. Shouldn’t he be treating me?

16
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:14,200
Aww, I’ll treat him instead, Dad. Let Jun save his money. You won’t have to worry so much.

17
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,640
I know… but I still worry about him.

18
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:28,560
Come on, he’s got plenty of people taking care of him over there. Who knows, next time he comes back, he might bring a boyfriend to show off!

19
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,480
Really now? Ooh! (laughs) Alright, alright.

20
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,440
Need help with anything, Dad?

21
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,720
It’s fine. I’ll handle it.

22
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,720
Yo, what’s up, Win?

23
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,840
Jun. Tell me what was up the other day—left me with that weird message and then vanished.

24
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,120
I was thinking about going home.

25
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,159
You better just tell me now or I’ll come storm into your room.

26
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,840
Up to you, bro. If you wanna come, then just come.

27
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,800
Alright then. Let me grab my car keys real quick.

28
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:13,640
Good. You can crash at my place. I’m staying at Dad’s tonight anyway. Yo, he’s grilling fish for dinner—interested?

29
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,120
Hell yeah. That sauce hits different.

30
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,240
Yeah.

31
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,560
But I haven’t showered yet. Gimme a minute, I’ll come pick you up.

32
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,520
Damn, you always take forever. Hurry up, man!

33
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,000
Hey there, my dear --

34
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,040
Yo Jun.

35
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,000
Oh Hia, Tai! What’s up?

36
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,880
I told Hia Tai I was going to your place, so he wanted to come along.

37
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,040
I’m craving Thai tea from Ko Nueng’s place.

38
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:53,120
Let’s go, bro. Bet you’re hungry. What about Hia Champ?

39
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,640
Champ’s working at the factory. Couldn’t make it.

40
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,720
Are we heading out yet?

41
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,760
My friend, I’m starving. Can we grab something to eat first?

42
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,400
What would you like to order?

43
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,080
Crispy pork basil with a fried egg, for me.

44
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,560
Make that two, please.

45
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,440
Jun, what are you getting?

46
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,159
Minced pork basil with a well-done fried egg, please.

47
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,159
Two of those.

48
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,360
I’m gonna go smoke. You coming, Tai?

49
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,680
Yeah, I’ll come with.

50
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,440
Alright, man.

51
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,040
Huh?

52
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,160
Did you have a fight with Sorn or something?

53
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,720
Nope, didn’t fight.

54
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:16,280
You guys work at the same place, and he’s mentoring you too. Talk to him more—might help you guys get closer.

55
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,520
We only talk about work. Don’t really feel like chatting.

56
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:29,320
And that message you sent me—seriously dude, are you hiding something from me?

57
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:36,400
Nah. I was just watching my series and got curious about something. You’re overthinking it.

58
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:46,040
Of course I’m overthinking! You usually tell me everything. If you’re hiding something this time, it’s kinda sus, right?

59
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,159
There’s really nothing, bro. Don’t worry about it. I’m just hungry.

60
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,960
Alright man, I’m gonna hit the bathroom.

61
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,840
Sure, all of you just leave me here alone as usual.

62
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,440
Where’s Win?

63
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,560
He went to the bathroom, bro.

64
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,600
Ah, okay.

65
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,320
Then I guess I’ll go now too.

66
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,200
Didn’t you go earlier?

67
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,920
Nope, didn’t go.

68
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,440
Hey, stop shaking your leg, man.

69
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,799
You know, people who shake their leg a lot are supposed to be super horny.

70
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,520
Nope.

71
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,320
Or… wanna try with me and see for yourself?

72
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,200
What the hell are you saying?

73
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,200
Can you just sit still for a sec?

74
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,840
Then stop shaking your leg, I don’t like it.

75
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,480
Then help me out.

76
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,440
Help with what?

77
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,360
Yo, what are you doing?

78
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,600
Put your leg over mine so I won’t forget and shake again.

79
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,040
Win’s taking forever.

80
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,000
Can we get the check?

81
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,360
Four meals and four drinks, total 240 baht.

82
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,680
Here’s the exact amount.

83
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,000
Thank you!

84
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,080
Thanks for the meal, bro!

85
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,360
Now you’re all comfy, huh?

86
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,280
Dad!

87
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,640
Dad, Sister.

88
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,520
I’m home! Missed you!

89
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,880
Missed you too.

90
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,200
Still as handsome as ever, huh, my son?

91
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,520
Looking sharp, as always!

92
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,360
Sis, give me a hug. Missed you too!

93
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,000
Alright, that’s enough now.

94
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,200
It’s been a while... There’s Dad over there!

95
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,920
Hey!

96
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,080
Good evening, sir.

97
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,880
Tai and Win came too?

98
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,200
And that’s Sorn, right? I remember you! It’s been a while—you’ve gotten so handsome.

99
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,760
Go grab a seat. Order anything you want, I’ll make the drinks.

100
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,480
Dad always flatters everyone. Handsome where?

101
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,200
I’m serious! He really is!

102
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,720
Alright, I’ll help.

103
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:47,360
Cold drinks coming in! Here, this one’s for Tai—Dad said you don’t like sweet stuff, and he still remembers!

104
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,840
That’s awesome.

105
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,960
And here’s yours.

106
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,120
I’m thinking of checking out our old house. Haven’t been there in ages.

107
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,880
How is it?

108
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,720
Still tastes just like I remember.

109
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,920
Dude, I’m so excited!

110
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,600
What’s with you?

111
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:25,120
Come on, Sis—it’s rare we get grilled fish at home. Can’t I be happy?

112
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:31,200
Then go all out! You too, Win—don’t hold back. I’m paying today.

113
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,880
Wait, wasn’t Dad treating?

114
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,280
Sis...

115
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,440
Welp, guess I’m going all in now!

116
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:45,680
Dig in! Look at Dad today—grinning ear to ear.

117
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:56,120
It’s rare to have everyone at the table. Of course I’m happy. Ever since Jun left for college, this house got way quieter.

118
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,360
Come on, Dad—I thought Sis’s voice would’ve given you more headaches than me.

119
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,760
Jun, you brat!

120
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:08,720
How about this, Dad—tonight I’ll talk non-stop so you won’t feel bored. Deal?

121
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,120
All night long?

122
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,080
Can you handle that, Dad?

123
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,680
Bring it on!

124
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,840
Alright, alright—let’s eat!

125
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,200
Hello? What’s up, Piang?

126
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:10,320
Why’ve you disappeared lately? You don’t even call me anymore. Forgot about me or what?

127
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,400
Been super busy lately... Haven’t really talked to anyone much.

128
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,480
Oof, feels like I just dropped in your priority list or something.

129
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,960
And as for all my other flings—they’re all gone now.

130
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:26,560
Yup, all done for. Only Jun left, and he won’t even check in!

131
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,120
Aww, sorry. So, what are you up to?

132
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:38,240
Nothing much, just chilling. Wanna come over?

133
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,040
I’m sleepy… Was gonna crash early.

134
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,840
Then I’ll come sleep next to you. How about that?

135
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,840
Nope. I’ll end up not sleeping at all.

136
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,080
Let’s go out tonight then. You in?

137
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:01,400
Sure, I actually got something I wanted to talk to you about too. What time?

138
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,440
Same as always—meet at 10 p.m.

139
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,280
10 it is…

140
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,040
Um.. OKay, but can I leave before 1 a.m.? I’ve got work early tomorrow.

141
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:19,280
Deal. But Jun, dress up tonight—I’m showing you off.

142
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:23,920
Showing off, huh? Alright, I’ll make sure I look my best.

143
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,360
Alrighty!

144
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,520
See you, Piang.

145
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,440
Bye bye!

146
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:36,080
Yeah, I’ll check in on that again tomorrow. June isn’t rushing me or anything.

147
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,360
Just give me a call if there’s any update.

148
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,040
I'm going to the bar today. Do you want to come in?

149
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,600
Okay, I'll go now.

150
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,520
Whoa, with all this food, the bill’s gonna be huge for sure.

151
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,960
Not really. Don’t worry when you’re with me—we’ll split the bill.

152
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,400
Saying that, I thought you were gonna treat me.

153
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,600
Wow!

154
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,520
Told you to dress up, and you overdid it!

155
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,120
Look—everyone’s staring at you. I’m getting jealous here.

156
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:37,440
So, Jun… you said you had something to talk to me about. What is it?

157
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,520
How did you know you were a bottom?

158
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,320
Why’re you asking me that?

159
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,440
No reason. Just curious.

160
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:50,640
Well...

161
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,640
I used to be a top, but it didn’t feel right. Getting topped felt better.

162
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,120
So you had to test it to know?

163
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,320
What do you mean?

164
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,599
I mean… I feel like my preferences are changing.

165
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:14,359
Huh? Wait—are you saying you don’t like guys anymore?

166
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:23,640
No, Piang. I still like guys. It’s just that…

167
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:29,120
Don’t tell me… you don’t wanna be a top anymore… you wanna be a bottom now?

168
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,840
Um.

169
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,080
Yeah… Aren’t you shocked?

170
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:48,440
Of course I’m shocked—but it’s not a big deal. Everyone’s into different things. Nothing weird about that.

171
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:54,720
But how do you know you don’t want to be a top anymore?

172
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:04,840
Honestly? I don’t even know. I’m really confused.

173
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:14,440
Who the hell confused you that much? I’ve been talking to you for months and all I got was a kiss.

174
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:23,040
But this person… he confused you this bad? Must’ve hit you deep, huh?

175
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,360
I’m sorry…

176
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,000
Damn it, Jun.

177
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,240
I thought I was getting a boyfriend—turns out I got a girl bestie.

178
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,720
So this is what’s been stressing you out?

179
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:45,600
Yeah… I feel like I don’t even know who I am anymore.

180
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,040
Not yourself.

181
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,520
Then how about this—go ahead and prove it.

182
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,040
Like tonight—you already brought a guy here. Just do it with him.

183
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,280
What the hell are you talking about?

184
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:05,560
I’m not crazy. I’m serious. If you really wanna find out, this is the way.

185
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,080
Hold on, I’ll be back in a sec.

186
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:41,040
Piang’s been here a while. What took you so long? Aren’t you the owner?

187
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,880
Jun, this is Franz—the owner. And Franz.

188
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,280
This is Jun, Piang’s… guy.

189
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,040
Hi there.

190
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:05,360
Franz, that’s Piang. What’s with that face, huh? Don’t make me find out something shady.

191
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,240
Just saying hi. That’s all.

192
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,760
Whoa… Jun...

193
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,520
How much have you had to drink?

194
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,920
Just enough to numb my heart.

195
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,040
Trying to heal? So what?

196
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,040
Wait—don’t tell me...

197
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:38,840
I think I’m gonna try what you suggested… but I haven’t found my target yet.

198
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,040
God, you drive me crazy sometimes.

199
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,760
Just stay right here. Piang will be back. Franz, watch him for a bit, will you?

200
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,680
Gimme a cold towel first. And take good care of him, okay?

201
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,240
Would you like another drink?

202
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,560
Thanks.

203
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,320
Your name’s Jun, right?

204
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,720
Yeah.

205
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,720
That’s a unique name.

206
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,160
My dad says it means “handsome.”

207
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,080
And hey—he wasn’t wrong.

208
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,000
So… Jun, are you a bottom?

209
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:21,160
I guess I could be. I kinda wanna find out if I can be one.

210
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,680
Well then… shall we head to the back?

211
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,080
Why the hell didn’t he accept it?

212
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,040
Hey, kid.

213
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,760
Yeah?

214
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,280
Franz here yet?

215
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,120
Yeah, he’s in the back.

216
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,080
Go tell him I’m here. Now.

217
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:02,480
Franz is with someone. I didn’t wanna interrupt.

218
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,560
Fine. I’ll go in there myself.

219
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,600
Franz!

220
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,880
What the hell, Sorn? Can’t it wait? You’re seriously killing the vibe.

221
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,280
Jun!

222
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,920
Sorn?

223
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,680
Wait—hold up. You two know each other?

224
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,720
You can’t mess with this kid!

225
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,640
Whoa… is that really Sorn?

226
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:07,480
Yeah, it’s me! Who told you to drink this much, Jun?

227
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:13,800
No one curses like that—yep, it’s Sorn for real.

228
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,320
You’re seriously the most stubborn little shit, Jun!

229
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,080
I swear I’ll smack you as many times as your age—stubborn as hell! Come here!

230
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,480
Didn’t you tell me to wait out back?

231
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,040
You brought me all the way back home?

232
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:05,240
Damn, just when we were about to do something—you totally ruined the mood, Franz. Classy move.

233
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:12,120
Fine, you little shit. When you’re with me, you act like you’re with someone else.

234
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,960
Do what you want. I’ll just sit here and say nothing.

235
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,240
You little punk…

236
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,480
Seriously deserve a slap.

237
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,560
Who told you to drink that beer?

238
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,960
Who told you to stock it in the fridge?

239
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,160
You’re so damn stubborn, Jun… unbelievably so.

240
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,200
I’ve never met anyone this hard-headed in my life.

241
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,160
Even Win listens better than you.

242
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:04,720
Why are you even here? Why do you care so much? Didn’t you say you didn’t like me?

243
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,680
See? You’re confusing the hell out of me again!

244
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,640
Say it! What did I do that confused you?

245
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,920
Just say it!

246
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,560
Say it! What did I do that confused you?

247
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,080
Is that why you were about to hook up with Franz?

248
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:40,320
I already told you—don’t go doing this kind of thing with someone else. You can do it only with me!

249
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,840
If you wanna learn something, or if you need anything—just tell me!

250
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,840
It’s you, okay? You’re the one who’s confusing me.

251
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,320
I know I like guys, but...

252
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,040
I don’t know what I really want.

253
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:15,240
And every time you teach me… I still can’t do it with anyone else.

254
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,200
But when I’m with you… it just feels different.

255
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,960
So that’s why you were gonna try it with someone else?

256
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:31,520
Yeah. So what if I was?

257
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,000
Then I’ll try it with you.

258
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,920
And I’ll make it so clear.

259
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,960
You won’t need answers from anyone else.

260
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:20,840
Yes, Mom.

261
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,080
When are you coming home, Sorn?

262
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:28,520
Can’t right now. Orders from overseas are piling up.

263
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,440
Tai and Champ can’t handle it alone, so I gotta help them out.

264
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,560
You’re working yourself too hard, son. You’ll get sick at this rate.

265
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,400
Your boy’s not that easy to break, Mom.

266
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:42,160
Alright, my strong boy… Oh right—Uncle Nui asked about buying the land.

267
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,120
I’ll come down during the long holiday.

268
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,560
Alright, I’ll let her know.

269
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,240
What’s wrong?

270
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,640
Tripped over the blanket…

271
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,520
Huh? You clumsy buffalo.

272
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,360
Ouch—don’t curse at me.

273
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,600
That hurt!

274
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,760
I’m naked, you know!

275
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,280
Can you get up? Let’s go eat something.

276
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,120
Just give me a minute.

277
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:42,760
What are you embarrassed for? You’re built like a damn ox and still acting like a shy kid.

278
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,200
If you can walk, come downstairs and eat.

279
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:53,080
By the way, James is coming back soon. You’ll have to go stay with him.

280
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,720
Okay…

281
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:01,360
So… you staying over with me again tonight?

282
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,280
Nah, I’ll head back to my dorm.

283
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:26,080
But I won’t be at your dorm, you know?

284
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,840
Yo, Sorn!

285
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:00,200
You’ve been in a good mood lately. Got something going on you’re not telling me?

286
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,400
Nothing.

287
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,120
Yeah right! Ever since Tai’s been gone this week,

288
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,160
you’ve been living it up like some
dude on vacation from his wife! You bastard!

289
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:43,280
Hey, Sorn—if you’re giving Jun that look because you’re planning something, don’t let me catch you.

290
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,920
Hey Jun, go make me some coffee.

291
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:06,040
I’m not your barista, bro. If you want coffee that bad, make it yourself.

292
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:15,760
Wow, can’t even make one cup? So heartless.

293
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,800
What’s his problem?

294
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,080
Delivery for Khun Penny.

295
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:28,200
Jun, go grab Penny’s stuff.

296
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,920
Hi there.

297
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:36,760
Oh! It’s you! Sorry about the other day—I ran into you pretty hard.

298
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:43,240
Ah, it’s you. Are you the new intern?

299
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,360
Yeah, just started two weeks ago.

300
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:52,080
That explains why I hadn’t seen you before. And sorry as well—I wasn’t watching where I was going.

301
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,440
No worries at all.

302
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,880
Here’s the food for Khun Penny.

303
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,280
Got it. I’ll put it away.

304
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,040
Thanks, I’ll leave it to you.

305
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,000
Sure thing.

306
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,880
Thanks.

307
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,680
Yep.

308
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,360
What were you two talking about?

309
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,200
Just random stuff. Nothing important.

310
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,840
Yo, where you planning to eat?

311
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,160
Why? You treating?

312
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,560
You coming or not?

313
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,400
I was thinking noodles at that spot. It’s good.

314
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:20,640
Okay then. I’ll take rice noodles—no bean sprouts, no pork, no meatballs. And pack it to go, please.

315
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,320
Damn, bro. This place is packed!

316
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,080
Wanna take it upstairs and eat?

317
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,880
Order in.

318
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,360
Takeout? That’ll be a 20-minute wait.

319
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,520
What’s wrong?

320
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,360
I’m starving.

321
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,880
it’s hot as hell.

322
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:11,040
Ughh can I grab something to eat first? I seriously can’t take it.

323
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,000
Wait.

324
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:17,720
Hey! Don’t mess with me—I’ll snitch to Tai for real!

325
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:24,840
Maybe I should mess with you for once. Fine, do whatever you want, buffalo.

326
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,560
Wait, where you going? Seriously, can we eat first?

327
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,360
Tokyo (pancakes)

328
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,320
What would you like?

329
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,120
Mixed fillings—three pieces, please.

330
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,240
Oh no, there’s something stuck on your face.

331
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:54,040
Bro! You didn’t tell me I had tissue on my face!
Totally killed my look.

332
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,280
Look at this!

333
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,000
Damn, you complain non-stop when you’re hungry.

334
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,720
I was gonna take it off earlier and you snapped, saying I was messing with you.

335
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,600
Now you’re mad I didn’t say anything?

336
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,080
Get it all off.

337
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,160
Is it all gone?

338
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:13,400
With all that whining, you wanna be my wife or something?

339
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:17,760
Who’d wanna be your wife? You’re old!

340
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,600
Old, huh? Still the one who made you moan, Jun.

341
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,000
Oh my god—cut it out, Sorn!

342
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,480
Hmm? You’re not eating the meatballs?

343
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,480
Nah.

344
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,440
Can I have them?

345
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,280
What’re you gonna give me in return?

346
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,320
Seriously? I have to trade for meatballs?

347
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:51,360
You were gonna throw them away anyway. Just give them to me, please!

348
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,840
I paid for this noodle bowl,

349
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:05,560
And now you just want to steal my meatballs? Don’t be such
a moocher, Jun.

350
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,440
Won’t even give me a bite… stingy!

351
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,600
Use those skills I taught you.

352
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,920
If you’re my student, you better know how to handle stuff like this.

353
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,840
Get in the car.

354
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:30,080
Why are you standing there all clueless? Wanna get my dad insulted or something?

355
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:48,040
I thought you already went home.

356
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:54,840
I bought a suki set. Didn’t feel like eating alone, so I came to pick you up.

357
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,680
You mean… me?

358
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:02,960
Well, who the hell do you think I brought into the car? Use your brain, man.

359
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,400
Did I say I wanted to go to your house?

360
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,320
I’m making you.

361
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,680
After we eat, I’ll drop you off at your dorm. Happy now?

362
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,400
Call Champ to join us first.

363
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,400
I didn’t invite him, I invited you.

364
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,520
Besides, I just had western food. Too greasy—I hated it.

365
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,280
Why’d you eat it then?

366
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,560
Can you just shut up until we get home?

367
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,440
Keep talking and I’ll really kiss you.

368
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,520
Eat.

369
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,800
Not hungry.

370
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,080
I’m heading out.

371
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,920
Last bus is gone.

372
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,920
Grab a ride.

373
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:07,200
Do you always trust people that easily, Jun?

374
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,160
What else do you want me to do?

375
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,560
Want me to take you back?

376
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,720
Why not just sleep here?

377
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,160
Nope.

378
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,240
Why not?

379
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:22,440
It’s free. Don’t wanna crash here?

380
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,880
Nah, I’m heading back. Better that way.

381
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,960
We’re both guys—nothing should happen, right?

382
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,040
You’re so damn stubborn.

383
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,320
I’ll drive you back.

384
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,920
Thanks for dropping me off.

385
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,520
Jun....

386
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:28,280
This kiss is one that sticks.

387
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:36,000
When you kiss like that, the person you kiss will be thinking about you all night long.

388
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:46,600
Damn, if you’re gonna teach me, just say so. No need to yank my neck like that—you scared the crap outta me!

389
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,040
I’m going now.

390
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,440
Jun....

391
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:58,720
can I crash at your dorm tonight? Don’t wanna risk driving—might doze off.

392
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,160
You already got there?

393
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,560
Yeah.

394
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,160
You, man...

395
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,040
Just got back from dinner with a client.

396
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,680
Ahh..

397
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,800
I’m gonna shower first.

398
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,800
Mhm, go ahead.

399
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,440
Hey, don’t forget to turn the camera back around.

400
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,920
Shit…

401
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,760
Yo, don’t start judging my room,

402
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,840
It’s… kinda messy.

403
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,560
Mm.

404
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,680
Make yourself at home, I’ll shower real quick.

405
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,280
Don’t trash the place.

406
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:11,560
You could’ve just told me to carry it—don’t just hold it out like that. You scared me!

407
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,760
Where should I put it?

408
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,920
I saw you tell Tai this model fits great.

409
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:34,120
Yeah, it does. So, where do you want me to put them?

410
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:37,840
I bought them but the size’s wrong.

411
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,360
You take them—wear 'em for me.

412
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:13,680
Bro… are you seriously taking back the shoes? You gave them to me—who does that?

413
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,440
Still got them?

414
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:21,040
Yeah, I still have them.

415
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,400
You gave them to me.

416
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:32,040
You’re so dramatic—go write a novel or something,
you’d be great.

417
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,360
Alright, I’m taking this side. You sleep on the inside.

418
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:56,800
Your room’s hot as hell. I might need to sleep naked.

419
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,120
Jun…

420
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,200
What the hell are you talking about?

421
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,800
I want to.

422
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,800
Ugh—wait, hold on…

423
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:42,280
Look, I think we need to have a straight-up talk.

424
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,880
Can’t it wait till later?

425
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:47,000
Nope. We’re talking now.

426
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,680
Say what you wanna say.

427
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:10,480
Like… about that stuff—we’ve done it once, and that was enough, right? I feel like it’s gone too far now.

428
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:15,600
If I tell you something… can you handle it, Jun?

429
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:19,400
Go ahead. Say it.

430
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:24,320
I like doing it with you… but you’re not that good.

431
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:31,000
But if you keep practicing, I think you’ll become amazing.

432
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:34,120
But why me?

433
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:40,200
From the koi pond back then… to now...

434
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,840
Why’d you believe me anyway?

435
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:51,160
You sound convincing. And honestly, I thought it was safe talking to you.

436
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:57,600
Can I ask why you kept teaching me?

437
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:07,040
Because we already started something. And it wasn’t hard to just… keep going.

438
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:18,760
Right now, I just want you to focus on one thing—are you happy with what we’re doing?

439
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:28,200
Honestly… yeah, I kinda like it. It’s not like it’s hurting anyone, right?

440
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:31,080
Why are you overthinking all this?

441
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:38,600
How could I not think about it? We didn’t even get along before… and now this?

442
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:42,800
If your girlfriend sees this, won’t she kill me?

443
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:50,960
I don’t have a wife. No kids.

444
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:57,640
What about you? Got a boyfriend? A fling?

445
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:00,360
Someone I’m talking to… but it’s nothing.

446
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:05,680
Then stop talking to them. If you’ve got something to say,
say it to me.

447
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,640
Wow… you’re acting like my boyfriend now.

448
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:18,280
Let me tell you something, Jun… If I were your boyfriend, you wouldn’t be asking me these dumb questions.

449
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:25,280
So? You and me—are we clear now?

450
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,800
Yeah, clear.

451
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,160
Clear about what?

452
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:51,240
You and I… we’re just sex buddies. We give each other what we need. No feelings involved.
