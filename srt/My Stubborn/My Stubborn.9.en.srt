1
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,720
If I'm going to date a kid, it definitely can't be Jun.

2
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,920
Why not?

3
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,520
Because he's Tai's little brother.

4
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,160
So what's Tai got to do with this? You're just a friend of his brother.

5
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:15,600
Tai treats Jun like he's the most precious thing. They've known each other since they were kids—super close.

6
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:25,520
You know what? Tai once told me he wanted his mom to adopt Jun.

7
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:35,000
I can't even imagine... if I ever broke up with Jun, how would I face my friend?v

8
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,240
But they're not real siblings, are they? If you like him, go for it.

9
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,960
But they're not real siblings, are they? If you like him, go for it.

10
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:57,160
I just don't want to mess things up with Tai.v

11
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,400
I...

12
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:12,320
Shut up, Sorn. And listen to me. All the plans you're making for the future—go ahead. I'm not stopping you.

13
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,440
Because those are things that bring stability.

14
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,760
But this—this is about your heart.

15
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,800
I want you to think about today, not just the future.

16
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,760
You always make things harder than they need to be.

17
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,840
Let me ask you seriously—what are you afraid of?

18
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,720
Are you really happy saying things that go against your heart?

19
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,280
Even I can tell you like him—and I'm just watching from afar.

20
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,520
Did Jun pay you to say all this?

21
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:58,360
Nope. I just feel sorry for you.

22
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,760
You're such an idiot.

23
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,880
A kid confesses they like you and all you say is 'thanks'?

24
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,200
What, you thanking your dad?

25
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,480
Isn't your dad the same as mine, you idiot?

26
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,800
And another thing—was he eavesdropping?

27
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,560
When he said he liked me?

28
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,480
Nosy little shit.

29
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,800
And he was drunk at the time.

30
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,880
You can't take everything a drunk person says seriously.

31
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,800
He was drunk?

32
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,240
Yeah, right. You're just making excuses.

33
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,040
I saw everything.

34
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,960
And I know Jom is close to Jun too.

35
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,600
But... I don't really know that name.

36
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,159
Is he one of your crew?

37
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,760
You know Jom too?

38
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,520
Did Jun tell you about him?

39
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,800
No, he just happened to call when I was with Jun.

40
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,280
'Hia Jom this, Hia Jom that.

41
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,880
' Sounds like they're planning a trip together too.

42
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,800
So how far have you and Jom gotten in your chats?

43
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,240
You two seem real close, huh?

44
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,920
And what’s wrong with that?

45
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,720
We just know each other.

46
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:56,200
But you're not like this with Win.

47
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,600
Or Tai. Or Champ.

48
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,000
You don’t spam texts or call them this much.

49
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,720
I just talk to Hia Jom about random stuff, that’s all.

50
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,520
And with Hia Champ, I’ve talked to him forever

51
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,000
even during the two years you disappeared,

52
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,600
I kept in touch.

53
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,120
I told you already—I don’t like Jom.

54
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,520
What did Hia Jom even do for you to dislike him?

55
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,760
Ask yourself what's going on with you.

56
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,840
You chase away everyone I talk to—Piangrak,

57
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,200
now Jom.

58
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,280
Why is that?

59
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,640
What if I said I was jealous?

60
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,280
Don’t say it.

61
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:17,760
I told you before—if you don’t feel anything, don’t say anything.

62
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,640
But what if I really am jealous, Jun?

63
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,480
Could you handle it?

64
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,280
You’ve hated me for years.

65
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,440
You won’t even call me 'Hia.

66
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,960
' Even if you say you like me more now,

67
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,640
it doesn’t mean you can ignore everything else, right?

68
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,000
But I already confessed that I like you.

69
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,600
Do you understand what that means?

70
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:04,240
And you replied… 'Thanks.'

71
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,320
So how am I supposed to believe you're really jealous?

72
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,760
You remember that?

73
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:21,120
I think I’ve been clear enough about how I feel.

74
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,280
What you do with that—it’s up to you.

75
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,080
Do you really like me? For real?

76
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,400
Get out. Don’t come near me.

77
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,320
Tell me.

78
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,080
Tell me now, while you're sober

79
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,640
. Otherwise I won’t count what you said when you were drunk.

80
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:02,600
What the hell, P’...

81
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,080
Sounds like someone just woke up...

82
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,120
Just leave.

83
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,760
I’m sleepy. I want to sleep.

84
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,040
You’re not going to let me take care of you?

85
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,640
Go take a shower, P’.

86
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,440
I’m seriously tired.

87
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,960
What if I said I was jealous?

88
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,520
Your eyes look swollen. Are you okay?

89
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,320
I’m fine.

90
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,520
Are you sick or something?

91
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,560
I’ll take you to the doctor.

92
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,320
I don’t want Tai blaming me for bringing you home sick.

93
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,640
You okay? You’ve got to tell me if something’s wrong, Jun.

94
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:30,400
Man, I’m just happy you and Hia Sorn are finally cool with each other.

95
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:35,280
Now we can actually go on trips without all the death stares.

96
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,520
Jun.

97
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,400
Hey, Hia Champ. Hello.v

98
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,280
So, how was the trip?

99
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,680
It was fun, Hia.

100
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,800
Then how come you didn’t come with Sorn today?

101
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,280
Hey Jun.

102
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,200
Hi Hia.

103
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,680
Where’s my souvenir?

104
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,640
Oops, I forgot, Hia.

105
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,920
But I did buy something.

106
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,880
I went down south, so I brought back some salted eggs.

107
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,560
Ah… hmm. (feels like “Oh, I see.”)

108
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,600
Were the eggs very salty?

109
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,200
Yeah, they were salty.

110
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,640
James,

111
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,240
were the salted eggs salty?

112
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,040
Yeah… they were salty.

113
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,560
You mean, like, actual eggs?

114
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,320
Salted eggs are like… this, right?

115
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,440
Ugh.

116
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,200
That’s not it?

117
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,040
Nope.

118
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,040
Sorn,

119
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,840
go check the order upstairs. I think there’s a mistake.

120
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,240
Okay.

121
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:38,720
Even more than pomelos. Four of them. Four eggs.

122
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,880
Where did you go this morning?

123
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,520
Why didn’t you leave with me?

124
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,360
I had some errands to run.

125
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,560
What errands?

126
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,960
Why didn’t you tell me?

127
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,400
We could’ve gone together.

128
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,800
Didn’t want to bother you.

129
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,880
Bother me with what?

130
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,760
Or did you plan to meet that asshole Jom?

131
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,120
No, I didn’t.

132
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,520
And what if I did meet with Jom?

133
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,200
What’s it got to do with you?

134
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,040
It has everything to do with me!

135
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,200
Because.....

136
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,520
I’m the one Tai asked to look after you.

137
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,240
If you're going somewhere, shouldn't you at least tell me first?

138
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,280
Let’s go eat. I’m starving… come on.

139
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,120
I’m not hungry.

140
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,120
Then what do you want to eat?

141
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,200
Just tell me and I’ll buy it.

142
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,560
We can eat together.

143
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,040
But I’m still—

144
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,320
If you say you’re not hungry one more time, Jun,

145
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I swear I’ll kiss you right here.

146
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,840
Aren’t you afraid people will think you like me?

147
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:51,040
Or did you forget you told me you didn’t?

148
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,160
Jun…

149
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,240
Sorn,

150
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,920
come outside with me.

151
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,360
What’s up?

152
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,480
Just ask.

153
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,160
Why’d you bring Jun to the house?

154
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,760
No reason.

155
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,000
He was free, so I invited him.

156
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:52,760
And? Looks like you two get along pretty well.

157
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,240
I told you to open your heart to Jun.

158
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,920
He’s just a normal kid.

159
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,640
That cheeky attitude—it’s just one part of who he is.

160
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,520
Yeah, real cheeky.

161
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,560
First day he shows up, he's already drinking bootleg liquor with Nu.

162
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,960
Excuse me, here’s your food.

163
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,080
Oh, let me get a menu too, please.

164
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,080
Sure.

165
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,240
I’ll have… this one,

166
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,640
and this one… oh,

167
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,880
and this one too.

168
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,880
Why you ordering so much?

169
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,000
Feeding the whole company or what?

170
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,840
It’s for your precious little brother, isn’t it?

171
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,240
You sure take care of my brother well.

172
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,160
Didn’t you ask me to look after him?

173
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,680
Yeah, and that’s good.

174
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:18,360
Just don’t forget—Jun’s like our little brother.

175
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,360
Yeah.

176
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,880
Where are you rushing off to?

177
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,280
Uh…

178
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,640
You’ve got plans every damn day. You never wait to go home with me anymore.

179
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,360
Ever since you got back from the South, you’ve been avoiding me.

180
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,960
What’s going on with you?

181
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:04,320
If you keep shutting me out like this, how am I supposed to know what’s wrong?

182
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:24,320
Fine. I’ll go shower and get dressed. Let’s head to work together.

183
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,640
Do you even get what I’m saying?

184
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,400
Yeah.

185
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,520
Food delivery.

186
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,120
P’Jom.

187
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,760
Hello. Is Khun Korn around?

188
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,960
Oh, Korn went to the café.

189
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,160
Okay, could you give this to him for me?

190
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,400
Sure, I’ll take it for him.

191
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,600
Thank you.

192
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,240
Is Jun here?

193
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,200
Umm...

194
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,680
Praew, give this to Jun for me. He’s working for me.

195
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,480
Okay.

196
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,840
It’s fine. Just let Jun know I brought him some snacks.

197
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,320
Sure.

198
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,480
Thanks.

199
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,600
You seriously couldn’t go get it yourself?

200
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:40,080
Jom bought that for you. Isn’t it rude if you don’t go out to get it?

201
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,480
I already told Praew to grab it for me.

202
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:49,240
P’Sorn, can you help me? I’m not really sure how to do this.

203
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,200
Same here, P’. I’ve been stuck for a while.

204
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,480
Why aren’t my calculations matching up?

205
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,280
Since Jun’s into fitness, I got him something healthy.

206
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,960
Really?

207
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,400
What’s going on between you and Jom?!

208
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,560
What the hell, P’?

209
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,760
Jom looks like he’s trying to hit on you.

210
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,720
So what if he is?

211
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,840
You just met him. You don’t even know if he’s a good person.

212
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:42,720
And how would you know if he is or not? I haven’t even tried dating him.

213
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,960
So you’re gonna date him after you just told me you liked me?

214
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,640
Isn’t that none of your business?

215
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,960
Jun!!!

216
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,760
At least Jom never said...

217
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,680
He doesn’t like younger guys.

218
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,360
You don’t know a damn thing, so stop talking.

219
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,240
Then if you don’t know, shut the hell up too.

220
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,640
Whatever’s going on between me and Jom... that’s my business.

221
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,120
Hey, what’s up?

222
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,600
Hey.

223
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,920
You been here long?

224
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,960
Yeah, a while. Are you drunk?

225
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,160
What? No way. Come on, let’s have a drink.

226
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,960
Cheers!

227
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,160
Hold up. This is Hia Jom.

228
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,240
Hello.

229
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:51,840
Hey there.

230
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,320
And this is Win, my friend.

231
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,920
I’ll be right back, bye!

232
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,360
You’re such a drunk, man.

233
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,400
Hia.

234
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,240
Do you think someone like me should even have a girlfriend?

235
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,160
Why do you ask that, Jun?

236
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:24,320
I used to date girls, y’know… but it never worked out.

237
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,760
So I started liking guys instead.

238
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,440
You’re not surprised I like guys?

239
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:38,440
A little. But honestly, it’s not far from what I expected.

240
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,440
Wait… do I come off that obvious?

241
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:52,800
But the guy I like… he doesn’t like me back.

242
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,040
So are you gonna go after him, or move on?

243
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,160
I don’t know.

244
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,560
Hia. I think… I should probably let go.

245
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,920
Just haven’t found someone to heal me yet.

246
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,480
Then take your time, Jun.

247
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:25,120
And if you’re not ready, you can lean on my shoulder for now.

248
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,760
Thanks, Hia.

249
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:47,720
That’s enough, Jun.

250
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,280
Come on, Hia, just a little more.

251
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,840
That’s too much already, Jun. Enough.

252
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,520
Hey, Sorn! Easy! Don’t start something here, calm down!

253
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,160
Jun, we’re going home!

254
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,720
Hia Sorn.

255
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,800
I'm going home!

256
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,920
I said I'm not going back!

257
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,960
Hia Sorn? Why are you even here?

258
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,280
No one invited you.

259
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,640
Oh! Hi P'Franz, want a drink?

260
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,800
Just one more, yeah?

261
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,640
Let Jun go. If he wants to drink, let him. I’ll look after him.

262
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,800
Mind your own business.

263
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,920
Let’s go home!

264
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,040
You! Come with me!

265
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,480
Jun.

266
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,480
Hey! Let him go! This is family business!

267
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,920
You’re hurting him!

268
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,000
Look at what you did, Jun!

269
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,840
Why the hell would you act like that at the club?

270
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,240
What if Tai asks me...

271
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,320
Hia Tai!

272
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,480
Hia Tai! Hia Tai.

273
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,960
Hia Tai that! It’s always about Hia Tai!

274
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,960
Let me ask you straight.

275
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,840
Have you ever cared about me by yourself? Just once?

276
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,840
All you do is use Hia Tai as an excuse.

277
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,720
Stop yelling at me, Jun!

278
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,200
No. Let go!

279
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,840
What the hell do you want from me, Jun? You’ve been saying crap all day!

280
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,320
Then what do you want from me?

281
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,600
If you don’t like me, just leave me alone!

282
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,280
Or is this how you care for me—as Tai’s precious little brother?

283
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,520
Don’t bother next time.

284
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,320
I don’t need it.

285
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,160
And dragging me out of the club like some stray dog.

286
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,360
Did Tai tell you to do that too?

287
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:23,960
Huh?

288
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:37,280
Don’t forget—you’re just the guy who taught me about sex.

289
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,960
You have no right to act like that.

290
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:46,760
Jun.

291
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,920
And another thing...

292
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,680
Every time we sleep together, it’s because you wanted it!!

293
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:12,320
And I was just the idiot who let you fool me.

294
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,280
From now on.

295
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:40,000
You and I—we’re done. I don’t care what it’s about.

296
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,120
You won’t have to deal with a kid like me ever again.

297
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,000
And just so you know...

298
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,200
I hate you.

299
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,520
Shit! P’Sorn!

300
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,920
Hey, where’d you go last night?

301
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,160
I told you, didn’t I? Don’t drive drunk.

302
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,640
I wasn’t drunk, bro. I went out with Jun.

303
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:59,160
Try to keep that kid in check. He’ll go off the rails when he grows up.

304
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,760
Bro…

305
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,040
Hmm?

306
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,600
It’s just…

307
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:15,800
It’s just…

308
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,200
Nah.

309
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,880
What?

310
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,080
I don’t know how to start.

311
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,640
That serious, huh?

312
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,200
Looks like Hia Sorn and that Jun guy are about to...

313
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,600
Sorn, what the hell’s wrong with you?

314
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:02,640
You sent the wrong order. If I sent this to the client, what then?
Pay attention, man.

315
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,040
Did Tai call you?

316
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,640
Yeah, he did.

317
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,360
What about Jun?

318
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,000
Why should I tell you?

319
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,000
Why didn’t he show up for work?

320
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,440
I called him so many times, he wouldn’t answer.

321
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,040
He probably had something to do.

322
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,640
Let me borrow your phone, I’ll call him.

323
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:45,440
Damn, what the hell’s with you today? You’re so annoying.

324
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,160
Just let me borrow it.

325
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,120
Fine.

326
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,920
Hello, Champ.

327
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,920
Why aren’t you answering my calls?

328
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,639
Are you ignoring me now?

329
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,960
Sorn, I gotta go.

330
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,280
Don’t hang up on me, Jun! How are we supposed to fix this if you keep running away?

331
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:23,719
I know you’re mad, but I want to talk, I want to clear things up. If you keep avoiding me, how can we fix it?

332
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,560
Let’s talk later.

333
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,440
Jun.

334
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:40,800
I’ll come pick you up this evening. You’re at Tai’s place, right?

335
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,360
Want me to bring you something to eat?

336
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,400
Up to you.

337
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,239
See you.

338
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,720
Champ.

339
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:12,080
What’s wrong with Sorn lately? Did he fight with his girlfriend?

340
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,520
No idea, maybe he’s on his period.

341
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,640
Oh, his period?

342
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:23,760
Just like me, mine just started too.

343
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:30,080
I’ll go buy pads then, maybe get some for Sorn too. The winged ones.

344
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,640
Size 20. Byeee.

345
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,840
Hey, what are you eating? Having a celebration without telling me?

346
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,360
Why are you here?

347
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,000
Where is he?

348
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Who?

349
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:03,000
Don’t play dumb. I know you know everything. I want to talk to him first.

350
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,840
Where are you going?

351
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:17,080
If you won’t help, then shut up. I’ll go look for him.

352
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:23,080
If I do shut up, will you calm down?

353
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,960
Or will you finally be clearer than Jun is?

354
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,840
You led the kid on for months, dragged me into it until you started lying to yourself too.

355
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,480
And when the kid actually fell for you, you turned out to be a coward.

356
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:53,000
Have you even asked yourself whether you really like him?

357
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,160
Sorn, are you and Jun dating?

358
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,080
Dating?, Damn!!!

359
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:12,080
He doesn’t even know if he really likes Jun.

360
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:25,000
Then how can I admit I like him? He’s your little brother.

361
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,800
I had to hold myself back.

362
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,160
Because if you get mad…

363
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:44,400
So how many times have you two done it? Did you ever think that
he’s my little brother?

364
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,680
If you don’t really like him, then let him go.

365
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,000
Don’t let him fall deeper than he already has.

366
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,760
Guys, calm down!

367
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:08,040
Where’s Jun? Let’s just call him and talk this out.

368
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,960
Jun’s not here.

369
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,520
Tai.

370
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,480
I want to talk to Jun.

371
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:36,760
Then why didn’t you talk to him before?

372
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:48,760
Think hard—what did you say to him that made him not want to face you?

373
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:57,800
Let me tell you something. First thing you need to do is admit your own damn feelings.

374
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,120
You idiot!!!

375
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:14,040
Fine… I like him.

376
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,960
I like them… so much it hurts.

377
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,960
I don’t usually go for younger people, you know...

378
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,320
But I like them. I really do.

379
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,760
So no one thought to tell me anything?

380
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,880
It’s Sorn business, not yours.

381
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:41,120
Fine… I get it.

382
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:09,800
Sorn? You’re here late. Is something wrong? Did something happen to Jun?

383
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:22,720
Oh, no. I just happened to be nearby. Jun asked me to bring something he forgot, but he messaged me saying I don’t need to anymore.

384
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,000
Well then, I’ll get going.

385
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,560
Okay, take care getting home.

386
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:40,040
Why do I feel like I’m helping someone run off with someone else’s wife?

387
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,680
You’re still not answering Sorn’s calls? He’s called you so many times.

388
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,040
Screw it. Just ignore it.

389
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,600
Shit, he’s calling my house now.

390
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:20,160
Just pick up. But don’t tell him I’m with you. And if he asks where I am, don’t say anything.

391
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:27,120
Hello, bro. I can’t say, Tai orders.

392
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:36,520
That’s all for now, my dad asked me to run an errand. Yes, sir.

393
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:49,840
Jun, what are you gonna do if he actually finds you?

394
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,200
I don’t know.

395
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:03,280
Then… let me ask you this instead.

396
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:12,360
If he tells you he likes you… would you be with him?

397
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,240
What would you like to order today, P’James?

398
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,920
Espresso, thanks.

399
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:45,040
Morning, P’Sorn! You’re here early today.

400
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,640
Good morning, P’Sorn.

401
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,520
Mmm... Jun’s not coming in to work today?

402
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,080
Looks like… he’s not coming.

403
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,080
Why does Sorn look so stressed today?

404
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,160
Yeah, I’m kinda scared now too.

405
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,840
You can't avoid me forever, Jun.

406
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:06,880
I will find you.

407
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,760
Get ready to meet me.

408
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:28,200
Hey, have you and Jun talked it out yet?

409
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:38,640
He’s avoiding me. Thinks he can just take leave and disappear.

410
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,160
So what are you gonna do?

411
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,720
He can’t stay off work for long.

412
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:50,280
If he’s gone too much, he won’t pass his internship.

413
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:24,160
Look… about yesterday, I’m sorry.

414
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:31,240
I didn’t mean to go off on you like that.

415
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:38,600
But you were right. It’s not really my business.

416
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,720
Who says that?

417
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,760
Everything’s your business too…

418
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:04,280
But why… I don’t feel like that.

419
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,440
What even are we? I don’t even know.

420
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,320
Forget it…

421
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,800
Hey, it’s not like that…

422
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,720
If you don’t really feel anything, then don’t act like this.

423
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,040
Yo Win, doing stock check?

424
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,040
Yeah… so much stuff.

425
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,480
Hey, let’s grab something to eat tonight. I’m starving.

426
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,080
Pad Thai with omelette sound good?

427
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,240
You got it, man.

428
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,480
You made a deal. No backing out.

429
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,080
Deal!

430
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,280
See you, back to work.

431
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,280
Bye. Work hard, man.

432
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,120
Okay.

433
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,640
Still mad at me?

434
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:42,360
What… Who’s mad at you?

435
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:49,240
Can we not be like this? I really hate this feeling.

436
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:57,000
You don’t need to feel anything. It’s always left hanging anyway.

437
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,400
Champ...

438
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,080
It’s just...

439
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:05,400
It’s fine. It’s not even my business.

440
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:11,040
Champ, talk nicely to me, please?

441
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:17,680
Alright then, truce.

442
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,560
You look kinda cute in glasses, y’know.

443
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,160
Don’t even.

444
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,800
Still mad? Huh?

445
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,800
Dunno.

446
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,760
Do you even shower, dude?

447
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:43,840
Mmm…

448
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:51,080
In the meantime, you should really think about your feelings.

449
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,480
Mmm…

450
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,560
Maybe Jun needs time too.

451
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:07,720
He’s been gone for a whole week. Still not enough time to think things through?

452
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:29,000
Damn, shave that thing already!

453
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,360
Dude, I legit thought you were a jungle bandit.

454
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,440
What are we celebrating?

455
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:42,480
Celebrate my ass. I came to comfort someone heartbroken.

456
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:45,760
Who?

457
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,760
You, idiot.

458
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,160
I’m not heartbroken.

459
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,240
I just…

460
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,320
Got dumped?

461
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:06,080
I asked Korn where Jun is—he didn’t know.

462
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:10,200
Asked Tai—he wouldn’t say a word.

463
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:20,200
But that guy Jom, the one who went clubbing with Jun? He knows.

464
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,800
Oh hey.

465
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:33,040
Whose rhino plushie is that?

466
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,040
It’s Jun’s.

467
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,480
So tiny and squishy.

468
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,680
Here, here—take this.

469
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,800
Let’s toast.

470
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:29,640
Come on, Tai. Just tell me where Jun is.

471
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:33,520
Hia, I’m not trusting a guy like Sorn. No way.

472
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,960
No way... Hia Sorn?

473
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,960
I caught you. Did you ever even miss me?

474
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:40,960
Obviously not.

475
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,680
Even if you didn’t… I missed you.
