1
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,520
Next time, if you can’t find your way home, just call me to pick you up.

2
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,920
Don’t just go home with some random guy.

3
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,480
Why are you making it so complicated?

4
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,320
You’re just gonna call Tai again and say I didn’t take care of you, right?

5
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,400
You don’t need to worry about Hia Tai.

6
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,160
I didn’t even meddle in your thing with Penny.

7
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,280
Are you sure you want to go through with this, Sorn?

8
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,480
Yeah, I’m sure. That’s that.

9
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,400
Is that even enough food?

10
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,479
Yeah, it’s enough.

11
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,960
Enough for me, just for breakfast tomorrow.

12
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:44,600
What about me?

13
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,200
Find your own food.

14
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,960
Listen to me, Jun.

15
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,680
From now on, every morning.

16
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,440
I’m gonna have breakfast with you.

17
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,520
Huh?

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Every day.

19
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,960
If you’re gonna watch, then sit down, Jun. Don’t just stand there.

20
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,279
We’ve got a couch and you won’t even sit on it.

21
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:20,880
I like sitting here. Stop talking, I’m trying to watch TV.

22
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,320
Hey! I said don’t bother me, I’m watching!

23
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,320
Let me stay like this for a bit.

24
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,680
Hey! Don’t mess with my nipple.

25
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,560
Why not?

26
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,000
‘Cause it’s tiny and kinda cute.

27
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,159
Why are you so pale?

28
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,760
Well, I’m half Chinese.

29
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,480
Hey.

30
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,680
Where are you going?

31
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,040
I don’t like your cologne. Smells like women’s perfume.

32
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,880
Why’d you take your shirt off?

33
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:04,400
You said you didn’t like the scent, right? So I took it off.

34
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,720
Here, Puth. This is for you.

35
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,799
Mmm, just leave it over there.

36
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,880
What’s up with him?

37
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,800
Whoa, whoa—

38
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:55,760
Hey! This model just came out, right? It’s so damn cool.

39
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,880
What do you think? Nice, huh?

40
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,720
Yeah.

41
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,120
I just bought it.

42
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,200
Let me try it on.

43
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,840
If it wasn’t you, I wouldn’t let anyone borrow it.

44
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,440
You’re the best, Puth.

45
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,840
Don’t scratch it, okay?

46
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,920
Yeah, yeah.

47
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,200
Just a sec.

48
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,840
Ew, it’s dirty.

49
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,400
I’ve had my eye on this one forever.

50
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,760
This is perfect.

51
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,400
Done.

52
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,720
Let me see.

53
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,600
Whoa.

54
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,480
What do you think?

55
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,120
Looks good on you. You need to get one for yourself.

56
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,600
Then I’m keeping it. Bye!

57
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,080
Hey, Jun!

58
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,240
That’s mine!

59
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:38,920
Can I have it?

60
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,360
No!!!

61
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:40,800
Careful!

62
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,840
Don’t scratch it! Don’t scratch it!

63
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,480
Jun!!!

64
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,680
Oh, Sorn’s here. Here’s your stuff.

65
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,840
I’m out.

66
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:29,080
Why the hell are you messing around with Puth? You don’t care if people get the wrong idea?

67
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,520
Come on, who’s gonna think that way? You nag too much.

68
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,680
Where are you going?

69
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,360
Taking you to eat, duh.

70
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,240
Why are you so grumpy?

71
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,480
Sorry, I’m just starving.

72
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,760
Want my banana?

73
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,400
What the hell?

74
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,400
Here. Want it or not?

75
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,680
Hell no.

76
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,440
It’s a big one though. If you don’t want it, I’ll eat it.

77
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,360
Go ahead, eat it.

78
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,760
Perfect fit in my hand.

79
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,360
Here.

80
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,360
Big juicy bite. Wanna try?

81
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,440
Can’t you eat like a normal person?

82
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,960
Hey, Pieng!

83
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,040
Turn around.

84
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,160
Whoa.

85
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,840
What are you doing here?

86
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:59,360
I’m modeling for a shoot. And you’re here with...?

87
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,320
This is Sorn. Sorn, this is Pieng.

88
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,360
Hi, Sorn. Finally get to meet you.

89
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,240
How’s it going? Tired?

90
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,320
Totally exhausted.

91
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,400
Hang in there.

92
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,680
Hey, bro, watch where you're walking.

93
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,680
Oops, I better go first. Don’t wanna get scolded.

94
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:57,200
Jun, don’t forget to prepare the quotation for this part, okay?

95
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,440
Got it.

96
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,920
Alright, thanks.

97
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,760
You eat too many candies. Your teeth are gonna rot, dude.

98
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,000
Ouch.

99
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,080
Hello, food delivery here.

100
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,480
Who’s it for?

101
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,920
For Ms. June. Is she around?

102
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,440
Oh, she’s in a meeting. I’ll take it for her.

103
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,760
Alright, please pass it to her.

104
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,920
Sure.

105
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,400
This one’s for Jun.

106
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,400
Huh? I’ve got something too?

107
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,560
I was driving by, saw some snacks that looked good, thought I’d get you some.

108
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,080
Thanks!

109
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,800
Don’t tell me you’re trying to bribe me with snacks.

110
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,520
Deep down you just want to boost your restaurant sales, don’t you?

111
00:13:54,520 --> 00:14:00,480
Nah, but to be honest, we do have a promo going. In case you’re interested.

112
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,520
For real?

113
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:07,400
Nice! I’ll definitely drop by when I get the chance. Just not sure when.

114
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,400
Sorn.

115
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,120
But let me know when you plan to come.

116
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,720
Sure thing.

117
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,440
What’s the update from Vietnam?

118
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,440
Oh right—don’t forget to eat the snacks before they get cold. Won’t taste as good.

119
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,840
Did they confirm the order yet?

120
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:21,920
It’s already a week past the deadline and they still haven’t given us an answer.

121
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,000
Sorn.

122
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,360
Hey, Sorn! Yo, Sorn!

123
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,600
Sorn!!!

124
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,760
Sorn, June’s talking to you. What are you staring at?

125
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,160
Uh—about the Vietnam order. I’ll make sure we get a response by today.

126
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,080
Okay.

127
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,560
Alright, let’s move on to the next item.

128
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,360
So here, we have the figures...

129
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:06,280
Excuse me, Ms. Penny, are these the most updated figures?

130
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,200
From what I remember, they weren’t like this.

131
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,120
Right, these are the ones from—

132
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,760
Sorry, there’s been a slight mistake with the data.

133
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:42,040
I really hope you won’t be making mistakes like this when we’re actually executing, Ms. Penny.

134
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,560
Simple stuff like this shouldn’t even be wrong in the first place.

135
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,920
If I were stricter, you’d be in real trouble.

136
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,600
I’m sorry. I’ll fix it right away.

137
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:19,320
It’s alright. We can review it again after the meeting.

138
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,520
Okay, let’s move on to the next topic.

139
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,720
Sorn, you need to focus more during meetings.

140
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,760
Sorry.

141
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:19,640
Guys, is Jun seriously close with the delivery guy?

142
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,040
Yeah, I saw them chatting the other day.

143
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,640
But Jun’s like that. He gets close to everyone real fast.

144
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,640
But not with me though.

145
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:35,160
Who would wanna be close with you? You always mess with him.

146
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,160
If I were Jun, I wouldn’t want anything to do with you either.

147
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,760
Right?

148
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,160
Me too.

149
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,800
Hey, Jun.

150
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,280
Oh, hey Hia.

151
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,040
You know the delivery guy?

152
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,560
Yeah, just met him. I went to eat at his cousin’s place, that’s how we met.

153
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,000
Want some snacks? Jom got these for me—they look tasty.

154
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,720
Looks good, but I’ll pass.

155
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:19,600
Come on, Hia, just a bite! You really that health-conscious?

156
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,520
I’ll eat it later.

157
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,480
What’s up?

158
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:28,840
What?

159
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,320
You just seem kind of annoyed.

160
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,520
Be ready by 3 p.m. I’m taking you to the factory.

161
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,520
Tell Pae and Aey too.

162
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,680
Fine, just take my snacks then.

163
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,800
I’m heading out. Later!

164
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,680
Come on.

165
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,600
It’s noon. Let’s grab lunch.

166
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,840
Let’s go.

167
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,080
How could you do that?

168
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,160
Do what?

169
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,200
You embarrassed me in that meeting.

170
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:37,640
You’re doing this because of me and Sorn, aren’t you?

171
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:49,720
I usually keep work and personal stuff completely separate.

172
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,600
But now...

173
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,400
I’m not so sure anymore.

174
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,600
Maybe it is because of you.

175
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,800
Where are you going?

176
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,280
There’s a sports day at the factory.

177
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,760
You ever been?

178
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:28,000
Never. Look at me, I’m drowning in work over here.

179
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,880
At this rate, you’re gonna be a future tycoon for sure.

180
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,600
We go ta hustle and save up—so you can marry P’Wi, right?

181
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,600
Stop.

182
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,960
What?

183
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,040
Sit down.

184
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,080
Now what?

185
00:23:54,040 --> 00:24:00,320
Every time you mention Wi, I get super stressed out.

186
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,280
Here we go again .

187
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,520
Wi gets jealous so easily, bro.

188
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:12,600
Like that day—my phone rang, and she checked to see if it was a
client or not!

189
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,800
Damn.

190
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,440
I’m so done with this, man.

191
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,640
We l don’t forget, you’ve done your share of crap to her too.

192
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,240
My dear boy .

193
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,240
What now?

194
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,600
I was wrong, okay?

195
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,960
Wow, going fu l drama now, huh?

196
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,080
But seriously—I’ve changed. I’m a good guy now!

197
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,040
Uh-huh.

198
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,200
You believe me, right?

199
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,320
Sure, I believe you.

200
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,920
Wi even gets jealous of me and you!

201
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,160
That’s crazy. Why would she be jealous of me?

202
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:49,040
Even if I like guys . you’re just not my type, bro.

203
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,560
You like guys?

204
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,400
Yeah. Why?

205
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,600
You got a boyfriend?

206
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,720
Uhh.....

207
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:05,080
Jun, you coming or not? Otherwise, I’ l leave you here.

208
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,920
I’m packed. Let’s go!

209
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,080
I’m going now. Byeee!

210
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,600
See ya.

211
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,280
Don’t stress, okay?

212
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,800
Haven’t seen him in forever.

213
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,920
Yeah.

214
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:33,440
Win, my man! I missed you! Whoa—careful! You’re gonna fa l!

215
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:41,880
Damn, you trying out for the national team or what? You’re so intense!

216
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,560
Of course I’m serious. Check out my uniform—cool, right?

217
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,920
Awesome!

218
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,680
You look badass, bro.

219
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,280
Isn’t Hia Tai coming?

220
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,480
He’ l show up soon.

221
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,960
He’ l be here any minute, I bet.

222
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:18,400
Man, I hope he comes. Dad already said he’s busy. If Hia doesn’t show, they won’t believe I’m the boss’s son!

223
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,200
What are you even saying?

224
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:26,280
Win, seriously—we’re a l here for you. We didn’t come empty-handed either!

225
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:30,440
Aey brought snacks and everything just for you, I swear.

226
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,880
Brought snacks a l the way here just to cheer you on!

227
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:38,440
Dude’s lying! He just wanted to eat them himself. Don’t believe him.

228
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,640
Man, this is gonna be fun.

229
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,640
We’ l cheer from right here. Go warm up.

230
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,920
Yeah, let’s stay close so he can hear us.

231
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,640
You’re not scared of ge ting smacked by the ba l standing here?

232
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:14,280
Bro, if it’s gonna hit, it’s gonna hit—no ma ter where you stand.

233
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,720
He’s rea ly serious, huh?

234
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,120
He’s got the vibe down.

235
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,640
How long has it been since he started?

236
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,400
Hey Hia Tai!

237
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,440
Hey there.

238
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,440
It’s almost time, Hia.

239
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,040
Go get ’em, Win!

240
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,200
Come on, help cheer my friend!

241
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,920
Sure!

242
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,800
Wooo! Let’s go!

243
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,640
Pete, you’re being super loud.

244
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,200
It’s a sports day! Go ta be loud, right Namrin?

245
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:18,920
Exactly!

246
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,000
Hey, hey!

247
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,960
I’m thirsty .

248
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,360
You’re thirsty now? It’s just ge ting exciting!

249
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,360
Go Win! One more shot!

250
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,520
But I’m rea ly thirsty!

251
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,360
Not now—Win’s sti l fighting out there! Cheer him on!

252
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,520
Pre ty girl, you can have this water.

253
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:38,240
Aww, thank you! So sweet of you—unlike someone over
here who tota ly ignores me.

254
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,920
Jun, hey!

255
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,960
Jun!

256
00:28:59,080 --> 00:28:59,960
Jun!

257
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,600
It rea ly hurts .

258
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,480
Let me see.

259
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,400
My nose—do you think it’s broken?

260
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,000
Calm down, man.

261
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,840
Damn Jun, you’re bleeding a l over!

262
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,520
Win, Hia needs some ice!

263
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,000
Got it, Hia!

264
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,600
You alright, Jun? I’ l take you to the nurse.

265
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,520
I’ l take him.

266
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,920
Take good care of him, alright?

267
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,520
You’re not seriously hurt, right? Where does it hurt?

268
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:15,080
I’m sti l handsome, Hia. Nose ain’t broken—just a li tle bruise.

269
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,160
That’s good.

270
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,840
If you wanna see a doctor, just te l me. I’ l take care of it, okay?

271
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,640
Nah, I got that covered.

272
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:32,080
No way, dude. This happened during a company event—just claim it with your company insurance.

273
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,280
Alright.

274
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,080
Oh, and Jun, did you hear? Win’s team won!

275
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,440
He already bragged about it to me, Hia.

276
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,040
Great, then I’ l find a day to treat you a l to a meal.

277
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,640
Can I come too, Hia?

278
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,520
Of course.

279
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,320
Thanks a lot!

280
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:56,720
I’m heading back to the office. Go ta drop off Pae and Aey.
Take care, alright?

281
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,760
See ya, man.

282
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,080
Get in the car.

283
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,320
What’s wrong?

284
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:24,400
Ugh, I’m starving. Can we stop somewhere to eat first?

285
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,400
What do you wanna eat?

286
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:32,800
Hey Sorn, Jom’s place has a promo right now. Wanna go?

287
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,960
Can’t we go somewhere else?

288
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:40,760
What? His restaurant’s right on the way.

289
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,400
We’re almost there, come on, please.

290
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,280
Didn’t you eat there yesterday? What now?

291
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:57,280
But the food’s fresh! Super tasty, high quality, and it’s not even expensive!

292
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,480
What, did he pay you to promote his place?

293
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:07,800
Fine then, drop me off. Go wherever you want. I’ l get back on my own.

294
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,720
You mean ge ting a ride back with Jom in his delivery truck?

295
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,040
I’m hungry .

296
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:30,200
I’ l have this one, and this . oh and this too.

297
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,480
Come on, Sorn! Hurry up and pick. I’m starving!

298
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:44,840
I just got the menu! If you’re that hungry, eat my foot as an appetizer.

299
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,720
You’re such an ass.

300
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:55,280
I’ l get this, that, and . yeah that one too.

301
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,000
You ordered a l that—can you even finish it?

302
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,800
You act like you don’t eat a ton.

303
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,360
You’re not the type to eat two bites and be full.

304
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,440
Just order it. You’ l devour it a l anyway, like you always do.

305
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,160
Would you like anything else?

306
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,480
Nah, that’s it.

307
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,640
Alright.

308
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,600
Hurry up, man. I’m starving!

309
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,280
Sure, your food will be out shortly.

310
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,080
Cool.

311
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:27,040
I’ l split the bi l with you this time, Sorn.

312
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:36,760
You think I can’t cover this tiny bi l for you?

313
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,840
Just eat. Stop fussing.

314
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,160
Can’t even split the bill…

315
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,840
Here it comes!

316
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,480
Uh—can Ju-jai sit with you?

317
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,880
Sure, I’ l bring it over.

318
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,400
Thanks.

319
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,120
Who’s that?

320
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:06,240
First Jom, now Ju-jai? How many more you got?

321
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,480
Is this a restaurant or a bar, seriously?

322
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:15,000
Well, I had a date with him here that day.

323
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,040
What’s he like?

324
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:26,520
Quiet, smiles a lot—super cute.

325
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,880
And looks?

326
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,639
Kinda big. A little chubby.

327
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,840
So you’re into bear types now?

328
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,280
Yup. Got a problem with that?

329
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,280
Here he comes.

330
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,239
This is your Ju-jai?

331
00:34:54,239 --> 00:35:00,400
Yep. Big and adorable.

332
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:09,600
He kept me company when I got stood up… by a certain someone.

333
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,800
Alright, let’s eat, let’s eat.

334
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,600
Thanks.

335
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,120
No problem.

336
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,600
Hey Dad.

337
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,320
What’s up, Jun?

338
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:48,400
I won’t be home tonight.

339
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:55,320
How are things? You’ve been staying with Sorn a while. I hope you’re not being a burden.

340
00:36:55,320 --> 00:37:02,920
Don’t worry, Dad. Sorn’s cool with it. I help with utilities too, so it’s a l good.

341
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:10,160
We l, if Tai says you’ve been acting up, I’ l drag you back home!

342
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,200
Come on, Dad. Not this again .

343
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:20,400
Alright, alright—I’ve got to open shop. Bring Sorn over sometime, okay?

344
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,920
Sure, I’ l te l him.

345
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,560
Okay, bye Dad.

346
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,480
Sorn!

347
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,280
What?

348
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,400
Where’d you go?

349
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,520
What’s in the box?

350
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,240
My mom sent it from home.

351
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,560
Ooh, let me see!

352
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,760
Carefull.

353
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,880
Al the way from the south.

354
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,160
Can I open it?

355
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,040
Go ahead.

356
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,560
Let me grab something to open it with.

357
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:22,720
Whoa, I can sme l it already. What is it?

358
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,080
Gaeng Tai Pla?

359
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:32,400
Smells amazing. Want me to help cook?

360
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,840
Nah, just go watch TV. You’ l burn everything.

361
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,800
Hey, I’m quick in the kitchen, okay?

362
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,360
Alright, I’ll go.

363
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,680
Jun, crack three eggs for me.

364
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,760
Can’t cook without Jun, huh?

365
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,480
My specialty, Sorn!

366
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,920
You know how to crack eggs?

367
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,240
Dude, I’m a pro.

368
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:17,000
My dad taught me since I was a kid. Boiled, fried—you name it.

369
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,120
Let’s see what you’ve got.

370
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,600
Where’s the oyster sauce?

371
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,680
Right there.

372
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,960
This one?

373
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,280
Jun.

374
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,200
Hmm?

375
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,200
Come closer.

376
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,240
Here’s a reward for my little chef.

377
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,920
Huh? Let’s go.

378
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,800
Let’s eat here instead, so we can watch a movie.

379
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:20,320
Wow, so the dining table’s just for decoration now?

380
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:26,120
Exactly! Come on, hurry up!

381
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:31,400
Whoa, that’s a lot. Let’s dig in!

382
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:36,160
Hey, my dad ca led earlier. He said I should invite you to
dinner at our place.

383
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,120
He wants to treat you for le ting me stay with you.

384
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,560
No need. It’s rea ly nothing.

385
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,800
Your dad be ter feed me more than this then.

386
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,280
Whoa! It’s spicy, man!

387
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,760
Told you it was spicy.

388
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,680
It’s too hot. I can’t eat this!

389
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,200
Nope, can’t do it.

390
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,880
Let me check.

391
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:21,320
Next time I’ l make a separate one. Less spicy for you.

392
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,040
So you can actua ly eat it.

393
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,600
Are you close with Jom?

394
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,040
Not rea ly. He’s just easy to talk to.

395
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,800
What about me? Are we close yet?

396
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,000
Wanna come to my place?

397
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,920
Hallo, Phi Thanu.

398
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,720
Didn’t think you’d be into younger guys.

399
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,160
What the he l are you talking about?

400
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,400
What’re you looking at my brother like that for?

401
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,320
He’s cool.

402
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,120
I like that.

403
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,920
You ever done it?

404
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,560
Nope.

405
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,560
You drunk?
