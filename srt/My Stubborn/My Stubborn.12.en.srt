1
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:37,960
What is it?

2
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,200
P’Korn and P’Praew said you guys are really close to P’Champ…

3
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,720
I wanna ask him out.

4
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,560
So I was hoping you two could give me some advice.

5
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,199
P’Gorn.

6
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,240
I’ve got a question about Champ.

7
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,920
Yeah? What is it?

8
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,960
I wanna know…

9
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,800
is Champ single?

10
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,240
Hmm?

11
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,240
Tos, why do you ask?

12
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,400
Well…

13
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,760
Champ’s just cute, that’s all.

14
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,960
what do we say?

15
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,520
Single or not?

16
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,240
But if you really wanna know…

17
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,720
Ask P’Sorn and P’Tai…

18
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,560
They’re close with him. Sorry if we don’t know!

19
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,560
- Yes
- Just try it! Ask P’Sor and P’Tai…

20
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,160
No need. This is enough.

21
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,320
Good luck…

22
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,920
I’m rooting for you!

23
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,440
I heard…

24
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,280
you just started at the office…

25
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,320
and you’re already hitting on coworkers?

26
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,280
No work?

27
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,079
I do work.

28
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,600
But Champ matters to me.

29
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,400
I wanna know

30
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,440
what type he likes…

31
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,760
so I can try love at work...

32
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,160
You should get back to work.

33
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,160
It’s business hours—

34
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,640
not personal time.

35
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,400
We’ll chat later.

36
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,120
Alright.

37
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,440
But if you guys can’t help…

38
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,040
no worries.

39
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,480
I’ve never failed at flirting…

40
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,960
Just don’t block me,

41
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,320
that’s all.

42
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:13,000
Dude’s being hella annoying—pursuing Champ again!

43
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,360
What are you gonna do?

44
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,040
Hello all—big group today. What can I get you?

45
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:34,560
What’s everyone having?  I’ll treat.

46
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:37,600
Jun and I will have green tea.

47
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,960
Then… I’ll take one Americano.

48
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,680
Got it two green teas, one Americano, and one mocha.

49
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,240
Sure. But hey! Isn’t Champ skipping his usual… mallow mocha?

50
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,320
Um… what’s a mallow mocha?

51
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,680
It’s hot coffee with marshmallow. He usually drinks it daily.

52
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,480
Bro.

53
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,680
don’t you usually just drink iced coffee?

54
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,560
Then can I switch to a mallow mocha?

55
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,640
Nope!

56
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,360
Why not?

57
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,600
I just wanna drink what Champ drinks.

58
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,320
Champ only drinks iced mocha.

59
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,800
Then whose mallow mocha is this?

60
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,320
It’s for my friend.

61
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,360
One mallow mocha and one espresso, please.

62
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:29,760
Got it

63
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,120
Make it quick!

64
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,120
Champ!

65
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:34,720
Huh.

66
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,000
I saw Jun just calling you and that Tos dude.

67
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,800
Right now?

68
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,640
Yeah.

69
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,240
Me too?

70
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,440
Yeah.

71
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,880
Go ahead.

72
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,960
Let’s go, bro.

73
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,400
Tos, don’t meddle with Champ!

74
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,960
You just joined, right?

75
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,840
I saw your late reports.

76
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,720
I think you need to change how you work.

77
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,760
Bro.

78
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,640
I’m grown and I’ve got this job.

79
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,520
I don’t need anyone telling me what’s right or wrong.

80
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:22,400
And my uncle said I’m definitely staying.

81
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,200
Don’t worry about my work.

82
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,960
Tos, he is not being nice.

83
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,680
He shouldn’t act like this.

84
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,760
What we heard earlier…

85
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,080
don’t mention it to anyone.

86
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,000
Grab your coffee and go eat before break ends.

87
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,280
before break ends.

88
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,360
What now…

89
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,120
Nothing.

90
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,640
We’ve gotta follow what the boss says.

91
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,440
You’re calmer than I thought.

92
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,680
So why the hell did you call me here?

93
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,480
That bastard! Isn’t he hitting on you?

94
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,600
And you’re just letting him? I don’t get it!

95
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,760
If we weren’t at the office,

96
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,120
I’d’ve knocked him out!

97
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,280
But I don’t like him, man.

98
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,200
But if you start liking him!

99
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,880
I’ll deal with you…and him!

100
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,920
Deal with what?

101
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,440
What are we?

102
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,920
You want me to spell it out?

103
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,760
What we are?

104
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,159
You’re my wife!!

105
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,280
Tai...

106
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,320
You belong to me.

107
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,120
I’m so jealous, it’s driving me crazy!

108
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,160
And that bastard thinks who he is—

109
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,800
flirting with you in front of your husband?

110
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,880
I’m not your wife!

111
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,920
We’re not even dating.

112
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,040
You got amnesia?

113
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,520
Need me to refresh your memory?

114
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,240
Because you never said anything.

115
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,679
You never defined us.

116
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,919
And how you treat me…

117
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,440
it’s no different from anyone else.

118
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,000
Not special,right?

119
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,400
It’s not true!

120
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,000
do I not feel that way?

121
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,040
I love you, Champ.

122
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,320
I’ve loved you all this time.

123
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,560
Until now…

124
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,920
I didn’t even realize...

125
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,840
how important you are.

126
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,320
But our relationship…

127
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,200
it’s definitely more than friends.

128
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,240
Why are you this adorable?

129
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,920
I could die of jealousy!

130
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,600
You asshole…

131
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,600
I love you, Champ.

132
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,560
You love me too, right?

133
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,760
Mmm.

134
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,280
Then…

135
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,040
Love with me.

136
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,120
But here…

137
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,120
No worries…

138
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,000
doing it here…

139
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,520
feels thrilling!

140
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,920
Yeah…

141
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,440
P’Champ.

142
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,400
our senior at the company.

143
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,800
He's super handsome.

144
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,080
If I could win him over, that’d be slick!

145
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,680
Guys-liking-guys is trending now, right?

146
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,160
Might be good to hop on the trend.

147
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,600
Yeah.

148
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,280
Champ’s easy to talk.

149
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,360
and kind.

150
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,080
Totally.

151
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,840
My profile’s no joke—

152
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,360
who wouldn’t like it?

153
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,680
Oh… P’Tai,

154
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,200
Where are you going?

155
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,000
You worthless moron—

156
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,680
from work to your brain.

157
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,880
All you think about is low‑blow stuff!

158
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,720
You having fun with this crap?

159
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,040
Do you think you’re cool

160
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,840
doing this shit?

161
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,480
And you!

162
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,080
Who the hell are you to judge me!

163
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,160
Who are you to speak up…

164
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,160
You’re just Champ’s friend.

165
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,520
If Champ wants me,

166
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,240
You don’t get to interfere!!

167
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,600
Why shouldn’t I have a say?

168
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,720
Hey!

169
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,160
Don’t you!

170
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,200
P’Champ.

171
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,760
Help me.

172
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,480
Tai is going to hurt me.

173
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,680
Just let him go.

174
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,800
Tai!

175
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,160
Get out.

176
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,840
I’ll handle this.

177
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,360
But damn!!!

178
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,280
Yeah…

179
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,080
I’ll take it from here.

180
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,720
Got something to say? Spit it out.

181
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,320
P’Champ.

182
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,240
I wanna know—

183
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,840
are you seeing someone?

184
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,520
I…

185
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,040
I like you.

186
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,200
Huh.

187
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,640
if you feel uncomfortable,

188
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,680
it’s okay.

189
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,560
Or if it’s because of P’Tai,

190
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,360
I can get my uncle to

191
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,200
kick him out.

192
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,480
I appreciate your kindness,

193
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,800
but keep it.

194
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,640
Use this time to better yourself,

195
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,280
so when your uncle’s gone.

196
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,320
you can survive on your own.

197
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,120
And one more thing

198
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,200
I already have a partner—

199
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,600
and they don’t like it

200
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,360
when someone flirts with me.

201
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,440
Who’s your partner?

202
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,000
The boss’s son.

203
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,080
The boss’s son?

204
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,720
Damn!

205
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,920
Hey you!

206
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,000
You think he’s dumb or insane?

207
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,800
Can’t he tell…

208
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,520
Tai is the chairman’s son?

209
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,520
Yeah, same.

210
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,520
I don’t really know,

211
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,920
but he’s overly confident for sure.

212
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,800
That, I agree with!

213
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,600
Right? You agree?

214
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,040
I don’t know how powerful his backup is,

215
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,000
but Tai’s got that aura, man.

216
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,360
When we see him—damn—we almost wanna somersault and bow at his feet.

217
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,960
Show us then. How would you do it?

218
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,680
Like this! Just like that.

219
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,160
Gosh… P’Tai’s not just hot, he’s cool too!

220
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,360
So high-class no one can afford him.

221
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,880
Whoever dates him is super lucky.

222
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,720
True that.

223
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,880
Hey P’Put,

224
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,840
So what’s Champ gonna do now?

225
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,400
Tos openly declared he’s chasing him.

226
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,440
I mean, Champ probably has a lover already.

227
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,320
Handsome, kind,

228
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,960
super sweet—

229
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,440
he doesn’t seem single.

230
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,640
What do you think?

231
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,280
I’m sure he’s taken.

232
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,640
Someone at his level being single? No way.

233
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,200
And… what about you and P’Vee?

234
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,000
Have you two patched things up yet?

235
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:10,880
Right!

236
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,880
You gossip about others, but what about you?

237
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,040
Spill it.

238
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,839
I think…

239
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,440
letting her go is the best.

240
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,680
Even if we got back together,

241
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,359
I couldn’t be her peace.

242
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,720
Better she meets someone better than me.

243
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:38,960
Back to work.

244
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,160
Let’s go.

245
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,320
Don’t be sad.

246
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,640
It’s gonna be okay.

247
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,280
Jun,

248
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,800
I’m heading out to meet a client.

249
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,480
Want anything?

250
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,120
Umm…

251
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,120
Can you get me Tokyo pancakes?

252
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,840
Yes, sir.

253
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,080
Hey Jun,

254
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,080
you did my laundry the other day, right?

255
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,560
Yeah.

256
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,520
Didn’t you see the stain?

257
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,360
I’m going to see clients—

258
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,120
it’s so unprofessional.

259
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,520
For real?

260
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,360
Where’s the stain?

261
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,680
Right here.

262
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,440
What the hell are you playing at?

263
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,160
Something stuck on your forehead?

264
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,640
P’Sorn, you jerk!

265
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,000
I’m off!

266
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,880
coffee to cure the hangover.

267
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,600
Honestly, you should’ve stayed 3 more days

268
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,400
till my day off.

269
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,600
I’d take you around.

270
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,840
I know

271
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,880
you wanted someone to take your IG pics.

272
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,200
Don’t act slick.

273
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,160
Just post the old ones first!

274
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,160
Why?

275
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,040
You jealous?

276
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,400
I’m just protective of what’s mine.

277
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,920
P’Thanu!

278
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,760
That bad, huh?

279
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,480
How could you eat that much?

280
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,720
Hey! P’Sorn

281
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,280
Did you hear?

282
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,120
Tos resigned.

283
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,520
Said another place offered him more pay.

284
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,400
The other place offered a higher salary.

285
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,720
Hmm…

286
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,720
One more thing…

287
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,000
Can I go chill with Win?

288
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,120
He called—said he’s lonely.

289
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,360
Please…

290
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,240
please, P’Sorn?

291
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,160
Where?

292
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,600
Just a local hangout nearby,

293
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,520
not far.

294
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,480
Please?

295
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,040
No.

296
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,520
I won’t get drunk.

297
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,080
I don’t believe you.

298
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,480
I swear.

299
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,200
I won’t drink too much.

300
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,280
I’ll come back safe.

301
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,640
no drama.

302
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,360
Please… P’Sorn…

303
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,000
Please

304
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,880
If you’re going.

305
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,160
then I’m going too.

306
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,080
But if I can’t go with you,

307
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,400
then you’re not going either.

308
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,280
Ah… Jun!

309
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,360
This table’s for our friends.

310
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,280
Oh! P’Jun!

311
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,040
Yo! What’s up, my man?

312
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,120
Hey P’Fran, Hello

313
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,800
Hello,Jun the hottie.

314
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,600
Whoa, you’re exaggerating, bro.

315
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,440
Haven’t seen you here in forever. Thought you forgot my place already.

316
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,760
Nah, never forget this place!

317
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,680
Good thing Piangrak called to reserve a table.

318
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,960
I picked the best spot and threw in a free bottle for you.

319
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,600
You gave us a whole bottle?

320
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,120
Yep.

321
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,400
Thanks a lot.

322
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,200
You're a really big-hearted shop owner.

323
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,280
With generosity like that

324
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,560
aren’t you scared of going out of business?

325
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,520
Not at all.

326
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,440
My business partner

327
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,400
totally gets it.

328
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,080
Jun!

329
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,840
Yeah?

330
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,160
Didn’t you say you wouldn’t bring P’Sorn here?

331
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,320
Honestly, I wasn’t gonna tell him.

332
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,200
But if I didn’t,

333
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,720
he wouldn’t let me come at all.

334
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,360
Hey, cheers!

335
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,160
Come on!

336
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,360
Cheers, P’Fran!

337
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,240
Let’s clink glasses!

338
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,600
Cheers!

339
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,400
Mmm…

340
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,400
Hey

341
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,480
You

342
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,680
Wanna head near the stage?

343
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,800
Let’s go, let’s go!

344
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,360
Let’s move

345
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,240
Hey, did you come with friends?

346
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,960
You look familiar—

347
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,480
are we following each other on IG?

348
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,440
Mind typing it for me?

349
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,520
What are you doing?

350
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,920
Uh… dancing, duh?

351
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,760
Your charm’s on full blast tonight.

352
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,480
What?

353
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,920
What?

354
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,440
So what’s the deal?

355
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,920
Are you dating P’Sorn?

356
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,640
Wait—

357
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,840
what?

358
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,440
You two are a thing now?

359
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,760
So he’s not your “Bro” anymore, huh?

360
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,760
You messing with me?

361
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:58,920
Hold up—

362
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,960
P’Fran, you know P’Sorn?

363
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,120
Yeah…

364
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,040
Sorn’s actually my business partner.

365
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,840
What?!

366
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,040
P’Sorn’s a partner here?

367
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,720
He never told me!

368
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,320
Don’t change the subject.

369
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,160
That girl just now—

370
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,160
did you give her your number?

371
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,520
No, I didn’t!

372
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,600
Didn’t you see? I was literally trying to get away.

373
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,840
Good.

374
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,280
Now you going home or what?

375
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,240
It’s almost 1AM.

376
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,920
Come on, bro…

377
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,760
We’ve still got a full table.

378
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,040
You’re the co-owner anyway—

379
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,560
can’t you treat us?

380
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,040
Give you an inch, you take a mile, huh?

381
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,120
Bro!

382
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,200
Come on,

383
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,640
pour us another round, please?

384
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,200
Please, bro…

385
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,280
Hurry up!

386
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,800
Fine!!

387
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,520
Want a drink~?

388
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,240
Today’s your last day of internship.

389
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,480
I wanted to bring you here.

390
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,760
Why’d you bring me?

391
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,040
Do you know?

392
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,720
The office fire escape...

393
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,480
What is it for?

394
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,600
I don’t know.

395
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,280
They’re for this!

396
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,080
You okay?

397
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,680
You sure I can do this?

398
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,720
Yeah.

399
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,360
Jun wants “Hia” to do it.

400
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,040
What did you just call me?

401
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,560
Hia Sorn...

402
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,280
Go easy on me.

403
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,800
Was I being too rough on you?

404
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,840
No… don’t say stuff like that.

405
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,400
Why is that?

406
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,120
So what if I say it, huh?

407
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,160
It feels so intense.

408
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,640
Jun...

409
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,040
you’re too damn cute.

410
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,240
Hey

411
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,640
You guys still here?

412
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,200
If me and Champ weren’t here,

413
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,960
would you two even get a moment alone, huh Sorn?

414
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,280
You’re corrupting my boy!

415
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,280
You do that stuff somewhere private!

416
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,560
Were you spying on me?

417
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,840
Damn right we were!

418
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,960
Fine!

419
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,560
I won’t use the fire escape next time.

420
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,680
Okay, that’s good...

421
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,960
It’s hot and exhausting anyway.

422
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,120
If it’s were a rooftop sounds... better.

423
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,080
That’s nice, Sorn. Real nice.

424
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,000
P’ Tai,P’ Sorn, stop fighting already.

425
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,520
Jun

426
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,760
Tai kicked me!

427
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,480
You’re talking nonsense.

428
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,840
I’m honestly creeped out, man.

429
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,920
I’ll take that bastard Jun home later.

430
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,440
You guys coming?

431
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,880
Sure. Win probably wants to go with Jun anyway.

432
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,360
Let’s camp in your grandma’s backyard again—

433
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,920
with the koi pond.

434
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,840
Yeah…

435
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,480
I want your dad and sister to know we’re together,

436
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,960
like my mom does.

437
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,720
And if my dad doesn’t approve?

438
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,480
I’ll fight for it.

439
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,600
Because I...

440
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,960
want his son as my boyfriend.

441
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,960
Here’s some water.

442
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:16,880
Hi, Dad!

443
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,760
Oh, hello!

444
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,520
Hey sis!

445
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,360
Hi, Dad!

446
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,760
Hi,hi

447
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,400
I brought some fruit for you.

448
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,920
You took Jun in and brought gifts?

449
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,960
Wow, this guy’s not bad at all.

450
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,800
Dad, let me help.

451
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,840
Busy day at the restaurant, huh?

452
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,800
I’ll help serve.

453
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,320
Sis, which table?

454
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:57,040
He’s pretty slick. Maybe we should hire him as an employee.

455
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,080
Not an employee—

456
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,280
I’m gonna be your son-in-law.

457
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,160
They’re good. Maybe you could hire them—

458
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,840
Hey, did you see Dad’s face?

459
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,480
Here’s water. And for dad… and sis.

460
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,640
Thank youuuu.

461
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,440
So Tai and the others aren’t here?

462
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,040
Haven’t seen you in ages.

463
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:33,360
Oh, they’re waiting at Tai’s grandma’s.

464
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,200
We’re camping on the lawn tonight.

465
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,800
So, Jun staying at Sorn’s place—any drama?

466
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,880
Sneaking girls in?

467
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:51,000
Or… does Dad need to go propose for a wife?

468
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,320
Eh?

469
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,760
Or... a guy?

470
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,160
Sis, what are you talking about?

471
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,560
Drink your water.

472
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,440
I am.

473
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,880
And how’s your boyfriend search going, sis?

474
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,200
Dad, look at what he said.

475
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,640
He’s teasing you—just kidding

476
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:23,120
Hey Sorn, if....we’re sleeping together, you sleep on the floor.

477
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,400
I never planned to share the bed with you.

478
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,240
Your place isn’t soundproof…

479
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,080
Sex won't be as fun if we do it now.

480
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,240
What are you saying?

481
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,720
Aren’t you worried that people will see?

482
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:40,760
Hey!

483
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,760
So you’re flirting with my brother?

484
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,280
Or are you already together?

485
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,520
Sis…

486
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,280
I ask Sorn.

487
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,120
I like your brother.

488
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,320
We’re dating.

489
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,960
I’m here today...

490
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,680
I’m here to tell you

491
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,200
I will another one person...

492
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,160
who comes to love Jun.

493
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,760
And ask your permission to date openly.

494
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,360
Oh dear, sis!

495
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,160
How long have you been together?

496
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,800
Just recently.

497
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,280
We’ve been together longer than that.

498
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,800
What are you talking about?

499
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,160
better now than later, right?

500
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,200
Since when?

501
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,080
When you stayed at Sorn’s house, or before?

502
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,640
You mean when did I start liking him…

503
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,200
when we were dating or after...?

504
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:01,920
Hey!

505
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:07,200
I felt it when I went to his place.

506
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,240
I liked him first.

507
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,000
He takes good care of me—

508
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,640
just too stubborn to say it.

509
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,920
He didn’t say he like me.

510
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,280
We argued, but he apologized,

511
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,920
so I softened.

512
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,560
Alright, you’re dating then.

513
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,040
Sis, you’re the best!

514
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:39,080
You’re the cutest.

515
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,760
But with Dad…

516
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,920
maybe we should go slow?

517
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,120
Do you think...

518
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,160
If dad finds out, wll be mad?

519
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,440
No idea.

520
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:01,600
But I don’t think he’s that old-fashioned…

521
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,840
Finally you have someone real.

522
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,800
Stop teasing.

523
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,920
When’s it your turn?

524
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,320
I will tell dad.

525
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,520
Don’t squeal yet.

526
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,840
How’s it? Do you like it here?

527
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,360
I love it.

528
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,200
I’ve been coming here since we were kids.

529
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:58,880
Before, my parents didn’t have time,

530
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,800
So I come to playing with you often.

531
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:09,120
made us close, this feels like my second home.

532
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:16,200
From now on, this place will be yours too.

533
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,200
This ring came from Grandma.

534
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,160
She told me to keep it until I meet someone I love.

535
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,680
I think... I love you now.

536
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,480
I don’t know since when.

537
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:18,200
But when I realized it, I already loved you.

538
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:23,720
So this ring it’s yours.

539
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,880
But I didn’t bring a ring to give you in return.

540
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,320
Consider it reserved.

541
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,400
When we get married,

542
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,720
you can bring a ring to exchange.

543
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,200
Mmm.

544
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,720
You like it?

545
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,640
I do.

546
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,280
The ring?

547
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,960
Yeah.

548
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,760
Need any help, Dad?

549
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:51,600
I’ve never seen Jun bring anyone home, except Tai and Win.

550
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,480
I’m glad Sorn got along with him.

551
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,520
I thought wouldn’t get along.

552
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:07,560
Do you remember how mad Jun was before?

553
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:11,920
When he said Sorn invited him over.

554
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:17,160
I was shocked and happy

555
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,200
Jun’s a sweet guy.

556
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:28,040
Everyone likes him.

557
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,560
Please take care of him.

558
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:35,800
He can be a tease, but he’s kind.

559
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:44,320
Besides Tai, you’re someone he cares about.

560
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,720
Thank you for looking after him.

561
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,200
Thank you for trusting me, Dad.

562
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,400
Just… be respectful,that grabbed his butt.

563
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,400
New Caption

564
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,320
I don’t want him getting calluses.

565
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,640
Consider it Dad’s request.

566
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,840
Got it, Dad.

567
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,200
Huh?

568
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,560
How did dad figure it out?

569
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,200
Hia!

570
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,360
Ah, sorry—it just slipped.

571
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,080
But how did Dad know?

572
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,680
He just knew.

573
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,240
How?

574
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,280
I didn’t say, You didn’t say.

575
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,520
I didn’t say, You didn’t say.

576
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,360
Sis, didn’t say.

577
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,120
Dad defintely wouldn’t have noticed.

578
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,880
With so many customers every day, today is the same.

579
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,000
how’d he notice?

580
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,360
Do you think someone who raised you all your life...

581
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,640
Wouldn’t recognize you?

582
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:22,840
Huh?

583
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,520
I visited your place,

584
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,080
and slept with you.

585
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,680
Adults notice these things.

586
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,400
And when you said no one saw,

587
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,720
Dad did. I even grabbed your ass.

588
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,160
F**king P’ Sorn!

589
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,280
What the hell, man?

590
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,160
You’re all over the place!

591
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,120
What are you dramatizing?

592
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,400
Do you think I didn’t notice Dad watching?

593
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:02,520
Fine!

594
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,040
But don’t do anything flashy like that again.

595
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,920
Especially in public.

596
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,920
No this, no that

597
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,760
So many rules.

598
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,600
Maybe I’ll forbid you from leaving the house instead.

599
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,600
Why would you lock me in?

600
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,440
I’ll keep you in bed—

601
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,640
no sun, no moon.

602
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,600
P’ Sorn…

603
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:48,640
You’re...

604
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:51,800
so damn cute.

605
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:52,600
Awww!

606
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,080
Hurry up.

607
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,360
Tai, Champ, and Win have been waiting.

608
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,240
Let’s go.

609
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,280
P’ Champ...

610
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:43,040
That ring on your finger looks familiar.

611
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,240
No wonder—

612
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,400
you’ve seen it before.

613
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:50,920
Where?

614
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:55,560
Grandma’s.

615
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,560
bro?

616
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,400
Have you greeted your brother-in-law yet?

617
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,280
Whoa...

618
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,680
I’m shocked.

619
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,720
We’ve been best friends forever.

620
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,320
But Champ’s a great bro—

621
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,720
so kind and sweet

622
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,200
Wow, thanks, man.

623
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,560
I don’t want to brag,

624
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,680
but if it was P’ Sorn…

625
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,560
I swear, stop imagining.

626
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,240
Everyone’s got someone.

627
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,360
Tai dates Champ,

628
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
and Jun’s with Sorn.

629
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,520
I want a boyfriend too…

630
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,080
For that, you should ask Sorn.

631
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,640
Why me?

632
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,520
Aren’t you an expert?

633
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:00,840
You’re his bro—teach him.

634
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,280
bro...

635
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:10,920
they say you’re good in bed…

636
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,400
is that true?

637
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,400
Win, why are you staring at me?

638
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,040
Jun’s good too—

639
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,760
I taught him self-care when he was young.

640
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:27,920
Sorn!

641
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:28,800
Damn, Sorn!

642
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,760
Fuck!

643
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,360
What the hell are you saying?

644
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,360
Yeah,

645
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,320
I know I was wrong…

646
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:42,320
I was young and didn’t know.

647
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,000
But don’t follow that, Win!

648
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,240
I forbid it.

649
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,120
Hey, bro..

650
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,640
where’d you teach Jun that?

651
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,280
That’s none of your business.

652
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,960
Why not?

653
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,520
What’s with that koi pond?

654
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,240
What? Nothing.

655
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,400
Just eat, guys.
