1
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,759
What are you doing here?

2
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,560
You’re not gonna let me in?

3
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,920
I asked what you're here for. You gonna mess with me again?

4
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:11,840
I pissed you off, and I brought all this stuff. What do you call that, Jun?

5
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:19,680
What’s the point of all this? You’re nice just to slap me in the face again? Doesn’t help at all, man.

6
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,200
I admit I messed up, okay?

7
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:33,920
And I already said sorry. But since you’re still mad, I brought you this stuff as an apology.

8
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,720
Well?

9
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,120
Did you mess with my little bro, you jerk, P’Sorn?

10
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,120
Champ told you?

11
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:47,560
What did Jun ever do to you? Why’d you mess with him like that? Didn’t you promise me you wouldn’t?

12
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:54,320
Yeah, I get it. I was wrong. I already apologized, what more do you want?

13
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,320
I just called him. He’s still mad at you, man.

14
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,800
If you want me to baby you like the rest of them, I can’t do that.

15
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:09,000
If you keep acting like this, I’ll tell Dad to send you to Vietnam so you won’t see him again.

16
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,680
If you’re gonna mentor him, stick to the line. Don’t mess with him until June has to yell at you.

17
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:23,720
Fine, fine. I’ll make it up to your precious little brother until he forgives me. Happy now Tai?

18
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,120
Yeah, I’m good now. Just make sure you do it. That’s all.

19
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:38,480
If this still isn’t enough, I don’t know what else to do.

20
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:48,520
P'Sorn, if you think an apology will magically fix everything, it won't.

21
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:58,400
But I’ll take your apology. Just... don’t mess with me like that again.

22
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,360
Can we eat now? I’m starving.

23
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,360
I’m getting noodles from the place at the corner.

24
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,120
So you’re leaving me to eat all this by myself?

25
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,800
Hey!

26
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,720
I’m heading out, Jun.

27
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,040
Um.

28
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,280
Jun.

29
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,480
Why you so pissed?

30
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,120
You’re not even gonna talk to me?

31
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,640
I’m talking to you now. When did I say I wouldn’t?

32
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,560
Then give me a kiss.

33
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,280
Nope, Just go.

34
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,720
Leave.

35
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,080
You really not gonna talk to me?

36
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,960
Sorn told me yesterday's meeting wasn’t your fault.

37
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,680
He said he did it on purpose to mess with you.

38
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,400
Oh… okay.

39
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,480
I’m sorry for scolding you yesterday.

40
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:16,040
It’s totally fine. I get that meetings are important. And I was kinda at fault too, barging in like that.

41
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,840
So, have you cleared things up with Sorn?

42
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,040
Yeah, all good. He called me in for a chat yesterday.

43
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,200
Alright, good to hear. Go ahead and get back to work.

44
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,520
Thank you.

45
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,640
Didn’t get scolded—YESS!

46
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,280
Guys! Here—grilled sticky rice for everyone!

47
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:21,160
Aww, Jun brought us sticky rice? If P'Sorn sees, he’ll get jealous!

48
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,240
Yeah, he’s gonna sulk for sure.

49
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,400
Relax, guys. I had P'Sorn buy it.

50
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:27,920
Go ahead, eat!

51
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,280
Pick whichever one you want.

52
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,080
This one's gotta be banana. Smells amazing.

53
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,800
I bought it for you, you got the right one.

54
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,880
Then I’ll return it, Jun. Not eating anymore. Get back to work.

55
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,360
P'Put, what would you like?

56
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,040
Hey, can I get an iced Americano, no sweetener?

57
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,120
And I’ll have a latte.

58
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,960
That’s one Americano and one latte, right?

59
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,760
Yep.

60
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,680
That’ll be... 12,000 baht.

61
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,720
Whoa, kid! Are you this friendly with everyone or just us?

62
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,480
Friendship?

63
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,320
More like a scammer. You tryna sell me a house next?

64
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,520
Oops! My bad—120 baht.

65
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:23,560
120? Hang on—here’s 200.

66
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,760
Here’s your change.

67
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,800
Wow, that was fast!

68
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,960
You’re quick at math. Super fast.

69
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,640
Hey, let me pay for you.

70
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,159
Nah, it’s fine. I can buy coffee for my little bro.

71
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,520
You’re the real sugar daddy.

72
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,600
So touched. Just take it, bro.

73
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,240
Come on, no biggie.

74
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,120
Nope. Just take it already.

75
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,480
You dissing me, kid? It’s just one cup. Forget it.

76
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:54,080
Oh hey, Vee. When did you get here? How come we didn’t see you?

77
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,960
How would Put notice? You two were too busy chatting.

78
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,440
What did I even do?

79
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,400
We just got carried away.

80
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:12,280
Oh, this is Jun—our beloved intern.

81
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,960
And this is Vee, my girlfriend.

82
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:22,040
Nice to meet you, P'Vee.

83
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:32,800
Wow, who’d think someone like you could land a girl this pretty?

84
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:40,240
Yeah, she’s pretty. Wait a sec—what do you mean “someone like me”? Huh?

85
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,520
I mean you look... good! Totally good-looking... not ugly at all.

86
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,720
Hmph!

87
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,360
Oh, that’s P’Yoni.

88
00:09:54,040 --> 00:10:00,480
Vee, chill. There’s nothing going on with her anymore.

89
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,920
Why don’t you try dating her again?

90
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,480
Damn, P’Put!

91
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:21,200
There’s nothing between us now! Ask Jun, he knows everything—he’s always with me.

92
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:28,920
Jun! Jun! Say something, man! Help me out here!

93
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,880
Nothing’s going on, P’Vee. I always see P’Put working, that’s all.

94
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,920
You better be telling the truth, Put. Jun, I’m counting on you.

95
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,440
You almost got me in serious trouble.

96
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,160
Yeah, but I covered for you, didn’t I?

97
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,760
Thanks a ton. Hey kid, is the coffee ready yet?

98
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,680
It’s coffee.

99
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:11,080
damn it! What are you doing—you're not a kid, stop fiddling with that.

100
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:18,640
I haven’t tied this thing in forever. So... how’ve you been? Long time no see.

101
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,000
I’ve been alright.

102
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,840
You sure?

103
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,600
Yeah, I’m fine.

104
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,760
Really sure?

105
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,000
What?

106
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,560
Let’s just go get that coffee already.

107
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,480
Hey there.

108
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,640
Oh hey!

109
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,520
Jun, coffee’s all gone!

110
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,960
Didn’t help much. I’m still scared I’ll pass out at work.

111
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,640
Forget him—hey beautiful, could you make me a cup?

112
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,120
Make it yourself.

113
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,480
Sigh... people and their kindness, huh?

114
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,760
Gimme a sip.

115
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,160
Go ahead.

116
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,480
Hot!

117
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,920
Careful, man.

118
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,080
Hey kids.

119
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,720
P’Tai! / Hey.

120
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,760
Want some coffee, P’Tai?

121
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,560
Help yourself.

122
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,640
Yes sir.

123
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,440
Pae, Aey—come help me set up the meeting room.

124
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,000
Damn, missed my shot again.

125
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,560
Got it!

126
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,440
I’ll catch up with you guys.

127
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,760
So I’m not invited, huh?

128
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,760
I’m out.

129
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,360
You’re back, Hia?

130
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,360
Yeah.

131
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,160
Hey.

132
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,520
You get any sleep at all?

133
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,960
They’re fixing the road near my dorm. Still came in early though.

134
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,560
What time?

135
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,680
4 a.m.

136
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,480
Four?!

137
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,040
Yeah, it’s killing me, Hia.

138
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,320
When will they be done?

139
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,400
No clue. Probably forever.

140
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,560
Huh? Tai, your tie.

141
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,880
Smile and fix that tie, Hia.

142
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,400
I’m leaving it like this.

143
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,920
Why not look for a dorm closer to the office?

144
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:36,000
I’ve been thinking about it, but rent around here’s crazy expensive.

145
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,600
Yeah, makes sense.

146
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,000
What’re you guys talking about? You look so serious.

147
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,160
Jun’s dorm area—they’re fixing the road, and it’s gonna take forever.

148
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,480
So what now?

149
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,640
Just stay at my place, dude.

150
00:14:54,760 --> 00:15:02,720
It’s empty anyway. Office is only 15 minutes away.

151
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,240
And don’t feel bad, you’ve crashed there before.

152
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:16,000
Sounds good to me. At least someone will be looking after Jun. Je Poey and Ko Nueng won’t have to worry.

153
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,800
Yeah, I agree too.

154
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:26,160
Hey Jun, come check those documents upstairs with me.

155
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,520
Wait—Jun stayed at P’Sorn’s place before? How come I didn’t know?

156
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,320
Yeah, what the hell?

157
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,360
You sneaky little—

158
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,120
Thanks.

159
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,200
Jun.

160
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,640
Thanks.

161
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:34,000
Oh, I still owe Win a meal. Is he home? Let’s invite him over to Sorn’s place.

162
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,520
I’ll call him.

163
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:44,040
Great! Wanna go buy stuff to eat? It’s been ages since we had a party.

164
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,560
Yeah.

165
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:51,200
You guys go ahead. I’ll stay and help Jun tidy up first.

166
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,240
Shall we go?

167
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,400
Jun.

168
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,880
P’Sorn.

169
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,720
I’m in the middle of sorting stuff.

170
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,160
You can do that later.

171
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,920
But...

172
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,960
I want to...

173
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,400
Hold up.

174
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:06,080
Hurry up, okay? I don’t want Hia to see us.

175
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,240
P’Sorn, answer your phone.

176
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,560
No, not now. I’ll lose the mood.

177
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,560
What if it’s something important?

178
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,040
Yes, Hia?

179
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:13,440
Champ’s out shopping—do you guys have any sukiyaki sauce at home?

180
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,160
P’Sorn, do you have any sukiyaki sauce?

181
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,080
Nope.

182
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,480
No, we don’t, Hia.

183
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:25,840
What about garlic and fresh chili? I wanna make seafood dip.

184
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,880
Got garlic and chili?

185
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,080
Nope.

186
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,440
No, Hia.

187
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,920
And a mortar and pestle to grind it?

188
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:34,960
Hia...

189
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,040
No, man! Just buy whatever the hell you need!

190
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,680
Then why the hell are you yelling at me?

191
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,560
P’Sorn, Open the door.

192
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,320
P’Sorn!, Open the door!

193
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,920
P’Sorn!!, Open the door!!

194
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,040
P’Sorn!!!, Open the door!!!

195
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,640
Stop—Win’s coming!

196
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,120
Hold on, Jun’s almost done.

197
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,280
P’Sorn!

198
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,240
P’Sorn, stop!

199
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,160
I’m hot, open the door!

200
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,680
P’Sorn!!!

201
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,760
Didn’t you hear? Win’s here!

202
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:31,960
Damn!

203
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,480
Hey P’Sorn

204
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,560
oh hey Hia!

205
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,720
What took you so long?

206
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,000
Where’s Jun?

207
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,440
There he is.

208
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,720
Man, I waited forever! It’s freaking hot out.

209
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,120
Yeah, I was in the bathroom.

210
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,680
P’Sorn opened up already. Come on in.

211
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,200
So, how’s it feel living at P’Sorn’s?

212
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,680
Not bad.

213
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,960
Close the door, will you?

214
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,440
Whoa, look at the size of this shrimp!

215
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,240
Yeah, Hia stocked up. Looks delicious.

216
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,720
Seeing all this reminds me of the beach trip. I wanna go again.

217
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,000
Win, let’s go again next month.

218
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,880
Let’s pick a date. I’ll invite Pe and Aei too.

219
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,080
Nice. Deal!

220
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,080
Let’s make it happen.

221
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,840
You guys only ever think about going on trips.

222
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,040
Ever think about work?

223
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,840
Sorn.

224
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,040
he’s just an intern.

225
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,120
Not a full-time staff like us.

226
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,360
Cut him some slack.

227
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,280
Yeah, alright.

228
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,640
Invite Piang too. The more the merrier.

229
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,640
I don’t think Piang’s free though.

230
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,440
She’s been swamped with work.

231
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,520
You okay?

232
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,600
Ouch.

233
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,920
You alright? That looked bad.

234
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,120
I’m fine. Just a scratch.

235
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,640
You’re bleeding though.

236
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,280
Hang on, I’ll get you a band-aid.

237
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,040
Hey—wait, I can do it myself.

238
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,800
Be careful.

239
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,560
Thanks.

240
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,160
P’Champ.

241
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,400
Where’s my seaweed salad?

242
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,240
Did you forget it?

243
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,640
I bought it—it’s somewhere around here.

244
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,520
Where?

245
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,680
If it were a snake, you’d be dead. Right here.

246
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,480
Ow!

247
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,280
Let me see.

248
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,000
Wait a sec, it hurts.

249
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,080
Your eyeball’s not gonna fall out, calm down.

250
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,920
Sorn, what the hell did you do to him now?

251
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,280
Can’t you see your beloved little bro’s hurt?

252
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,080
All you think is I’m messing with him again.

253
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,080
Come on, I’ll rinse your eye.

254
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,440
If you wanna tell Tai I messed with you, fine.

255
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,520
But the part where we slept together—keep that between us.

256
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,560
What the hell are you saying?

257
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,000
Huh?

258
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,520
Hi! I’m Candy.

259
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:52,360
I live next door. I saw you just moved in, so I brought you some sweets.

260
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,880
Thanks a lot.

261
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,880
Have you been here long?

262
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,560
Just moved in.

263
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,360
Hmm, and the guy who lives here?

264
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,960
Oh, P’Sorn? Let me get him for you.

265
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,000
Here he is—P’Sorn, the owner.

266
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,680
Hello.

267
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,640
He’s busy with work.

268
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,480
Then I’ll just leave the sweets here. If you like them, I’ll bring more.

269
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,120
Thanks.

270
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,320
Who do you live with?

271
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,600
With my mom.

272
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,760
Oh yeah?

273
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,680
Thanks!

274
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,560
Bye!

275
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,360
Bye-bye!

276
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,720
Oh, P’Penny. Hi there.

277
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,960
Hi sweetie.

278
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,520
Sorn.

279
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,160
come see me in my office later.

280
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:30,560
Hey, I bet P’Sorn hasn’t gone to see her lately.

281
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,840
You really think P’Sorn has something going on with Ms. Penny?

282
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:43,040
Come on, we both know he’s into older women.

283
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:49,280
Oops, I meant more mature women. So little cuties like me lose out.

284
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:56,840
He’s picky. Especially with people at work—never seen him hook up with anyone here.

285
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:01,400
Ugh, Praew, don’t argue with me. Just wait and see.

286
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,800
Ahem! Back to work, you two.

287
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:10,760
Don’t spread rumors unless you’re sure. It can ruin reputations.

288
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,880
Yes, P’.

289
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,080
Back to work, missy.

290
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,200
Yeah yeah, I’m on it.

291
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,200
Hey stop.

292
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:48,920
Kidding, chill. No need to look so serious.

293
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,520
Alright, I’ll stop teasing.

294
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,520
Heard you’re playing nanny these days?

295
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Kid had to move dorms, so I let him stay at my place.

296
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:09,880
You don’t like kids. So Jun’s an exception?

297
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,520
Why would Jun be?

298
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,560
Normally.

299
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:25,640
You never let anyone near your personal space.

300
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,360
What are you trying to say?

301
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:37,160
Just thinking… maybe someone’s changed their mind.

302
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,440
Jun’s like Hia Tai’s little brother.

303
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,440
There’s no special reason except he’s Tai’s brother.

304
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,960
Then let’s talk tonight, just us.

305
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,080
Mm-hmm.

306
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,680
Hey.

307
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,480
Where are you?

308
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,840
Where are you?

309
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,360
Why?

310
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,280
I’ve been waiting for you.

311
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,040
Didn’t you say we’d go out for breakfast?

312
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,560
Yeah, wait there—I’ll swing by to pick you up.

313
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,760
Okay.

314
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,120
Jun.

315
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,680
Aren’t you coming with?

316
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,200
Maybe next time.

317
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,720
Where are you going?

318
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,160
Hmph. See?

319
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,240
I knew it. Just like I thought.

320
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,200
Think what?

321
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,680
Oh come on, look at the signs!

322
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:32,080
Hah! Gonna say he’s “running errands”? It’s after work. What errands?

323
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,520
Just wait—Khun Penny’s gonna be all smiles tonight.

324
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,720
Do you always have to suspect him?

325
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:44,120
Not suspecting—my intuition never fails, okay?

326
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,240
I think he really does have something to do.

327
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,000
What would you like to order?

328
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:07,040
I’ll have this one, and that one... that’s all.

329
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,560
Please wait a moment for your food.

330
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,400
Oh—hey!

331
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,680
You are...?

332
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,960
I’m Jun. And you are...?

333
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,120
I’m Jom. Are you dining alone today?

334
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,600
Yeah.

335
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,920
Are you working here, P’Jom?

336
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,680
I thought you were some office guy.

337
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,720
This is actually my aunt’s restaurant.

338
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,160
Anyway, enjoy your meal once it’s ready.

339
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,480
If you need anything, just let me know.

340
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,360
Or you can leave a comment on this card here.

341
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,480
Sure, will do.

342
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,080
Great.

343
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,240
Hey, P’Jom!

344
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:55,760
Yeah?

345
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,640
What’s this?

346
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,880
That’s “Joojai.”

347
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:05,720
For solo diners, we let “Joojai” sit with them so they won’t feel lonely.
Cute, right?

348
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,600
Alright then, I’ll leave you to it.

349
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,360
Thanks!

350
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,360
Oh—can I see the menu again?

351
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,480
Here you go.

352
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,960
I think I’ll order something to take home.

353
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,400
This one, to go please.

354
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,000
No problem. Give me a moment.

355
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Hey, can I get the bill? And I’ve got a coupon.

356
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,680
Sure. Just a sec.

357
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,920
Thanks!

358
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,720
Heading out?

359
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:05,280
Yeah, P’Jom. The food was amazing. No complaints at all.

360
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,280
And I even got a discount—bonus!

361
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,880
If you like it, come back again. I’ll give you more discounts.

362
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,280
You’re too kind.

363
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:19,520
If I come again, I’ll say I’m your friend—get the insider treatment.

364
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,920
With pleasure. How are you getting home today?

365
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:28,920
I’ll probably just grab a bike from here. My neighborhood’s nearby.

366
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,840
Oh right, I’ve got to deliver food near there anyway. I’ll give you a lift.

367
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,320
Sure, thanks!

368
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,880
Your takeout’s ready.

369
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,960
Perfect timing.

370
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,600
Here’s your change.

371
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,360
Thanks a lot.

372
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,719
Thank youuuuu.

373
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,520
No problem.

374
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Shall we go?

375
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,800
Yeah.

376
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,920
Here, let me carry that.

377
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,960
Thanks.

378
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,840
Hey! How’d that work talk go?

379
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,640
Pretty good. Smooth overall.

380
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,880
Nice.

381
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,520
Here.

382
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,560
eat.

383
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,360
You okay?

384
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:17,960
I think...

385
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,200
I don’t feel so great.

386
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,480
Hey.

387
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,960
What’s wrong? Lemme see!

388
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:36,960
I’m not feeling well... but I think you know how to take care of me.

389
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,960
Jun close with the delivery guy now? Seriously?

390
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,000
But Jun close with everyone anyway.

391
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,680
Yeah, but not with me.

392
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,400
Can you blame them?

393
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,600
Let me chip in for this meal.

394
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,680
You really think I can't cover something this cheap for you?

395
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,800
Hey! Watch where you're walking!

396
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,040
Mind if Jujai joins us?

397
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,000
Who?

398
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,840
I went on a date with her the other day.
