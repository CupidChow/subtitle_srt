1
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,039
What are you doing, bro?

2
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,520
Oh, I’m making stir-fried basil and Panang curry. Tai and Sorn want to eat.

3
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,720
Need any help, bro?

4
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,200
No, it’s fine.

5
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,720
Jun, go find Sorn for me. No idea where he fell asleep. We’re almost done here.

6
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,680
Okay, bro.

7
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,080
Bro?

8
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,120
Are you there, bro?

9
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,759
Bro?

10
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,440
What the hell is this?

11
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,680
Damn!

12
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,280
Did you see that?

13
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,880
Shit!

14
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,320
Where are you going?

15
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,400
Aren’t you curious to stay and watch with me?

16
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,600
Nah, you go ahead.

17
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:29,000
It's so hard already, and you’re still holding onto it?

18
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,200
I heard you have a girlfriend. Don’t you want to try it out with her?

19
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,440
Sit down.

20
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,600
Hold on, bro. Don’t tell anyone about this.

21
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,040
Do you really think I’d blab about this?

22
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,400
Hurry up.

23
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,720
Whoa, what’s up, bro?

24
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,440
Hey, hey, hey! What’s going on?

25
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,040
Why? Aren’t you going to take off your pants?

26
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,840
Hurry up.

27
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,640
No one’s around here, right, bro?

28
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,920
Do you see anyone?

29
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,840
Move closer.

30
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,720
Hurry.

31
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,560
Put your hand on it.

32
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,760
I know already. I can do it.

33
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,640
Oh?

34
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,360
Let me do it for you.

35
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,880
Hey! What are you doing, bro?

36
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,360
Why are you yelling?

37
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,600
You want everyone to know what we’re up to?

38
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,960
How can you just grab it like that?

39
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,480
I’m helping.

40
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Cliche.

41
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,800
Can I kiss you?

42
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,520
It helps set the mood.

43
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,280
Two years later...

44
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,840
Jun, are you out yet?

45
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,160
Yeah, I’m here.

46
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,080
I’m almost there. See you at the office.

47
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,480
Okay, see you.

48
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,280
This floor is for imports and exports. We take and deliver goods here.

49
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,120
Got it.

50
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,680
If you have any questions, just ask me.

51
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,120
Got it.

52
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,360
We start at 9:30 AM.

53
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,000
P’Puth!

54
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,880
Hey, Jun, my little bro!

55
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,040
How’s it going? You doing okay?

56
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,800
I’m good, bro.

57
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,440
Internship?

58
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:31,800
Yeah.

59
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,720
Come here. I’ll introduce you to the team.

60
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,520
These are your fellow interns.

61
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,360
Let’s introduce ourselves. One at a time.

62
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,680
I’m Aey.

63
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,560
I’m Phe.

64
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,840
I’m Jun. Nice to meet you.

65
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,440
Huh? What’s your name again?

66
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,880
It’s Jun. J-U-N. Sounds a bit tricky, right?

67
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,400
Jun? That’s a really unusual name.

68
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,440
I’ve never heard it before in my life.

69
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,480
It’s Chinese. It means ‘handsome.’

70
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,840
See? I got a cool name.

71
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,560
Jun!

72
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,760
Wynn!

73
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,440
I missed you!

74
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,240
How are you?

75
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,280
I’m good!

76
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,480
Bro Tai, hi!

77
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,160
Alright, kids. Say hi to Bro Tai.

78
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,600
Hello!

79
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,240
Hey, these are the new interns, right?

80
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:23,960
Yeah.

81
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,400
Ready to work?

82
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,960
Absolutely!

83
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,280
Wow, so the vice president himself is here to welcome us?

84
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,720
Nah, I’m just another salaryman.

85
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,920
Alright, get to work, everyone.

86
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,320
Let’s go.

87
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,920
Wait.

88
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,720
These are your access cards. You need to carry them to work.

89
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,080
Thanks!

90
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,160
Do you all know your working hours?

91
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,800
Yes!

92
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,680
All noted.

93
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,600
Here’s your card.

94
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,000
Thanks, P’Puth!

95
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,320
Aey, this is yours.

96
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,800
Jun, my little bro.

97
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,640
Thanks!

98
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,920
P’Puth so lovely

99
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,160
Oh, P’Penny! Hi!

100
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:30,960
Oh, P’Penny! / Hi!

101
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,520
Hey! Everything good?

102
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,040
These are the new interns for this year.

103
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,320
Hi

104
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,760
Nice to meet you!

105
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,240
If you have any questions, ask him.

106
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,800
I gotta get back to work.

107
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,800
Ask anything, okay?

108
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,160
Really? Anything?

109
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:49,760
Yep.

110
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,600
Wow, you’re sharp.

111
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,840
P’Penny is so pretty. I’m nervous.

112
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,160
She’s the company’s star.

113
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,920
And that’s our company’s tough one, P’June.

114
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:14,200
She’s super strict. Don’t mess up, or you’ll end up in the ‘cold room.’

115
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,640
Alright, let’s get to work. Let me give you a tour.

116
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,320
Come on, guys. Follow me.

117
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,480
I’m at the coffee shop. You want anything?

118
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,840
The usual.

119
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,840
Okay, okay.

120
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,840
Cool. Want a snack?

121
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:54,440
Nah, I got grilled pork sticky rice. Brought some for you too.

122
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,760
Okay. Be right up.

123
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,760
One mocha, please. And one mallow mocha.

124
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,240
Wow, two cups? Are you drinking them both?

125
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,240
Nope. One’s for my friend.

126
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,480
A friend? Sure about that?

127
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,680
Bina, helping out?

128
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,640
Yeah, Uncle Champ.

129
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:36,200
Call me ‘Bro’ outside. ‘Uncle’ makes me sound old.

130
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,960
Got it, Bro.

131
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,040
Your coffee’s ready.

132
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,720
Thanks!

133
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,520
Here, your mallow mocha. Same as always.

134
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,840
Thanks.

135
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,880
Damn, it’s so hot today. Why do you always drink hot coffee?

136
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,720
Because it’s good.

137
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,240
I like it.

138
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,000
Where’s my grilled pork sticky rice?

139
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,640
Here.

140
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,120
Looks good.

141
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,040
Smells amazing.

142
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,520
Wait.

143
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,200
If you want some, ask me nicely.

144
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,880
Oh, come on! I’m starving. Stop messing with me!

145
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,160
Then no food for you.

146
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:52,680
P’Tai, please. Can I have some grilled pork?

147
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,400
Whoa, dude.

148
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,920
Give it back!

149
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,840
Let me feed you.

150
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,280
What’s wrong with you?

151
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,520
I want to eat first.

152
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,040
Go away.

153
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,960
You’re annoying.

154
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,880
What’s your problem?

155
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,840
Can’t you just let me eat in peace? I’m hungry.

156
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,360
You look funny when I tease you.

157
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,280
You’re a pain.

158
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,040
Nah, screw you.

159
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,480
Screw you?

160
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,960
P’Puth!

161
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:07,960
What’s up?

162
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,040
How long have you been working here?

163
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,920
Me? Over two years.

164
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,839
I started right after my internship. Applied and got in.

165
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,000
Yeah, interesting.

166
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,520
Which department are you in?

167
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,520
Import-export.

168
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:23,800
Oh, good choice! James is a pro.

169
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,720
Once you graduate, just butter him up. He’ll take you in.

170
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,440
Guarantee

171
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,200
He hired me.

172
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,120
I don’t know

173
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,360
Trust me.

174
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,120
That’s a relief.

175
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,680
Alright, I gotta work.

176
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,200
Wait. Where’s P’Tai?

177
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,000
He said he was picking up a friend at the airport.

178
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,840
I’m off. Don’t wanna meddle in his business.

179
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,240
Alright, bro.

180
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,000
If you’re free, help me out at work.

181
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,800
Why don’t you help me instead?

182
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,320
Nah, I’m out.

183
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,640
Talking to your sweetheart?

184
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,560
Jun has a sweetheart?

185
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,560
No, just someone I’m talking to. Name is Piangrak.

186
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,800
Don’t wait! Show me how spicy. Let me see.

187
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,240
Wait… do you like guys, bro?

188
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,720
It’s the modern era, dude. Anyone can date anyone.

189
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,440
Sorry.

190
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:51,080
He’s cute, though. At first, I thought Piangrak was a girl’s name.

191
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,600
Yeah, me too at first.

192
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:58,040
Honestly, I used to date girls.

193
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,440
I got it.

194
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,280
Where are you guys going tonight?

195
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,680
I’m going to watch Aey practice ice skating.

196
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,600
You can skate?

197
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:13,080
Let me tell you, she’s on Thailand’s national team.

198
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,040
Doesn’t look like it, but she made it.

199
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,760
Who’s that?

200
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,560
Oh, it’s P’Puth.

201
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,360
Okay.

202
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,920
You shouldn’t be spying like this. It’s rude.

203
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,240
P’Sorn!

204
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,120
Where have you been?

205
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,120
You just disappeared.

206
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,720
Me?

207
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,040
P’Sorn.

208
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,480
But you used to call me ‘bro.’

209
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,720
I only call people ‘bro’ if I’m close to them.

210
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,560
Don’t just smile. Tell me where you’ve been.

211
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,480
I had some family matters to take care of.

212
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,480
I lost my phone, so I couldn’t contact anyone.

213
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,920
Then why didn’t you just say that?

214
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,600
You disappeared just like that.

215
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,200
Why are you so mad?

216
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,400
I’m here now, aren’t I?

217
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:50,960
About that day… the day you and I…

218
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:59,160
Two years ago.

219
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,240
Jun!

220
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,720
Give it back!

221
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
What do you mean?

222
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,680
I said give Jun’s stuff back!

223
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,200
What are you doing, bro?

224
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,800
He was about to steal from you.

225
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,200
If you’re that desperate, go handle it yourself in the bathroom.

226
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,440
Oh. 0000.

227
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,040
Oh. 0000.

228
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,760
Oh. 0000.

229
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,080
Oh. 0000.

230
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,400
Oh. 0000.

231
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,480
Jun!

232
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,720
Why is it taking so long? Are you not done yet?

233
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,880
Bro… I finished three times already, and it’s still not going down.

234
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,720
Huh? Let me see.

235
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,280
No, no, bro!

236
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,120
Don’t be shy, Jun. Open the door.

237
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,280
Hurry up.

238
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,920
Shit. You were definitely drugged, Jun.

239
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,560
Drugged?

240
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,800
Am I going to die?

241
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,480
Put your pants on.

242
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,520
Get in the car.

243
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,280
What is this, bro?

244
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,960
Take off your pants.

245
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,560
Why? What’s happening?

246
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,640
I’ll help you.

247
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,880
But people might see…

248
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,080
See what? My car has 60% tint.

249
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,960
Either let me help you, or suffer until your balls explode.

250
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,960
Bro, this won’t be a problem, right?

251
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,120
You’ll be fine.

252
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,640
I’ll take care of you.

253
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,160
But don’t go doing this with anyone else.

254
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,360
Yeah, who else would do it like you?

255
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,960
Just… wanted to say thanks.

256
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,440
Thanks for what?

257
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,680
For helping me, bro.

258
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,760
No problem.

259
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,320
I’m heading back to work now.

260
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,240
Where have you been losing sleep?

261
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,640
Sorry, I was clearing a deal with Singapore last night.

262
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,280
I think you’re working too hard. Take a break.

263
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,240
Why? Are you worried about me?

264
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,840
I’m just afraid there’ll be no one to help with work.

265
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,280
Alright, thanks.

266
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,760
Go rest now.

267
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,400
I’m getting back to work.

268
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,400
Okay, cool.

269
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,200
What the hell?

270
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:37,320
If you’re not going to help, then just leave.

271
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,520
Who said I wouldn’t help?

272
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,800
Press this button first.

273
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,480
Then pull out that drawer.

274
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,720
It’s stuck right there.

275
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,840
Not that one.

276
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,400
This one.

277
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,600
Do you wear cologne? Smells nice.

278
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,880
Why are you sniffing my neck? Get away.

279
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,840
What’s wrong with you?

280
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:24,640
WhyWhen I try to help, you push me away. When I don’t, you tell me to leave.

281
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,280
It’s too close.

282
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:40,840
Closer than this? We’ve been closer before, haven’t we?

283
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,320
Don’t talk about that in front of people.

284
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,000
Talk about what?

285
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,880
That day!

286
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,560
Don’t pretend like you don’t remember.

287
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,560
Speak properly.

288
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,040
Damn you.

289
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,200
Speak properly, or I’ll bite your lip off.

290
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,520
Fine.

291
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:11,240
Just don’t talk about that again. I’m serious. I don’t want anyone to know.

292
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,040
Alright, stop looking so serious.

293
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,240
Give me your LINE.

294
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,040
Why?

295
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,200
So you won’t get mad when you can’t reach me.

296
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,280
My phone’s dead.

297
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,760
Not giving it to you. Bleh.

298
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,160
Oh, hey, Jun.

299
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,440
Piang, how long have you been here?

300
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,840
Just got here.

301
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:47,840
Hungry?

302
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,880
Yeah.

303
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,160
Let’s go.

304
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,480
Who’s that kid?

305
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:04,080
I think his name is Piangrak. Probably Jun’s boyfriend.

306
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,080
Wait, he’s dating a guy?

307
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,240
Surprised?

308
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,320
When Jun first told me, I was just as shocked as you.

309
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,720
Why’d you bring me here?

310
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,480
Because Piang wanted to eat here. It’s been a while since we last came.

311
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,640
Been waiting since noon, huh?

312
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:32,800
Liar! You were texting me at noon saying you were eating crepes.

313
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:39,160
Crepes are a snack, not a meal.

314
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,600
Whatever.

315
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,320
Order food, please.

316
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,960
Here’s the menu.

317
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,240
Thanks.

318
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,160
What would you like?

319
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,000
Him first. He’s hungry.

320
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,520
I’ll have this one.

321
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,760
Make it two.

322
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,080
Coming right up.

323
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,840
Hey, Jun. I wanted to ask you something.

324
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,120
What’s up?

325
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,360
The guy waiting for you outside the office… who is he?

326
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,680
The one with the tied-up hair. He’s really handsome.

327
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,480
A senior at the office. Why? Do you like him?

328
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,160
Does he have a girlfriend?

329
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:27,840
Wow, Piang. You’re checking out another guy right in front of me?

330
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,760
I was just joking! Don’t get mad.

331
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,320
You sure?

332
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,160
Yes!

333
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,760
Alright, don’t joke like that again. Got it?

334
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,280
Got it. I promise.

335
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:13,440
You guys didn’t even tell me you were coming.

336
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,920
Sorn, calm down.

337
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:56,400
Wow, Jun. You’re so diligent, showing up early.

338
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,040
I brought soy milk and deep-fried dough sticks.

339
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,400
Thanks, bro.

340
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,840
No problem.

341
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,760
Hey, what’s on your face?

342
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,480
Oh, I took a nap just now. Maybe dust from my desk.

343
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,639
Oh, okay.

344
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:16,600
Can I have some grilled pork, bro?

345
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,840
Go ahead.

346
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,760
Hey, bro, any good food around the office?

347
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,120
Hey, bro, any good food around the office?

348
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,320
At the end of the street, there’s a crispy pork place. They give you a huge portion.

349
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,000
At the end of the street, there’s a crispy pork place. They give you a huge portion.

350
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,960
And at the very end, there’s stuffed deep-fried dough sticks. So good.

351
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,000
And at the very end, there’s stuffed deep-fried dough sticks. So good.

352
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,520
Gotta try that someday, bro.

353
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,840
Jun, you’re here already?

354
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,880
Good morning.

355
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,920
What happened to your face?

356
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,040
Damn.

357
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,719
What the hell, It stinks!

358
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,320
Did you not wash up?

359
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,080
Yep.

360
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,159
Ew.

361
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,239
You show up early just to use the office bathroom?

362
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,960
Getting your money’s worth, huh?

363
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,080
What are you doing, bro?

364
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:12,480
Your hair is soft, like a dog’s fur.

365
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,920
And your mouth is as dirty as one.

366
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,560
I’ll slap you, Jun.

367
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,440
With my lips.

368
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,640
Bro Champ, he again.

369
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,520
Damn, Sorn. Knock it off already.

370
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:40,520
After all these years, you’re still messing with him.

371
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,440
Well, he started it.

372
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,360
No, you started it.

373
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,840
You rolled your eyes at me.

374
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,880
Sorn, where did you disappear to?

375
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,200
I had some stuff to take care of.

376
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,960
You vanished just like that?

377
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,040
And why do you care so much?

378
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,240
I’m here now, aren’t I?

379
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:06,080
Jun, the dust on your face isn’t dust.

380
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,360
Someone drew a cat on you.

381
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,360
What a cat?

382
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,440
Go wash your hands.

383
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,360
You showed up early, but you didn’t check your face?

384
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,920
Damn you, Sorn.

385
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,080
With a crazy cat face like this, what the hell is up with you?

386
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,360
You’re messing with me, aren’t you?

387
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,680
Who said that?

388
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,320
No one else in this company pranks me except you.

389
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,800
Damn it, it won’t even come off!

390
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,840
Well, at least you're smart enough to know it was me.

391
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,760
Why the hell did you do this?

392
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,200
If you’re going to mess with me like this, just stay out of my business.

393
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,200
But hey, I brought you some facial cleanser.

394
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,720
Do you really hate me that much?

395
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,880
Are you seriously dating guys now, Jun?

396
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,520
Who I date is none of your business.

397
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,840
Why? Are you against same-sex relationships or something?

398
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:51,160
I was just asking. No need to freak out.

399
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,640
I was just curious because you used to date girls.

400
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,280
Since that time… when I helped you.

401
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,760
Shut up, people will hear.

402
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,800
Damn you, Sorn.

403
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,560
Disgusting.

404
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,040
And about what you’re wondering… that was a long time ago.

405
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:18,000
I’ll tell you now—Jun from back then is gone.

406
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,600
Now, I’m the spicy Jun.

407
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,320
Look at this. What do you think?

408
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,120
Spicy, right?

409
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,040
This is the real deal.

410
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,440
Pretty solid, huh?

411
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,840
Come take a closer look.

412
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,200
Your muscles are tight too, huh?

413
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,280
I get it, physique-wise.

414
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:10,320
But what made you change your preferences?

415
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:14,200
Why do you care? It’s not because of you, if that’s what you’re thinking.

416
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,280
You can’t fool me, Jun.

417
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,280
What are you trying to do? People will see.

418
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,160
If you don’t want me to do this, then just tell me—

419
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,000
It’s because of me, isn’t it?

420
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,040
No, it’s not.

421
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,960
And have you used what I taught you yet?

422
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,840
Yeah, I have.

423
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,480
With who?

424
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,200
Why do you care?

425
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,240
Just tell me—with who?

426
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,880
With Piang.

427
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:34,560
P’Sorn, I saw P’Champ looking for you. He said it’s work-related. He’s outside.

428
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:40,320
Oh, Jun! What happened to your lips?

429
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,560
Why are they swollen like a damn octopus?

430
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,400
And who the hell wrote on your face?

431
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,880
Oh my god, I’m going crazy!

432
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,320
I accidentally bit my own lip, P’.

433
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,720
And the marks on my face? Probably a dog wrote them.

434
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,640
Oh, just go wash your face already.

435
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:04,120
P’Sorn, I’m going to find P’Champ first. Come find me later.

436
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:13,560
And you, hurry up and wash your face. Move it.

437
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:24,280
I’m dead. I’m so dead.

438
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,200
What’s wrong?

439
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,880
Praew.

440
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:33,720
I was just in the bathroom, and Jun and Sorn… it looked like they had a fight.

441
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:39,360
P’Sorn looked pissed. Poor Jun.

442
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,400
Where’s my order? Bring it here so I can check it.

443
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,640
Documents. Hurry up!

444
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:54,000
Here, the order sheet.

445
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,320
Hey, Wynn, what’s up?

446
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,000
Man, I’m so bored, there’s no one to talk to.

447
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:04,200
Damn, same here. P’James, my mentor, went out for errands.

448
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,000
Now I gotta do P’Puth’s work.

449
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:14,120
Hey, let me finish up work first, then we’ll talk.

450
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:18,360
Wait, wait. Want to grab drinks tonight? I think I’ll be heading back into the city.

451
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,200
Hell yeah, let’s go! See you there.

452
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,240
Okay, same place as usual.

453
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,440
Done deal, see you.

454
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,520
Okay.

455
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,280
Hey, little bro, do you have my files yet?

456
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,640
Right here, just got them fresh off the press.

457
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,720
Damn, that was fast. Let me see.

458
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:51,240
Okay, all good. Thanks, but you’re useless to me now. Go downstairs and work.

459
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,320
I want to keep helping you.

460
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:59,520
Help with what? I just have to submit these papers. Go downstairs.

461
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:04,880
Why are you making such a fuss? Just go.

462
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,560
Fine, I’m leaving.

463
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,720
Every time I see you, I feel like I want to stomp on your face.

464
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,480
If you called me just to scold me, I’m leaving.

465
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,480
Jun!

466
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,480
You’re supposed to be learning from me, aren’t you?

467
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:42,040
Don’t think just because you’re Tai’s favorite little bro, I won’t tear into you in front of everyone.

468
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,760
So what if I’m Tai’s little bro?

469
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,520
Oh, P’Sorn, is there a problem?

470
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,480
Is this the order from Singapore?

471
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:59,640
Oops, not playing this game.

472
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:06,000
If anything comes up, just call Korn, okay?

473
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:12,840
Alright, I’ll be going now. Okay?

474
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,840
If you want to teach me, then say it nicely.

475
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:22,600
I called you here since noon, but did you even bother showing up?

476
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,720
Sort these by company name and year.

477
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,760
You look sleepy. Just go drink milk and sleep.

478
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,240
I’m not a kid anymore.

479
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,320
No matter how much you grow, you’ll always be younger than me.

480
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,640
Be honest, P’. Do you really dislike me that much?

481
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,000
I don’t like kids.

482
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,160
Especially annoying little brats like you.

483
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,200
Well, I don’t like certain old people either.

484
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,440
Especially old people like you.

485
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,560
What did you say?

486
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:36,920
Hey, you just got here, and you’re already chugging drinks. Calm down.

487
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,280
I’m chilling, bro.

488
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,200
Can me toast?

489
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:57,120
Yeah.

490
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,760
Mind if I sit here?

491
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:05,920
Go ahead.

492
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,520
I’m Pop. What’s your name?

493
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:19,280
Jun.

494
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,880
Are you here alone?

495
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:31,400
No, I came with friends. But your bag got caught on my arm, and now I’m lost.

496
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,720
What do you mean it got caught?

497
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,800
Hey, Jun, Pop’s talking to you.

498
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,960
Then talk to him.

499
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:47,800
Hey, pour me a drink.

500
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:10,240
Sorn’s late.

501
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,880
P’Jun, were you waiting long? My friends dragged me into a drinking session.

502
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:49,200
P’Jun, slow down. I can’t breathe.

503
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,640
I. We.

504
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,560
Oh. Oh.

505
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,680
You bastard. You dare touch my boyfriend?

506
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,360
Who the hell is your boyfriend?

507
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,400
Him. Right here.
