1
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:50,039
Umm

2
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,680
Umm

3
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,840
That's enough, you!

4
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,000
We've done it a lot already

5
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,880
We've done it a lot already,

6
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,000
but can't we do it again?

7
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,440
You're all out of cum.

8
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,440
Ohhh!

9
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,120
You really are something.

10
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,360
Heh...

11
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,200
Champ!

12
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,800
I…

13
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,040
Hey!

14
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,520
I think we should just stop here.

15
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,680
I’m afraid we won’t be able to be friends again like we were.

16
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,160
Save this kind of thing...

17
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,040
for someone you actually love.

18
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:02,800
Hey

19
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,760
Yeah, man.

20
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,440
Hmm...

21
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,440
Where’s Hia Sorn been?

22
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,560
I...

23
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,400
Haven’t seen him in two or three days.

24
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,800
Did you guys fight or something?

25
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,920
Or...

26
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,399
He gave up trying to win you back?

27
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,720
He’s not answering. Whatever, forget it.

28
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,000
Hey!

29
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,480
calm down.

30
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,280
I’ll help you.

31
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,080
Should I message Hia Tai?

32
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,440
Hia Tai, have you seen Sorn lately?

33
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,400
I've tried to contact him, but no luck.

34
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,640
Maybe he's sick.

35
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,960
It seems like he hasn't come to work for several days.

36
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,280
Jun,

37
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,040
Hia Tai said...

38
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,040
Hia Sorn’s sick.

39
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,160
For real?!

40
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,840
How is he?

41
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,080
I don’t know.

42
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,320
Hia Tai’s working with P’June.

43
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,520
Wait—where are you going?

44
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,360
I’m heading out...

45
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,840
I’ll call a cab.

46
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,400
Alright, take care.

47
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:54,760
Jun!

48
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,159
Whoa!!

49
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,600
Hia Tai told Win you were sick,

50
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,200
so I came rushing over…

51
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,680
but you...

52
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,120
Then I’ll go.

53
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,480
Jun, wait!

54
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,640
Let me go, P’Sorn!

55
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,240
Guys, don’t move yet—it's slippery...

56
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,480
Let go!

57
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,600
If I let go, you won’t listen to me.

58
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,159
I don’t want to hear anything from you anymore.

59
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,720
Be as jealous as you want, Jun.

60
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,159
but just listen to me.

61
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,960
Don’t step yet.

62
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,360
it’s slippery.

63
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,000
Sorn.

64
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
How are you feeling?

65
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,760
Whoa!!

66
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,080
Are you okay?

67
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,080
Let go!

68
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,320
Sorn.

69
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,760
Have you told him about us yet?

70
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,200
Heh!

71
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,000
Since we’re all here.

72
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,760
Let’s just clear everything up.

73
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,800
I’ve got nothing to clear up.

74
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,520
I’m leaving.

75
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,800
If you think you can just walk out of my house.

76
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,680
Go for it, Jun.

77
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,120
Hey!

78
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,040
Stay still.

79
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,400
Calm down and just listen to me.

80
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,640
Back then,

81
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,240
Sorn and I...

82
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,920
we were friends with benefits.

83
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,680
But it wasn’t wrong.

84
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,360
neither of us had anyone else.

85
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,320
I don’t know.

86
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,000
why...

87
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,600
Sorn decided to end it.

88
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,920
Maybe we were done…

89
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,040
or maybe it’s because of you.

90
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,600
I swear I don’t have anyone else, Jun.

91
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,559
How would I know that?

92
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,600
You’re so...

93
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,679
Believe me.

94
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,320
There’s really no one else.

95
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,280
Then why didn’t you tell me you were sick?

96
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,920
I couldn’t even stand up.

97
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,640
I haven’t even properly called in sick yet.

98
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,760
Sorn’s been out for days.

99
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,240
I was nearby, so I dropped in.

100
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,240
And I happened to find Champ already taking care of him.

101
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,120
Sorn was seriously sick.

102
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,040
Hia told him to go see a doctor and he refused.

103
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,360
Good thing Hia had a hunch and came to check.

104
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,800
Lucky you didn’t die.

105
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,560
So damn stubborn.

106
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,760
Where are you now?

107
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,080
I’m nearby.

108
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,320
Let’s meet in half an hour, okay?

109
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,600
I’ll head off first.

110
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,960
I’m leaving now.

111
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,960
Thanks a lot.

112
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,240
Hey! Watch your step—it’s slippery!

113
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,320
Whoa!!

114
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,440
Heh...

115
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,360
I’m outta here.

116
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,800
Has P’Sorn taken his meds yet, Hia?

117
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,520
I have eaten.

118
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,840
Champ, got it for me.

119
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,640
You sure you’re okay?

120
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,320
Hmm...

121
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,440
Should we get Sorn to eat something?

122
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,960
Yeah, go eat.

123
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,240
Penny bought you some porridge.

124
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,080
I don’t feel like eating porridge.

125
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,920
It’s too mushy.

126
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,000
Stop whining.

127
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,640
Your throat hurts, so just eat something warm.

128
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,840
How can I eat Penny’s stuff?

129
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,320
That kid’ll get jealous again.

130
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,880
Didn’t you see how possessive he is?

131
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,360
Who’s jealous of you?!

132
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,400
A moment ago, it...

133
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,200
I just...

134
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,320
Just what?

135
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,120
Say it. Acting all tough.

136
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,440
You’re just as bad as me.

137
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,560
Okay stop—enough.

138
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,840
So what do you actually wanna eat?

139
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,600
No clue.

140
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,800
Hia Jom?

141
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,120
I was about to order…

142
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,800
Why you calling Jom?

143
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,280
Ordering food for you!

144
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,440
You won’t eat this or that.

145
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,160
How’re you supposed to take your meds?

146
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,600
Then order from somewhere else!

147
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,280
Hia Jom’s place is the closest, duh.

148
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,000
Hand it over.

149
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,960
I’ll get one porridge and...

150
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,280
one spaghetti.

151
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,240
Thanks.

152
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,800
That’s it?

153
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,520
You love pushing my buttons.

154
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,160
And you’re jealous for no reason.

155
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,960
No reason?

156
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,440
I just…

157
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,680
damn,

158
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,080
My head hurts.

159
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,800
You idiot.

160
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,560
See? Acting all tough while being sick.

161
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,000
[You idiot.]

162
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,440
You okay, dude?

163
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,280
Here, Hia.

164
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,520
Huh?

165
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:34,880
I ordered extra for you.

166
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,480
Thank you very much.

167
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,920
What about Sorn?

168
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,320
The porridge’s for him.

169
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,000
Looks good.

170
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,680
This place’s food is great.

171
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,560
I want rice.

172
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,520
You’re so fussy, man!

173
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,120
Why eat something hard to swallow?

174
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,080
Just eat the damn porridge.

175
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,320
I don’t like porridge.

176
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,280
Oh!

177
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,600
come on, liar.

178
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,200
You eat this so you can take your medicine.

179
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,520
If you don’t get better,

180
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,240
I’m sending Jun to find a new boyfriend.

181
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,360
Yeah,

182
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,440
Hia...

183
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,960
just force yourself to eat,

184
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,080
so you can take the meds.

185
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,360
Feed me.

186
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,840
Heh.

187
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,280
You can eat it.

188
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,480
Eat it yourself.

189
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,240
Eat.

190
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,240
Feed.

191
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,280
Hia, where are you taking Jun’s stuff?

192
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,000
To my place, obviously.

193
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,800
Can I leave a bit later, bro?

194
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,800
Not yet...

195
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,080
I haven’t finished the paperwork to transfer my internship yet.

196
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,760
Can I go another day?

197
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,600
When you moved to the factory,

198
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,600
You didn’t need any paperwork.

199
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,240
Just grab your stuff!

200
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,480
Are you in a rush or what?

201
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,560
Yeah.

202
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,680
I’m in a rush.

203
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,120
And I already job took leave for you.

204
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,800
That means...

205
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,920
So Hia Tai knows everything now, huh?

206
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,440
Yep.

207
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,440
He gave the green light.

208
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,560
You can start interning at the office today.

209
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,360
You’re stealing Jun from me again, Hia...

210
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,160
Win, don’t you feel bad for me?

211
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,400
I’ve been apart from Jun for ages now.

212
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,040
That’s your own fault.

213
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,240
Come on, don’t!

214
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,920
Three days.

215
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,280
No way, bro.

216
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,200
Then just one day.

217
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,520
Ughhh…

218
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,200
Jun!

219
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,280
choose—me.

220
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,880
Or... Hia?

221
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,320
Heh...

222
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,880
I’ll take the day off.

223
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,800
to pack my things.

224
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,280
But...

225
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,680
can I finish one more week at the factory?

226
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,040
Then I’ll head...

227
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,400
to the city office.

228
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,400
Is that okay?

229
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,360
He's okay.

230
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,320
Give me a handshake, my friend.

231
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,680
If you didn’t say no, I’ll take that as a yes.

232
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,440
Gotta get back to work.

233
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,080
Oh!

234
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,920
yeah.

235
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,520
Bye, bro!

236
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,280
So...

237
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,800
you feeling better now?

238
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,000
Did you see a doctor?

239
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,800
Yeah, I’m getting better.

240
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,640
Let’s go pack.

241
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:40,000
I told you I don’t wanna leave?

242
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,480
What kinda couple lives separately, huh Jun?

243
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,360
You keep saying "couple"

244
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,320
you ever get embarrassed?!

245
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,960
Nah, not at all.

246
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,880
‘Cause it’s true.

247
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:56,920
So...

248
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,560
Then can I ask for something?

249
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,200
When I go back to the office.

250
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,640
let’s keep our relationship a secret, okay?

251
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,960
And don’t try anything at work.

252
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,200
No touching in front of others.

253
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,840
But… if it’s just the two of us…

254
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,840
that’s allowed, right?

255
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,440
Huh...

256
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,760
Pack your stuff already!

257
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,680
You promised me. About the office.

258
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,520
P’Sorn.

259
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,880
I’m sleeping in this room tonight.

260
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,560
I don’t approve.

261
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,000
Why not?

262
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,600
Because I’m too lazy to knock when I wanna get it on with you.

263
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,360
Seriously?!

264
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,560
Do you always have to bring up sex?

265
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,280
I just want some time for myself.

266
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,920
Time for yourself?

267
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,560
You’re telling me you’re gonna handle yourself,

268
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,360
when I’m literally right here?

269
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,840
Hgh...

270
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,720
I meant me time...

271
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,240
like personal space.

272
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,400
You’re not secretly seeing someone else, right?

273
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,160
The reason I want my own room.

274
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,160
because I’m tired at work.

275
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,560
You’re way too clingy, man!

276
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,280
I don’t wanna be exhausted, alright?!

277
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,720
Hmm...

278
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,000
Okay!

279
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,920
Now go. I’m packing.

280
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,640
Coffee’s here! For P’Praew and P’Korn!

281
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,960
Beena, Pete.

282
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,360
thank you so much.

283
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,520
You two delivered this yourselves?

284
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,360
Yep.

285
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,400
The café’s quiet today,

286
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,720
so we figured we’d bring it up ourselves.

287
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,520
Hmm...

288
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,960
It’s been quiet up here too lately.

289
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,720
Jun’s been gone.

290
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,200
P’Sorn—my boyfriend,

291
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,360
oops!

292
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,680
he’s been gone too.

293
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,880
I’ve been so lonely!

294
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,200
But I saw you chatting it up with the security guard earlier.

295
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,760
Didn’t look lonely at all!

296
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,240
Oof!

297
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,000
And the other day I saw you talking to Auntie Maew.

298
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,200
scribbling down some long list of numbers.

299
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,480
Doesn’t look like someone lonely!

300
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,240
Korn!

301
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:16,840
What?

302
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,960
you seriously handed your lottery sheet to Auntie Maew?!

303
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,800
Yeah!

304
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,040
Submit what?

305
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,680
Oh!

306
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,080
Nothing, sweetie.

307
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,840
Just a little note for Auntie Maew.

308
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,960
I missed her, that’s all.

309
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,240
So you two not heading back to the café yet?

310
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,840
You haven’t paid us yet!

311
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,360
Ah!

312
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,640
Payment! Okay.

313
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,720
Here’s the QR code.

314
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,800
If they need anything else,

315
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,120
make sure to follow up, alright?

316
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:42,560
Of course.

317
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,160
I’ll count on your team to support from this side too.

318
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,320
Hey Jun,

319
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,360
Wanna grab some crispy noodles across from the factory.

320
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,440
Come eat with us.

321
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,560
it’s as good as us.

322
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,360
Sure thing.

323
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,520
Since you’re heading back to the city office soon anyway.

324
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,080
Hmm...

325
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,080
Yeah!

326
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,000
we should totally throw you a mini send.

327
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,360
Our beloved prince of the factory is leaving soon.

328
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,960
we gotta go all out!

329
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,640
Oh!

330
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,080
That’s too much.

331
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,920
I’m not that popular.

332
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,840
Hey!

333
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,000
Sorn…

334
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,040
Once we send our handsome intern back to the city,

335
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,000
if you get any other good-looking newbies,

336
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,800
send them here, okay?

337
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,480
Jun!

338
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,520
one of the city office’s resident charmers.

339
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,040
He always spreads his charm around.

340
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,920
That’s why he’s got a whole fan club.

341
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,960
You’re just making stuff up…

342
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,480
Oww! Come on, bro!

343
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,840
Don’t bite my lip,

344
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,120
that hurts!

345
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,880
I want to.

346
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,440
Well, I want to too.

347
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,520
Hold on a sec!

348
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,200
I meant…

349
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,440
I wanna eat...

350
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,080
eat food!

351
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,560
I’m hungry.

352
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,320
Can’t you eat later?

353
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,040
But...

354
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,800
Everyone’s waiting, though!

355
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,800
I’m waiting for you, duh.

356
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,360
Come on, bro…

357
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,480
I’ll be home again by Saturday anyway.

358
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,840
Can’t you give me a little down payment first?

359
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,520
Down payment?

360
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,160
Down payment?

361
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,600
Down payment!!

362
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,480
I’m outta here.

363
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,360
Jun!

364
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,800
you little shit!

365
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,720
Ah!

366
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,160
Oh.

367
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,440
Guys, help me! help!

368
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,360
Alright, alright!

369
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,480
we’re coming!

370
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,440
Heh..

371
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,160
You ordered food?

372
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,800
Nah.

373
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:32,880
Oh!

374
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,440
Right this way.

375
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,720
Whoa, that’s awesome, bro!

376
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,920
Here’s your soy milk.

377
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,360
Shit, it’s hot! Damn it!

378
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,880
That’s all you brought me?

379
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,200
You’re watching your figure.

380
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,200
right? Why eat more?

381
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,120
And why are you showing up so late?

382
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,440
I’m crashing here tonight.

383
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,720
Huh?

384
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,160
You’re sleeping in Jun’s room, right?

385
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,680
But...

386
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,760
The room’s not soundproof.

387
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,000
Keep it down, alright?

388
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,440
You jerk, Win!

389
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,920
Later, bro!

390
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,080
I’ll be back.

391
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,520
Where you going?

392
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,280
Grabbing my clothes from the car.

393
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,520
Hey! Bro!

394
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,560
Where’d you come from, the desert or something?

395
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,240
I don’t feel like it.

396
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,760
I know.

397
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,560
I won’t push it.

398
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,040
Let me just cuddle you real hard.

399
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,040
Hey!

400
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,040
I’m so proud

401
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,200
got myself a hot boyfriend.

402
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,840
But I hate it when people look at you.

403
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,400
Now.

404
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,320
You’re complimenting me to my face now?

405
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,520
You used to not even look me in the eye.

406
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,840
I was complimenting you in my head, okay?

407
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,480
Jun…

408
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,000
I wanna get serious with you—for real.

409
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,680
I also...

410
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,640
serious about you.

411
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,520
I wanna do this right.

412
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,600
But I’m scared you’re not ready.

413
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,000
Not ready for what?

414
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,520
Coming out to my family.

415
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,040
Well, well, if it isn’t my brother-in-law!

416
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,240
Whoa—P’Nu!

417
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,960
What the heck did you just say?!

418
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,640
And what are you doing here?

419
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,480
You visiting?

420
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,840
How long you staying?

421
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,440
Want me to show you around?

422
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,120
You sure you’ve got the energy?

423
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,200
My brother actually let you outta bed?

424
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,920
Nu

425
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,920
Stop teasing him.

426
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,480
Yeah, seriously

427
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,160
Back me up here, P’Sorn.

428
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,280
Dude, stop blurting out the truth all the time! People might actually…

429
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,080
You told Mom about him yet?

430
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,800
Feeling better now, honey?

431
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,960
Yeah, I’m all good now, Mom.

432
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,200
Has Tanu arrived?

433
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,480
He’s here...

434
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,360
And all he’s done is nag me.

435
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,080
So annoying!

436
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,920
How did you even raise that guy, Mom?

437
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,600
I raise him the same way as you.

438
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,520
Mom…

439
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,880
What is it?

440
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,480
Um…

441
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,360
What if I had a boyfriend.

442
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,800
It’s a good thing.

443
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,240
My eldest son is going to fall in love.

444
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,160
But...

445
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,640
It’s not the kind of love people see as “ideal”?

446
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,160
If it’s the love you choose, it’s gotta be good.

447
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,120
Jun’s a sweet boy.

448
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,200
Wait—Mom, you knew?!

449
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,440
Don’t underestimate your own mother.

450
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:13,880
The way you look at him says everything.

451
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,520
So… do you like him?

452
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,480
Whoever you love, I love too.

453
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,080
Jun’s adorable.

454
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,080
Bring him to visit again sometime, okay?

455
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,200
Will do.

456
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,560
Love you, Mom.

457
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,240
And you?

458
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,640
Why are you here?

459
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,880
Came for a friend’s wedding…

460
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,800
And to check in on stuff for Lady Wandi.

461
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,360
Our mom’s starting a new business.

462
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,200
Man, you never stop working, huh?

463
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,720
I swear, she’s gonna run for district mayor next.

464
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,640
You’re such a model son.

465
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,960
Of course I am. Not like you—

466
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,880
ditched the farm life to be a salaryman.

467
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,640
You asshole…

468
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,840
P’Sorn

469
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,520
Where’d all the stuff in the bedroom go?

470
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,640
Since Tanu’s staying over, you gotta sleep in my room.

471
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,240
Why didn’t you put him in your mom’s room?

472
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,480
Didn’t have time to clean it up.

473
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,160
Alright, alright—

474
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,920
just sleep in my room, okay?

475
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,360
That way I don’t have to roll in dust in my mom’s room again.

476
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,960
Settled.

477
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,880
Quit whining and go to sleep.

478
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,880
Jun…

479
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,240
Can I?

480
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,120
Hey hey! I brought your stuff—

481
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,360
Ohh, wow...

482
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,440
wait, are y’all making babies in there?!

483
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,080
You little devil!

484
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,680
Tanu!

485
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,320
Get your ass home NOW!

486
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:33,400
I didn’t know y’all were doing that! You didn’t even lock the damn door!

487
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:40,320
And seriously—put your shirt on, you’re flashing me, dude!

488
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,600
You saw something just now, didn’t you?

489
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,600
Are you seriously embarrassed right now?

490
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,440
I’ve seen your junk since we were kids!

491
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,400
Not mine

492
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,760
Jun’s!

493
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,840
Oh...

494
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,360
I only saw his chest.

495
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,640
Just the chest, okay?

496
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,520
You sure?

497
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:08,200
Totally! Just a glimpse. Then you kicked me out.

498
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:16,040
Next time, wait for permission before barging into someone’s room!

499
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,720
This is your house.

500
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,760
And my house too!

501
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,680
I’ve been here loads of times

502
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,560
I come and go like I own the place.

503
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,320
Huh? What the—!?

504
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,840
I’m trying to teach you something!

505
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,480
Okay, okay! I’m sorry

506
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,200
I really didn’t know!

507
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:38,200
How’s Jun? Is he mad at me?

508
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,480
Mad at me? That’s fine. But mad at me? I’m screwed.

509
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,640
P’Sorn! Go sleep with P’Tanu

510
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,480
I’m locking the door tonight!

511
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,440
See?! This is your fault, dumbass! Shit

512
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,920
Jun! Don’t lock the damn door!

513
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,639
Hey, P’Sorn.

514
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,520
Are you still mad at me about last night?

515
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,000
Of course I am! Why didn’t you lock the damn door?

516
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,800
Ughh, now Tanu’s gonna tease me to death!

517
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,199
Tanu left at like 7 a.m.

518
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,719
He had to go be the best man at that wedding.

519
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,520
So you really are mad at me, huh?

520
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,920
Come on, don’t be mad.

521
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,440
I seriously didn’t know the door wasn’t locked. Forgive me?

522
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,720
Fine. But next time—don’t forget.

523
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,120
I mean it!

524
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,360
Got it.

525
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,440
Drink your coffee—I made it for you.

526
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,400
Drink it first.

527
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,720
Morning, everyone.

528
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,760
Whoaaa Jun! Our precious intern.

529
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,480
I thought you ran off for good!

530
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,560
Where’ve you been, man?

531
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:01,160
Welcome back, Jun!

532
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,120
Hello everyone.

533
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,720
Hey hey, let’s not crush him with hugs, alright?

534
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:09,600
Hmph! I missed him too! Look at him, he’s grown two whole centimeters!

535
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,360
Whoa, that’s a big deal, huh? Two whole cm!

536
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,560
You’re so cute.

537
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,320
Glad you’re back, Jun.

538
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,080
Thanks, P’.

539
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:20,880
We thought you were quitting to go work at the factory full time. Didn’t even tell us.

540
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,720
Yeah, sorry about that.

541
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,240
I didn’t plan to transfer—it all happened pretty fast.

542
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,200
Besides, I was only gone a little while. I’m back now.

543
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,440
Hi P’June, P’Penny!

544
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,920
- Hii there!
- Hello!

545
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,320
Alright, we’ll catch you later.

546
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,280
Okay!

547
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,640
What?

548
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,520
P’June, P’Penny did I miss something?

549
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,520
They seem normal to me...

550
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,440
Feels like P’June and P’Penny are dating!

551
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,560
Gosh, Praew! Don’t go blurting that out without proof.

552
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,080
Gosh, Praew! Don’t go blurting that out without proof.

553
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:07,120
P’June and P’Penny? OMG, really?

554
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,400
Yup!

555
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,520
No way! Penny and June? Can’t be!

556
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:20,960
Listen, this tea’s been filtered! Auntie Maew—our cleaning lady—told me.

557
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:26,280
She saw them kiss after work!

558
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,440
Whaaat?! Dead!!

559
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:36,200
Our ship is sinking!! Who do we ship P’Sorn with now?!

560
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,320
Okay, enough gossip! Back to work, everyone—line up, students!

561
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,600
We’ll talk later—move it, before they walk in! Scatter!

562
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,160
See you this evening! Back to work now!

563
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,480
Sit down and start working, you troublemaker!

564
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,120
Yeah, yeah.

565
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,560
How’ve you been?

566
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,120
I’m good! The factory was hot as hell.

567
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,400
I missed this office so much—AC’s heaven here.

568
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,840
You ran off and didn’t even tell me. I was kinda hurt.

569
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,040
Awwww you poor thing, always so sensitive!

570
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,600
Here ya go.

571
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,280
welcome back to work, my dear intern~

572
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,560
Whoa, that’s way too much.

573
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,400
Can I just fake my death?

574
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:28,520
Hey, what do you mean? That’s all James’s work.

575
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,440
Just wait till he’s done with the meeting—he’ll come teach you.

576
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,360
So you can level up, bro!

577
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,440
Still too much, bro!

578
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
That’s what you get for disappearing!

579
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,600
Wait, where is P’James?

580
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,640
He’s in a meeting, bro.

581
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,320
Oh right, and who are these kids—

582
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,400
Oh, I’m an intern here.

583
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,120
And this is P’Champ

584
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,800
He’s on the sales team

585
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,760
P’Champ…

586
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,480
oh! I’ve heard about you from P’Korn.

587
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,120
But dang, you look super young! I thought you were another intern.

588
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,800
So good-looking too.

589
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,200
I’m Tos, by the way. Just started working here.

590
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,480
Oh! Nice to meet you, man.

591
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,480
So where do you usually eat lunch?

592
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,840
Around here, just nearby.

593
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,760
Mind if I tag along?

594
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:35,760
I’m new and don’t really know who to eat with yet.

595
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,920
Sure, let’s have lunch together this noon.

596
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,440
Thanks a lot…

597
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,280
See you at lunch, P’Champ!

598
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,240
Yes, sir. Absolutely, I’ll take care of it.

599
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,160
Okay, goodbye.

600
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,720
P’Puth~ are P’Ei and P’Pae around?

601
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,440
Oh hey, it’s Vena! Doing coffee runs today?

602
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,720
Yep! They placed an order.

603
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,080
Ahh, they’re not here right now. P’Praew sent them to prep meeting docs.

604
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,920
Then can I leave these with you?

605
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,800
Sure!

606
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,920
Cool, bring ’em over.

607
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:34,720
Thanks a lot.

608
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,480
By the way, is there a new intern joining?

609
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:43,120
Oh, you mean the new guy? Actually no—he’s not an intern, he’s a full-time hire. His name’s Tos.

610
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,360
The higher-ups asked me to take care of him.

611
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,400
Then don’t forget to send him to buy coffee at my dad’s café too, okay?

612
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:54,280
You’re tiny but a pro at selling stuff, huh? Damn, impressive!

613
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,480
You’re doing great, I’ll take care of it!

614
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,400
Alright, we’ll get going now.

615
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,360
Don’t forget to give the coffee to P’Toey and P’Pae!

616
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:06,320
Will do! Get back safe.

617
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,600
I gotta get back to work. Byeee!

618
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,520
Kids these days… really know their stuff

619
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,720
P’Tai, P’Sorn

620
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,440
Can I ask you something? Just 5 minutes, promise.

621
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,400
What is it?

622
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:30,640
P’Korn and P’Praew said you guys are really close to P’Champ…

623
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,920
I wanna ask him out.

624
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:45,760
So I was hoping you two could give me some advice.

625
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,800
You guys still here?

626
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,200
Do that stuff somewhere private!

627
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,000
Were you spying on me?

628
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,240
I want your dad and sister to know we’re together.

629
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,760
And if your dad doesn’t approve?

630
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,720
Has Jun ever brought a home?

631
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,880
Or… does Dad need to go propose for a wife?

632
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,120
Or... a guy?

633
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,000
So you’re flirting with my brother?

634
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Or are you already together?

635
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,480
Sis…

636
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,920
Sis, ask Sorn.
