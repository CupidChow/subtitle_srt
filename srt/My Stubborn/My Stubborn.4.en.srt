1
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,200
We just sex partner.

2
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,720
We satisfy each other's needs.

3
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,040
Without any feelings involved.

4
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,120
You.

5
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,640
Hmm?

6
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,960
I’ve got gossip.

7
00:06:53,960 --> 00:07:00,160
Last night, the place I went to—hot Korean guys, seriously.

8
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,920
Whoa! You went without even thinking of inviting me?

9
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,280
What’s your heart made of, huh?

10
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,040
Oh please, even if I invited you, like you’d actually come.

11
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:14,120
You just watch Chinese dramas all day. Look at you—not sleeping at night, your eyes are all dark.

12
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,640
Really?

13
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,160
Totally. You need fillers already, babe.

14
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:28,640
But the lead actor is so handsome. I can’t get off the Great Wall of China!

15
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:35,760
Hey, the Great Wall is tall, okay? Be careful or you’ll fall to your death. Don’t say your friend didn’t warn you.

16
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,360
Are you cursing me?

17
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,840
I’m not cursing. I care about you, duh.

18
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,400
Care, my ass. You love me so much, right?

19
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,000
She’s here—Praew’s here.

20
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,320
Jun!

21
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,200
Oh, hi.

22
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:07,440
Hey there. Where’ve you been? Walking in like that, eyes all droopy. Did my love hit your eyes or something?

23
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,240
Oh please, stop harassing him.

24
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,200
I wasn’t harassing him at all!

25
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,120
Sorry, okay?

26
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,080
Oh, it’s alright. No worries.

27
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,320
So sweet. He’s not mad at me.

28
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:31,400
Jun, he’s like… whoa… like rawr! Just like that, right, Praew? Spot on, told you! Haha—so spicy.

29
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:38,760
Haha—so spicy.

30
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,680
I wanna be a hyena so bad—so I can bite your neck! Rawr!

31
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,480
That’s enough. Get back to work.

32
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,440
Ughhh.

33
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,200
Shit! P’Son!

34
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,640
- What are you doing?!
- Hey!

35
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,360
Geez, you came out of nowhere! You scared me!

36
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,680
You’ve got such a weak heart.

37
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,880
It’s your fault—this bite mark!

38
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,160
P’Korn and P’Praew saw it already!

39
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,240
It’s just a mark, right?

40
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,240
But they saw it, didn’t they?!

41
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,080
Want me to do it back to you? It’s embarrassing, you know!

42
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,680
Then do it back, why don’t you?

43
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,560
It hurts, Jun.

44
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,720
So what? My neck hurts too.

45
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,520
Son! Hiding out here, huh? P’June was asking for you.

46
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,720
Hey, boss.

47
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,240
So, did P’Sorn mess with you or anything?

48
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,960
I didn’t mess with him at all.

49
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,400
And you? Did you mess with him?

50
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,520
You used to be pretty spicy, didn’t you?

51
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,080
Come on, boss. Who’d dare mess with him?

52
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,200
He’s supervising my internship—if I fail, I’m screwed.

53
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:37,280
Yeah, good. Keep things smooth. Son’s got a sharp tongue but a kind heart. If you're good to him, he’ll take care of you for life.

54
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,120
Him? Kind-hearted? Really?

55
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,800
Yeah! Keep fighting, bro!

56
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,400
He’s only kind to ghosts.

57
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,640
Hello, Jun!

58
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,800
Oh! P’James!

59
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,320
Having coffee?

60
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,120
Yeah.

61
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,120
So, Jun has to go to the… rong-ngang jad-song… or something. (mumbling)

62
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,360
What did you just say?

63
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,280
Rong-ngan! Don’t you get it?

64
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,480
Oh! The factory.

65
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,520
Right—the factory.

66
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,240
Exactly.

67
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,560
Going to see Win too, right?

68
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,880
Exactly, With Sorn.

69
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,720
Okay, With P’Sorn?

70
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,080
Yeah.

71
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,920
I’ll head over after I finish this.

72
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,040
Here—want some?

73
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,440
Thanks.

74
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,280
How do you feel, man?

75
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:24,800
I’m excited!

76
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,440
Yeah.

77
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,400
I couldn’t sleep at all last night.

78
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,520
Whoa, that bad?

79
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,880
Of course it was, friend.

80
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,840
Let me play it for you. Yeah.

81
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,720
Jun, sit in the front.

82
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,440
Go on, just go.

83
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,920
Yeah, yeah, I know.

84
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,280
You guys going to the factory?

85
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,800
Yes.

86
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,840
Let me come too—I was just about to see Khun Paisan.

87
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,720
The employee documents on their side are still a mess.

88
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,280
Take the front seat, please.

89
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,240
Thanks, sweetie.

90
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,960
Don’t.

91
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,400
No one’s gonna see.

92
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,080
The kids in the back!

93
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,440
They’re all asleep already.

94
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,720
Alright, I’ll go see Khun Paisan first then.

95
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,440
Okay.

96
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,880
It’s massive.

97
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,920
Seriously, it’s freaking huge.

98
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,280
Whoa.

99
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,640
Hey Jun, Aey, wanna go check that area out?

100
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,160
Where are you guys going?

101
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,680
We’re just walking around the factory.

102
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:51,080
You guys can’t just wander around here, it’s dangerous. Some areas are off-limits, and others need a guide to enter.

103
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,360
Yes, sir.

104
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,720
Hey, Jun!

105
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,000
Win!

106
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,520
Missed you so much.

107
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,520
Seriously missed you, man.

108
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,000
Big smooch!

109
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Calm down, bro.

110
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,600
Oh! Hey P’Son, hello!

111
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,800
Oh, so Pe and Aey came too?

112
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,240
No way we’d miss this!

113
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,400
How’ve you been? All good?

114
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,080
All good, you bastard.

115
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,640
Just kinda lonely—no one my age around.

116
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,440
Yeah, I get that.

117
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,640
Come on, let’s head to the break room.

118
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,560
Is there aircon?

119
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,840
Yup, icy cold.

120
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,280
Alright, let’s go.

121
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,360
It’s scorching hot.

122
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,160
Help yourselves to the snacks, guys.

123
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,160
Thanks, bro.

124
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:41,960
Hey P’Son, bring Jun to see me more often. I’m all alone here—no one my age!

125
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,480
Didn’t I hear you’re playing sepak takraw with the mechanic team?

126
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,560
Yeah, I am.

127
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,360
I’ve got a match next week. Wanna come watch?

128
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:57,680
Wait a sec, Win—are you here for your internship or training for the national team?

129
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,240
Hey Win, but we’re not sure yet. If there’s work at the office, then maybe…

130
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,760
I’ll bring them myself.

131
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,440
Hoo! Count me in too, P’Son.

132
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,080
Yeah, I’ll bring you guys.

133
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,440
But I gotta get back to work first.

134
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,640
Okay, sure.

135
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,560
Does P’Son have a girlfriend?

136
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,200
Why you asking? Got a crush on him?

137
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,920
Nooo, just curious!

138
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,800
Just answer already.

139
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:40,080
Not really. Since I’ve known P’Son, never seen him with an actual girlfriend.

140
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:50,280
What a shame! I thought he was dating P’Penny—they’ve got such good chemistry. I totally ship them.

141
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:59,640
Pfft, you just imagine things. They might just be close friends—doesn’t mean there’s anything more. All in your head.

142
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,600
You never know. Maybe there is something.

143
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,880
Someone as pretty as P’Penny? Of course all the guys like her.

144
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,560
But usually… he doesn’t really act flirty with anyone.

145
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,560
Right, Jun? You work with him, don’t you?

146
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,760
Uh… nope, nothing going on.

147
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,080
See? Told ya!

148
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:29,120
Next time you come to the factory, I’ll introduce you to this technician—he’s insanely good at takraw.

149
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:35,120
Is he as good as Aey? He just went ice skating—super intense. I’ve got a clip, let me show you.

150
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,640
You better do it properly.

151
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,160
Here, look at this... this one.

152
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,080
He’s flying like that—I thought it was Iron Man!

153
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,640
So slick.

154
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,360
Cool, right?

155
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:55,360
Yeah, Win, I’m telling you—this place has tons of activities. I’ve changed my mind, I wanna intern here. Can I switch?

156
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,960
If you can switch, let me come too.

157
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,080
No way. I won’t let you.

158
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:08,000
The international department interns at the city office. If you move here, what would you even do?

159
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,200
Might as well go home.

160
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,240
Has P’Son gotten stricter lately or what?

161
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,960
And harsh, too.

162
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,480
Thank you, P’Penny, P’Son.

163
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,920
Sure. You coming?

164
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:56,840
Hey Aey, do you think P’Penny actually wants you to do this kind of thing?

165
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:02,400
Maybe not, but I want them to spend time together, you know?

166
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,360
Busybody. Meddling in things that aren’t your business.

167
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,280
Come on, let’s go.

168
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,440
Why you meddling?

169
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,000
Hey Jun, let’s go!

170
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,400
Alright, alright, I’m going.

171
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,880
Hey, how do you press this? Help me out.

172
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,880
Watch this.

173
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,760
Just like that.

174
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,080
Awesome.

175
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:35,520
Mhm.

176
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,520
Thank you.

177
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,840
Can I ask you something?

178
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,840
What is it?

179
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,600
You and P’Son—have you known each other long? You guys seem really close.

180
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:55,520
I wouldn’t call it close. We only talk like two or three sentences a day.

181
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,000
Why?

182
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,280
Can’t you tell?

183
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,560
Me and P’Son just argue all the time. I’ve never liked his face.

184
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:09,800
Even though you “don’t like him,” he still takes care of you.

185
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:17,280
Look at today at the factory—when you said you wanted to join the sports event, he actually took you there.

186
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,280
You’re exaggerating.

187
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,440
No, it’s true!

188
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,280
Have you seen P’Put?

189
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,320
I think I saw him—looked like he was walking this way.

190
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,400
Still hasn’t come to collect his stuff.

191
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,200
How’s it going, my dear junior?

192
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,280
There he is, speak of the devil. All done, bro.

193
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,360
Let me see.

194
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,080
Let’s check it.

195
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,080
Only one file?

196
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,960
Here, there are two.

197
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,680
Oh wait, this one doesn’t count, right?

198
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,920
Okay, all set. Thanks a lot.

199
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,800
- See you around.
- Goodbye.

200
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,000
Hey, what’s up, Piang?

201
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,600
Why do you keep disappearing, P’Jun? I have to keep chasing you down.

202
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,040
Ugh, I’ve been super busy lately. What about you—what are you doing?

203
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,600
Just lying around under the building. I went to grab some snacks.

204
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,440
Um! Are you free this evening, P’Jun? Wanna catch a movie?

205
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,720
Hmm, a movie? Yeah, sure, I’ll go.

206
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:12,240
Hey… let me ask you—was the guy who owns the bar we went to named Franz?

207
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,960
I don’t remember his face, just that he was hot.

208
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,280
Hmm. Now that you know your type, you can’t stop complimenting him, huh?

209
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:30,240
So? Are you going to tell me who that guy Son is—the one who came to pick you up?

210
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,680
He’s just like I said—an older guy I know. Nothing more.

211
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:40,400
Now I wanna know even more. I asked P’Franz, and he wouldn’t say a thing.

212
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,040
He said something like, “I can’t get involved in this,” acting all secretive.

213
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,840
Come on, there’s really nothing going on.

214
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,960
Let’s just meet at the cinema, okay?

215
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,000
Okay, that’s all for now. My friends are here.

216
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,960
Wow, just hung up like that?

217
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,800
Ugh.

218
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,120
Geez, what the hell are you doing, man?

219
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,520
And what are you doing here?

220
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,520
Where are you going?

221
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,920
Just going to the movies with Piangrak.

222
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,560
Didn’t I tell you not to talk to her?

223
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:36,240
Oh please, I’m just going as her friend.

224
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,840
So who are you texting? Franz?

225
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,520
You want him to get you drunk again?

226
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,200
I’m the only one getting myself drunk.

227
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,480
Hoping you’d end up in his bed, huh?

228
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,000
I just wanted to prove that I…

229
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,680
I...

230
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,920
Wait, are you seriously gonna sleep with him?

231
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,240
He’s really pushing it, insulting me like that.

232
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:17,600
Hey, I’m just going to chill, that’s all.

233
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,280
I’m not hooking up with anyone.

234
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,000
Then why waste your money on it?

235
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:29,120
Can you even earn your own money? Spending it on nonsense.

236
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,240
What’s your problem, seriously?

237
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,960
Yelling like this—did you fight with P’Penny or something?

238
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,600
What’s Penny got to do with this?

239
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,720
You think I didn’t notice?

240
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,080
There’s nothing going on.

241
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,240
Penny was just messing around, that’s all.

242
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,000
Is that how people tease each other these days?

243
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,200
Whatever. Up to you.

244
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,360
I’m not dating Penny. I don’t have a wife.

245
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,280
Then… do you have a girlfriend?

246
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,120
I don’t have a girlfriend either.

247
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,400
You little brat.

248
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,000
No one owns me yet.

249
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,920
Wanna grab a drink, huh?

250
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,480
Same place as always.

251
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,480
Oh.

252
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,400
Watch my phone for me.

253
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,080
What are you doing here?

254
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,200
Are they about to fight?

255
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,760
I’m just training Jun.

256
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,080
Oh, right. You’re really dedicated, huh?

257
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,360
It’s after work already, look at the time.

258
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:50,120
You could’ve gone home, you know? Jun probably wants to go too.

259
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,360
Something urgent came up.

260
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,880
They’re kicking us out—let’s go.

261
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,480
Then I’ll leave this work with you.

262
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,360
Please take care of it.

263
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,520
Then I’ll take my leave.

264
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,520
Goodbye.

265
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,880
Let’s go, Jun.

266
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,600
Jun, come on.

267
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:22,960
Damn, my heart nearly jumped out of my chest.

268
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,640
Feel it—my heart’s pounding like crazy.

269
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,040
Whoa, what’s up with you?

270
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,200
Penny.

271
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,560
Yes? Is something wrong?

272
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,840
Do you realize you’re behaving inappropriately at work?

273
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,640
Inappropriately?

274
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,040
How so?

275
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:27,680
Going off with Son during work hours—and acting like you own him.

276
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,600
Aren’t you afraid people in the company will think badly of you?

277
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,040
Is that all?

278
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,400
If that’s all, I’ll excuse myself.

279
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,080
Why haven’t you gone home yet?

280
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,920
I called a ride, but no one’s picked it up yet.

281
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,920
I’ll give you a ride.

282
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,400
Uh, well…

283
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,960
C’mon, I’ll take you.

284
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,360
But I’m stopping by the mall first.

285
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,720
Huh?

286
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,600
Which place should we eat at?

287
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,000
Oh, Jun! Wanna have dinner together?

288
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,320
I was going to treat Son to thank him for giving me a ride to the factory.

289
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,920
Thanks, but I’ll pass. I already made plans with a junior.

290
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,480
Which floor are you meeting this junior on?

291
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,920
P’Jun!

292
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,280
Oh, Piang!

293
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,680
Let’s go, Piang.

294
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,320
See you later.

295
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,640
That place looks tasty too.

296
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,240
Come on, let’s eat.

297
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,240
Hmm… I wanted to go to that place…

298
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,760
What’s wrong?

299
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,400
Oh, let’s go to a different place.

300
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,480
Nothing.

301
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,360
P’Jun,

302
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,800
Why’d you drag me here? You didn’t even say hi to him yet.

303
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:54,520
No need to say hi. It’s not like we’ll see him again.

304
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:03,880
Don’t come home late. Tomorrow morning, I’m making you join the meeting too.

305
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,880
Hmm, nothing.

306
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:20,080
Don’t be a smartass. Read it and reply.

307
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,720
I’m going to hang out some more with Piangrak.

308
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,200
Where the hell are you going?

309
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:41,120
Oh, hi P’Son!

310
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:51,200
Ugh, Praew—he’s in a bad mood again. I even greeted him and he
scowled at me.

311
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,680
Oh no, drama incoming.

312
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,760
Just wait.

313
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,960
So, what now? What do you think? Yeah, exactly.

314
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,680
Hi Jun! What did you buy?

315
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,920
Grilled sticky rice. Want some?

316
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,400
Can I have a bite… of your heart?

317
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,480
Oh, come on.

318
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,120
You cheeky thing.

319
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,640
Hey! Hello, P’Champ.

320
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,400
Hey, what did you buy to eat?

321
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,120
Grilled sticky rice, bro. Want one? Got different fillings—pick one.

322
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,040
Oh, I saw Win yesterday.

323
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:35,240
Oh right, I forgot—I was gonna throw him a birthday thing.

324
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,880
I’m probably free next week. I’ll call him.

325
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:39,840
Sounds good.

326
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,560
Tai’s back too—perfect timing for a get-together.

327
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,520
I’m in, boss.

328
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,520
Look at us—just work all day. So stressed out.

329
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,240
Jun, you’re coming. That’s an order.

330
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,120
P’Champ, can I even say no?

331
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,640
When it’s free, I’m in.

332
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:02,000
But can you afford me? I eat a lot.

333
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,480
Bro, don’t worry—I got you.

334
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,880
Let’s go, bro.

335
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,280
You’re my favorite, after all.

336
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,400
Don’t forget drinks too.

337
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,800
Go all out.

338
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,200
Here you go.

339
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,080
You’re early, man.

340
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,080
Thanks, thanks.

341
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,120
One each.

342
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:26,360
Go print and copy 15 sets of this—collated. I need it in 10 minutes.

343
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,640
I’m still eating… haven’t even had breakfast yet.

344
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,360
It’s alright, I’ll do it, P’Son.

345
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,640
Pe, don’t do it. Jun will.

346
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,920
I want it done by 8:50.

347
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,480
I’m gonna tell Tai. When he’s back, you’re screwed.

348
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:05,200
You breathe Tai’s name. He’s not even here, and you’re still talking about him all day.

349
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:12,640
Well, you keep picking on his boy. Don’t let me catch you doing it again, jerk.

350
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,080
I’m not picking on him—I’m making him work.

351
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:28,040
You dumbass. Who’d believe you? The kid’s eating and you make him work, but you never ask Pe or Aey to do anything. Damn.

352
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,480
It’s work time, not mealtime!

353
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,320
Idiot.

354
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:52,160
Shit—it’s jammed! Damn it! Why’d it shut down?!

355
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,080
Jun.

356
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,520
is it done yet?!

357
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,160
The machine’s frozen—shut off. Give me a second.

358
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,320
Can’t even finish this simple task?

359
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,360
How are you gonna survive.

360
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:13,280
Jun? Is anything done? If not, don’t bother.

361
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,720
Well… I’ll just go work in P’James’s office then.

362
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,400
Look in the folder. These are the orders we’ll need to…

363
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:39,360
Sorry, I brought the meeting documents.

364
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,680
The printer here broke down, so I’m a bit late—my apologies.

365
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:48,440
Jun, P’Son told you to prepare these yesterday.

366
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,760
Huh?

367
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,760
Are you done.

368
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:05,040
Jun? Please step out—it’s meeting time now.

369
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,679
Sorry.

370
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:29,840
Okay, let’s continue. These are the rush orders, the client’s already following up. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

371
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,000
Champ, have you seen Jun?

372
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,000
How would I know, idiot? You’re the one pulling dumb pranks, jackass.

373
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,280
Don’t start yelling—help me find him first. He disappeared.

374
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,440
James!

375
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,720
What?

376
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,840
Have you seen Jun?

377
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:08,000
I think P’June asked to talk to him—he went that way.

378
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,760
Jun.

379
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,680
Jun, look up.

380
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,800
Don’t bother me. Just leave.

381
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,560
Calm down.

382
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,480
Calm down?

383
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:49,720
For what? What the hell have you been doing to me?

384
00:35:51,520 --> 00:36:08,920
All those pranks—and now P’June called me in just to scold me because of you. Dammit.

385
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:32,880
Jun, I’m sorry. Please don’t cry.

386
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:43,360
Son, P’June wants to talk to you.

387
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,800
Yeah, I’m coming.

388
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,920
What’s up?

389
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,000
Are you busy?

390
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,720
For you? I’m always free.

391
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,760
Your dear friend caused trouble again.

392
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,880
He teased the kid so much P’June ended up
scolding him. Too much.

393
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,040
"Work stuff?"

394
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:54,280
Yeah. I wouldn’t say anything if it was something else, but Jun looked crushed—like a kicked puppy. Call him and cheer him up.

395
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,680
Alright, alright. I’ll call him.

396
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,560
You going out tonight?

397
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,720
Nah.

398
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,120
I’ll call you later then.

399
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,720
Okay.

400
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,880
Yes, boss.

401
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:34,400
Heard you got pranked by Son? What happened? You two seemed to be getting along.

402
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,520
It’s fine, bro. He always messes with me.

403
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,480
I’ll deal with him.

404
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,400
No need, really.

405
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:50,040
I don’t want it to blow up. Besides, P’Son already apologized.

406
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:55,760
Alright, I’ll still sort it out. Champ told me already.

407
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:03,120
I’m heading back in a couple of
days—anything you want? Win gave me a whole wishlist.

408
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:09,720
Win again? Hmm… nah, I don’t want anything. Nothing in particular.

409
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:14,160
Okay then. I’ll get back to work. We’ll talk later.

410
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,400
Alright, bro. Thanks.

411
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,840
Bye.

412
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,040
Who else just showed up?

413
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,480
The grilled sticky rice is here, guys.

414
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,880
Be careful or P’Son's gonna scold you.

415
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,200
Why would he? I asked him to buy it for me.

416
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,160
Still, I bought it for you first, okay?

417
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,440
So what now? Are you gonna move out or what?

418
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,040
I can't afford the rent, man.

419
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,320
Then just come stay at my place.

420
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,800
And don’t even worry about it — you’ve crashed there before anyway.

421
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,960
Jun.....

422
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,200
I want it.

423
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,440
P’Son...

424
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,120
I’m not feeling so good...

425
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,720
But I do know how to make you feel better.

426
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,840
Why are you eating so fast?

427
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,920
If you rush like that, you're gonna get a stomachache.

428
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,360
I’m just super hungry!

429
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,080
Finish chewing before you talk, man.

430
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:16,400
If I closed my eyes, I’d think I was eating with my dad — you nag just like him.

431
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:22,320
Well, maybe if you didn’t act like a kid, adults wouldn’t have to nag. Try listening for once.

432
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,040
Yesss sir, Grandpa.

433
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,840
Thanks a bunch.
