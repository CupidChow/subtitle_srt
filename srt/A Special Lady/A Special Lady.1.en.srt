1
00:00:55,934 --> 00:00:57,266
My apologies.

2
00:00:57,267 --> 00:00:59,475
We're fully booked today.

3
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,767
May I find you a room at a nearby hotel?

4
00:01:45,642 --> 00:01:47,975
Cork is set.

5
00:01:47,976 --> 00:01:50,182
Yes, he just entered into the parking.

6
00:01:50,183 --> 00:01:52,141
Mr. KIM is moving over the stairs.

7
00:01:52,142 --> 00:01:53,766
President LEE arrives in Ocean A.

8
00:01:53,767 --> 00:01:55,558
Samjin Construction's KIM has arrived.

9
00:01:55,559 --> 00:01:57,517
Cliff side, all rooms are ready.

10
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:01,954
Okay, Lara.

11
00:02:03,726 --> 00:02:05,350
He's early.

12
00:02:11,183 --> 00:02:13,601
Money Gate's PARK has arrived.

13
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:24,809
SH Refrigeration's NAM has arrived.

14
00:02:35,309 --> 00:02:37,950
District Attorney CHOI has not arrived.

15
00:02:37,975 --> 00:02:39,058
Please verify.

16
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:44,018
Mr. CHOI doesn't have
the time to be on time.

17
00:02:44,243 --> 00:02:46,448
He's a busy man.

18
00:02:52,592 --> 00:02:55,758
All rooms except 1309 are active.

19
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,259
I'll report when Mr. CHOI's
whereabouts are confirmed.

20
00:03:05,967 --> 00:03:09,383
Our long-awaited expansion
is finally coming to a finish.

21
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:37,051
What...

22
00:05:38,342 --> 00:05:39,634
Who are you?

23
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:45,342
Mr. LIM?

24
00:05:51,134 --> 00:05:53,134
Don't you have a meeting to get to?

25
00:05:53,884 --> 00:05:55,176
I'll keep this short.

26
00:06:02,092 --> 00:06:03,425
I hope it came out well.

27
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:10,926
Four minutes, thirty-three seconds...

28
00:06:35,425 --> 00:06:37,009
What do you want?

29
00:06:37,095 --> 00:06:40,650
During your company's workout crisis,
ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

30
00:06:40,675 --> 00:06:45,134
why do you think we helped
you unconditionally?

31
00:06:50,607 --> 00:06:53,275
JC Group doesn't give handouts.

32
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,383
You know that.

33
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,675
Just sign here.

34
00:06:58,438 --> 00:06:59,814
If I refuse?

35
00:07:18,334 --> 00:07:19,376
Mr. LIM!

36
00:07:19,428 --> 00:07:24,219
The concrete will dry in less than a day,

37
00:07:24,376 --> 00:07:27,293
- Get some more cement.
- Got it.

38
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,376
and tile work starts on Monday.

39
00:07:36,412 --> 00:07:40,370
You'll rest here in peace
for a good ten years.

40
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:42,547
I'll sign!

41
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:46,750
My wife will report me missing
by this time tomorrow!

42
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:51,334
And they'll track my
GPS to this location!

43
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,834
Listen carefully.

44
00:08:08,126 --> 00:08:11,709
My man will fly out tonight
with your passport.

45
00:08:12,042 --> 00:08:16,500
When she reports tomorrow,
she'll learn the truth,

46
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:20,917
that you fled to the Philippines
with a hot young secretary.

47
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,917
She'll see the video, too.

48
00:08:24,251 --> 00:08:28,749
The one of you screwing
that poor girl sideways.

49
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,084
Please don't!

50
00:08:32,418 --> 00:08:34,042
What the...!

51
00:08:37,449 --> 00:08:42,787
Don't make me cut you open, Dr. JANG.

52
00:08:43,084 --> 00:08:44,583
Hand it over.

53
00:08:44,834 --> 00:08:46,209
Go tell KIM!

54
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:53,666
Is this how he repays me for
saving his life on my table?!

55
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:55,126
Fuck that shit.

56
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,959
Take him to the farm.

57
00:09:07,376 --> 00:09:08,667
See you tomorrow.

58
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:10,209
Mr. LIM...

59
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,334
Mr. LIM!

60
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:24,167
Sorry I'm late.

61
00:09:26,084 --> 00:09:27,875
Was it all really necessary?

62
00:09:29,251 --> 00:09:31,167
- Sir?
- Please don't worry sir.

63
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:35,030
You know how long I've prepared for this.

64
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:37,291
And the DA?

65
00:09:37,292 --> 00:09:40,167
I'm meeting him at La
Tête for a briefing.

66
00:09:40,542 --> 00:09:44,001
And if Dr. JANG doesn't budge by tonight,

67
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,458
I'll take care of him quietly.

68
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:47,875
Give him more time.

69
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:50,333
How much?

70
00:09:50,334 --> 00:09:51,625
As much as he needs.

71
00:09:52,376 --> 00:09:56,126
He's saved many of our
men over the years.

72
00:09:57,084 --> 00:10:00,376
Let's try not to lose any more good men.

73
00:10:01,292 --> 00:10:02,334
Yes, sir.

74
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:11,042
Is all this necessary?

75
00:10:12,084 --> 00:10:15,376
Getting pictures taken
with big shot officials,

76
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:19,959
and giving scholarships to random kids...

77
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,834
You know that's how he
built up this business.

78
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,891
I do. I'm just saying.

79
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,084
Our men could use a little taking after.

80
00:10:36,917 --> 00:10:38,126
It must be hard.

81
00:10:38,797 --> 00:10:41,256
It's fine. I'll manage.

82
00:10:42,128 --> 00:10:45,128
You're the one dealing with
that damn district attorney.

83
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:54,334
I'm off.

84
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,469
You must not know me well.

85
00:11:13,851 --> 00:11:16,727
I drive a nine-year-old sedan.

86
00:11:18,334 --> 00:11:21,917
I recently got married in
these beat-up shoes.

87
00:11:22,576 --> 00:11:24,576
No time to buy a new pair.

88
00:11:24,887 --> 00:11:26,721
That's not integrity.

89
00:11:27,326 --> 00:11:29,326
That's just being sloppy.

90
00:11:29,492 --> 00:11:30,700
But I know you.

91
00:11:31,117 --> 00:11:34,658
You force loans on companies
and bankrupt them,

92
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:38,325
only to make profit through
a debt-equity swap.

93
00:11:38,326 --> 00:11:41,117
We've also been known to
revive failing companies.

94
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,034
Money has its roots.

95
00:11:43,326 --> 00:11:45,533
If you plant black money,
you get a black forest.

96
00:11:45,534 --> 00:11:47,326
I can't let that happen.

97
00:11:48,825 --> 00:11:50,159
Enough with this.

98
00:11:51,451 --> 00:11:53,866
I can't be bought and I don't negotiate.

99
00:11:53,867 --> 00:11:55,075
I'm gonna smoke.

100
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,659
The harder you try, the
bigger the consequences.

101
00:12:03,742 --> 00:12:05,909
Songka Hotel, Room 1309.

102
00:12:07,783 --> 00:12:10,326
I understand you married
your chief's daughter.

103
00:12:11,117 --> 00:12:13,659
This isn't a buy off or a negotiation.

104
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,802
This is blackmail.

105
00:12:17,224 --> 00:12:19,057
Stop sniffling around.

106
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:22,534
WEI

107
00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:27,074
The number you have
dialed is not in service.

108
00:12:27,075 --> 00:12:28,242
Yes, Chief.

109
00:12:28,783 --> 00:12:30,534
We got back from our honeymoon.

110
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,783
Yes, father-in-law.

111
00:12:34,242 --> 00:12:36,242
I'll make your daughter happy, sir.

112
00:12:37,242 --> 00:12:39,242
Yes, sir. Good night.

113
00:12:43,742 --> 00:12:45,367
How much?

114
00:12:52,201 --> 00:12:53,699
Fucking bitch...

115
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,367
Buddy, buddy! Hey!

116
00:12:56,117 --> 00:12:57,409
Give her a break.

117
00:12:57,479 --> 00:12:59,486
She's on her knees begging...

118
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:03,833
Fuck off before you get a real beating.

119
00:13:05,783 --> 00:13:08,117
You just hit a district attorney.

120
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,500
Buddy.

121
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,190
Want to come with me?

122
00:13:15,017 --> 00:13:16,994
I'm sorry...

123
00:13:26,618 --> 00:13:27,618
Mister...

124
00:13:29,825 --> 00:13:34,032
Could you walk me to the subway station?

125
00:13:47,163 --> 00:13:49,996
Okay... let's see.

126
00:13:52,067 --> 00:13:56,317
All your hard work and effort
made this expansion possible.

127
00:13:57,359 --> 00:14:01,067
JC Group will now grow into
a legitimate corporation.

128
00:14:02,015 --> 00:14:06,139
All thanks to your consent
to restructuring our territories.

129
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:10,012
The reorganization went smoothly...

130
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:13,442
A board meeting, I see.

131
00:14:14,526 --> 00:14:18,275
You're restructuring Seoul
and leaving out GM Industries?

132
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:23,150
GM belongs in Incheon, as it always has.

133
00:14:23,692 --> 00:14:26,734
We've been running Western
Seoul for decades.

134
00:14:27,983 --> 00:14:29,899
Although I'll let the YDP district slide.

135
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,776
Don't bring up the YDP!

136
00:14:33,192 --> 00:14:35,442
That's why we're restructuring
the territories...

137
00:14:36,526 --> 00:14:38,359
This is our main business.

138
00:14:39,734 --> 00:14:43,401
We've been overstocked since
our Western lines were cut off.

139
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,192
My boys might get restless
if this keeps up.

140
00:14:48,776 --> 00:14:53,234
Restore our distribution channel,
or take the stock off our hands.

141
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,776
I've sent the proposal to Mr. LIM.

142
00:14:57,317 --> 00:14:58,818
He was into the idea.

143
00:15:16,484 --> 00:15:18,776
Have you received a proposal from GM?

144
00:15:21,025 --> 00:15:22,484
Yes, I've read it over.

145
00:15:23,192 --> 00:15:25,067
I've been meaning to brief you...

146
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:28,275
Profit split is reasonable.

147
00:15:28,484 --> 00:15:29,484
And?

148
00:15:29,567 --> 00:15:33,109
We shouldn't exclude
this product forever...

149
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:40,526
I've said it before.

150
00:15:41,025 --> 00:15:43,983
Once you start in guns and
drugs, there's no turning back.

151
00:15:51,526 --> 00:15:55,859
Our organization does not
deal in guns and drugs.

152
00:15:57,818 --> 00:16:01,983
This principle is what
brought us this far.

153
00:16:03,317 --> 00:16:04,317
Got it?

154
00:16:08,025 --> 00:16:09,109
Remember.

155
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,668
Your territory stops in Incheon.

156
00:16:13,908 --> 00:16:15,449
Thank your father for that.

157
00:16:16,234 --> 00:16:17,900
Brings back memories.

158
00:16:26,091 --> 00:16:27,715
Twenty years ago,

159
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:33,667
when I begged you not to take my eye,

160
00:16:35,025 --> 00:16:36,818
you refused without hesitation.

161
00:16:47,192 --> 00:16:49,651
This is goddamn embarrassing.

162
00:16:51,254 --> 00:16:53,379
Incheon boys play dirty.

163
00:16:53,976 --> 00:16:56,476
He just doesn't want you to get mixed up.

164
00:17:05,851 --> 00:17:06,934
Still using it?

165
00:17:08,517 --> 00:17:09,559
It's pretty.

166
00:17:13,267 --> 00:17:16,350
Painkillers aren't candy. Cut it down.

167
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:27,934
How about it?

168
00:17:28,892 --> 00:17:30,183
Let's go for a drive.

169
00:17:31,934 --> 00:17:33,225
I'm still on the clock.

170
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:40,018
Fine.

171
00:17:41,809 --> 00:17:42,809
See you.

172
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:53,559
Will you come if I wait?

173
00:17:54,267 --> 00:17:56,350
Just bring me Dr. JANG's contract.

174
00:17:59,142 --> 00:18:01,434
She never looks back.

175
00:18:19,851 --> 00:18:20,934
Chilly, eh?

176
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,018
Drink up.

177
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:29,309
Try some of that.

178
00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:47,475
I'll free you so you can
sign the agreement.

179
00:18:47,934 --> 00:18:54,767
We'll get you a hot shower
and some warm clothes,

180
00:18:56,726 --> 00:19:00,350
and we'll talk about the
good old days over a drink.

181
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:03,392
You'll grow old and die in time anyway.

182
00:19:04,517 --> 00:19:07,517
I'd rather not bury you
with my own hands.

183
00:19:12,142 --> 00:19:13,267
Mr. LIM.

184
00:19:14,726 --> 00:19:15,726
Yes?

185
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,559
Fuck you.

186
00:19:22,142 --> 00:19:26,350
You can't even kill me
without permission.

187
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:32,309
You think doing his dirty work
makes you a big shot?

188
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,767
You know what KIM is like.

189
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:40,018
You think he'll take care of you?

190
00:19:40,392 --> 00:19:42,934
I've watched for twenty years.

191
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:48,142
His right-hand men, idiots like you...

192
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:03,767
It's all here.

193
00:20:20,392 --> 00:20:21,726
Ju-hwan is coming.

194
00:20:23,642 --> 00:20:25,642
He got into trouble again.

195
00:20:26,548 --> 00:20:29,548
Another expulsion means
he's done in Singapore.

196
00:20:30,467 --> 00:20:32,467
I can find him another school,

197
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,176
but I keep having this thought.

198
00:20:38,092 --> 00:20:40,425
Maybe it's time to keep him here.

199
00:20:42,051 --> 00:20:43,717
We've come a long way.

200
00:20:45,176 --> 00:20:49,425
Once the hospital deal is done,
I want a normal life.

201
00:20:51,592 --> 00:20:56,759
I know how hard you tried
to keep him from harm.

202
00:20:58,176 --> 00:21:00,051
Twenty years apart is long enough.

203
00:21:02,467 --> 00:21:04,134
You've both waited long enough.

204
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,550
Which one looks better?

205
00:21:12,467 --> 00:21:14,634
I'd like to get your opinion.

206
00:21:16,801 --> 00:21:18,801
I like this one.

207
00:21:24,009 --> 00:21:26,466
I'll wrap up Dr. JANG tonight.

208
00:21:26,467 --> 00:21:29,842
How long have we known each other?

209
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:36,176
Over ten years since our
orphanage days, sir.

210
00:21:40,051 --> 00:21:41,051
You okay?

211
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:42,383
Your head.

212
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,383
Of course.

213
00:21:45,967 --> 00:21:47,592
Shall I wrap this for you?

214
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:51,801
No, I'll take the other.

215
00:22:00,634 --> 00:22:02,134
I was for real.

216
00:22:03,051 --> 00:22:04,717
My feelings for you were real.

217
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:11,259
Sang-hoon!

218
00:22:14,383 --> 00:22:17,549
You know I hate meeting
clients after the job!

219
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,801
Shut the door.

220
00:22:19,342 --> 00:22:21,342
I only came to see you!

221
00:22:22,218 --> 00:22:23,634
I said, shut it!

222
00:22:30,843 --> 00:22:31,843
This is NA Hyun-jung.

223
00:22:31,866 --> 00:22:33,427
Give me a few days.

224
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:36,452
It'll take some time to
bury this investigation.

225
00:22:36,842 --> 00:22:38,342
Whatever you like.

226
00:22:41,717 --> 00:22:42,717
Jesus...

227
00:22:44,134 --> 00:22:45,176
Good work.

228
00:22:46,967 --> 00:22:49,926
What's with you again?

229
00:22:51,092 --> 00:22:53,300
I'm exhausted. Go on home.

230
00:22:57,946 --> 00:22:59,892
Wei.

231
00:23:02,259 --> 00:23:05,051
You know how pretty you are.

232
00:23:07,974 --> 00:23:11,891
Men get boners like teenagers
when they see you.

233
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:14,425
But leave me out of it.

234
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:18,383
I'm just not into young girls.
It's a condition.

235
00:23:21,383 --> 00:23:23,383
- Stop it.
- Baby.

236
00:23:24,238 --> 00:23:26,612
That's because you never had me.

237
00:23:27,176 --> 00:23:29,801
You'll be hooked once you've had a taste.

238
00:23:30,717 --> 00:23:32,758
Why else would I get five grand a night?

239
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:34,967
I don't fucking care why.

240
00:23:36,342 --> 00:23:37,550
I'll make you go nuts.

241
00:23:37,926 --> 00:23:39,759
Jesus, you're driving me nuts!

242
00:23:45,719 --> 00:23:47,344
Wait, are you into guys?

243
00:23:55,926 --> 00:23:56,926
Shit...

244
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,467
Mi-ok?

245
00:23:59,967 --> 00:24:01,425
Whose name is that?

246
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,646
Who the hell is she?

247
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,300
Goddamn rain...

248
00:24:25,926 --> 00:24:27,050
Hello?

249
00:24:27,051 --> 00:24:28,341
Good evening.

250
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:30,342
I'm JC Group's secretary NA Hyun-jung.

251
00:24:30,926 --> 00:24:32,926
I'm calling to inform you
about your flight.

252
00:24:33,717 --> 00:24:38,509
Incheon-bound KE 695 departs at 7:40 a.m.

253
00:24:38,842 --> 00:24:42,051
It'll touch down in Korea at 1:50 p.m.

254
00:24:42,634 --> 00:24:47,051
Mr. KIM has an urgent meeting,
so I'll be picking you up.

255
00:24:47,284 --> 00:24:49,284
No, don't come.

256
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:51,167
I'm not a kid.

257
00:24:52,459 --> 00:24:54,418
Should I call back tomorrow?

258
00:24:54,542 --> 00:24:56,834
No, just let me sleep.

259
00:25:08,917 --> 00:25:10,709
Nothing to wear...

260
00:25:24,042 --> 00:25:26,084
He's got a girl he likes.

261
00:25:26,917 --> 00:25:30,084
He has a huge scar with
her name tattooed on it.

262
00:25:31,149 --> 00:25:33,606
I've been asking around,

263
00:25:33,754 --> 00:25:36,338
and he's had that tattoo for a long time.

264
00:25:37,376 --> 00:25:39,709
For at least ten years.

265
00:25:40,376 --> 00:25:43,084
And the scar wasn't
stitched up by a doctor.

266
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:47,167
It must've been her. I can sense it.

267
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:49,667
How long have you worked for me?

268
00:25:50,042 --> 00:25:53,084
Since I slit my wrist
after the abortion, so...

269
00:25:55,209 --> 00:25:56,334
Seven years?

270
00:25:57,459 --> 00:25:59,166
What did I tell you then?

271
00:25:59,167 --> 00:26:02,792
If I have the guts to hang
myself, I can do anything

272
00:26:03,917 --> 00:26:06,917
And that I'd become the
best if I follow you.

273
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,376
But that you had to quit
when I tell you to quit.

274
00:26:13,583 --> 00:26:15,611
It's time for you to quit.

275
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:18,500
Did I do something wrong?

276
00:26:19,096 --> 00:26:21,263
I've been saving up under your name.

277
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:25,459
I can't offer you much, but
it's enough for severance.

278
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,042
Haven't I worked hard?

279
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,874
I learned a lot and tried...

280
00:26:30,875 --> 00:26:32,667
You haven't learned!

281
00:26:33,438 --> 00:26:35,770
You still pick the worst men.

282
00:26:40,334 --> 00:26:43,834
You wanted to have children.
To settle down.

283
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,418
Can LIM give that to you?

284
00:26:48,334 --> 00:26:51,334
He could get stabbed and
disappear in a blink.

285
00:26:53,135 --> 00:26:55,437
Take the offer and walk away.

286
00:26:57,822 --> 00:26:59,947
- If I don't?
- Then you're fired.

287
00:27:02,459 --> 00:27:04,709
Once I take care of you and Madame KIM,

288
00:27:08,643 --> 00:27:10,018
I'll retire too.

289
00:27:18,376 --> 00:27:20,084
Stop, stop!

290
00:27:21,745 --> 00:27:22,870
Hey! Stop!

291
00:27:36,334 --> 00:27:37,959
Mr. LIM.

292
00:27:39,292 --> 00:27:41,834
You know you can't climb any higher.

293
00:27:43,167 --> 00:27:48,418
Anything deemed profitable by JC Group

294
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:52,376
is set aside for KIM Ju-hwan.

295
00:27:53,126 --> 00:27:55,459
KIM's son is being groomed.

296
00:27:58,117 --> 00:28:01,742
If your boss dies, Ju-hwan
is the heir apparent.

297
00:28:01,909 --> 00:28:03,284
But what about you?

298
00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:06,783
NA Hyun-jung is his mother, so she's set.

299
00:28:19,367 --> 00:28:20,367
Yes?

300
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:25,783
You didn't know she was Ju-hwan's mother?

301
00:28:28,201 --> 00:28:30,117
You were in jail then.

302
00:28:31,492 --> 00:28:34,534
The district wars between
Incheon and Seoul.

303
00:28:35,284 --> 00:28:37,159
Went on for a year and a half.

304
00:28:38,242 --> 00:28:43,782
Those Incheon boys killed
KIM's wife and son.

305
00:28:43,783 --> 00:28:46,409
They really went all out.

306
00:28:49,742 --> 00:28:51,409
So NA went in to settle the score.

307
00:28:53,492 --> 00:28:58,159
Killed the Incheon boss
and brought the son to KIM.

308
00:28:58,783 --> 00:29:01,242
Took the fall for everything
and went to jail.

309
00:29:03,201 --> 00:29:05,742
But why did she go so willingly?

310
00:29:06,326 --> 00:29:08,451
She was pregnant with KIM's child.

311
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:13,750
Jail was the safest place
she could give birth.

312
00:29:15,492 --> 00:29:17,284
To this day, no one knows.

313
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:22,451
You really didn't know?

314
00:29:24,284 --> 00:29:26,700
You sure you can trust KIM?

315
00:30:03,326 --> 00:30:04,092
KIM JUNG-HWAN MEMORIAL

316
00:30:04,117 --> 00:30:07,284
You're older than your brother now.

317
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:11,903
If you fight again,
no more school for you.

318
00:30:12,742 --> 00:30:14,992
If you never learn to restrain yourself,

319
00:30:16,727 --> 00:30:18,059
there's no point in learning.

320
00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:20,074
What if someone hits me first?

321
00:30:20,075 --> 00:30:21,075
Dodge it.

322
00:30:21,104 --> 00:30:22,879
Then I'd be a loser.

323
00:30:23,284 --> 00:30:24,284
Then lose.

324
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:26,159
And you?

325
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:29,618
Why ask me to do something
you can't even do yourself?

326
00:30:35,663 --> 00:30:38,705
Why did that woman accompany us?

327
00:30:41,409 --> 00:30:44,576
Even if she's your lover,
you should've asked me.

328
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:09,116
Get in, it's a long walk.

329
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,534
Uncle Sang-hoon will take me.

330
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:44,284
Isn't it hard?

331
00:31:47,284 --> 00:31:48,950
Bringing plants back to life.

332
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,284
Whatever I touch tend to die.

333
00:31:54,401 --> 00:31:57,401
That won't happen, you love this one.

334
00:31:58,484 --> 00:32:00,776
Give it water and pay attention.

335
00:33:30,983 --> 00:33:32,983
I thought we could chat privately.

336
00:33:37,695 --> 00:33:41,317
The boss is cosplaying a businessman,

337
00:33:42,317 --> 00:33:44,067
so he only dines with the big wigs.

338
00:33:45,651 --> 00:33:49,150
My boys and I must stink
like dog shit to avoid us.

339
00:33:49,291 --> 00:33:52,166
At least the big wigs don't
pull out knives during meals.

340
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:58,401
What the fuck is wrong with that?

341
00:33:59,275 --> 00:34:00,983
LIM Sang-hoon, get it together.

342
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,775
How long will you live like this?

343
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:05,799
Why? Do I embarrass you?

344
00:34:10,067 --> 00:34:12,484
Is that why you never
told me about Ju-hwan?

345
00:34:15,442 --> 00:34:19,692
And now you want to lead a proper life?

346
00:34:22,384 --> 00:34:24,051
Very nice, Ms. NA.

347
00:34:29,616 --> 00:34:32,657
Have breakfast with Je-chul,

348
00:34:35,183 --> 00:34:37,183
water the garden in the afternoon,

349
00:34:38,475 --> 00:34:40,183
and spread your legs at night.

350
00:34:44,642 --> 00:34:46,225
Don't you have any dreams?

351
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:50,183
How long will you swing
knives before you drop dead?

352
00:34:54,267 --> 00:34:55,767
Fuck dreams.

353
00:34:59,934 --> 00:35:02,142
When will I drop dead?

354
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:04,267
Why not?

355
00:35:08,225 --> 00:35:09,350
Remember this?

356
00:35:11,059 --> 00:35:13,434
The first time I got stabbed,

357
00:35:14,892 --> 00:35:18,059
it was the first time I killed,
who gave me the knife?

358
00:35:19,309 --> 00:35:20,309
It was you.

359
00:35:21,517 --> 00:35:25,726
Whenever there was a big job,
I put on the flashiest clothes.

360
00:35:27,976 --> 00:35:34,225
Because whenever I got
stabbed, you came to see me.

361
00:35:37,392 --> 00:35:39,392
I trusted you to do that,

362
00:35:41,183 --> 00:35:45,018
so I hacked and slashed
just knowing that,

363
00:35:46,726 --> 00:35:48,601
and kept swinging.

364
00:35:51,225 --> 00:35:54,767
What was I thinking?

365
00:35:55,892 --> 00:35:57,892
I feel like a fucking loser lately.

366
00:35:59,684 --> 00:36:04,183
Why does that fucking DA
know something I don't?

367
00:36:05,684 --> 00:36:07,976
Is this all I am to you?

368
00:36:09,809 --> 00:36:10,809
Dreams?

369
00:36:14,056 --> 00:36:16,347
What else do I need besides you?

370
00:36:47,976 --> 00:36:48,976
Take it.

371
00:36:50,889 --> 00:36:52,138
What are you doing?

372
00:36:53,949 --> 00:36:55,598
I said take it.

373
00:36:56,595 --> 00:36:58,054
Goddamn trash.

374
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:07,059
Hey!

375
00:37:08,934 --> 00:37:10,934
In the end, we're both trash.

376
00:37:46,225 --> 00:37:49,142
So I can't do shit without permission?

377
00:37:51,142 --> 00:37:53,018
Whose permission, fucker?

378
00:38:34,234 --> 00:38:35,917
Mr. CHOI?

379
00:38:35,942 --> 00:38:37,400
It's LIM Sang-hoon.

380
00:38:48,692 --> 00:38:51,609
JC Group / GM Industries
Investment Proposal

381
00:38:57,692 --> 00:39:01,234
Don't look at it on an emotional level,

382
00:39:01,734 --> 00:39:03,817
read it as business possibility.

383
00:39:05,151 --> 00:39:08,276
All distribution processes
are quite transparent.

384
00:39:08,692 --> 00:39:11,524
- With an open mind...
- Go play somewhere else.

385
00:39:11,525 --> 00:39:13,525
You're out of your league.

386
00:39:21,483 --> 00:39:23,192
Do you still think

387
00:39:24,026 --> 00:39:26,483
we're even for killing my father,

388
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,609
when you served time in jail?

389
00:39:30,984 --> 00:39:36,942
His life was for my boss' son's life,

390
00:39:38,318 --> 00:39:42,359
and my jail time was for your eye.

391
00:39:43,442 --> 00:39:47,734
You're a glorified pimp,
don't pretend not to be.

392
00:39:48,442 --> 00:39:49,817
Doesn't suit you.

393
00:40:05,442 --> 00:40:07,442
Why didn't you bring out the tea?

394
00:40:08,817 --> 00:40:09,942
He's still a guest.

395
00:40:15,817 --> 00:40:16,817
I'm off.

396
00:40:28,791 --> 00:40:32,375
Close down La Tête indefinitely,
and freeze the funds.

397
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,816
And get double approval
for any major decisions.

398
00:40:34,817 --> 00:40:37,359
Put together an exit
route, and have it ready.

399
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:38,609
For 3 people.

400
00:40:48,234 --> 00:40:49,984
Our preparation is complete.

401
00:40:50,442 --> 00:40:51,775
We move in an hour.

402
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:55,067
You're quick, just as I heard.

403
00:40:55,837 --> 00:40:57,837
I thought it'd take you at least 2 hours.

404
00:40:58,609 --> 00:41:00,692
Are the Incheon boys just as fast?

405
00:41:01,734 --> 00:41:05,318
They do anything to settle
the territory and money.

406
00:41:05,518 --> 00:41:06,559
Don't you worry.

407
00:41:07,725 --> 00:41:09,059
He's in a meeting.

408
00:41:10,017 --> 00:41:13,725
I know the board's secrets,
their mouths are sealed.

409
00:41:14,975 --> 00:41:17,725
As we agreed,
I'll take care of the boss,

410
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:21,767
and I take over JC, La
Tête and our assets.

411
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,725
JC is yours, in addition,

412
00:41:26,392 --> 00:41:30,767
I'll bury the murders of
Dr. JANG and CEOs.

413
00:41:31,142 --> 00:41:34,599
But I want NA Hyun-jung, and La Tête,

414
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,683
including videos, files,
and clientele lists.

415
00:41:38,809 --> 00:41:42,017
Send the Incheon boys and
get NA no matter what.

416
00:41:49,059 --> 00:41:50,559
According to our lawyer,

417
00:41:51,267 --> 00:41:54,725
seizure is just part
of the investigation.

418
00:41:55,226 --> 00:41:56,351
I'll meet him.

419
00:41:58,017 --> 00:42:01,017
We have leverage over CHOI.

420
00:42:02,101 --> 00:42:06,642
We prepared enough, I'll meet him myself.

421
00:42:09,725 --> 00:42:11,351
You'll have to be careful.

422
00:42:12,184 --> 00:42:13,226
Our...

423
00:42:14,683 --> 00:42:17,017
business expansion isn't finalized,

424
00:42:18,017 --> 00:42:21,101
so there may be some internal conflict.

425
00:42:21,767 --> 00:42:22,850
What do you mean?

426
00:42:24,184 --> 00:42:25,351
For example,

427
00:42:26,642 --> 00:42:29,600
LIM may feel wronged
for not receiving his due.

428
00:42:32,767 --> 00:42:35,226
He's been holding back a lot.

429
00:42:36,059 --> 00:42:41,642
He could be a huge liability,
you should calm him.

430
00:42:49,476 --> 00:42:51,308
I heard about your sister's wedding.

431
00:42:51,309 --> 00:42:52,641
You didn't need to...

432
00:42:52,642 --> 00:42:54,642
I know you're doing your job really well,

433
00:42:55,975 --> 00:42:58,059
but don't let anyone
come close to the boss.

434
00:42:59,226 --> 00:43:01,683
Have a car follow him wherever he goes.

435
00:43:10,226 --> 00:43:11,226
Yes?

436
00:43:12,975 --> 00:43:14,142
La Tête?

437
00:43:20,184 --> 00:43:21,351
Where is it?

438
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:41,725
Where is it?

439
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:50,142
Tell me.

440
00:43:51,642 --> 00:43:53,017
Our little video.

441
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:56,975
Did it feel good to fake it?

442
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:06,817
Did it?

443
00:44:10,059 --> 00:44:11,295
Come to him?

444
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,944
He wants you to come
see him at his hotel.

445
00:44:14,642 --> 00:44:16,267
He looked quite upset.

446
00:44:17,059 --> 00:44:18,267
How should I proceed?

447
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,517
CHOI directly came into La Tête.

448
00:44:27,518 --> 00:44:29,600
Don't go, sir, this feels all wrong.

449
00:44:32,759 --> 00:44:36,218
CHOI must have something up his sleeve.

450
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:40,862
Stop bowling so late and
come home early, Ju-hwan.

451
00:44:42,535 --> 00:44:45,452
Is LIM there now?

452
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:47,017
Yes.

453
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:49,559
I'll call you from the road.

454
00:45:05,101 --> 00:45:06,892
- Sang-hoon.
- Yes, sir?

455
00:45:07,934 --> 00:45:10,518
How long have we worked together?

456
00:45:14,476 --> 00:45:17,559
You asked me that not too long ago.

457
00:45:25,226 --> 00:45:26,476
Let's go then.

458
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:29,434
This isn't something I can avoid.

459
00:45:46,186 --> 00:45:48,520
Listen carefully, this
is extremely crucial.

460
00:45:48,809 --> 00:45:52,184
There's a walk-in closet
in the master bedroom.

461
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,216
Winter clothes are hung there.

462
00:45:54,217 --> 00:45:56,467
Behind it is a steel door.

463
00:45:56,551 --> 00:46:00,259
It's a safe room, no
one can get you there.

464
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:04,467
If something happens, go straight there.

465
00:46:05,509 --> 00:46:06,925
Do you understand?

466
00:46:09,023 --> 00:46:10,881
Address and passcode.

467
00:46:11,365 --> 00:46:12,907
The code is my birthday?

468
00:46:20,592 --> 00:46:22,592
Promise me you'll do this.

469
00:46:25,259 --> 00:46:28,633
So you used the time I
gave you to tie my noose?

470
00:46:28,634 --> 00:46:31,341
What was I to do? I was cornered.

471
00:46:31,342 --> 00:46:33,175
How far have you gone with Mr. LIM?

472
00:46:33,384 --> 00:46:35,134
To the point of no return.

473
00:46:39,883 --> 00:46:42,509
Did you see the sex tape?
It'll be a big hit.

474
00:46:44,509 --> 00:46:47,967
You think JC will exist
after bringing down a DA?

475
00:46:48,759 --> 00:46:50,882
So, should I release it?

476
00:46:50,883 --> 00:46:54,384
The date could make it or break it.

477
00:46:55,759 --> 00:46:58,134
But now might not be the right time.

478
00:47:16,551 --> 00:47:17,551
Alright, listen.

479
00:47:18,467 --> 00:47:19,759
Alright, lady.

480
00:47:21,676 --> 00:47:25,134
Would you like the privilege
of a beating like her?

481
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,842
Please call me Madame KIM.

482
00:47:31,092 --> 00:47:33,301
Be satisfied with just
one slap in the face.

483
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:37,592
NA Hyun-jung, I mean NA Mi-ok is done.

484
00:47:37,925 --> 00:47:39,551
Help yourself.

485
00:47:39,967 --> 00:47:44,676
I'm bound to her with
my debt, not loyalty.

486
00:47:45,217 --> 00:47:48,384
Should I send you to a hotel?
The state-run hotel?

487
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,817
There's no hot water,
so it could be a nuisance.

488
00:47:51,842 --> 00:47:53,383
Come on now.

489
00:47:53,384 --> 00:47:57,883
Do you think she trusted us
with files to hand over to you?

490
00:47:59,461 --> 00:48:02,086
Don't underestimate NA Mi-ok.

491
00:48:15,925 --> 00:48:20,509
The phone is turned off,
please leave a message...

492
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:43,833
Give me your phone.

493
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:00,800
I'm sorry...

494
00:49:46,418 --> 00:49:49,084
Turn right under the Pyungchon bridge.

495
00:50:01,851 --> 00:50:03,142
You okay, boss?

496
00:50:09,726 --> 00:50:12,475
What did you do to my driver?

497
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:14,934
We took his sister.

498
00:50:16,976 --> 00:50:18,601
Worry about yourself.

499
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:31,517
Cutting which part first

500
00:50:33,018 --> 00:50:34,809
would make me feel better?

501
00:50:38,892 --> 00:50:39,892
Here?

502
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:42,350
Or here?

503
00:50:43,443 --> 00:50:47,902
LIM could completely flip out.

504
00:50:48,142 --> 00:50:49,266
If she's harmed.

505
00:50:49,267 --> 00:50:52,059
It's easier to ask for
forgiveness than for permission.

506
00:50:52,434 --> 00:50:53,601
Forgiveness...

507
00:50:56,225 --> 00:51:01,851
will be given to us by the
district attorney, okay?

508
00:51:04,684 --> 00:51:08,642
An eye for an eye.

509
00:51:09,851 --> 00:51:13,392
Let's call it even, for
my father and my eye.

510
00:51:14,601 --> 00:51:15,601
Fuck...

511
00:51:43,409 --> 00:51:44,993
Drag him out.

512
00:52:08,851 --> 00:52:10,559
What're you gonna do now?

513
00:52:20,018 --> 00:52:22,819
I moved the boss to the farm.

514
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:27,392
I'll come back afterwards.

515
00:52:46,726 --> 00:52:49,851
Bury me,
if you want to end this.

516
00:52:50,605 --> 00:52:52,438
You know everything.

517
00:52:52,809 --> 00:52:53,851
Need money?

518
00:52:54,851 --> 00:52:58,267
Or something I can do?

519
00:53:00,018 --> 00:53:02,767
Do you still think you can
win if we go one-on-one?

520
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,176
Winner takes all.

521
00:53:20,425 --> 00:53:22,467
The dead don't come back,

522
00:53:24,092 --> 00:53:26,092
and the cripples are crippled for life.

523
00:53:27,759 --> 00:53:29,675
It's all over for me.

524
00:53:31,592 --> 00:53:32,592
What?

525
00:53:33,176 --> 00:53:34,342
Already giving up?

526
00:53:38,842 --> 00:53:39,926
Take the knife.

527
00:53:45,218 --> 00:53:47,218
Take it, motherfucker!

528
00:53:50,425 --> 00:53:52,425
Come at me, son of a bitch!

529
00:53:55,009 --> 00:53:58,966
Don't pretend to be high and mighty!

530
00:53:58,967 --> 00:54:00,800
Let's settle this, asshole!

531
00:54:00,801 --> 00:54:04,300
Sang-hoon! You like Hyun-jung, right?

532
00:54:06,967 --> 00:54:09,134
You mustn't try to possess
someone you like.

533
00:54:10,509 --> 00:54:14,009
Just protect what she deems important.

534
00:54:16,592 --> 00:54:17,675
You can't...

535
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:23,801
try to be the most important person

536
00:54:26,425 --> 00:54:28,051
in her life, asshole.

537
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:34,218
What's that got to do with me?

538
00:54:34,717 --> 00:54:38,218
Ju-hwan is her child, you know that.

539
00:54:41,259 --> 00:54:43,300
Killing me is enough!

540
00:54:46,342 --> 00:54:48,009
Can you be happy with that?

541
00:55:10,967 --> 00:55:12,176
What's up?

542
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,509
Who gave that to you?

543
00:55:41,779 --> 00:55:45,321
That boring ass DA, of course.

544
00:55:58,259 --> 00:55:59,842
Your real name is...

545
00:56:04,129 --> 00:56:05,587
Mi-ok?

546
00:56:06,675 --> 00:56:07,675
No.

547
00:56:09,176 --> 00:56:11,009
Mi-ok died a long time ago.

548
00:56:31,717 --> 00:56:34,549
Hey! Open up!

549
00:56:34,550 --> 00:56:37,591
No choice but to retire!
Don't forget my severance!

550
00:56:37,592 --> 00:56:41,009
If I die here, ask Madam
for your severance.

551
00:56:41,634 --> 00:56:43,634
Tell her you know all about it.

552
00:57:26,902 --> 00:57:28,111
What the fuck...!

553
00:57:32,817 --> 00:57:33,900
Take her!

554
00:57:34,725 --> 00:57:35,892
Go get her.

555
00:57:39,351 --> 00:57:40,850
Go get her.

556
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,059
Go get her.

557
00:58:26,767 --> 00:58:28,392
Hyun-jung!

558
00:59:03,477 --> 00:59:05,252
Hyun-jung...

559
00:59:08,226 --> 00:59:12,767
Don't fight with Sang-hoon...

560
00:59:16,145 --> 00:59:18,478
I don't like it when you two fight.

561
00:59:56,142 --> 00:59:58,184
What's this? You said you had NA.

562
00:59:59,351 --> 01:00:01,434
You called me here to show me her body?

563
01:00:13,975 --> 01:00:15,392
KIM's funeral first.

564
01:00:16,184 --> 01:00:18,029
Don't touch me.

565
01:00:24,226 --> 01:00:26,226
Bark when I tell you to bark.

566
01:00:27,598 --> 01:00:29,598
Fetch me my sex tape.

567
01:00:31,059 --> 01:00:32,683
Fucking gangsters.

568
01:00:51,975 --> 01:00:55,351
Delete

569
01:00:55,759 --> 01:00:57,297
Fucking bitch...

570
01:01:13,017 --> 01:01:15,017
Sure, I'll bark.

571
01:01:55,600 --> 01:02:00,975
CHOI has LIM on a noose because
he hasn't found the video.

572
01:02:02,306 --> 01:02:05,640
They're going nuts trying to find you.

573
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:11,460
Eat and get better.

574
01:02:19,476 --> 01:02:21,226
Snap out of it.

575
01:02:24,351 --> 01:02:26,351
Please snap out of it...

576
01:02:27,559 --> 01:02:29,559
And Ju-hwan will do so too...

577
01:03:01,725 --> 01:03:02,725
Sir.

578
01:03:02,966 --> 01:03:04,508
Ju-hwan's here.

579
01:03:21,518 --> 01:03:22,642
Ju-hwan?

580
01:03:26,179 --> 01:03:27,637
You don't know me.

581
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:37,925
What's up?

582
01:03:40,259 --> 01:03:41,384
It's starting.

583
01:03:43,925 --> 01:03:45,175
Uncle.

584
01:03:46,883 --> 01:03:51,009
If dad didn't die of hemorrhage,

585
01:03:52,509 --> 01:03:55,759
and someone killed him, what do I do?

586
01:03:58,301 --> 01:03:59,883
What would you do?

587
01:04:13,628 --> 01:04:15,426
Get revenge.

588
01:04:42,259 --> 01:04:45,008
The prosecution is investigating
the cause of your father's death

589
01:04:45,009 --> 01:04:47,925
as a homicide, and not hemorrhage.

590
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:51,675
Killed by someone who
wants to take over JC.

591
01:04:51,676 --> 01:04:54,092
Listen carefully, this
is extremely crucial.

592
01:04:54,967 --> 01:04:56,550
Go to this address.

593
01:04:56,551 --> 01:05:00,634
In the master bedroom, winter
clothes are hung there.

594
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:03,050
Behind it is a steel door.

595
01:05:03,426 --> 01:05:04,925
It's a safe room, you know?

596
01:05:08,718 --> 01:05:13,800
We looked into who could do so
when you and your father's gone.

597
01:05:14,692 --> 01:05:18,442
And the one who knows
all of JC's secrets.

598
01:05:19,109 --> 01:05:20,609
Who could it be?

599
01:05:23,275 --> 01:05:26,692
JC Group is currently being
investigated by the prosecutors.

600
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:31,650
The prosecution believes that
vital pieces of evidence

601
01:05:31,651 --> 01:05:35,359
were stolen by secretary NA Hyun-jung.

602
01:05:36,067 --> 01:05:40,608
The boat leaves in 2 days,
at 6 o'clock from Gungpyeong.

603
01:05:40,609 --> 01:05:42,401
Go with Ju-hwan.

604
01:05:48,442 --> 01:05:50,442
Former head secretary
NA Hyun-jung.

605
01:05:51,609 --> 01:05:53,942
She's the one who killed him.

606
01:05:54,776 --> 01:05:59,734
If something happens,
go straight there.

607
01:06:06,859 --> 01:06:07,942
Hello?

608
01:06:16,734 --> 01:06:17,859
Ju-hwan?

609
01:06:19,609 --> 01:06:21,983
- Ju-hwan?
- Ms. NA.

610
01:06:40,234 --> 01:06:41,651
Is it true?

611
01:06:44,765 --> 01:06:46,876
Did you kill dad?

612
01:06:48,249 --> 01:06:49,874
What?

613
01:06:50,995 --> 01:06:52,661
Did you kill him?

614
01:06:53,462 --> 01:06:55,141
Ju-hwan...

615
01:06:56,439 --> 01:06:58,439
Answer me, why did you?!

616
01:07:00,401 --> 01:07:03,025
Why did you get close to dad,

617
01:07:04,021 --> 01:07:06,372
and why you tried to marry him?

618
01:07:06,659 --> 01:07:08,825
I know all about you.

619
01:07:16,098 --> 01:07:18,098
That's you 25 years ago.

620
01:07:18,567 --> 01:07:19,567
Now tell me.

621
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:23,199
Fucking tell me, goddammit!

622
01:07:37,475 --> 01:07:42,018
You were born 5 AM, September 11, 1999,

623
01:07:44,267 --> 01:07:46,267
at Chungju penitentiary.

624
01:07:47,684 --> 01:07:49,601
I didn't want to tell you like this.

625
01:07:56,350 --> 01:07:58,018
I'm your mother.

626
01:08:06,223 --> 01:08:07,347
Sir?

627
01:08:09,225 --> 01:08:12,601
What's this woman talking about?

628
01:08:19,767 --> 01:08:20,892
CHOI Dae-sik.

629
01:08:21,393 --> 01:08:22,769
Have you been well?

630
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:25,726
I've been super busy.

631
01:08:26,726 --> 01:08:28,726
I looked for you like a mad man.

632
01:08:34,851 --> 01:08:38,018
Your mother was all the rage,

633
01:08:38,392 --> 01:08:39,891
25 years ago in Incheon.

634
01:08:39,892 --> 01:08:41,100
Enough.

635
01:08:41,976 --> 01:08:46,434
He's old enough, he has
the right to know.

636
01:08:46,684 --> 01:08:47,851
Don't touch him!

637
01:08:56,726 --> 01:08:59,059
Sir, what are you doing?

638
01:09:02,657 --> 01:09:03,824
Don't do this?

639
01:09:04,874 --> 01:09:07,248
Don't do what? Tell me.

640
01:09:09,601 --> 01:09:10,684
No!

641
01:09:12,192 --> 01:09:14,917
Wanna see your son's head explode?

642
01:09:15,299 --> 01:09:18,591
Where is it? My sex tape?!

643
01:09:19,851 --> 01:09:21,266
Where is it?!

644
01:09:21,267 --> 01:09:23,267
Tell me! Where?!

645
01:09:24,392 --> 01:09:25,475
Where is it?!

646
01:09:32,601 --> 01:09:35,059
Let him go, he's not involved.

647
01:09:35,355 --> 01:09:37,773
Not involved? Of course he is.

648
01:09:38,637 --> 01:09:40,261
One more thing,

649
01:09:40,642 --> 01:09:45,767
4 years later, this whore became
your father's side chick.

650
01:09:46,243 --> 01:09:50,993
She then killed a man, while
she was pregnant with you.

651
01:09:51,350 --> 01:09:54,767
So that makes you her accomplice, right?

652
01:09:56,097 --> 01:09:57,805
Where is it, fess up.

653
01:10:00,601 --> 01:10:01,767
Dirty whore!

654
01:10:03,517 --> 01:10:04,809
Where is it?!

655
01:10:27,642 --> 01:10:28,934
Ju-hwan...

656
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:36,183
Shit.

657
01:11:54,407 --> 01:11:57,503
Why do you make things so complicated?

658
01:12:00,934 --> 01:12:03,142
It's you who make things complicated.

659
01:12:05,892 --> 01:12:07,100
Come to me now.

660
01:12:08,642 --> 01:12:10,392
The boss' out of the picture.

661
01:12:11,513 --> 01:12:14,597
If I don't, you'll kill me?

662
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:23,483
If you don't?

663
01:12:27,567 --> 01:12:29,359
I may kill Ju-hwan too.

664
01:12:29,859 --> 01:12:31,859
Are you for real?

665
01:12:34,026 --> 01:12:35,318
I'll give you a day.

666
01:12:37,318 --> 01:12:38,525
Think about it.

667
01:12:41,234 --> 01:12:42,942
That fucker is my gift to you.

668
01:12:43,483 --> 01:12:44,734
Do as you please.

669
01:12:59,151 --> 01:13:02,399
The prosecutor investigating
JC is under the suspicion of

670
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:04,734
demanding sexual favors.

671
01:13:04,942 --> 01:13:07,984
This is the interview with the witness.

672
01:13:08,241 --> 01:13:11,316
He picked one of my girls,

673
01:13:11,359 --> 01:13:15,399
and demanded more sexual favors.

674
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:20,026
This could be a big scandal
so we must be careful.

675
01:13:20,442 --> 01:13:22,734
Have you got any evidence?

676
01:13:23,061 --> 01:13:28,186
The video shows CHOI in the
act and he's identifiable.

677
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:33,858
The prosecutor is under investigation...

678
01:13:33,859 --> 01:13:36,442
I could clear your name.

679
01:13:36,775 --> 01:13:40,318
If you let me out, I'll set you free.

680
01:13:40,817 --> 01:13:43,109
We can put everything on KIM.

681
01:13:44,692 --> 01:13:47,775
No, LIM Sang-hoon!
He ordered everything.

682
01:13:48,026 --> 01:13:50,734
That bastard dethroned KIM,

683
01:13:51,692 --> 01:13:53,359
and tried to kill me,

684
01:13:54,442 --> 01:13:56,483
by releasing the dogs...

685
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:00,692
You fucking bitch!

686
01:14:01,775 --> 01:14:04,650
You won't get out of this alive!

687
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:10,304
Wait for me, I'm coming.

688
01:14:11,567 --> 01:14:12,650
Let me out, please.

689
01:14:29,109 --> 01:14:30,151
Smoke...

690
01:14:32,143 --> 01:14:33,143
Please...

691
01:14:36,442 --> 01:14:38,442
Fuck you, fuck face.

692
01:18:58,299 --> 01:18:59,465
You okay?

693
01:19:05,634 --> 01:19:07,634
Where's Ju-hwan?

694
01:19:08,129 --> 01:19:10,629
What do I have to do?

695
01:19:26,598 --> 01:19:29,973
Just come to me, that's all I want.

696
01:19:41,675 --> 01:19:44,966
Let him go. I'm begging you.

697
01:19:47,092 --> 01:19:50,800
Let us go.

698
01:19:56,676 --> 01:19:58,467
I just need you.

699
01:19:59,509 --> 01:20:00,967
Let's leave together.

700
01:20:08,509 --> 01:20:11,718
Don't you understand why I'm doing this?

701
01:20:12,426 --> 01:20:13,592
Ju-hwan?

702
01:20:14,759 --> 01:20:17,341
You just gave birth to him,
that doesn't mean anything.

703
01:20:17,342 --> 01:20:19,467
What do you know about him?

704
01:20:20,433 --> 01:20:25,932
But we went through so
much in the past 10 years.

705
01:20:28,134 --> 01:20:30,134
If I'm with you,

706
01:20:33,259 --> 01:20:35,342
we'll continue to live like this.

707
01:20:37,175 --> 01:20:38,342
Sang-hoon.

708
01:20:39,759 --> 01:20:42,009
No more of this.

709
01:20:43,509 --> 01:20:45,634
I don't want Ju-hwan living this life.

710
01:20:50,217 --> 01:20:51,509
Is it so hard to say?

711
01:20:53,342 --> 01:20:54,967
That you'll come with me?

712
01:21:11,751 --> 01:21:14,626
When things die down,

713
01:21:16,342 --> 01:21:18,009
let's talk then.

714
01:21:19,634 --> 01:21:21,009
When exactly?

715
01:21:26,049 --> 01:21:28,350
I'd rather end it here.

716
01:21:56,967 --> 01:21:58,217
When you...

717
01:21:59,759 --> 01:22:01,925
stitched me up
for the first time,

718
01:22:03,969 --> 01:22:05,886
it didn't hurt at all...

719
01:22:08,342 --> 01:22:11,592
But why does it hurt so much now?

720
01:22:13,009 --> 01:22:15,551
Pain is all I feel right now.

721
01:22:22,551 --> 01:22:27,883
Start my car, it'll tell you where he is.

722
01:22:34,759 --> 01:22:35,842
Go.

723
01:23:25,551 --> 01:23:27,592
She never turns back...

724
01:23:34,844 --> 01:23:35,969
Dammit...

725
01:24:26,337 --> 01:24:27,837
Sang-hoon...

726
01:24:29,834 --> 01:24:31,751
what was the point?

727
01:26:33,876 --> 01:26:36,409
So this is how you look.

728
01:26:36,623 --> 01:26:37,707
What?

729
01:26:39,413 --> 01:26:42,967
You gave me flight info
for the past 10 years.

730
01:26:44,259 --> 01:26:45,842
And never met in person.

731
01:26:46,425 --> 01:26:48,425
Uncle Sang-hoon always picked me up.

732
01:26:49,176 --> 01:26:50,425
Are you dad's lover?

733
01:26:51,383 --> 01:26:53,842
Um, well...

734
01:26:54,467 --> 01:27:01,217
I've served your father as his
secretary and continue...

735
01:27:01,218 --> 01:27:03,717
I was right, it doesn't matter.

736
01:27:05,425 --> 01:27:07,425
So what should I call you?

737
01:27:08,967 --> 01:27:10,300
Just Hyun-jung?

738
01:27:22,759 --> 01:27:25,675
Guess what my first impression
of you was at the airport.

739
01:27:26,717 --> 01:27:28,884
You know those killers in movies?

740
01:27:28,985 --> 01:27:32,152
They change into stupid t-shirts
after getting blood on their suits.

741
01:27:33,313 --> 01:27:34,896
You felt like that.

742
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:38,084
Totally my style.
