Are you really not going anywhere?

3
00:00:04,064 --> 00:00:05,585
Just think about it.

4
00:00:05,585 --> 00:00:09,312
Is a CEO of a company and an intern appropriate?

5
00:00:09,312 --> 00:00:11,078
Why do you like me?

6
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:13,813
We won't be able to sleep if I start talking about it. It's a lot.

7
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:17,090
Do you ever think that one day you'll not like me anymore?

8
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,667
I don't know what's wrong with Cher.

9
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:20,915
He's acting weird and avoiding me.

10
00:00:20,915 --> 00:00:22,902
If you don't know, you must find out.

11
00:00:22,902 --> 00:00:25,656
If you let this go on, it might...

12
00:00:25,656 --> 00:00:27,071
Where are you going?

13
00:00:27,071 --> 00:00:28,275
Find out the answer.

14
00:00:28,275 --> 00:00:30,690
It's not good to let this go on, right?

15
00:00:38,802 --> 00:00:42,307
Cher. Come with me.

16
00:00:43,371 --> 00:00:45,744
Where are we going?

17
00:00:45,744 --> 00:00:47,367
Boss?

18
00:00:52,084 --> 00:00:53,747
Boss.

19
00:01:01,275 --> 00:01:03,923
What's wrong? Can you just tell me?

20
00:01:03,923 --> 00:01:06,469
I'm feeling uneasy as hell.

21
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:10,870
It's nothing.

22
00:01:12,582 --> 00:01:14,612
What did I do wrong?

23
00:01:14,612 --> 00:01:15,904
You didn't.

24
00:01:15,904 --> 00:01:18,586
Seriously Cher, what is going on?

25
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:27,666
I'm just an intern, Boss.

26
00:01:36,981 --> 00:01:40,106
I never wanted it to be like this.

27
00:01:41,766 --> 00:01:45,506
Someone said what we have is impossible.

28
00:01:56,124 --> 00:01:58,450
Who said something to you?

29
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,044
I'm everything my friends said I'd be, Boss.

30
00:02:03,984 --> 00:02:06,867
I care about what everyone thinks.

31
00:02:09,277 --> 00:02:12,198
I care about how other people look at us.

32
00:02:19,384 --> 00:02:20,880
But you're not caring about me right now.

33
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,435
Me not caring about you?

34
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,606
I care so damn much!

35
00:02:25,606 --> 00:02:27,655
I don't want people to think of you in a bad way.

We just love each other.

Are you done whining?

00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,404
Why did you take me here?

You should learn to memorize your work schedule.

We're sitting on a white sand beach.

87
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:24,264
The sand is finely powdered.

don't let anyone else ruin our relationship.

The only thing allowed to change us...

103
00:07:55,487 --> 00:07:57,870
is that you no longer love me.

You're allowed to take half a day off.

111
00:08:43,286 --> 00:08:47,949
And you'll get a premium taxi driver as a bonus to take you anywhere you want.

112
00:08:49,007 --> 00:08:50,819
Yes, for the day off.

113
00:08:50,819 --> 00:08:54,416
But no, for the taxi.

Why not?

00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,764
The dialogue would go something like,

184
00:13:58,764 --> 00:14:02,070
"Hey. If you don't stop associating with him,"

185
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:05,300
"that kid will be in big trouble."

186
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,806
Am I right?

187
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,072
Did she really say that?

188
00:14:14,072 --> 00:14:16,512
It wasn't that harsh.

189

But I won't surrender.

00:14:22,493 --> 00:14:23,680
What if she forces you?

191
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,380
I will never give up.

192
00:14:28,797 --> 00:14:32,542
What if she takes your credit cards, your company, all your assets,

193
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:35,872
and cut you off from the inheritance—

194
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,968
What happened in the drama that you watched?

195

"I'm willing to give up anything because I don't want to lose you."

That sort of thing?

198

Boss.

199

If you say something like that, I won't give in.

200
00:15:00,182 --> 00:15:02,284
That's too cheesy.

201
00:15:02,284 --> 00:15:07,155
Hey. If one day you fall out of love with me, or if I fall out of love with you,

202

you will have nothing left.

203
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:17,626
Just because you like me doesn't mean you will like everything about me.

Humans are born in different conditions and live different lifestyles.

There's no way we can get along 100%.

What kind of people do you not like?

209

If it's you, I like it all.

210
00:15:43,066 --> 00:15:47,148
No, not that answer. I'm being serious here.

212
00:15:51,527 --> 00:15:56,984
I don't like people who go behind my back and lie.

213
00:15:56,984 --> 00:16:00,666
They are rude and disrespectful.

214
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,570
Why are you asking?

215
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,625
I asked so that I wouldn't do it.

216
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:10,167
And we can be together for a long time. Isn't it good?

217
00:16:14,812 --> 00:16:16,262
Please give me a hug.

218
00:16:16,262 --> 00:16:18,132
You already got a hug.

The game we just launched, you stole it, didn't you?

227
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,794
That's not it, Boss.

228
00:17:00,794 --> 00:17:03,702

- Boss, I didn't—
- You're fired!

Why did they suddenly shut down the game?
[Game Dramatically Shut Down!]

234
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,123
They launched it not long ago.

235
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:23,777
It can't be that they lost profit. Lots of people play the game.

236
00:17:28,918 --> 00:17:31,129
You didn't have to cancel the game.

237
00:17:31,129 --> 00:17:33,386
The idea really belonged to Thyme.

238

Where did you get that piece of evidence?

It's not that, my friend.

00:18:05,914 --> 00:18:10,318
Are you having so much fun watching me try and try?

00:27:21,584 --> 00:27:24,634
You're just a little crybaby.

362
00:27:24,634 --> 00:27:26,222
Come here.

363
00:27:26,222 --> 00:27:27,810
Don't comfort me.

364
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:30,770
The more you do, the harder I'll cry.

365
00:27:33,769 --> 00:27:37,207
There, there.

366
00:27:37,207 --> 00:27:40,156
Don't cry, okay?

367
00:27:42,081 --> 00:27:44,801
You jerks...

368
00:27:48,517 --> 00:27:50,624
Have you stopped playing completely?

369
00:27:52,158 --> 00:27:54,771
The game is over, Hia.

370
00:27:54,771 --> 00:27:57,100
The mission is too big.

371
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,120
I can't fight it.

372
00:28:07,724 --> 00:28:12,130
It all depends on whether you still want to fight.

373
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:15,330
If you do, just call for your teammates.

374
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:18,346
We're ready to fight alongside you.

375
00:28:22,219 --> 00:28:24,907
Breaking up while you're still in love

376
00:28:24,907 --> 00:28:28,210
is more painful than breaking up after falling out of love.

377
00:28:38,064 --> 00:28:43,830
Honestly, I don't even know if this is love.

378
00:28:44,454 --> 00:28:46,171
Why?

379
00:28:46,807 --> 00:28:49,387
Nothing has been clear from the beginning.

380
00:28:50,219 --> 00:28:53,586
I might only be the innovation he's never seen before.

381
00:28:54,486 --> 00:28:57,675
And I'm happy to get on his nerves.

382
00:28:58,345 --> 00:29:01,609
That's why I don't know if it's love

383
00:29:01,609 --> 00:29:04,526
or some kind of new good feelings towards each other.

384
00:29:11,347 --> 00:29:12,527
Hello.

385
00:29:12,527 --> 00:29:15,967
Welcome to Die with Laem ASMR.

386
00:29:15,967 --> 00:29:20,009
I'll be eating super delicious fried chicken today.

387
00:29:20,923 --> 00:29:23,344
Why did you do it?

388
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:29,678
Look at these guys.

389
00:29:29,678 --> 00:29:32,479
I'll take the couch then.

390
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,241
Where should I sleep now?

391
00:29:34,241 --> 00:29:36,784
You can sleep right here, P'Laem.

392
00:29:37,738 --> 00:29:41,067
Ai Three won't wake up and kill me, will he?

393
00:29:41,067 --> 00:29:43,434
Come on and sleep, P'Laem.

394
00:29:53,246 --> 00:29:55,243
Get some sleep, P'Laem.

395
00:29:55,243 --> 00:29:57,395
Don't think too much.

396
00:29:58,832 --> 00:30:01,032
Are you really talking to me or just sleeptalking?

397
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:03,278
I'm not sleeptalking.

398
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:05,967
My eyes are just half open.

399
00:30:07,357 --> 00:30:10,178
Thank you so much, Ai Zo.

400
00:30:11,118 --> 00:30:15,574
I love you guys so damn much.

401
00:30:15,574 --> 00:30:17,669
Hey! Zo is mine!

402
00:30:17,669 --> 00:30:21,844
I'm the only one allowed to love him, okay?

403
00:30:24,628 --> 00:30:26,893
My Zo.

404
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,376
It looks good here.

405
00:30:49,698 --> 00:30:53,177
Nong Cher, are you okay?

406
00:30:53,784 --> 00:30:55,529
I'm all good.

407
00:30:55,529 --> 00:31:00,052
Oh, Jae. Can you do this evaluation paper for my university?

408
00:31:00,052 --> 00:31:01,760
Of course.

409
00:31:02,352 --> 00:31:05,373
Is your internship over soon?

410
00:31:06,732 --> 00:31:10,075
Yes. It ends next week.

411
00:31:17,469 --> 00:31:19,604
Yes, Boss.

412
00:31:21,707 --> 00:31:23,686
What did he say?

413
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,219
He wants coffee.

414
00:31:26,219 --> 00:31:29,680
But he wants his regular.

415
00:31:32,227 --> 00:31:34,060
I'll get it for him.

416
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:37,170
I'm going downstairs anyway. I can get it.

417
00:31:48,229 --> 00:31:50,229
Are you sure you can stay alone?

418
00:31:50,229 --> 00:31:52,995
Yes, I'm fine.

419
00:32:06,987 --> 00:32:10,577
[Boss]

420
00:32:24,336 --> 00:32:26,517
I was going to call the police.

421
00:32:26,517 --> 00:32:29,647
But once I saw his last name, I was afraid it'd be a big deal.

422
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:33,772
Your contact was on his screen, so I called you.

423
00:32:35,991 --> 00:32:37,135
I want more drinks.

424
00:32:37,135 --> 00:32:38,419
What happened?

425
00:32:38,419 --> 00:32:40,662
He's drunk and keeps picking a fight with other customers.

426
00:32:40,662 --> 00:32:42,170
I couldn't help it.

427
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:44,927
Their faces asked for it.

428
00:32:44,927 --> 00:32:47,346
Thank you so much.

429
00:32:50,061 --> 00:32:51,634
Did you drive here?

430
00:32:51,634 --> 00:32:53,220
Leave me alone!

431
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,840
Just let me die.

432
00:32:56,825 --> 00:32:59,170
Don't be silly.

433
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:00,234
Who's that?

434
00:33:00,234 --> 00:33:02,630
The boss is silly.

435
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:05,686
He's always silly.

436
00:33:05,686 --> 00:33:07,472
Damn it.

437
00:33:10,514 --> 00:33:12,414
Where's your car key?

438
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,869
No idea.

439
00:33:15,801 --> 00:33:17,264
How about your condo's keycard?

440
00:33:17,264 --> 00:33:18,834
I don't know. I'm not leaving.

441
00:33:18,834 --> 00:33:21,398
I'm staying here, not going.

442
00:33:23,385 --> 00:33:24,738
What should I do now?

443
00:33:24,738 --> 00:33:26,428
Why do you care?

444
00:33:26,428 --> 00:33:28,775
I always upset people around me.

445
00:33:28,775 --> 00:33:31,386
Just leave me alone here.

446
00:34:01,367 --> 00:34:03,266
So heavy like a buffalo.

447
00:34:07,603 --> 00:34:10,670
Yes. I'm a buffalo.

448
00:34:12,301 --> 00:34:14,971
I love you so much like a dumb buffalo.

449
00:34:18,043 --> 00:34:20,426
Do you think you're the only one who knows how to love?

450
00:34:35,632 --> 00:34:37,542
Why did you do that, Cher?

451
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:39,464
It's as if you don't know me at all.

452
00:34:39,464 --> 00:34:42,047
Ai Thyme was my only friend.

453
00:34:45,337 --> 00:34:46,982
I'm sorry.

454
00:34:49,318 --> 00:34:51,446
I want an explanation.

455
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,879
I wanted to get revenge for P'Jack.

456
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:57,627
Jack?

457
00:34:57,627 --> 00:34:59,798
- My words didn't mean anything?
- You're hurting me.

458
00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:01,964
What about my feelings?

459
00:35:13,184 --> 00:35:14,853
Cher.

460
00:35:14,853 --> 00:35:18,882
Even now you're paying more attention to that freaking Game Boy than me.

461
00:35:32,913 --> 00:35:40,580
My mom, Tian, and Thoop saved up to buy me this Game Boy.

462
00:35:47,343 --> 00:35:49,223
Happy birthday, Son.

463
00:35:49,223 --> 00:35:52,275
Hey! Are you serious?

464
00:35:54,181 --> 00:35:55,395
Thank you so much.

465
00:35:55,395 --> 00:35:56,903
I've always wanted it.

466
00:35:56,903 --> 00:36:00,647
Tian and Thoop contributed some money, too.

467
00:36:00,647 --> 00:36:02,097
Do you like it?

468
00:36:02,097 --> 00:36:03,540
I like it so much!

469
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,481
If you do, make sure you play it often.

470
00:36:05,481 --> 00:36:07,968
Yes, and I'll take good care of it.

471
00:36:07,968 --> 00:36:09,740
Thank you so much.

472
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,000
Cher.

473
00:36:25,146 --> 00:36:26,946
You know what, Boss?

474
00:36:28,141 --> 00:36:30,526
Ever since I knew you,

475
00:36:31,912 --> 00:36:35,127
my life has been a damn mess.

476
00:36:39,682 --> 00:36:42,366
It's freaking exhausting, you know?

477
00:36:46,074 --> 00:36:48,546
I shouldn't have known you!

478
00:36:52,378 --> 00:36:54,907
Why did we have to meet?

479
00:37:01,203 --> 00:37:03,826
I'm freaking exhausted!

480
00:37:07,555 --> 00:37:09,072
Cher.

481
00:37:14,515 --> 00:37:17,341
Please don't say that.

482
00:37:17,341 --> 00:37:20,329
My life has been so messed up!

483
00:37:21,881 --> 00:37:23,926
Can you just let me go?

484
00:37:24,476 --> 00:37:26,387
I shouldn't have gotten to know you!

485
00:37:26,387 --> 00:37:28,652
Cher, don't say that.

486
00:37:28,652 --> 00:37:31,172
Can you just walk out of my life?

487
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,068
Please don't say that.

488
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:15,380
♫ I just realized what love feels like,
Is this a dream that I get to meet you? ♫

489
00:39:15,389 --> 00:39:17,609

I'll fix it for you, Cher.

Boss, move.

00:40:46,707 --> 00:40:48,424
But Cher, let's talk.

505
00:40:48,424 --> 00:40:50,840
- Can we talk about us later?
- But—

506
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:54,489
Ai Thoop's friend called saying he's been arrested at the police station.

507
00:40:54,489 --> 00:40:55,989
What?

508
00:41:01,537 --> 00:41:06,946
Hey. It's okay. Everything will be over soon.

509
00:41:13,169 --> 00:41:15,458
While you're driving,

510
00:41:15,458 --> 00:41:17,307
can I hug you?

511
00:41:18,031 --> 00:41:19,344
Sure.

512
00:41:36,607 --> 00:41:41,097
Hey. What's up with you now?

513
00:41:41,097 --> 00:41:43,341
I forgot that I'm sulking.

514
00:41:43,341 --> 00:41:45,931
I don't want to hug you anymore dammit.

515
00:41:45,931 --> 00:41:47,700
You can stop sulking for a moment.

516
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,080
After we're done with Thoop's matter, I'll make it up to you.

517
00:41:51,329 --> 00:41:53,883
He can be released, right?

518
00:41:53,883 --> 00:41:55,766
Nothing's going to happen, right?

519
00:42:00,842 --> 00:42:03,951
Don't touch me! I don't like it, dammit!

520
00:42:03,951 --> 00:42:07,071
All right, then. No touching.

521
00:42:07,781 --> 00:42:09,767
I called a lawyer.

522
00:42:09,767 --> 00:42:13,949
We can bail him out once we get there.

523
00:42:16,828 --> 00:42:21,708
I'm such a bad big bro.

524
00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:24,272
I can't even take good care of a little brother.

525
00:42:24,914 --> 00:42:26,923
Don't blame yourself.

526
00:42:26,923 --> 00:42:29,294
You're doing your best.

527
00:42:29,294 --> 00:42:32,272
You support yourself and Thoop at the same time.

528
00:42:32,272 --> 00:42:34,349
I think you're great.

529
00:42:46,678 --> 00:42:48,410
No touching!

530
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:50,298
I'm sulking, geez!

531
00:42:51,604 --> 00:42:54,667
Okay then. No touching while sulking.

532
00:42:54,667 --> 00:42:58,878
Yes. I'm sulking, but I can lean on your shoulder.

533
00:42:58,878 --> 00:43:00,510
Got it?

534
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:02,160
Of course.

00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:39,270
♫ Please go back, let the ordinary me gaze up at you ♫

541
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:45,801
[Next Week]
Please don't disappear on me again.

542
00:43:45,801 --> 00:43:49,224
I can't imagine a life without you.

543
00:43:49,224 --> 00:43:52,546
I also don't know what it'd be like not having you.

544
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:57,247
Probably like a dog abandoned by its owner.

545
00:43:59,042 --> 00:44:01,834
Cher, promise me,

546
00:44:01,834 --> 00:44:06,927
no matter what happens, we will fight it together.

547
00:44:06,927 --> 00:44:08,641
You troublemaker.

548
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:14,860
♫ I'm just someone ordinary ♫

549
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:21,200
♫ I don't have enough significance or importance ♫

550
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,790
♫ To make you, ♫

551
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:27,760
♫ Who is a star in the sky, lean toward me ♫

552
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:33,860
♫ I'm not worthy enough for you to love me  ♫

553
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:37,470
♫ Please go back, let the ordinary me gaze up at you ♫

554
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:40,490
♫ I'm just someone ordinary ♫

555
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:46,940
♫ I don't have enough significance or importance ♫

556
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:49,380

557
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:53,290
♫ Who is a star in the sky, lean toward me ♫
