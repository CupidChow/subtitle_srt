You like me don't you, Boss?

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:02,700
I like you.

3
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,900
I like myself when I'm with you.

4
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,340
Doing the crazy things that you tell me to do.

5
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,880
It's as expected.

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,260
Honestly, we might even lose to high schoolers right now.

7
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,590
You're saying like we didn't give it our all.

8
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,690
I didn't see anyone being serious about it at all.

9
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,160
Just because we lost once doesn't mean we will lose forever.

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,130
Smile for me, please.

11
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,250
Boss, you've been much livelier lately.

12
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,710
Can I kiss you?

13
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:33,780
I'm here for Khun Gun.

14
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,910
- Do you have an appointment?
- I do.

15
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,421
Cher.

16
00:00:37,421 --> 00:00:39,391
Boss.

17
00:00:39,391 --> 00:00:41,141
I'm sorry for bothering you so late.

18
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:45,032
That's all right. Why are you soaking wet?

19
00:00:45,032 --> 00:00:48,770
I was going to book a taxi but accidentally tapped the motorbike button.

20
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:51,570
I felt too bad to cancel.

21
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,500
That's why I'm wet as a drowned puppy.

22
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,270
Are you sure you're okay?

23
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,560
Then why are you here at this hour?

24
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,820
Something did happen,

25
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,930
but my mind isn't stable enough to tell you.

26
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,260
And please don't ask why I'm here.

27
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,020
I have no idea, either.

28
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,970
I came to your place without knowing it, instead of returning to my dorm.

29
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,620
Whether you intended to come or whether you just pinned the wrong location,

30
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,100
I'm glad the person next to you now is me.

31

40
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,881
Let's check if your hair is dry.

41
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,431
It's dry. We can go to bed.

42
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:53,397
Is that your way of checking it?

43
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,130
Boss?

44
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,406
Are you going to sleep already?

45
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,990
What is it?

00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,190
Can I get a hug?

47
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,700
You didn't tell me you had a competition today.

48
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,650
Should I be upset?

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,971
It was just a warmup match.

50
00:03:55,971 --> 00:03:58,811
It wasn't that important. That's why I didn't tell you.

51
00:03:58,811 --> 00:04:03,220
If it has to do with you, everything is important, no matter how minuscule it is.

52
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,460
How about when a dog peed on Ai P'Jack's beloved motorbike? Should I tell you about that too?

53

You should.

54
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,000
Okay.

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,400
My life is full of nonsense stuff.

56
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,180
Prepare your ears to listen, Boss.

57
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,940
Boss.

58
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:28,210
I feel like I'm holding my team back somehow.

59
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,530
Why?

60
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,829
I don't know.

61
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:36,360
At the competition, I was so angry at myself.

62
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,890
I made lots of mistakes.

63
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,430
And then P'Three and P'Jack got into an arugment.

64
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:44,780
I feel like everything happened because of me.

65
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,679
Why would you think that?

66
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:50,500
Because I'm doing my internship.

67
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,890
I don't have as much time to practice as before.

68
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:57,080
And there are many other things, Boss.

69
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,130
Didn't you just say it was just a warmup match?

70
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:04,380
That means you still have a chance next time, right?

71
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,970
Yes.

72
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:11,860
Now that you know your mistakes, fix them.

73
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,600
As for the fight your friends had, it's very normal

74
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,430
for a group of people working together to have disagreements.

75
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,530
There are many ways to deal with it.

76
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:27,760
But honestly, I don't think I can advise you on this.

00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,774
My friend's resort.

85
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,430
That must be expensive.

86
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,770
You don't have to worry about that.

87
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,860
I don't know if they're free to go.

88
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,800
Tell them I want to pay them back for the BBQ.

Hold on, Boss.

94
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:54,820
I don't think our BBQ was this expensive.

00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,110
My friend just had it renovated.

96
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,470
Let me know if you guys need anything.

97
00:06:58,471 --> 00:07:03,191
Then I'll do exactly as you said.

98
00:07:03,191 --> 00:07:05,690
Boss. How much is this stay?

99
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,200
Will you at least let us pay half of it?

100
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,791
That's all right. My friend hasn't officially opened this resort yet.

101
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,670
Think of it as you guys trying it out.

102
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,240
Let me know if there's a problem.

00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,320

107
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:28,014
The chandeliers are bigger than my café.

00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,901
I'm... sorry.

00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,426
What the heck now?

110
00:07:56,426 --> 00:08:00,420
Sorry for being hot-headed at you guys.

111
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:05,050
I know that as the team captain, I should blame myself, not other people.

112
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:08,410
It's my fault. Really.

113
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,680
I know we all did our best.

114
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,578
But my mouth. My mouth was terrible.

115
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,130
You hit it too softly.

116
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:25,382
I couldn't hear the sound.

117
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,560
It's my bad.

118
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,121
All right.

119
00:08:30,121 --> 00:08:34,120
I'm sorry, too, for raising my voice at you.

120
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,601
As for being foul-mouth,

121
00:08:35,601 --> 00:08:38,770
don't be like that. Let Ai Laem do it.

00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,470

123
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,640
All right.

124
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,860
I'm sorry, Father. I won't do that again.

125
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,510
You can command me anything.

126
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,020
I will do it.

127
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:58,560
I can even be your servant for a day.

128
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:00,830

129
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,710

So?

133
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,950
You said it.

134
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,780
What's your name?

135
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,190
My name is Three.

00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,460
Hand, please.

137
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:33,020
Of course.

138
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,230
Sure.

139
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,780
I'll kick you!

140
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,960
Don't!

141
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,380
We're having seafood for dinner.

142
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:47,210
Boss, are your seafood and my seafood the same thing?

143
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,990
You're not talking about lobsters and Alaskan king crabs, are you?

144
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,170
Oh, it's not like that.

145
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:56,750
But there are the biggest tiger prawns and some crab meat.

146
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,480
Thank you so much, Boss.

147
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,220
This trip is so great that I feel a little bad.

148
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:11,121
Just enjoy it. I just want everyone to relax.

149
00:10:15,842 --> 00:10:16,990
Hia!

150
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:17,941

151
00:10:17,941 --> 00:10:19,200
I want to get in the water with them.

152
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,930
Get in the water? Sure. Let's go.

153
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,470
You can smile now, right?

154
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,970
Why?

155
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:40,810
Did I look so miserable before?

156
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,960
The most miserable face of you that I've seen.

157
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,020
You're exaggerating, Boss.

158
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,150
So you're not blaming yourself anymore, are you?

159
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,451
I don't know. I can't say that.

160
00:10:54,451 --> 00:10:57,220
Let's see the result of the next competition first.

161
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,890
You're making me feel bad, too.

162
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,150
Why?

163
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:06,270
You don't have time to practice because you need to do the internship at my company.

164
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,800
That has nothing to do with it.

165
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,550
I have to do an internship anyway. If I don't, I won't be able to graduate.

166
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:15,470
It takes as much time no matter where it takes place.

167
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,640
That's true.

168
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,500
Let's get in the water. Come on.

169
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,510
No. I don't want to get wet.

170
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:40,220
Oh, come on!

171
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,420
I'm really not ready to get wet. You go ahead.

172
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,440
Boss, your life doesn't need to be so well-planned all the time.

173
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,870
It's just playing in the water. You don't need to think too much.

174
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:53,081
I'm not planning anything. I just don't want to get in the water.

175
00:11:53,081 --> 00:11:54,820
You enjoy it.

176
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,640
Come quickly, Boss!

177
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,350
So damn tired!

178
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,200
I usually sit in the gaming café all day.

179
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,780
Once I get to exercise like this, I realize it.

180
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,240
Do you realize you're old?

181
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,420
I realize I'm still young and strong.

182
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,500
Hia, you're awesome!

183
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,390
- Ouch! My back.
- Hia!

184
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,690
One, two, three.

185
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,810
Gosh! Whoa!

186
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:43,270
Whatever you do, consider your age.

187
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,800
Boss, thank you so much for taking us here.

188
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,880
I need to thank you, too.

189
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,147
Why?

190
00:12:56,147 --> 00:12:58,747
For bringing me more friends.

191
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,730
They are all yours, Boss.

192
00:13:04,542 --> 00:13:08,352
Spending more time with them will cause your head to explode.

193
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,460
Here you go!

194
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,400
Let's create a nice vibe.

195
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:34,640
Why does the print on this speaker look like the one on my coffee tumbler?

196
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,460
They're from the same set.

197
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:46,110
You already got the tumbler. I should get the speaker.

198
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,711
You won't use it anyway even if you have it, right?

199
00:13:47,711 --> 00:13:50,601
How do you know I won't use it?

200
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,980
Does someone like you listen to music?

201
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,310
Someone like me doesn't listen to music.

202
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:01,538
I only listen to your voice.

203
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,860
You keep talking nonsense.

204
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,800
I'm already right here.

205
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,960
Why do you need a speaker?

206
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,210
What did you say?

207
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,710
Nothing.

208
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,670
Hia Tub and everyone are here.

209
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,630
Yo!

210
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,530
Greeting like the youngsters?

211
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,590
Please take a seat.

212
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,190
Hold on, Ai Jack.

213
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:32,690
How can you sit?

214
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,690
You take care of the drinks.

215
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,200
- Okay. You got it.
- You were acting oblivious.

216
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,960
Get the drinks!

217
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,550
No problems. I got it, Hia.

218
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,940
Guys, I'll be right back.

219
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,550
I'll be right back, Boss.

220
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,980
Make it strong.

221
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,940
Do you want it with only ice?

222
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:53,760
Can I borrow 10k? I need the money for a camp.

223
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,620
What kind of camp costs so much?

224
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,390
Some of it is for my previous projects I haven't paid for.

225
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,840
I really need the money.

226
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,900
You know I won't ask you for money if I'm not really in need.

227
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,460
Seriously, Thoop.

228
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:08,690
You're not spending money on something bad, are you?

229
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,688
Have some trust in me, damn it.

230
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,790
All right. I'll transfer you the money.

231
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,750
Do it right now, all right?

232
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,240
What's the hurry? I'll do it later.

233
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,380
My friend advanced it for me and he needs it back now.

234
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,080
Okay then.

235
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,540
This should be enough.

236
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,660
Whoa, are you dehydrated or something?

237
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,360
Do it faster.

238
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:43,560
Ai Laem, what's wrong?

239
00:15:44,479 --> 00:15:48,400
It's Ai Thoop. He asked for money.

240
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,050
Be careful, dude.

241
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,050
In case it's for drugs or gambling.

242
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,470
- Here you are, Boss.
- I'm afraid so too.

243
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,660
But he said no.

244
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,050
Whatever. Let's cheers.

245
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:02,380
- Where is my glass, Ai P'Jack?
- Hold on one sec.

246
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,720
Gosh! You're so slow!

247
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,170
Let's cheer!

248
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:09,760
Cheers!

249
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,680
Our awesome bro will empty his glass!

250
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,560
Gosh. You're so damn heavy.

251
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,850
Can you even take a shower?

252
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:37,970
I have one word to say...

253
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,570
I can't.

254
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,300
That's two actually words.

255
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,460
I can't. That's two words.

256
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:49,060
I can't. I'm drunk.

257
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,780
No shower, but your face should be cleaned at least.

258
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,120
So refreshing.

259
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,350
Get some sleep, Boss.

260
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,530
Once you're sober, go take a shower and wash your face.

261
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,680
See you tomorrow.

262
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:35,790
Aren't you going to sleep here and hug Phi Gun tonight?

263
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,440
Want to cuddle and sleep?

264
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,840
Wait.

265
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,550
What did you just call yourself?

266
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:47,160
Phi Gun. I'm Nong Cher's Phi Gun.

267
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,200
What the heck now?

268
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,680
Where did you pick that up, Boss?

269
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,520
I heard nong Zo and nong Three call each other like this.

270
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,230
It's cute.

271
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,000
My head hurts.

272
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,410
Hurry...

273
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,720
Give me a hug.

274
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,320
Hug me.

275
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,040
Look at you.

276
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,029
Just hug the bolster.

277
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:22,930
Someone who hasn't showered is smelly.

278
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:25,550
So unclean.

279
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:29,300
All right. You don't have to hug me.

280
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:33,660
My face is clean. Give me a kiss.

281
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,080
Just sleep.

282
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,280
Before you get any more embarrassing than this.

283
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,030
I love you, Cher.

284
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,860
Nong Cher.

285
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,310
Sweet dreams, Boss.

286
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:31,110
P'Laem, aren't you sleeping yet?

287
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,610
Ai Zo.

288
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,280
Still worried about the competition?

289
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,480
A little.

290
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,600
How's P'Three doing?

291
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,140
Is he still angry at me?

292
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,850
He isn't angry at anyone.

293
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,700
Really?

294
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,920
He's just sad he couldn't lead us to victory.

295
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,930
What he expressed that day was because of his hot temper.

296
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:14,170
I feel like I'm a burden to our team, Ai Zo.

297
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:19,540
The boss told me not to think this way, but I can't help myself.

298
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,860
You're blaming yourself because we lost.

299
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,220
I feel for you P'Laem.

300
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,460
You've always done so great.

301
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,800
But in the end, you are taken as a failure.

302
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,351
All right. You don't have to be sarcastic.

303
00:20:34,351 --> 00:20:38,760
I'll heal myself soon. I've been feeling a lot better anyway.

304
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:44,010
Will you heal yourself or will someone else?

305
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,071
Zo, have you been spending too much time with P'Three?

306
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:51,853
No, it's you.

307
00:20:51,853 --> 00:20:54,252
Have you been spending too much time with the boss?

308
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,220
Are you using my words against me?

309
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:05,260
Whatever it is, I'm rooting for you.

310
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,000
- Ai Zo.
- Yes?

311
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,680
What is love?

312
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,230
I guess that depends on how we define it.

313
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,880
- Really?
- Yes.

314
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,520
What is love for you?

315
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,300
It's P'Three.

316
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,500
I want to puke, but don't want to waste the tiger prawns I just ate.

317
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,460
What about you?

318
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,760
Have you figured out what your love is like?

319
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,180
I love you, Cher.

320
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,820
Nong Cher.

321
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,720
What?

322
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:09,250
I don't know. It's difficult.

323
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:13,580
But... I think I know now.

324
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,200
It's the reason you're quiet and what you're thinking about.

325
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,000
Also, the way you are is called love.

326
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,760
Is it?

327
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,700
I've never seen you so insecure.

328
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:39,940
Whatever happens, I'm always here for you.

329
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,671
I'm sleepy. I'm going to bed.

330
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,860
Goodnight.

331
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,070
It was so dang fun, P'Jack.

332
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,470
Yes, I know.

333
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,460
Well, well.

334
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,370
You guys went on a trip without telling me.

335
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:19,200
It was so sudden. Maybe next time, Jae.

336
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,040
Yes. Come with us next time.

337
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,200
The resort of the boss's friend...

338
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,190
Ai Laem, let's go get some coffee.

339
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,420
I'm coming, too.

340
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,900
- Guys, do you want anything?
- One latte, please.

341
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,701
- Of course. I'll get it for you.
- Thank you.

342
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,990
What's going on?

343
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:43,180
Ai P'Jack, did I say something wrong?

344
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:46,800
You shouldn't tell people you're that close to the boss.

345
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:51,400
Especially even going out of town together. People may think he's biased.

346
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,980
Come on. Do we need to be that cautious?

347
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,980
It's better safe than sorry.

348
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,490
I know you and the boss are close.

349
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:03,400
And it may be closer than normal.

350
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:09,160
We don't have any problems with that though, right, Jack?

351
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,090
We're afraid people will think of the boss in a bad way.

352
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:15,380
Okay, Jae. I'll be more careful next time.

353
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,181
Yes. We're saying this because we care.

354
00:24:18,181 --> 00:24:22,594
Since we're discussing this, how about you tell us your status?

355
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:25,086
What are you two now?

356
00:24:26,486 --> 00:24:28,400
Gosh!

357
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,580
It's nothing, Jae.

358
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,780
Ooh! Your lips are shaking.

359
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:38,800
As I told Ai P'Jack, he is just a fan of my ASMR channel.

360
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,060
Okay.

361
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:45,220
But I'm really happy to see the boss in a better mood.

362
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,760
We must thank you for this, nong Cher.

363
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,106
I didn't do anything.

364
00:24:53,786 --> 00:24:55,200
What now, Ai P'Jack?

365
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,400
You're staring at me so hard, you might as well eat my head.

366
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,030
I don't want to eat your head full of saw dust.

367
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:05,751
What? Not only did my mom feed me ashes as a kid,

368
00:25:05,751 --> 00:25:08,420
did she also feed me saw dust too?
(T/N: Saw dust also means "airhead", "a fool")

369
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,450
I'm going to buy the boss' coffee now.

370
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,580
You're buying the boss coffee...

371
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,546
Oh, dear.

372
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,920
Your caffeine is served.

373
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,545
- It's so good.
- You haven't drank it yet.

374
00:25:35,086 --> 00:25:36,472
Can I crash at your place tonight?

375
00:25:36,472 --> 00:25:39,020
Oh? Why?

376
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,160
My air conditioner doesn't work.

377
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,580
- Do you even have your PJs?
- I've brought them with me.

378
00:25:49,073 --> 00:25:50,860
He's so ready.

379
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,600
Doesn't sound intentional at all.

380
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,026
It's not intentional.

381
00:25:55,026 --> 00:25:57,373
All right. I believe you.

382
00:25:57,373 --> 00:25:59,860
Here. I'm off to work.

383
00:25:59,866 --> 00:26:02,346
What's the hurry?

384
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,680
Because there is a huge workload in this company.

385
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,666
And the boss is very pushy.

386
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:10,366
I'm going now.

387
00:26:12,826 --> 00:26:15,620
See you this evening at my car.

388
00:26:16,606 --> 00:26:18,006
Okay.

389
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,720
What are you doing?

390
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,680
You've been acting weird since we left the office.

391
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,601
I'm hiding from people.

392
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:46,234
But we're already far from the office.

393
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:52,986
Why didn't you tell me?

394
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,780
My neck hurts.

395
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,773
I don't get why you need to hide from people.

396
00:26:59,573 --> 00:27:01,780
Because of P'Jack.

397
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:04,230
He said it's inappropriate.

398
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,830
He's afraid people would view you badly.

399
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,440
Are you worried about me?

400
00:27:12,053 --> 00:27:14,206
I care about a dog, duh!

401
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,346
My puppy.

402
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:22,773
Hey! Use both hands to drive. It's dangerous.

403
00:27:22,773 --> 00:27:26,261
If you don't let me touch you, I'll kiss your cheek.

404
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,240
My little puppy.

405
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,630
Good job, my little puppy.

406
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:36,980
You're so cute.

407
00:27:50,506 --> 00:27:52,640
What are you looking at?

408
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,473
You've been more down to earth ever since you met me.

409
00:27:57,013 --> 00:27:58,920
I just enjoy it.

410
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,210
Oh, after the meal, you go take a shower first.

411
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:04,640
- I want to stream a game for a bit.
- Game streaming?

412
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,654
Yes. I told my fans I would.

413
00:28:06,654 --> 00:28:08,810
I don't want to postpone it. They will yell at me.

414
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:09,900
Sure.

415
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,860
Can I watch?

416
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:19,280
You can, but you can't appear in the frame. Or people will go wild.

417
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,420
All right.

418
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:24,300
It isn't so easy to beat me, nong!

419
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,300
There are 24 hours a day.

420
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,960
But I practice this game 30 hours a day.

421
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,434
Don't get cocky, you jackass. Hide your shadow well

422
00:28:31,434 --> 00:28:33,253
or my axe will bash you in the head.

423
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:36,160
Does the axe have a cold? Why is it coughing?
(T/N: "Bash" and "coughing" are homonyms in Thai)

424
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,713
P'Laem, what a dull joke.

425
00:28:38,713 --> 00:28:40,370
Damn it, Ai Laem!

426
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:43,271
What? They are chasing us down now!

427
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,690
That was close.

428
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,720
"Who is behind you?"

429
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,733
Come on. This joke is outdated.

430
00:28:56,733 --> 00:28:59,066
I'm here alone.

431
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,460
Shit!

432
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:09,610
Boss. Did you just walk past the camera?

433
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:11,773
Oh.

434
00:29:11,773 --> 00:29:14,900
And why are you shirtless?

435
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,930
I'm wearing it right now.

436
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,960
- Are you playing a game with your friends?
- Yes.

437
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,135
Can I say hi?

438
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:25,035
Yes. Here.

439
00:29:26,277 --> 00:29:27,591
Hi, everyone.

440
00:29:27,591 --> 00:29:29,860
Hi, Boss.

441
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:32,800
I just wanted to say hi to you all. I won't bother you now.

442
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,133
Please continue.

443
00:29:34,133 --> 00:29:35,720
Here.

444
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,040
- I'll be waiting in bed, Cher.
- What?! (From all)

445
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,506
You're so screwed, Ai Cher.

446
00:30:14,653 --> 00:30:16,500
Are you sleepy?

447
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:21,610
You can't do that next time. Got it?

448
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:23,320
You're famous now.

449
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:28,310
I just walked past the camera. And now I'm famous?

450
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,480
Hey, look at your face.

451
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,280
It can even shake men's hearts.

452
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,000
Is the heart of this man,

453
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,035
shaken as well?

454
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,918
You talk too much.

455
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,932
- Can I kiss your cheek?
- For 20k.

456
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:51,390
Sure.

457
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,146
Hey, I'm kidding.

458
00:30:53,146 --> 00:30:55,693
Don't spend money like it's nothing.

459
00:30:55,693 --> 00:30:59,670
Should we sleep then? Or we might not get to sleep at all.

460
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:01,070
Yes.

461
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,653
Hey, Boss.

462
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,500
Can I ask you something?

463
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:25,300
Why are you so fond of crashing here at my tiny place?

464
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,152
What's so special about it?

465
00:31:28,066 --> 00:31:31,153
You don't sleep at your fancy condo.

466
00:31:31,153 --> 00:31:33,733
I know your AC is not broken.

467
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,486
It's not the room that I like.

468
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,480
I like its owner.

469
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,940
Oh, wow!

470
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,680
Did you even bring your business attire?

471
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:20,053
Next time, I will bring even more.

472
00:32:20,053 --> 00:32:22,660
In case I spend many nights here.

473
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,420
Whatever you say. Do as you please, Father.

474
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:28,530
I need to hurry off to the hotel.

475
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,040
Eat first though, Boss.

476
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,200
At least a few bites. I made it for you.

477
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,700
All right.

478
00:32:38,626 --> 00:32:41,640
Are you coming to the office later?

479
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:44,700
I am, but I'm dropping you there first.

480
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,313
It's okay. Ai P'Jack will pick me up.

481
00:32:47,313 --> 00:32:49,020
Is that so?

482
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:52,020
I'll see you in the afternoon.

483
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:58,966
I'll bring you the cake from the hotel. It's so good.

484
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,160
Please drive safely.

485
00:33:06,074 --> 00:33:07,674
See you.

486
00:33:26,673 --> 00:33:30,013
- Boss, did you forget...
- May I come in?

487
00:33:32,293 --> 00:33:33,926
Am I dreaming?

488
00:33:33,926 --> 00:33:37,413
I'm paying you a visit. That's how you greet your guest?

489
00:33:40,033 --> 00:33:41,866
I'm paying you back the money.

490
00:33:43,346 --> 00:33:45,060
Where did you get the money from?

491
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,680
I won at soccer betting.

492
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,233
Yes, I know it's bad.

493
00:33:49,233 --> 00:33:51,130
But I'm able to pay you back because of it.

494
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:53,680
I even have some left to spend.

495
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,840
Hey, Ai Thoop.

496
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,310
Are you addicted to betting (gambling)?

497
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:01,827
- You said you'd...
- It was just for fun.

498
00:34:01,827 --> 00:34:04,973
I earn so much more back. Why are you nagging so much?

499
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,933
You must quit, Thoop.

500
00:34:08,933 --> 00:34:11,140
Or I'll be so angry at you.

501
00:34:11,806 --> 00:34:14,080
Is the monthly allowance I give you not enough?

502
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,560
You can just tell me.

503
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:21,193
I know I nag at you when you call, but I give you money every time.

504
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:24,160
Please don't do this, Thoop. It's bad.

505
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,293
I'm worried about you.

506
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:29,646
It's because of P'Tian. I know.

507
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,670
Partly, yes.

508
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:37,220
The fact that she's gone but I'm still here taking care of you,

509
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,580
doesn't that mean I view you as my real younger brother?

510
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,740
Do you get me?

511
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:44,606
Even though I do bad things to you all the time?

512
00:34:44,606 --> 00:34:47,994
No. You're taking care of me because you loved P'Tian.

513
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:52,946
Yes, I loved your sister.

514
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,686
And I love you too.

515
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:59,120
Promise me you won't do gambling again.

516
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,200
All right. I know.

517
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,700
I'll quit.

518
00:35:04,086 --> 00:35:07,430
As for this, keep it.

519
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:08,713
I don't need it right now.

520
00:35:08,713 --> 00:35:11,733
But don't you spend it on gambling. Okay?

521
00:35:11,733 --> 00:35:13,873
No. I'm returning it.

522
00:35:13,873 --> 00:35:16,660
If I need to borrow from you next time, it will be easier.

523
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:19,461
- You're such a pain.
- I'm leaving now.

524
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,040
Hey, Thoop.

525
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:25,180
Promise me that you won't do it again.

526
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:28,433
All right. I know. You don't need to repeat it.

527
00:35:28,433 --> 00:35:30,233
It's annoying.

528
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,980
Whose brother was that? He's so hard to raise.

529
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:52,126
Raise him yourself in the next life. I'm tired.

530
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,620
What is this place, a runway?

531
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,980
People are walking back and forth.

532
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,320
Hey, Boss.

533
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,540
I forgot something.

534
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,920
I was already far away and had to turn around.

535
00:36:21,893 --> 00:36:23,080
This.

536
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,450
It's normal for old people.

537
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:27,580
Hey. Who did you just call old?

538
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,713
Someone around here.

539
00:36:28,713 --> 00:36:30,986
You'll be punished.

540
00:36:30,986 --> 00:36:33,040
With what?

541
00:36:33,646 --> 00:36:35,400
With a kiss.

542
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,686
Hey, Boss!

543
00:36:37,686 --> 00:36:39,950
What the fuck are you doing?

544
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,673
Shit. Thoop.

545
00:36:41,673 --> 00:36:42,730
I...

546
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:44,630
You what?

547
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,650
Is this loving P'Tian?

548
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:50,406
So this is the behavior of the man who claimed to love my sister?

549
00:36:50,406 --> 00:36:51,800
I can explain.

550
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,270
Explain that you and this asshole are screwing?

551
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:56,020
Ai Thoop!

552
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,206
Watch what you say.

553
00:36:58,206 --> 00:37:01,700
If you're going to curse at someone, do it to me only.

554
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:05,273
Why am I so disappointed in you this time?

555
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:09,300
From now on, don't say my sister's name ever again!

556
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,266
You don't have to transfer me money.

557
00:37:12,266 --> 00:37:15,326
Go ahead and try a new fucking lifestyle that you want.

558
00:37:15,326 --> 00:37:17,706
Sorry to interrupt.

559
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:45,286
I'm sorry about my little bro.

560
00:37:45,286 --> 00:37:48,280
He's simply foul-mouthed.

561
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:17,240
I don't know how strong and caring you had to be in the past,

562
00:38:19,713 --> 00:38:24,686
but when you're with me, you don't need to do that.

563
00:38:24,686 --> 00:38:28,806
I want you to express what you feel.

564
00:39:19,873 --> 00:39:22,129
What the hell is wrong?

565
00:39:22,129 --> 00:39:24,686
The job you mentioned,

566
00:39:24,686 --> 00:39:26,580
is it hard to do?

567
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,070
Are you ready for it?

568
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,800
I have nothing left to care for.

569
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,280
I don't need to care about anyone's feelings.

570
00:39:41,606 --> 00:39:45,354
Ai Laem! Why don't you pick up the phone?

571
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,500
I'll be waiting downstairs.

572
00:40:03,879 --> 00:40:05,470
Wait for me at the office.

573
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:07,020
See you this evening.

574
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,520
Okay.

575
00:40:19,535 --> 00:40:21,440
Let's go.

576
00:40:23,606 --> 00:40:24,941
Ai Laem.

577
00:40:24,941 --> 00:40:29,860
If I have to explain now, I better eat this helmet and die.

578
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,660
So should I wear it or eat it?

579
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:42,286
Do you want to hit your head with it or do you want me to do it?

580
00:40:42,286 --> 00:40:44,586
It's your little bro here.

581
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,000
Come on.

582
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:59,270
Let me know whenever you need me here. Hm?

583
00:41:01,326 --> 00:41:03,026
Got it?

584
00:41:14,835 --> 00:41:17,065
The prophet Laem is predicting you are so worried about someone
[Laem, Phon's Son]

585
00:41:17,065 --> 00:41:23,100
that you want to finish work quickly and go back to meet him.

586
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,840
Am I right?

587
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:31,633
You are. Can I ask one more question?
[Gungawin]

588
00:41:31,633 --> 00:41:33,970
It's 39 baht per question.
[Laem, Phon's Son]

589
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:37,650
If you want 5-questions answered, it's 500 baht.

590
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:39,734
I'll give you 1,000.
[Gungawin]

591
00:41:39,734 --> 00:41:45,092
I just want to know if the one I'm missing is still sad.

592
00:41:45,092 --> 00:41:49,132
He's not sad anymore.
[Laem, Phon's Son]

593
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:52,480
Send me a selfie as proof.
[Gungawin]

594
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:06,910
Hello, Boss.

595
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:08,570
Have you eaten?

596
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:11,030
I just had Som Tum with salted crab and fermented fish.

597
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:13,850
My mouth still smells like fermented fish.

598
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:15,374
Can you smell it?

599
00:42:15,374 --> 00:42:17,112
What do you want to eat this evening?

600
00:42:17,112 --> 00:42:18,690
Anything is fine.

601
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:20,080
Spend the night at my place.

602
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,156
Okay.

603
00:42:21,156 --> 00:42:25,087
But you must take me back to my dorm to get some clothes first.

604
00:42:25,087 --> 00:42:27,250
- Deal.
- You should go back to work.

605
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:29,050
I should too.

606
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:31,460
I've been gone too long. Ai P'Jack is going to bite my neck.

607
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,942
Sure. I'll be back in the office in a bit.

608
00:42:33,942 --> 00:42:36,142
I didn't ask.

609
00:42:36,142 --> 00:42:37,914
I wanted to tell you.

610
00:42:37,914 --> 00:42:39,560
Bye bye.

611
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:42,960

612
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,730

- You're internship must be close to completion.
- That's right.

618
00:43:15,136 --> 00:43:16,437
In half a month.

619
00:43:16,437 --> 00:43:18,768
Do you want to move in with me?

620
00:43:18,768 --> 00:43:22,340
I don't want you to call me boss all the time.

621
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:24,849
I want you to call me something else.

622
00:43:24,849 --> 00:43:25,958
Phi Gun?

623
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:27,858
Come on.

624
00:43:27,858 --> 00:43:29,490
Let's play in the water.

625
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:32,647
I'm so happy that I'm scared it will be gone.

626
00:43:32,647 --> 00:43:34,881
I want to have you with me forever.

627
00:43:34,881 --> 00:43:37,005
I wonder why I like you so much.

628
00:43:37,005 --> 00:43:39,293
