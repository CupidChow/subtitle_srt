Hello, Ai P'Jack!

11
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,840
Did you secretly change my ringtone?

12
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,824
Yes, it was me.

13
00:01:19,824 --> 00:01:22,420
And you even set it to the max volume.

14
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,580
Are you trying to wake up the neighbor, too?

15
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,290
You sleep as if you're dead.

16
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:30,230
You wouldn't wake up even if the neighbor kicked on your door.

17
00:01:30,233 --> 00:01:32,262
Go take a shower.

18
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,670
What shower?

19
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:38,330
I got ready before picking up your call, Phi.

20
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:41,240
I woke up at 5 a.m. to iron my clothes.

21
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,432
I'm locking my door now. See you out front.

Call me when you arrive... Whoa!

23
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,460
No wonder I thought you sounded nearby.

24
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,070
Wow. I didn't know you could teleport.

25
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,460
When did you learn it?

26
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,060
If I'd known, I would've only told Ai Zo where I kept my spare key.

27
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,020
I shouldn't have told you, too.

28
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,000
Go take a shower already!

Let me tell you. The last competition was cutthroat.

I'm going to get your coffee before the café closes.

Three months. Is that how long it took you to think, Khun Jack?

00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,340

Coffee is delivered.

99
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:51,380
That's about it, Boss. That's briefly it.

100
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:55,070
And why isn't it a survival horror game like I told you?

101
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:59,493
Did you hear me wrong that day or were you not listening to what I told you?

102
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,910
I heard you right, Boss.

103
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:06,000
I just don't think survival horror is a good idea.

104
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,280
Yes, people love thrilling games, and that includes action-horror as well.

105
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,340
But action-horror isn't as appealing as survival horror.

106
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:19,640
Action-horror is appealing because players can fight against their enemies.

107
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,660
The appeal you mention is preferential to an individual.

108
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,550
To me, killing monsters to get to the next level is just plain—

109
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,885
Why don't you add side missions then?

110
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:38,170
Oh, I'm sorry.

111
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:40,890
I apologize on his behalf. It's his first day of internship.

112
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,890
He still has a lot to learn.

113
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,840
Shut up and leave.

114
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,230
What?

115
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,110
Shut up and leave.

116
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,940
What are you saying, P'Jack?

117
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,260
You may leave now.

118
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,120
Ah. I'm sorry again.

119
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,820
Sorry.

120
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,790
Wait.

121
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,700
Yes?

122
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,346
What did you say just now?

123
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:17,776
When exactly? I said a lot of things.

124
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,020
Ah, side missions, right?

125
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,480
It's his first day, Boss.

126
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,175
- Let's—
- I'm not talking to you, Jack.

127
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:35,093
I don't usually let interns voice their opinions,

128
00:09:35,093 --> 00:09:37,733
but I'll listen to yours today.

129
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,140
Please.

130
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,060
It's such an odd honor, Boss.

131
00:10:06,185 --> 00:10:08,167
Then...

132
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:12,173
may I talk about the game genre first? Something is bothering me.

133
00:10:12,173 --> 00:10:13,253
Sure.

134
00:10:13,253 --> 00:10:16,830
I won't interrupt you until you raise your finger saying you're finished.

135
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,430
Please.

136
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,200
Okay.

137
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,750
Here's what I think, Boss.

138
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,050
It's true that survival horror games are interesting,

139
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:29,870
but not every game made is popular.

140
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:35,230
In Thailand, only Home Sweet Home and ARAYA are successful.

141
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,580
The rest stays unknown, Boss.

142
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:41,370
It's not that people aren't making any games, it's just that they aren't successful.

143
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,840
So I agree with P'Jack's idea.

144
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,950
If Phenomenal Gaming tries making an action-horror game,

145
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:53,740
we may be able to pull it off with side missions and other minor features.

146
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:59,560
It could be a unique detail that distinguishes our company and becomes our signature.

147
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,450
Oh, I forgot. I'm done.

148
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:22,720
P'Jack, Ai Zo messaged me saying we're having BBQ pork this evening.

149
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,230
Let's go, okay, Phi?

150
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,360
P'Three and Hia Tub will be there.
(T/N: Hia, refers to an older man of Chinese descent)

151
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:31,553
He said it was to celebrate my smooth first day of internship.

152
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:35,520
Do you dare to call that a smooth first day, Ai Laem?

153
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:40,546
Easy there, Older Brother. It's your little brother here.

154
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,746
I don't know what the boss is on today.

155
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:47,870
Normally if you interrupt him like that he would have told you off

156
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:52,740
and informed your university that you have no manners.

157
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,020
Then the university will be banned because of you.

158
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,900
You're exaggerating.

159
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,960
We all see that Boss isn't that mean.

160
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:05,106
When I was speaking, he listened with no interruption.

161
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:11,670
You are just bad-mouthing P'Gun. Do you realize that?

162
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:16,066
Ai Laem, you better watch your mouth.

163
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,584
You're pointing at my face again.

164
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,966
But I've never seen our boss like that, either.

165
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,573
He's never treated anyone else that way.

166
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:34,783
Have I turned into the boss's favorite person on the first day of my internship?

167
00:12:34,783 --> 00:12:36,483
You...

168
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,720
You ran out of stuff, right?

169
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,440
There's only a computer screen left.

170
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,900
You probably wouldn't hit me with the screen, right?

171
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,580
Right. No more stuff.

172
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,186
But my foot is left!

173
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,750
Take them back.

174
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,020
Yes, Boss. Right, Sir.

175
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,880
Nong Cher.

176
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,800
Boss wants to see you.

177
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,460
You're so dead, Ai Laem.

178
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,590
Excuse me.

179
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,100
I'd like to get to know you.

180
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,706
What?

181
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,909
Why are you surprised?

182
00:13:55,909 --> 00:14:00,120
Is it weird if the boss wants to get to know his intern?

183
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,460
No. I just thought you looked at my resume before you accepted me here.

184
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:08,600
What is the HR for if I have to do that myself?

185
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,696
Well, isn't talking to me here more time-consuming than looking over my resume?

186
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,430
I'm sorry.

187
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:27,373
My name is Sarun. You can also call me Laem.

188
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:29,810
So Laem is your nickname?

189
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:32,490
But I heard Khun Aoi call you Cher.

190
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,190
That's my nickname.

191
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,760
Calm down, Boss. I'm not messing with you.

192
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,210
Cher is my real nickname. Laem is the nickname friends gave me.

193
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:44,753
My face is pointy, so they like to call me Laem (Pointy).

194
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:50,160
Why did you ask me to call you Laem when your nickname is Cher?

195
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,890
I like that name.

196
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:55,160
It sounds natural. Don't you think?

197
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,320
Is there something on my face?

198
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,233
I finally found you.

199
00:15:29,626 --> 00:15:32,846
What? What did you say?

200
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,840
I don't think we've met.

201
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,960
Are you mistaking me for someone else?

202
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,360
You did, didn't you?

203
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,933
I finally found you.

204
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,380
I don't think we've met.

205
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,520
Are you mistaking me for someone else?

206
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,550
No. I recognize you.

207
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,750
You...

208
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,772
It must be you.

209
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,610
It's you.

210
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:10,920
Definitely you.

211
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,620
Boss.

212
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,600
Once you're done talking to yourself, please talk to me.

213
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,120
Hold on.

214
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,940
Don't tell me,

215
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,370
are you my fan?

216
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,600
That's not exactly it.

217
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,433
But I can't fully deny it.

218
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:38,373
I feel anxious when you're gone.

219
00:16:40,047 --> 00:16:42,000
I wasn't sure it was you at first.

220
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,110
But once I get to talk to you more, I'm confident—

221
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,110
Damn!

222
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,763
I didn't curse at you. I was just surprised.

223
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,226
So you like watching game streams, too?

224
00:16:55,226 --> 00:16:59,250
Which livestream did you like or were you just impressed by my competitions?

225
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,240
Games?

226
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,350
Well, I know I'm good at playing games.

227
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:07,100
Especially, when I compete. I look extra cool.

228
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:12,347
I just didn't realize the CEO of Phenomenal Gaming was one of my fans.

229
00:17:12,347 --> 00:17:14,540
If I brag about this on my stream, people will go cra—

230
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,705
Do you play games too?

231
00:17:16,705 --> 00:17:20,120
That's why you can develop Jack's opinion.

232
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,263
If you didn't have any experience,

233
00:17:22,263 --> 00:17:25,049
you must have watched so many game movies.

234
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:26,293
Are you remembering the wrong person?

235
00:17:26,293 --> 00:17:28,366
No. I'm definitely right.

236
00:17:28,366 --> 00:17:31,706
If I'm wrong, you must be someone who resembles him so much.

237
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,580
It has to be you.

238
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,183
I'm so lost here.

239
00:17:37,183 --> 00:17:40,703
Stop talking to yourself and talk to me, please.

240
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,322
It's really you.

241
00:18:50,466 --> 00:18:52,266
So how is it? Tender, right?

242
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,440
Hey, Laem.

243
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,560
How was your first day of internship?

244
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,580
My dear nong Zo, I don't want to brag.

245
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:03,913
Even the fierce boss surrendered to me.

246
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,240
Zo, you should ask Ai Jack instead.

247
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,220
Do you think you'll get a decent answer from Ai Laem?

248
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,803
I don't think so.

249
00:19:11,803 --> 00:19:13,696
Hey, Ai P'Three!

250
00:19:13,696 --> 00:19:15,740
I'm only speaking the truth!

251
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:20,140
Over ten people in the meeting room had their eyes locked on me.

252
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,573
They were all listening to me!

253
00:19:22,573 --> 00:19:26,213
There were only eight people in the room.

254
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,610
Yes, whatever!

255
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:35,150
What's important is that the boss listened to my opinion without interruptions.

256
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,453
Is that true, P'Jack?

257
00:19:36,453 --> 00:19:39,423
Ai Zo, why did you ask that? Don't you believe me?

258
00:19:39,423 --> 00:19:42,320
- I do.
- What he said was somewhat true.

259
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,760
The boss doesn't usually listen to anyone.

260
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,380
Especially interns like him.

261
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:51,120
Maybe he talked so much that the boss didn't get a chance to interrupt.

262
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,290
- That's exactly what I thought.
- Right?

263
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,930
Speaking of which,

264
00:19:54,930 --> 00:20:00,130
Ai Laem, you haven't told me why the boss asked to see you.

265
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:14,873
It's really you.

266
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,170
The owner of the channel, Die With My Food ASMR.

267
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,770
Hey!

268
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,180
Do you watch ASMR videos, too?

269
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:28,220
Yes. I began watching them when I started having trouble sleeping.

270
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,953
And I just so happen to like your channel the most.

271
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,650
You're making me blush.

272
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,460
I didn't think you'd recognize me.

273
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,010
Can you believe

274
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:41,080
I showed my videos to the people on my team once and they couldn't recognize me.

275
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,414
By the way, where have you been? You haven't uploaded anything in a week.

276
00:20:44,414 --> 00:20:48,053
Ah, I went and got my wisdom tooth removed.

277
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,026
Boss, how about this?

278
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:56,926
If you like my voice, how about we talk more casually?

279
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,870
I give an inch and you want a mile?

280
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:09,420
Even though I like your voice very much,

281
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:13,573
it doesn't mean I will be friends with an intern, Cher.

282
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:18,480
You can call me Laem. It might get us closer.

283
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,000
No.

284
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,060
I'm calling you Cher.

285
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,120
There's one more thing you should know.

286
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,209
I don't like skinship.

287
00:21:28,209 --> 00:21:31,003
But you touched my face first.

288
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,860
Whatever you say, Boss.

289
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:41,576
Right. When will you upload the new video?

290
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,830
If I can get it done, I'll probably upload it later tonight.

291
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:49,710
By the time I finish my errands it'll be 9-10 p.m.

292
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:53,000
Then I will edit the video until, like, 11 p.m.

293
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,700
Why?

294
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:09,693
If it's so late, you don't have to upload the video.

295
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,633
Why not?

296
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,580
Because tonight,

297
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:21,173
I'll call you and listen to your voice.

298
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,100
What?

299
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,300
Hey, Ai Laem!

300
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,300
Wow! Have you been possessed?

301
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,210
You've been quiet and still for a minute.

302
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:50,380
Are you okay?

303
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,606
Is he calling for real?

304
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,420
Guys, I think I'm going to go.

305
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,120
I forgot I had something to do.

306
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,640
- Hey!
- Hey!

307
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,666
Hold on, Ai Laem.

308
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:08,300
You haven't answered my question.

309
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,170
Or did Boss fire you? Is that why you don't want to tell?

310
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:13,860
That would be too bad if he fired me.

311
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,970
Let's put it this way.

312
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:20,970
Your big boss is just my little fan.

313
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,940
Hurry up and be nice to me.

314
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:27,380
I'll be beneficial to your team in the future, Ai P'Jack!

315
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,880
Ai Laem.

316
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,620
What do you even mean?

317
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,690
You guys don't have to know.

318
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:35,883
I'm out of here.

319
00:23:35,883 --> 00:23:37,383
Hey.

320
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,366
Are you going to tell us or not, Ai Laem?

321
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:44,120
- I'm going to poke your eyes out.
- I'm doing the same to you.

322
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,020
Fine. I give up.

323
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:03,990
Oh, it's past 10 now.

324
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,280
Are you going to call or what?

325
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,213
Otherwise, I'll take a shower and go to bed.

326
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,120
Hello, Khun Sarun. You have an unreceived parcel.

327
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,900
- Please transfer your money...
- Damn it!

328
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:09,180
It's almost 11, man. The post office is still open or what?

329
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:12,540
Hey, why don't you try finding a new job?

330
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:15,480
Aren't you afraid of karma for scamming people like this?

331
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,980
I hope one day your family and relatives get scammed too and get all their money stolen.

332
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:23,800
Then you will know how your victims feel.

333
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,753
Goodnight, Phi!

334
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,370
- Hello?
- Hi, Boss.

335
00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:01,580
It's my bad I didn't tell you the exact time you should call.

336
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,500
But I'm so sleepy now.

337
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,533
I'm afraid I'll fall asleep when you call. And you'll think I don't keep my word.

338
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,020
I was just going to...

339
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,680
What should I do to put you to sleep?

340
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,500
Will it help if I keep talking? Or me chewing?

341
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,640
But I just had BBQ pork, Boss. I'm really stuffed right now.

342
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,233
It'd be too mean to make me eat again, Boss.

343
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,340
Then I'll ask questions and you answer.

344
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,200
Is there any limit?

345
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,500
I'm so sleepy.

346
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:36,587
Cher, If you're sleepy, you can go to sleep. I won't stop you.

347
00:26:36,587 --> 00:26:38,730
Hey, no way.

348
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:43,226
What if I fall asleep and you have a hard time sleeping?

349
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,280
Do you care that much about someone you've known for one day?

350
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,840
Yes, I've known you for a day.

351
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,026
But you've known me for a long time already, right?

352
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:08,940
Oh, right. How did you get my number?

353
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,390
I asked P'Aoi.

354
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:14,720
Then I must speak to Khun Aoi and tell her that disclosing my number is punishable.

355
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,490
Hey, Boss.

356
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:19,980
Boss, please don't blame, P'Aoi.

357
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,010
You know how I am.

358
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:25,370
We kept talking until P'Aoi got carried away and gave me your phone number.

359
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:28,920
If I didn't receive the nickname Ai Laem, there was another other for me.

360
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,180
They say I talk until monkeys sleep.

361
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,950
What are you laughing at?

362
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:37,570
It's because I talk until monkeys sleep.

363
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:40,986
That means, if I talk until monkeys sleep, that means you're a monkey.

364
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,950
What's my name?

365
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,260
Why do you ask? Or is it because you don't know what to ask?

366
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,030
I want to test your knowledge.

367
00:27:56,030 --> 00:28:01,700
To see how much you know about my company before entering my company.

368
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,180
Come on, Boss.

369
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:07,640
Shouldn't a knowledge check be conducted during the interview stage?

370
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,410
Your name is Gungawin.

371
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:13,600
Anything else you want to ask?

372
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,400
What am I like?

373
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:20,780
From what I heard...

374
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,360
you're a very harsh person.

375
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,160
You don't listen to other people's opinions.

376
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,606
And you seem like you don't have many friends.

377
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,780
But I don't think you're that extreme. Right?

378
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,780
Frankly speaking, I don't know.

379
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:40,553
Ever since I was born, I've never been harsh on myself.

380
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,570
Boss, let me tell you something.

381
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:47,450
You don't have to be so strict.

382
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:51,120
With your tie so tight to your neck every day, don't you feel uncomfortable?

383
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,840
Allow your shirts to have wrinkles from time to time.

384
00:28:54,386 --> 00:28:58,453
And for your coffee, how about you drink something else sometimes?

385
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:03,213
Why is that? Do you want me to step outside of the box?

386
00:29:03,213 --> 00:29:05,673
The coffee order is too long. I'm too lazy to remember it.

387
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,933
I'm kidding.

388
00:29:12,933 --> 00:29:16,000
Yes, I want you to try stepping out of your comfort zone.

389
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,370
I think creating games is like cooking.

390
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:25,490
You add this and that for your clients.

391
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:27,740
If you don't know your ingredients well,

392
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:31,900
you wouldn't know which ingredients should be mixed, right?

393
00:29:31,906 --> 00:29:34,180
Something like that.

394
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:41,410
Am I talking too much?

395
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:44,240
People have warned me many times.

396
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,140
I just can't help it.

397
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:52,460
If I wasn't nicknamed "Laem" first, people might call me "foul-mouthed" instead.

398
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:57,446
Let's just say I won't mind what you say tonight.

399
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,640
I should have said it more savagely then.

400
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,410
Hey. Are you asking for a mile after you get an inch?

401
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:05,700
I'll take that as a compliment, Boss.

402
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,620
You don't mind me. I don't mind you.

403
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,420
We're even.

404
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,700
You're just...

405
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:17,760
I think he's sleepy now, Boss.

406
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,873
I meant, Ai Laem.

407
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:25,840
Cher? Cher?

408
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:43,113
Goodnight, Cher.

409
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,140
Did you get any sleep?

410
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,380
I did.

411
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:35,840
Believe it or not, since I started my internship up until now,

412
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,370
I haven't played any games yet.

413
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:39,780
That's good.

414
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:43,020
What happened last night with the boss? Did he call?

415
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,650
No.

416
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:47,570
- Good.
- Because I called him.

417
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:50,820
It's good he didn't call. Why did you call him?

418
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,520
Well, I hate when things don't happen as scheduled.

419
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:58,230
He said he'd call, so he has to. He said we'd talk, so we did.

420
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:01,340
Ai Laem, please spare the boss.

421
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,996
Don't get on his nerves.

422
00:32:02,996 --> 00:32:05,230
I'm not getting on his nerves.

423
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:08,860
I'm trying to help your boss get a good night's sleep.

424
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:14,006
Why do you always misinterpret my good intentions?

425
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:19,250
Ai Laem! Fine. It's up to you then.

426
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:22,666
But if you get fired before your internship is over,

427
00:32:22,666 --> 00:32:25,550
I'll just say you deserve it.

428
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:27,510
Ai Laem!

429
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,480
Hop on.

430
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,639
You always look for trouble.

431
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:35,106
Ai Laem, will you be more precise?

432
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:38,780
If you're nagging so much, why don't you do it yourself?

433
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:42,760
Kids, it's lunchtime. How about we have papaya salad today?

434
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,470
Oh, I'd love to take you to Jae Phon's restaurant.

435
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:47,820
It's the best papaya ever!

436
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,465
Really? Where's that?

437
00:32:49,465 --> 00:32:51,520
- Udon Thani.
- Damn you!

438
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,320
It's his mom's shop, Jae.

439
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,860
Phon is his mother's name.

440
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:59,966
Ah! Your mother's name is Phon.

441
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:02,600
Come on, Jae!

442
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,820
We stopped making fun of other people's parents' names long ago.

443
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:08,040
Do people still do it these days?

444
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,160
Oh, I forgot.

445
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,396
You're from the old days.

446
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,120
You'll get what's coming!

447
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,270
Are we going or not? Come on. Chop-chop.

448
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:22,020
- Jae, you've said it, alright.
- Free food...

449
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:25,180
Oops! Why are we stopping?

450
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,020
Boss.

451
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:31,054
Why are you late for work today?

452
00:33:31,647 --> 00:33:35,300
I stopped by the hotel to check on something. Why?

453
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,489
Nothing. I was just asking because you're late.

454
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,653
Boss?

455
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:43,750
Ai Laem!

456
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,660
Will you stop talking?

457
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,730
Your mom should've shut your mouth with coal as a kid.

458
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:51,386
Why are you nagging, Ai P'Jack?

459
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,080
What's the matter?

460
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,520
Ah, nothing.

461
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,720
We're going out for papaya salad.

462
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,300
Would you like to join—

463
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,905
Ow! I just got bitten by an ant.

464
00:34:06,905 --> 00:34:08,537
You pinched the wrong person!

465
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,820
Ai Laem!

466
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,160
No, thanks.

467
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,654
But please get a coffee for me on the way back. My regular.

468
00:34:14,654 --> 00:34:16,466
What do you mean, regular?

469
00:34:16,466 --> 00:34:19,773
I'll get you something new. It'll surely be good!

470
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:24,050
For sure!

471
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:26,740
Please excuse us now, Boss.

472
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,173
Oops. Wrong way.

473
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:35,640
Let's go, hurry!

474
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,720
What's wrong with you guys?

475
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,970
- Don't say that!
- Ai Laem! How can you say that?

476
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:41,367
- You can't say it like that.
- But he came late, though.

477
00:34:41,367 --> 00:34:43,966
You can't!

478
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,952
- Just a moment, please.
- Sure.

479
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,093
Nong Cher.

480
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,160
Yes?

481
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,640
It's better to be careful, dear.

482
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,226
Uh... careful for what?

483
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:07,250
Well, we can't say much.

484
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:09,590
Can you spill it just a little then?

485
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:13,140
Let's just say don't get too close to the boss.

486
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:16,430
Especially alone together. Don't!

487
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:21,120
You're saying it like he's a serial killer or something.

488
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,320
Although he's not,

489
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,640
we can't say much.

490
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,333
We're warning you because we mean well.

491
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:34,603
You're slender framed and look mixed. Be careful of...

492
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:37,740
You know...

493
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:42,670
Thank you so much for your concern.

494
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,914
What era is this already?

495
00:35:43,914 --> 00:35:46,680
Who eats who or who gets eaten is their choice to make.
(TN: He's talking about sexual orientation)

496
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,960
For example, you can choose what you want to eat at your lunchtime.

497
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,020
Right?

498
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,520
Yes.

499
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,839
Your coffee is ready.

500
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,320
Thank you.

501
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,945
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

502
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:10,420
What would you like to order?

503
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:13,300
An extra-iced white mocha, with non-fat milk, and no syrup.

504
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,546
I got you whipped cream today.

505
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:18,293
You didn't knock.

506
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,080
I just did.

507
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,170
I got you tuna sandwiches too.

508
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:30,200
P'Aoi said it's the only type of sandwich you eat. Right?

509
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,900
Right.

510
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,410
But I didn't order it.

511
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:37,632
And I don't eat whipped cream either.

512
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,280
Come on, Boss.

513
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,860
We talked about this last night. About stepping outside of your comfort zone.

514
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:46,320
I was so sleepy, yet I remember it.

515
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,960
Don't you remember?

516
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:52,100
I even thought I'd get you a completely new menu, but I was afraid you couldn't eat it.

517
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:55,750
So I just altered it a little. Let's adjust it step by step.

518
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,643
I'll give you this one, and you get me a new one.

519
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:08,800
Come on. Do you really need a new one?

520
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,980
It's more than 100 baht per cup.

521
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,500
How about I get rid of the whipped cream for you?

522
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,020
It's wasteful to throw the whole thing away.

523
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,660
I said to get me a new one. So please go get it.

524
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,010
Hold on.

525
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:47,480
The new cup can be anything you want me to drink.

526
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:51,326
But no whipped cream. I really don't like it.

527
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,070
Of course, Boss!

528
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:59,352
I'll tell the barista to make the best coffee for you.

529
00:37:59,352 --> 00:38:01,273
Just a moment, please.

530
00:38:10,277 --> 00:38:12,990
Why do I always give in to you, Cher?

531
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:14,790
Who are you?

532
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,560
Okay. Thank you.

533
00:38:58,584 --> 00:39:03,178
So? Have you realized the disadvantage of not knocking on the door now?

534
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,260
I mistakenly took the sandwiches with me.

535
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:12,130
I'm returning them to you in case you're hungry.

543
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:48,820
Let's say there are 60 million people in Thailand.
[Next Week]

544
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:53,030
You might think you can control all of them, Boss.

545
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:56,120
But in fact, you can't control two people.

546
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,960
It's you, yourself.

547
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:03,720
- And Ai Laem, here.
- You've never had such delicious noodles, have you?

548
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,920
I'll give you a chance to surrender.

549
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:12,753
I told you, Boss. You can't control me.
