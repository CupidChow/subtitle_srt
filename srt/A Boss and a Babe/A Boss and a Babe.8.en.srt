00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,577
What the fuck are you doing?

00:00:20,577 --> 00:00:23,153
Why am I so disappointed in you this time?

Who knows what you've touched with your hands.

21
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,340
It will be a huge problem if it gets infected.

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,710
Oh, I do have a swollen eye!

23
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:22,457

How are you holding up?

34
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,360
Are you feeling any better?

35
00:02:47,856 --> 00:02:49,776
I called,

36
00:02:49,776 --> 00:02:52,284
but Ai Thoop had his phone turned off.

37
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,756
Wait until he calms down.

38
00:02:57,756 --> 00:03:00,656
Then you can call him again.

39
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,600
Can I slack off for just a bit?

00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,244

00:04:27,876 --> 00:04:31,376
Jack, you should warn him.

48
00:04:31,376 --> 00:04:34,968
He should be more discreet with his behaviors.

50
00:04:36,852 --> 00:04:40,870
the Game Design Department will get things approved so easily

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,104
Can you please explain this?

Someone claims the game we just launched belonged to someone else before.

113
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,530
Did you steal someone else's idea?

00:09:50,117 --> 00:09:52,068
That's not it, Boss.

115
00:09:52,068 --> 00:09:53,800

116
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,050

117
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:01,424

118
00:10:01,424 --> 00:10:03,010

119
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:06,352

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,730
What are you talking about?

130
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,164
Come on! Come on!

131
00:11:26,164 --> 00:11:28,816
Do you really want to make my life hell?

132
00:11:28,816 --> 00:11:31,872
- What is wrong with you?
- You should ask yourself that question.

133
00:11:31,872 --> 00:11:34,253
Do you want to take everything from me?

134
00:11:34,253 --> 00:11:38,920
I never wanted anything from you except friendship.

135
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,323

00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:50,224
A selfish bastard like you will have no one left.

Driving from Bangkok to Chonburi takes less than 40 minutes.

146
00:13:00,612 --> 00:13:06,040
I'm sure the speeding fines are way greater than the gas price.

Or do you not see me?

151
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:31,328
Oh! Maybe we drove so fast

152
00:13:31,328 --> 00:13:34,735
that the car fell off the highway and we died—

153
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:53,240
It's okay, Boss.

154
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,180
Just cry.

155
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,300

Are you really not going anywhere?

160

I'm really not.

161
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:46,280
I don't agree with asking Ai Laem to stay away from the boss.

162
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:50,200
I know. I just don't know what else to do.

I know, Zo. I don't want to butt in, actually.

165
00:14:55,536 --> 00:14:57,810
But people in the company are pressuring me.

166
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:01,335
So if the boss wasn't the CEO of the company

167
00:15:01,335 --> 00:15:04,050
and was just the owner of a gaming café like me,

168
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:07,008
then they would be allowed to date?

169
00:15:07,008 --> 00:15:08,040
Is that it?

170
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:12,380
Must we conceal someone's feelings with our opinions and feelings?

171
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,665
Shit. They are lovers. Think about it.

172
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:17,020
I understand you. I understand it well.

173
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:20,480
I don't want it to be like this. I don't want to stop them.

174
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,756
I just wanted Ai Cher to complete his internship first.

175
00:15:25,756 --> 00:15:27,720
It's better that way.

176
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,216
I feel bad for P'Laem.

177
00:15:32,412 --> 00:15:37,150
Before you do anything, please consult us first, Ai Jack.

178
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,076
Got it?

179
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:50,990
I think destiny sometimes plays with our lives, Boss.

180
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,810
The other day, I had trouble.

181
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:56,669
Today, you did.

182
00:15:56,669 --> 00:16:00,609
At least destiny is kind.

183
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,156
How?

184
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,288
It doesn't leave us to stay alone.

185
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,976
That's true.

186
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,980
Cher.

187
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,410
Are you angry with your little brother?

188
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,328
Do you mean Ai Thoop?

189
00:16:27,584 --> 00:16:29,700
Can you believe this?

190
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,400
I've never been angry with him.

191
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,112
I'm used to it.

192
00:16:38,512 --> 00:16:40,932
Thoop is Tian's younger brother, right?

193
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,590
Yes.

194
00:17:03,252 --> 00:17:08,380
Their father died when they were young.

195
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,788
Once their stepfather came into the picture,

196
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:14,160
the family became a mess.

197
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:18,056
He's an alcoholic and a drug addict.

198
00:17:19,032 --> 00:17:21,530
He physically abused them too.

199
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,400
I saw everything.

200
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,556
I knew how much Tian wanted to take Thoop away from that hellhole,

201
00:17:29,556 --> 00:17:32,056
but she couldn't bear it anymore.

202
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,888
She decided to escape.

203
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,200
Even P'Tian didn't want to live.

204
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,416
Why should I live on?

205
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,092
Live to lead your own life.

206
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:53,508
Ai Thoop, the pain is still fresh.

207
00:17:53,508 --> 00:17:56,880
That's why you think the world is too dark.

208
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,577
But this is life.

209
00:17:59,577 --> 00:18:01,872
Things happen all the time to put your patience to the test.

210
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:05,419
If it's so exhausting, why should I live on?

211
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,784
Live for yourself...

212
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,416
and for Tian.

213
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:16,104
For P'Tian?

214
00:18:17,648 --> 00:18:19,248
Yes.

215
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,436
She used to tell me...

216
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,740
she wanted to have higher education so she could get a good job...

217
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:37,140
and take you away to start a new life.

218
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,290
To get away from these people.

219
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:44,040
But she couldn't make it in the end.

220
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,396
That's why you're the only one left

221
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,384
to make a good life and take her away from here.

222
00:18:58,044 --> 00:19:00,480
I think of him as a brother.

223
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,480
A real brother.

224
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,468
I want to help him through this difficult time.

225
00:19:07,056 --> 00:19:09,260
What about you?

226
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:13,776
About that Thyme guy, why did he hit you?

227
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:24,400
I'm also asking myself the same question.

228
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,230
You know?

229
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:30,760
I hadn't even met him since we talked that day.

230
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,016
I'm as clueless as you are.

231
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,340
Leave it at that then.

232
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,176
You already got punched after all.

233
00:19:41,928 --> 00:19:45,380
Does it hurt, though?

234
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,440
Why did you touch my bruise?

235
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,424
I want to know if it still hurts.

236
00:20:06,576 --> 00:20:09,308
I wonder why I like you so much.

237
00:20:12,456 --> 00:20:15,250
You said you like me, just like that?

238
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,460
Do you like me, Cher?

239
00:20:21,404 --> 00:20:23,620
What the heck?

240
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:27,250
Come on. Do you? Tell me.

241
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,964
Yes. Along those lines.

242
00:21:22,832 --> 00:21:25,060
Are you taking advantage of me?

243
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,804
I'm not!

244
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,496
I'm just checking.

245
00:21:35,496 --> 00:21:39,236
I took a rich boy out to sleep all night in the dew.

246
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:44,832
If you got sick and died from a fever, how would I return you to your mom?

247
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,232
Hey.

248
00:21:46,937 --> 00:21:48,647
Do you care about me?

249
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:56,056
Hey, Boss, did the teacher not teach you how to interpret sentences in high school?

250
00:21:56,056 --> 00:21:57,984
That was not what I meant.

251
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:08,990
It wasn't as beautiful as this last night.

252
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:14,048
Exactly.

253
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,760
Come on.

254
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,588
Let's get in the water.

255
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,593
No. I don't have clothes to change into.

256
00:22:25,593 --> 00:22:26,819
Your car will get wet.

257
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:30,032
I could just buy a new car. It's fine.

258
00:22:30,032 --> 00:22:32,500
Come on. Let's play in the water.

259
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,360
Come on, get up.

260
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,124
- Let's go.
- Fine!

261
00:22:39,248 --> 00:22:41,216
Boss!

262
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:53,330
♫ You whispered softly that you love me, but it rings loudly in my heart ♫

263
00:22:53,330 --> 00:23:00,090
♫ If I could hear your voice before sleeping, it would be so wonderful ♫

264
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:07,040
♫ Sometimes the sky is overcast, but now I have you to lead the path ♫

265
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,290
♫ You're more precious than anything, I can't lose you ♫

266
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:15,230
♫ Because you're the only one that's meaningful ♫

267
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:22,288
It's as if we're in a different world right now.

268
00:23:22,288 --> 00:23:24,132
You're right.

269
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,756
I'm weirdly happy.

270
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,648
So do you feel happy or weird exactly?

271
00:23:32,648 --> 00:23:36,540
I'm so happy that I'm scared this happiness will disappear.

272
00:23:38,368 --> 00:23:40,840
If your happiness is me,

273
00:23:42,488 --> 00:23:44,540
it won't.

274
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,340
Right.

275
00:23:48,864 --> 00:23:51,064
It won't disappear.

276
00:23:58,648 --> 00:24:00,560
Let's go back.

277
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,568
We don't want to be late for work.

278
00:24:02,568 --> 00:24:06,512
What are you afraid of? The company owner is right here.

279
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,036
I'm afraid you'd go 200 km/h again.

280
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,872
Dying before my mom

281
00:24:13,872 --> 00:24:15,580
is a no for me.

282
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,749
Come on. Back to work.

283
00:24:27,064 --> 00:24:28,686
Do you have the energy?

284
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,024
Is that all the strength you have?

285
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:35,388
Boss, don't tease me!

286
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,316
It is zipped up.

287
00:24:58,816 --> 00:25:00,390
Yes?

288
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:02,403
I feel like people are staring.

289
00:25:02,403 --> 00:25:03,703
Forget it.

290
00:25:04,477 --> 00:25:06,852
Get whatever coffee for me, please.

291
00:25:06,852 --> 00:25:08,700
Sure, Boss.

292
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,569
Good morning, all.

293
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:21,640
Ai Laem. Where did you go last night?

294
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,380
Around here.

295
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,211
With the boss?

296
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,940
Yes.

297
00:25:35,528 --> 00:25:39,580
Hey. I have something to discuss.

298
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:43,551
Can we talk in the evening? I need to get him coffee.

299
00:25:44,264 --> 00:25:45,864
Do you want anything?

300
00:25:45,864 --> 00:25:47,664
No.

301
00:25:47,664 --> 00:25:49,010
Jae, do you want anything?

302
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:51,120
No, thanks.

303
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,408
Ai Laem, we're having BBQ with the team this evening.

304
00:25:56,408 --> 00:25:59,724
Okay. Can I bring the boss?

305
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,948
I'll go buy coffee now. Be right back.

306
00:26:01,948 --> 00:26:03,448
Bye.

307
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,940
Your coffee is served.

308
00:26:23,288 --> 00:26:24,992
By the way, Boss,

309
00:26:24,992 --> 00:26:28,320
a university instructor will pay this company a visit next week.

310
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,560
You won't be bothered, though. It's just a regular company visit.

311
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,359
I just want to let you know.

312
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,610
If the professor is coming,

313
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:39,100
that means your internship is almost over, right?

314
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:42,960
Right. In half a month.

315
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:48,720
Speaking of which, I'm a little down that it's over soon.

316
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,329
It's okay to feel down,

317
00:26:50,329 --> 00:26:54,996
but if you fail me just to keep me here, I'll be pissed.

318
00:26:57,728 --> 00:26:59,864
Can I do that?

319
00:26:59,864 --> 00:27:01,872
Am I teaching a fish to swim?

320
00:27:01,872 --> 00:27:03,672
I'm kidding.

321
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,168
I can come by even after my internship is done.

322
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:09,860
My university is just right here.

323
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:13,732
But I won't get to see you every day as I do now.

324
00:27:15,392 --> 00:27:17,492
You're whining again.

325
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:24,145
How about... you just move in with me then?

326
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,156
Are you crazy?

327
00:27:30,156 --> 00:27:32,760
Boss, we have BBQ this evening—

328
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,660
I'm in.

329
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,850
You're so easy.

330
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:40,120
It depends on who's asking.

331
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,928
Okay. I'll see you this evening.

332
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:44,560
I'm off now. Bye.

333
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,760
We missed you, Boss. It's been a while.

334
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,160
I missed you guys, too.

335
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,080
I haven't seen you all in a while.

336
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,030
Eat more, P'Boss.

337
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:05,320
We have lots of pork in the kitchen.

338
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,627
Sure. P'Boss, it is.

339
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,336
The veggies are all gone.

340
00:28:12,336 --> 00:28:14,850
- I'll go get some. Do you want anything?
- Yes.

341
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:19,368
Bring my boyfriend Zo his favorite, the cheesy tofu.

342
00:28:19,368 --> 00:28:23,080
Wow. Do you really need to highlight "Zo's favorite"?

343
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,648
I do.

344
00:28:24,648 --> 00:28:26,510
Because he's my love.

345
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:28,030
What? What will you do?

346
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:32,032
All right, Sir. I'll bring Zo his favorite right away.

347
00:28:32,032 --> 00:28:34,656
You can stay with them, right, Boss?

348
00:28:34,656 --> 00:28:36,504
Of course. No problem at all.

349
00:28:36,504 --> 00:28:38,073
Can you get that for me?

350
00:28:39,776 --> 00:28:41,370
Thank you.

351
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:43,370
Make it quick.

352
00:28:46,668 --> 00:28:48,588
I'll go help Ai Laem.

353
00:28:50,368 --> 00:28:52,708
It's heavy. He can't carry it by himself.

354
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:58,580
It's nothing, Boss. Let's just eat.

355
00:29:06,877 --> 00:29:08,174
What are you doing here?

356
00:29:08,174 --> 00:29:10,192
Why aren't you eating?

357
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,828
I'm here to help you.

358
00:29:12,828 --> 00:29:16,368
Come on. I can carry this small tray.

359
00:29:18,292 --> 00:29:20,232
What is it between you and the boss?

360
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,560
Why are you asking?

361
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:27,060
I mean, which stage are you and the boss at?

362
00:29:28,232 --> 00:29:30,140
You suddenly want to know about my business.

363
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,440
When did you become so meddlesome, huh?

364
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,992
You should stop it now, Ai Cher.

365
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:38,791
What are you talking about, Ai P'Jack?

366
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:43,643
People at the company are having so much fun gossiping about you and him.

367
00:29:43,643 --> 00:29:47,607
Especially that day he took your hand and went out, it became a huge topic for gossip.

368
00:29:48,776 --> 00:29:50,276
So?

369
00:29:51,636 --> 00:29:55,872
I know you don't care about other people's words.

370
00:29:55,872 --> 00:29:58,560
Right. So why are you saying this?

371
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,340
It's not just me who doesn't care. The boss doesn't, either.

372
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,556
But you must.

373
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:08,080
Why must I care about other people?

374
00:30:08,844 --> 00:30:10,344
There.

375
00:30:11,296 --> 00:30:14,156
- You should care about the boss's feelings.
- Your favorite, Zo.

376
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:22,472
Once the internship is done, you're gone.

377
00:30:22,472 --> 00:30:26,470
But the boss

378
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:29,330
must stay on and manage people.

379
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:35,952
But you said you were glad I could make him smile again, didn't you?

380
00:30:35,952 --> 00:30:41,060
Yes, I said that. And I'm glad we're close to him.

381
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:44,680
We eat BBQ together. We went to the beach together. We're friends.

382
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,484
Right.

383
00:30:46,484 --> 00:30:49,750
And now you want me to leave him?

384
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:53,356
Do you think this kind of relationship is appropriate?

385
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:59,550
You don't need to answer me now,

386
00:31:00,072 --> 00:31:02,576
but for tomorrow and the days to come,

387
00:31:02,576 --> 00:31:04,770
just think about it.

388
00:31:07,696 --> 00:31:12,048
Is a CEO of a company and an intern appropriate?

389
00:31:18,048 --> 00:31:20,330
Here you go.

390
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:22,360
What took you so long?

391
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,972
I spent time choosing the cheese balls for him.

392
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,030
Cher.

393
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,736
Are you okay?

394
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:45,428
I've got smoke in my eyes.

395
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,890
Does it hurt? Are you all right?

396
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:52,827
It does, but I'm fine.

397
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,908
Boss, are you done eating?

398
00:32:08,568 --> 00:32:10,316
I want to leave.

399
00:32:13,683 --> 00:32:15,864
I'm done, too.

400
00:32:15,864 --> 00:32:18,680
Guys, would you excuse me?

401
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,032
Let's meet again some other time.

402
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:25,097
- Sure.
- Of course. Please feel free.

403
00:32:25,097 --> 00:32:28,550
We can eat this every day.

404
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:30,840
I'll be leaving then.

405
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,473
Ai Jack, did you talk to him?

406
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:51,200
Yes. I couldn't wait any longer.

407
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,123
The deeper they go, the harder it'll be for them to get out of it.

408
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:01,470
Will P'Laem be okay?

409
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:06,452
I've never seen him like this ever since I knew him.

410
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:52,050
Goodnight, Cher.

411
00:33:54,752 --> 00:33:56,581
Boss.

412
00:33:56,581 --> 00:33:58,008
Hm?

413
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,180
Why do you like me?

414
00:34:03,957 --> 00:34:08,760
We won't be able to sleep if I start talking about it.

415
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,160
It's a lot.

416
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:18,664
Do you ever think that one day you'll not like me anymore?

417
00:34:21,008 --> 00:34:23,400
Why would you ask that?

418
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:28,270
It's nothing. It was a random thought,

419
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:30,640
so I just wanted to ask.

420
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,504
Are you okay?

421
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:43,628
Goodnight, Boss.

422
00:34:46,928 --> 00:34:50,588
Sweet dreams. See you tomorrow.

423
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:07,704

What time is it?

428
00:36:04,056 --> 00:36:05,860
Is it late?

429
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,440
Let's not go to work together.

430
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,880
Why?

431
00:36:19,368 --> 00:36:22,170
I'll go back to my dorm first.

432
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:24,283
I wonder if I left the window open.

433
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:26,553
If it rains, my room will be flooded.

434
00:36:28,351 --> 00:36:31,540
We can stop by your dorm together, actually.

435
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,544
That's all right.

436
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:37,312
Ai P'Jack messaged me saying he'd pick me up at the dorm.

437
00:36:37,312 --> 00:36:39,211
I don't want to say no to him.

438
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,580
Do your friends know the thing between us?

439
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:46,659
Actually, you can tell Jack. I think he has an idea already.

440
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:50,774
The thing between us...

441
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,080
What thing?

442
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:57,890
Cher, is there something wrong?

443
00:36:58,848 --> 00:37:01,240
You've been acting weird since last night.

444
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,112
I'm fine.

445
00:37:05,192 --> 00:37:07,410
You know I'm not a good liar.

446
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:10,460
If something is wrong, you'll be able to tell.

447
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,850
I'll go take a shower.

448
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,420
See you at the office.

449
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,785

452
00:38:11,688 --> 00:38:13,240
Jack.

453
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,364
Did you talk to him?

454
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:28,432
Did I make the wrong decision in doing this, Jae?

455
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,289
Maybe I shouldn't have meddled in his business.

456
00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:34,250
Come on. Don't make me worry about you too.

457
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:36,576
I used to have a lover, too.

458
00:38:36,576 --> 00:38:39,484
I know how painful it is to lose someone.

459
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,608
I shouldn't have done this to him.

460
00:38:42,608 --> 00:38:46,276
But you did it because you meant well.

461
00:38:49,784 --> 00:38:52,824
Let's bring him a snack.

462
00:38:52,824 --> 00:38:54,124
Come on.

463
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,140

464
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,452
Greetings, my lord.

465
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,920
I want him to feel better.

466
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,000
Thank you.

467
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,723
Eat something. I'm worried about you.

468
00:39:12,723 --> 00:39:14,563
It's good.

469
00:39:20,408 --> 00:39:21,824
That's the boss's cup.

470
00:39:21,824 --> 00:39:24,051
Yes. It's the boss's.

471
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,812
Why are you giving me this?

472
00:39:26,812 --> 00:39:29,815
Aren't you the one using it?

473
00:39:31,248 --> 00:39:32,548
Yes.

474
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,576
Are you okay?

475
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,208
What? Of course, I am.

476
00:39:49,208 --> 00:39:51,048
She was right.

477
00:39:51,048 --> 00:39:54,116
I always use this tumbler to get coffee for him.

478
00:39:54,116 --> 00:39:56,508
She must be thinking it's mine.

479
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,928
I'll go get coffee for the boss.

480
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,976
See. How can I not worry about him.

481
00:40:08,976 --> 00:40:10,928
He doesn't even care about the snack.

482
00:40:10,928 --> 00:40:12,528
Give it back.

483
00:40:15,256 --> 00:40:16,080
Quickly.

484
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,570
Didn't you give it to him?

485
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:19,460
Let me have a bite.

486
00:40:23,373 --> 00:40:25,488
Whatever coffee with no whipped cream.

487
00:40:25,488 --> 00:40:27,340
Yes.

488
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,840
Hey. Why do you look so down today?

489
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,488
Is it that obvious?

490
00:40:34,488 --> 00:40:36,680
It's so obvious.

491
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:40,705
It's nothing. My internship is nearly over.

492
00:40:40,705 --> 00:40:42,250
It just feels odd.

493
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:46,504
So I'll finally get to see the owner of this tumbler.

494
00:40:46,504 --> 00:40:48,288
I guess so...

495
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,560
if he doesn't tell the next intern to get coffee for him.

496
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,032
He might look a little grumpy.

497
00:40:54,032 --> 00:40:55,584
Don't be afraid of him.

498
00:40:55,584 --> 00:41:00,056
When I'm not around, please take care of him.

499
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:03,900
Make him some delicious coffee.

500
00:41:05,608 --> 00:41:07,310
Okay.

501
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:09,204
Just a moment.

502
00:41:42,772 --> 00:41:45,044
How did you have this tumbler?

503
00:41:49,175 --> 00:41:50,791
Is Ai Gun here yet?

504
00:41:52,064 --> 00:41:55,068
Yes. He's in the office.

505
00:41:57,005 --> 00:41:58,410
Are you bringing this to him?

506
00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:01,130
- Come with me.
- I...

507
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:03,144
Can you take this to the boss?

508
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,752
Please.

00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:16,970
"Whatever is fine."

510
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:19,256
Did he have this tumbler made for you?

511
00:42:19,256 --> 00:42:22,792
He made it before his internship was over. I just have to take this to the café,

512
00:42:22,792 --> 00:42:25,230
and the barista will take it from there.

513
00:42:26,532 --> 00:42:28,664
Wow! That's super cute.

514
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:33,000
Why are you making that face?

515
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,824
What's wrong?

516
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,576
I don't know what's wrong with Cher.

517
00:42:41,576 --> 00:42:44,540
He's acting weird. He's avoiding me.

518
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:47,056
He even asked you to bring me coffee.

519
00:42:47,056 --> 00:42:49,620
Did you do something that upset him?

520
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,312
No. We still hugged each other to sleep last night.

521
00:42:56,832 --> 00:42:59,136
Sleeping, that means just sleeping.

522
00:42:59,136 --> 00:43:01,360
I haven't said anything yet.

523
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,216
Maybe I mistakenly did something wrong.

524
00:43:03,216 --> 00:43:05,772
Did you do anything that made him angry?

525
00:43:05,772 --> 00:43:07,696
No, I didn't.

526
00:43:07,696 --> 00:43:09,649

00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:05,864
Will you and the boss be dating secretly, or will you tell the world once you graduate?

541
00:44:05,864 --> 00:44:08,032
I don't want to lose him.

542
00:44:08,032 --> 00:44:09,352
I love him.

543
00:44:09,352 --> 00:44:10,614
And you're saying it here?

544
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:12,432
Will Nong Cher hear it?

545
00:44:12,432 --> 00:44:13,769
The boss is silly.

546
00:44:13,769 --> 00:44:15,384
He's always silly.

547
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,020
I really want to hate you.

548
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,976
It's okay. I'm willing to do anything for you.

549
00:44:20,976 --> 00:44:22,260
Can I get a hug?

550
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,650
♫ I must be the luckiest person ever ♫

551
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:30,380
♫ My heart says you're the one to love ♫

552
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:35,100
♫ I'm just someone ordinary ♫

553
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:41,410
♫ I don't have enough significance or importance ♫

554
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:44,040
♫ To make you, ♫

555
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:48,050
♫ Who is a star in the sky, lean toward me ♫

556
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:54,110
♫ I'm not worthy enough for you to love me  ♫

557
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:57,790
♫ Please go back, let the ordinary me gaze up at you ♫

558
00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:00,790
♫ I'm just someone ordinary ♫

559
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:07,070
♫ I don't have enough significance or importance ♫

560
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:09,690
♫ To make you, ♫

561
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:13,540
♫ Who is a star in the sky, lean toward me ♫

562
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:19,630
♫ I'm not worthy enough for you to love me  ♫

563
