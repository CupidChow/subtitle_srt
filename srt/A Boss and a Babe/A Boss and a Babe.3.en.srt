00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,350
Here, for you.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,100
I'll share my group of friends with you, Boss.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,420
What's going on between you and the boss?

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,850
I've never seen him this close to anyone.

5
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:15,740
You must talk to me before bed every night until I'm tired of you.

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,520
Of course. Challenge accepted.

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,320
I'm giving you a chance to surrender now.

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,680
I told you, Boss. You can't control me.

9
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,570
This team is so damn savage!

10
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,990
They are the real deal. World class players, seriously.

11
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,600
They had a great plan.

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,680
This is how they play, is it?

13
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,580
We must learn from this team.

14
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,650
Ai Laem.

15
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,950
What's wrong?

16
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,590
You're pouting like a child.

17
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,370
Hello, P'Laem. Do you want any drinks?

18
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,150
I'll get it for you.

19
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,920
Okay.

20
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,470
Zo, get him coconut water.

21
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,520
He's washing his face with it.
(TN: funeral ritual)

22
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,450
So that way he can feel refreshed—

23
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,080
You must use it to wash with all the time.

24
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,150
That's how you know it's refreshing.

25
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,230
Ai Laem...

26
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,680
- Hey.
- Easy there, guys.

27
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,850
So what's the matter?

28
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,110
Phi.

29
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:37,070
What kind of status must you have to kiss?

30
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,730
Pardon?

31
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:44,330
What status should people have to kiss each other?

32
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,640
Like this.

33
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,243
People like Zo and me.

34
00:01:48,243 --> 00:01:50,020
That's embarrassing.

35
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,130
And what if they're not lovers,

36
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,140
can they kiss?

37
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,800
Of course.

38
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,460
Spouses.

39
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,620
Damn it!

40
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,720
I can't explain.

41
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,234
- Who did you kiss?
- The bo—

42
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,590
But...

43
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,720
If I told you, you'd know.

44
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,870
And you really did bring me coconut water, Ai Zo!

45
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,980
Well, P'Three told me to. Why are you scolding me?

46
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,270
Good job!

47
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,470
If not lovers,

48
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,530
not spouses,

49
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,590
Drunk people!

50
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,570
Sometimes they kiss.

51
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,520
What if they're not drunk, not lovers,

52
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,770
what else can they be?

53
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,113
I think maybe...

54
00:02:52,113 --> 00:02:54,930
they are people who have feelings for each other.

55
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,050
Shit!

56
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,090
I'm going to go eat and come back for practice.

57
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,282
And this is freaking good.

58
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,183
- He's suspicious.
- Right. He's acting weird.

What do you mean?

69
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:44,510
My feelings or the keycard?

70

Everything is exactly the same.

71
00:04:59,707 --> 00:05:03,420
No. It's not the same.

72
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:09,490
You're staying a lot longer in Thailand this time. Is your lover okay with that?

73
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,250
He is.

74
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:16,480
He doesn't complain, doesn't get jealous, and doesn't track me down.

75
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,510
We're free to live our own lives.

Freedom.

Is there actually someone that matches your type that much?

Hey, you!

83
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,830
I wasted my time dating you because I wanted a life partner,

84
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,110
not a friend.

Right.

91
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,680
Of course.

So there really is someone?

But it seems like it's the wrong place and time.

97

I wonder who he is.

98
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:47,960
It's an employee from the office.

99
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,000
What?

100
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,244
- An intern, to be precise.
- For real?

101
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:53,631
- Yes.
- You!

102
00:06:53,631 --> 00:06:56,290
I know what you're thinking.

103
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,040

00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,760
Yes.

110
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,630
But didn't you say that it was Thyme's game?

111
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:20,440
Someone told me to fight for everyone.

Again? Easy, man. My workload has been crazy lately.

00:08:10,661 --> 00:08:12,360
You can ask Ai Laem if you don't believe me.

128
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,220
We're all swamped with work.

129
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,313
I get you. That's why I reduced practice days for you.

130
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,600
Let's call it a day then.

131
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,670
Wait, Dude. Let's do one more round. What's the hurry?

132
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,450
Let me go to sleep. It's Sunday tomorrow.

133
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:34,450
Once I open my eyes in the morning, do the laundry, clean up my room,

134
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,779
and then in a blink of an eye, here comes Monday.

135
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:38,338
That's true! Dammit!

Let's go.

139
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,160
How are you getting home, Ai Laem?

140
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,010
With you, duh!

141
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,060

142
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,550
Bye.

143
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,033
- Bye, man.
- Yes.

144
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:06,130
P'Three, are you okay?

145
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:13,010
I just feel like they're not taking this as seriously as before.

146
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,910
They always have something to do.

147
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,750
Everything else is important to them...

148
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,370
except playing games.

149
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,810
Don't think too much, P'Three.

150
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,610
As you said, they both have something important to do.

151
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,290
P'Jack needs to work. P'Laem is doing his internship.

152
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:37,480
And when I'm a university senior, I need to do my internship too.

153
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,950
Right?

154
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,700
Sure.

155
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,710
I guess I'm overthinking.

156
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:52,440
I'm afraid we'll lose the competition.

157
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,530
That'd be embarrassing.

158
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,510
You have me here.

159
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,800
How can we lose?

160
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,510
Right.

161
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,880
I forgot.

162
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,690
My boyfriend is the best in the world.

163
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:09,260
If he wasn't, how could he attack the tower and steal my heart?

164
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,750
Ouch. It hurts.

165
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,973
I want to puke.

166
00:10:11,973 --> 00:10:15,193
Do it. Puke right in my mouth.

167
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,270
15 minutes.

168
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,460
Are you talking to me, Ma'am?

169
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:29,320
Your first month of the internship isn't over yet and you're late already.

170
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,110
I'm really sorry.

171
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,810
I'm...

172
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,990
I'm sick.

173
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:40,320
I was thinking of taking a sick leave, but I didn't want to miss work.

174
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,950
So I forced myself to get up.

175
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,620
Now I'm having a headache.

176
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,190
I think I have a fever too.

177
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,110
But I'm still okay.

178
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:55,053
Take out your employee ID card. I'll write down your name.

179
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,160
Shit. How could I forget it...

180
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,330
Don't tell me you forgot to bring your ID card?

181
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,750
What's wrong?

182
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,060
Hey, Boss.

183
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,310
This intern is 15 minutes late for work, Sir.

184
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,100
He also doesn't have his employee ID card.

185
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,493
You're late. You have no card. How did you get into our company?

186
00:11:16,493 --> 00:11:18,493
I just walked in, Boss.

187
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,910
- Are you sick?
- Yes.

188
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,510
I'm sick, Boss.

189
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:32,040
I left my window open last night. The rain was splashing in on me.

190
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,633
Once I woke up, I felt sick.

191
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,861
I'll take it from here. Thank you so much.

192
00:11:39,861 --> 00:11:41,610
Sure, Sir.

193
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,910
Boss.

194
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:50,870
I can walk myself.

195
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:54,900
Aren't you sick? What if you fall on your head while walking?

196
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,510
I'm worried about you,

197
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,220
the phony intern.

198
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,690
Come here.

199
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,110
Boss.

200
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,580
- Damn it!
- Did you curse at me?

201
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,200
- I was cursing at Ai Laem!
- Right.

202
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,780
That bastard. What is he doing now?

203
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,880
Good interns should come to work

204
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,590
before everyone else and should not lie.

205
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,930
You're not wearing your uniform properly.

206
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:43,490
But your body temperature is cold. Maybe you're really sick.

207
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:44,970
That's right.

208
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:54,200
Can I take a break outside and meet you again at 10?

209
00:12:54,200 --> 00:13:00,000
Are you so fragile that you need rest for a minor illness?

210
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,310
No. It's not minor, Boss.

211
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:05,770
I'm so damaged on the inside.

212
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:08,550
I can still speak since I am in positive spirits.

213
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,473
- Damaged?
- Yes, damaged.

214
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,610
Cold.

215
00:13:48,557 --> 00:13:50,810
You got a bit warmer.

216
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,690
You're tense now.

217
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,550
Where is the good spirit you speak of?

218
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,970
I found it somewhere.

219
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,360
I think it suits you well.

220
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,040
Put your ID card in it when you get back to your room.

221
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,930
If I don't see it around your neck...

222
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:47,250
Then what? What are you going to do, Boss?

223
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,180
I'll be so sad

224
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,920
because you don't care about the stuff I gave you.

225
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:56,620
Come on.

226
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,140
This thing is free. Don't be dramatic.

227
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:04,410
But I'm going to borrow it for now. I'll return it to you once the internship is over.

228
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,850
When I give someone something,

229
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:11,040
I never take it back.

230
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,233
Everything?

231
00:15:12,233 --> 00:15:13,933
That's right.

232
00:15:14,908 --> 00:15:19,138
When I give something, I give the best I can.

233
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,750
But when I want something,

234
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:31,770
I have to have it

235
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:03,670
Can I borrow 10K? You can deduct it from my allowance next month.
[Thoop]

236
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,700
If you don't pick it up, you won't get it.
[Cher]

237
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:27,300
I'm in class.
[Thoop]

238
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,500
See you at the same shop this evening.
[Cher]

239
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm busy.
[Thoop]

240
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,214
Then no money for you.
[Cher]

241
00:16:37,214 --> 00:16:41,698
Guys, let's eat. This meal is on me.

242
00:16:41,698 --> 00:16:43,418
Did you win the lottery again, Jae?

243
00:16:43,418 --> 00:16:47,300
I sure did. The food here is delicious.

244
00:16:48,903 --> 00:16:50,670
It's so tasty.

245
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,770
What's wrong, Ai Laem?

246
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:58,224
You're just chewing.

247
00:16:58,224 --> 00:17:00,322
I'm not really hungry.

248
00:17:00,322 --> 00:17:02,733
Hey, Ai Laem.

249
00:17:02,733 --> 00:17:05,356
Are you coming to Hia Tub's gaming café this evening?

250
00:17:05,356 --> 00:17:07,299
Ai Three set up a meeting today, right?

251
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:09,099
Shit!

252
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:11,245
I forgot about it.

253
00:17:11,245 --> 00:17:13,510
I'm meeting with Ai Thoop this evening.

254
00:17:14,399 --> 00:17:15,757
Hm? Who's Thoop?

255
00:17:15,757 --> 00:17:18,379
He agrees to meet you now?

256
00:17:18,379 --> 00:17:20,699
He wants 10.000.

257
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:23,056
Be careful. Don't always give him money.

258
00:17:23,056 --> 00:17:26,716
I'm afraid he's a gambling addict. He might drag you down as well.

259
00:17:27,862 --> 00:17:29,562
Who's Thoop?

260
00:17:29,562 --> 00:17:31,451
My little brother.

261
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:35,222
You never told me you have a brother, Nong Cher.

262
00:17:36,237 --> 00:17:38,858
He's not my biological brother. It's a long story.

263
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:41,570
How long? I have all day for it.

264
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,740
Tell me. I want to know.

265
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:47,738
Fine. Don't tell.

266
00:17:47,738 --> 00:17:51,480
Let's eat that spicy minced pork.

267
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,930
It's tasty.

268
00:18:02,967 --> 00:18:05,063
Your expression

269
00:18:05,063 --> 00:18:07,973
looks like you just got run down by a semi-truck.

270
00:18:07,973 --> 00:18:09,860
What have you been doing, Ai Thoop?

271
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,059
Do you want to order anything?

272
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:16,360
What time did you go to bed last night?

273
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,656
- 2 a.m.
- Be honest.

274
00:18:19,656 --> 00:18:20,694
5 a.m.

275
00:18:20,694 --> 00:18:23,768
Why so late? You aren't into games, right?

276
00:18:23,768 --> 00:18:26,340
Say what you want and get it over with.

277
00:18:26,949 --> 00:18:29,659
Why are you so moody?

278
00:18:29,659 --> 00:18:31,673
Would you understand if I told you?

279
00:18:31,673 --> 00:18:33,269
Of course, I would.

280
00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:35,631
All I need is for you to open your mouth and say it.

281
00:18:35,631 --> 00:18:39,577
My ears are ready to listen.

282
00:18:40,895 --> 00:18:44,880
I hate it when you treat me like I'm a beggar.

283
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,977
But what can I do?

284
00:18:46,977 --> 00:18:49,590
I still need your financial support.

285
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:53,119
What else do you want me to do to get the money?

286
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,878
Wait.

287
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,579
What now? Dammit.

288
00:19:08,202 --> 00:19:12,879
I never regarded you as a beggar.

289
00:19:12,879 --> 00:19:15,459
So don't be dramatic.

290
00:19:15,459 --> 00:19:17,306
Order something if you're hungry.

291
00:19:17,306 --> 00:19:21,619
If you hate me that much, you can order a takeaway and eat at your dorm.

292
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,319
I'm not hungry.

293
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,245
What's the matter, Ai Thoop?

294
00:19:27,245 --> 00:19:30,429
We don't have any issues between us.

295
00:19:31,214 --> 00:19:34,696
Be patient. Once I make my own money, I'll be out of your hair.

296
00:19:35,482 --> 00:19:37,819
Are you sure?

297
00:19:37,819 --> 00:19:42,037
If I stop supporting you, you won't survive.

298
00:19:42,863 --> 00:19:44,400
I won't be bothered.

299
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,727
I'll be even more carefree as I have more in my savings.

300
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:50,031
Stop transferring me money then.

301
00:19:50,031 --> 00:19:53,977
As for this 10.000, I'll pay you back once I have it.

302
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,985
- Where will you get it from?
- That's my problem.

303
00:19:59,985 --> 00:20:03,977
From now on, do whatever you want. Stop pretending to care for me.

304
00:20:03,977 --> 00:20:07,685
I'm just P'Tian's younger brother. She's probably reborn by now.

305
00:20:07,685 --> 00:20:10,214
She sure didn't stay around and watch you put on an act.

306
00:20:11,155 --> 00:20:14,465
Fine. I'm going back to Udon Thani next week.

307
00:20:14,465 --> 00:20:16,657
- If you want to go—
- No.

308
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,437
Just arrived?

309
00:20:48,437 --> 00:20:51,254
Yes, Boss. The traffic was horrible.

310
00:20:51,254 --> 00:20:54,900
Why are you soaking wet?

311
00:20:54,900 --> 00:21:00,061
It rained as I was taking a motorbike back here.
(TN: Motorbikes are another form of public transportation)

312
00:21:00,061 --> 00:21:02,632
I couldn't just cancel the service.

313
00:21:02,632 --> 00:21:05,496
I couldn't get off halfway either or the guy would yell at me.

314
00:21:05,496 --> 00:21:07,402
You might get sick.

315
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,860
No way. My head is harder than a helmet.

316
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,750
I don't get sick easily.

317
00:21:20,881 --> 00:21:23,840
My room is dusty, Boss. Nothing to worry about.

318
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:29,724
I think you should go wash up. I'm going to sleep.

319
00:21:29,724 --> 00:21:33,700
Wait. Didn't you call because you couldn't sleep?

320
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,608
Let's say I'll try to put myself to sleep.

321
00:21:35,608 --> 00:21:37,880
That's okay, Boss.

322
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,070
I'll take a super quick shower. And get back to you. Okay?

323
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,570
One sec.

324
00:21:44,948 --> 00:21:47,434
Did you forget that your camera is still on?

325
00:21:47,434 --> 00:21:49,654
No, I didn't forget.

326
00:21:49,654 --> 00:21:52,500
Cher, you're taking your clothes off in front of my eyes right now.

327
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,401
Come on, Boss.

328
00:21:54,401 --> 00:21:57,345
You don't have to mind me. It's okay.

329
00:21:57,345 --> 00:21:59,173
You're so...

330
00:21:59,173 --> 00:22:02,573
Oh, I was thinking of taking the phone into the bathroom too.

331
00:22:02,573 --> 00:22:05,088
In case you find out that the sound of water helps you sleep as well.

332
00:22:05,088 --> 00:22:07,942
Next time, I'll just turn on the shower for you to listen to.

333
00:22:07,942 --> 00:22:09,499
Be right back.

334
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:16,400
Stay here for now, Boss.

335
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,069
By the way, Boss.

336
00:22:21,069 --> 00:22:24,453
I'm taking a day off this Friday. You need to get coffee yourself.

337
00:22:24,453 --> 00:22:27,108
- Where are you going?
- I'm going back to my hometown.

338
00:22:27,108 --> 00:22:29,180
I sent my leave request to Jae Aoi already.

339
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,342
So you're coming back on Sunday?

340
00:22:31,342 --> 00:22:32,582
Yes.

341
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:35,099
Want to come with me?

342
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,657
Can I?

343
00:22:37,657 --> 00:22:40,937
Come on. I'm kidding, Sir.

344
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,539
But I want to go, though.

345
00:22:48,364 --> 00:22:49,739
What?

346
00:22:49,739 --> 00:22:52,019
Seriously?

347
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:55,853
Don't you want to travel there by a European car instead of an old bus?

348
00:22:55,853 --> 00:22:58,497
Excuse me, Sir.

349
00:22:58,497 --> 00:23:02,208
There's an airport in Udon Thani.

350
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:03,311
Don't you know?

351
00:23:03,311 --> 00:23:07,635
But you won't get to stop by any rest stops if you take the plane.

352
00:23:07,635 --> 00:23:11,725
I'm visiting my mom, not traveling around.

353
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,509
I'll go, too.

354
00:23:17,509 --> 00:23:19,027
Okay?

355
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,345
Fine.

356
00:23:27,345 --> 00:23:28,939
All right.

357
00:23:51,071 --> 00:23:53,299
Morning, Boss.

358
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:57,200
Are we close enough that I can take you to visit my mom?
(TN: Laem uses informal speech)

359
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,823
Hey, when will you stop speaking informally to elders?

360
00:23:59,823 --> 00:24:02,773
Come on. You're not much older. Don't call yourself an elder.

361
00:24:02,773 --> 00:24:04,489
You sound so old, Boss.

362
00:24:04,489 --> 00:24:07,422
Let's go. I'm in a rush. Come on!

363
00:24:07,422 --> 00:24:09,342
Where should I keep my bag?

364
00:24:09,342 --> 00:24:11,211
Maybe outside of the car, Cher.

365
00:24:11,211 --> 00:24:13,056
I'll put it inside.

366
00:24:16,022 --> 00:24:19,752
Why do you want to visit my hometown by the way?

367
00:24:19,752 --> 00:24:21,539
I don't know.

368
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:25,156
In case you run away, I'll be able to find you.

369
00:24:25,156 --> 00:24:27,044
And why would I run away?

370
00:24:27,044 --> 00:24:29,410
Someone told me I was an annoying person.

371
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:32,157
One day you might be so annoyed by me that you run away.

372
00:24:32,157 --> 00:24:34,505
- You really are annoying.
- Cher!

373
00:24:35,845 --> 00:24:39,967
I'm telling you. There aren't nice hotels for you to stay.

374
00:24:39,967 --> 00:24:41,680
I'll consider it a change of atmosphere.

375
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,402
Besides, I'll be there for two days only. I can sleep anywhere.

376
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:47,114
You'll see.

377
00:24:48,223 --> 00:24:50,779
I have a snack.

378
00:24:54,795 --> 00:24:56,610
Do you want some, Boss?

379
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:58,922
No, thank you.

380
00:24:59,669 --> 00:25:01,320
Here.

381
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,380
Try it.

382
00:25:06,814 --> 00:25:09,459
- Good?
- I've tried better ones.

383
00:25:10,231 --> 00:25:11,931
So foul.

384
00:25:14,893 --> 00:25:17,256
I'm drowsy. Can I sleep?

385
00:25:17,256 --> 00:25:19,979
Of course, you can.

386
00:26:59,948 --> 00:27:03,159
Welcome to Udon Thani province, Boss.

387
00:27:04,432 --> 00:27:06,414
It's really hot here.

388
00:27:06,414 --> 00:27:09,105
It's good, though. It increases metabolism.

389
00:27:09,105 --> 00:27:11,239
It's nice if you put it that way.

390
00:27:13,379 --> 00:27:15,100
What did you order?

391
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,419
I hope it isn't something hot and spicy.

392
00:27:18,531 --> 00:27:20,474
You'll find out.

393
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,200
Thank you.

394
00:27:29,985 --> 00:27:31,979
Stir-fried red curry paste.

395
00:27:33,189 --> 00:27:36,263
But I ordered it mild spicy for you.

396
00:27:36,263 --> 00:27:37,995
I know you.

397
00:27:47,912 --> 00:27:52,382
See? There are many good things you haven't tried.

398
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:01,259
How long have you been away from home?

399
00:28:04,794 --> 00:28:06,645
About half a year.

400
00:28:06,645 --> 00:28:09,460
I usually come home once a year.

401
00:28:10,749 --> 00:28:12,703
For New Year or Songkran?

402
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,622
For an anniversary.

403
00:28:18,005 --> 00:28:22,571
After this, I'll take you to the market.

404
00:28:22,571 --> 00:28:25,798
- There are lots of unique snacks.
- I don't eat snacks.

405
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,512
Hey, Boss. Can you stop opposing me for two days?

406
00:28:30,512 --> 00:28:34,600
It's the way I am. Just like you who can't stop talking.

407
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,679
Wow. Touché.

408
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:41,859
Let's eat.

409
00:28:49,841 --> 00:28:50,802
Mom!
(TN: Most locals of Udon Thani speak the Isan dialect)

410
00:28:50,802 --> 00:28:53,194
Oh, my dear son!

411
00:28:53,194 --> 00:28:54,840
How did you get here?

412
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,905
I closed my eyes and prayed. And here I am.

413
00:29:00,749 --> 00:29:03,555
- Hello, Mom.
- That's my boss. He wanted to visit as well.

414
00:29:03,555 --> 00:29:04,992
Oh, hello there.

415
00:29:04,992 --> 00:29:07,530
Who is making noise in front of my restaurant?

416
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:08,838
It's me!

417
00:29:08,838 --> 00:29:12,290
- Do you have a problem?
- Oh, my dear grandson!

418
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:14,822
How come you're here? Why didn't you tell us you were coming?

419
00:29:14,822 --> 00:29:17,360
- Missed you.
- Missed you too.

420
00:29:18,231 --> 00:29:20,131
How are you?

421
00:29:20,862 --> 00:29:22,810
Boss, let's come inside.

422
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:24,639
Hello. Hello.

423
00:29:30,247 --> 00:29:32,042
The weather is nice.

424
00:29:41,032 --> 00:29:43,343
You're so strong.

425
00:29:43,343 --> 00:29:47,179
Sorry, we didn't bring you water earlier.

426
00:29:47,179 --> 00:29:51,045
- We're packed with customers.
- It's okay.

427
00:29:51,045 --> 00:29:52,348
My name is Gun.

428
00:29:52,348 --> 00:29:53,974
Right.

429
00:29:53,974 --> 00:29:57,060
Where are you staying tonight?

430
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:00,437
Cher told me I could spend the night here.

431
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,170
If you're uncomfortable, that's totally fine.

432
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:05,270
I can find a hotel nearby.

433
00:30:05,277 --> 00:30:07,891
It's fine. It doesn't bother us at all.

434
00:30:07,891 --> 00:30:11,973
We're afraid you will not be comfortable.

435
00:30:11,973 --> 00:30:15,466
We don't have a guestroom for you.

436
00:30:15,466 --> 00:30:20,559
If you're staying, you must hang a mosquito net outside.

437
00:30:24,117 --> 00:30:27,137
Ouch! Mom. Why are you pinching me?

438
00:30:27,137 --> 00:30:30,617
You didn't tell me in advance that we have a guest.

439
00:30:30,617 --> 00:30:32,445
He said he could crash anywhere.

440
00:30:32,445 --> 00:30:34,722
I really can sleep anywhere,

441
00:30:34,722 --> 00:30:37,630
but it'd be better if Cher could keep me company.

442
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,746
Oh, of course!

443
00:30:39,746 --> 00:30:41,265
What?

444
00:30:41,265 --> 00:30:42,928
- Mom!
- Excuse me!

445
00:30:42,928 --> 00:30:44,985
Papaya Salad with salted crab and fermented fish, please.

446
00:30:44,985 --> 00:30:47,262
Yes, of course!

447
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,776
Make yourself at home.

448
00:30:49,776 --> 00:30:53,382
I'll hang a mosquito net for you tonight.

449
00:30:53,382 --> 00:30:55,425
I have to go watch the storefront now.

450
00:30:55,425 --> 00:30:57,466
- Please let me help.
- Come on, then.

451
00:30:57,466 --> 00:30:59,059
Mom!

452
00:31:00,771 --> 00:31:02,946
Grandma! I wanted to sleep next to you!

453
00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:05,971
No! It's annoying.

454
00:31:20,288 --> 00:31:21,303
Here you go.

455
00:31:21,303 --> 00:31:22,893
Boss, I'll help.

456
00:31:22,893 --> 00:31:24,345
Okay.

457
00:31:24,345 --> 00:31:26,080
Here you are.

458
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:36,250
There.

459
00:31:40,317 --> 00:31:42,788
You're looking for trouble.

460
00:31:42,788 --> 00:31:47,017
It's fine. This is fun. I have wanted to do this for a long time.

461
00:31:47,017 --> 00:31:48,829
You want to be a waiter?

462
00:31:48,829 --> 00:31:49,900
No.

463
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:55,120
I want a day-to-day job, the job that doesn't require so much thinking.

464
00:31:57,695 --> 00:32:00,157
What? I don't get it.

465
00:32:00,157 --> 00:32:01,819
It's because you're still young.

466
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:04,060
And I'm the CEO.

467
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,440
Day-to-day job?

468
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,420
What are you laughing at?

469
00:32:26,265 --> 00:32:30,659
I swear if your employees saw you looking like this...

470
00:32:34,849 --> 00:32:37,512
Why? What about it?

471
00:32:39,034 --> 00:32:40,659
It's nothing...

472
00:33:08,041 --> 00:33:09,622
Let me.

473
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:12,979
What are you doing?

474
00:33:12,979 --> 00:33:14,335
It's protection.
(TN: A myth tradition)

475
00:33:14,335 --> 00:33:17,419
Otherwise, the widowed ghost will capture you and make you her husband.

476
00:33:36,636 --> 00:33:38,200
There.

477
00:33:39,722 --> 00:33:43,960
The villagers normally hang up a sign,

478
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,700
"There are no men in this house."

479
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,300
But it's been raining lately.

480
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:52,788
And how will this help?

481
00:33:52,788 --> 00:33:56,857
We must pretend to be women to trick the widowed ghost?

482
00:33:56,857 --> 00:33:59,559
Painting the nails is enough.

483
00:34:20,663 --> 00:34:22,499
What are you doing?

484
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:25,585
Hey!

485
00:34:25,585 --> 00:34:27,320
Painting the nails isn't enough to trick her.

486
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,400
You must wear lipstick too.

487
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:31,382
Boss!

488
00:34:31,382 --> 00:34:32,882
Hey! It's dirty.

489
00:34:32,882 --> 00:34:34,582
Boss!

490
00:34:37,154 --> 00:34:40,333
Playing like a child. Damn you, Boss.

491
00:34:45,437 --> 00:34:48,147
It won't be clean using your hand.

492
00:34:48,147 --> 00:34:51,279
You must use this.

493
00:34:52,646 --> 00:34:55,819
Only a few drops are needed.

494
00:34:59,917 --> 00:35:01,203
See?

495
00:35:01,203 --> 00:35:03,332
Just tap and wipe.

496
00:35:03,332 --> 00:35:06,119
It comes off. See? It's easy.

497
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,290
You drew it yourself and now you're cleaning it off.

498
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:16,350
You must not have better things to do.

499
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:18,382
Am I clean yet?

500
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,360
Boss.

501
00:35:37,198 --> 00:35:39,432
- Cute.
- What?

502
00:35:39,432 --> 00:35:42,574
Clean. I mean your face is clean.
(TN: Cute and Face share the same word, "an")

503
00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:45,180
Well, the widowed ghost is so easy to trick.

504
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:49,179
If I told her I was already taken, would she believe me?

505
00:35:51,145 --> 00:35:53,879
If she came right now,

506
00:35:53,879 --> 00:35:56,267
who would you use as your lover?

507
00:35:56,267 --> 00:35:57,837
You, of course.

508
00:35:57,837 --> 00:36:02,999
I would tell her you're my lover.

509
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,040
It's just an old tale, Boss.

510
00:36:12,112 --> 00:36:14,239
I'm going to wash up.

511
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:19,152
Hey, make it quick.

512
00:36:19,152 --> 00:36:23,560
If the widowed ghost comes by, I won't have a lover to show her.

513
00:36:44,597 --> 00:36:47,661
Are you done, my lover?

514
00:36:47,661 --> 00:36:49,419
Boss.

515
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:54,790
If you sleep with the mosquito net wide open like this,

516
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:56,890
wouldn't the mosquitos bite you to death?

517
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:59,800
Well, I never used a mosquito net before.

518
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,542
And look at what you're wearing.

519
00:37:01,542 --> 00:37:03,431
You'll be hot and sweaty.

520
00:37:03,431 --> 00:37:07,639
Well, you didn't tell me how to prepare my clothes.

521
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,756
What are you doing?

522
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:30,317
What is this—

523
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:39,740
Are you having fun?

524
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,959
I sure am.

525
00:37:51,738 --> 00:37:54,200
Hey. Boss!

526
00:37:57,752 --> 00:37:59,552
Boss!

527
00:38:01,191 --> 00:38:03,139
It's my turn!

528
00:38:03,139 --> 00:38:06,770
♫ I just realized what love feels like ♫

529
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:10,030
♫ Is this a dream that I get to meet you? ♫

530
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:13,710
♫ To have you by my side ♫

531
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:16,660
♫ Like a dream that came true ♫

532
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:23,400
♫ Sometimes the sky is overcast but now I have you to lead the path ♫

533
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:32,300
♫ You're more precious than anything, I can't lose you.
Because you're the only one that's meaningful ♫

534
00:38:39,081 --> 00:38:40,690
Boss.

535
00:38:42,072 --> 00:38:45,068
Let's hurry up and sleep.

536
00:38:45,068 --> 00:38:48,526
Once the cooling powder wears off, you won't be able to sleep.

537
00:39:07,046 --> 00:39:09,177
Thank you for today.

538
00:39:14,431 --> 00:39:16,430
For what?

539
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:18,790
I haven't done anything yet.

540
00:39:22,211 --> 00:39:24,620
Thank you for letting me tag along.

541
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,550
It's been fun.

542
00:39:30,219 --> 00:39:32,542
Tomorrow will be more fun.

543
00:39:32,542 --> 00:39:34,759
I'll take you traveling.

544
00:40:00,804 --> 00:40:04,057
Thank you for walking into my life.

545
00:40:04,057 --> 00:40:06,459
It feels great to have you.

546
00:40:18,663 --> 00:40:20,962
Good night, Boss.

547
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,479
Aren't you sleeping?

548
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:01,628
I'm about to.

549
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,102
If you sleep late,

550
00:41:05,102 --> 00:41:09,063
watch out for the widowed ghost coming to capture you.

551
00:41:10,957 --> 00:41:14,574
Then we should put on a better act.

552
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,325
- How?
- Like this.

553
00:41:19,129 --> 00:41:21,016
Boss, what are you doing?

554
00:41:21,016 --> 00:41:24,271
Stop moving, my lover. I'm going to sleep.

555
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:32,300
Damn you, Boss.

556
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:37,880
♫ I can't be without you now. I’m lucky to be with you ♫

557
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,660
♫ As warm as the morning sunlight ♫

558
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:55,120
♫ You're a cool breeze when I'm feeling anxiously hot ♫

559
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:58,500
♫ Let's cuddle to cool down the heat ♫

560
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:05,230
♫ Sometimes the sky is overcast
but now I have you to lead the path ♫

561
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:12,820
♫ You're more precious than anything, I can't lose you.
Because you're the only one that's meaningful ♫

562
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:16,390
♫ I must be the luckiest person ever ♫

563
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:19,510
♫ My heart says you're the one to love ♫

564
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:22,010
[Next week]
Watch out for it, Boss!

565
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:25,251
If I want to hire you as a permanent employee, what do you say?

566
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,909
No, I don't like it.

567
00:42:26,909 --> 00:42:29,459
You don't like the job or me?

568
00:42:30,654 --> 00:42:32,559
Your coffee is here...

569
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:34,337
You should thank me.

570
00:42:34,337 --> 00:42:36,948
Because Nong Cher is jealous.

571
00:42:36,948 --> 00:42:40,394
So now you can't sleep if you don't hear my voice?

572
00:42:40,394 --> 00:42:42,721
I want to stay with you, Boss.

573
00:42:42,721 --> 00:42:45,319
You can sleep in my room tonight.

574
00:42:45,945 --> 00:42:49,921
You are very special to me. You know?

575
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,720
♫ I must be the luckiest person ever ♫

576
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,400
♫ My heart says you're the one to love ♫

577
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:16,670
♫ With you it's wonderful. It's great for my heart ♫

578
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:20,120
♫ You turn an ordinary day ♫

579
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:27,420
♫ Into something meaningful that I've never felt with anyone before ♫

580
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:33,360
♫ I can't be without you now. I’m lucky to be with you ♫

581
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:42,900
♫ I can't be without you now. I’m lucky to be with you ♫
