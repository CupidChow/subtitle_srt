Cher, you're my happiness.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,560
The happiness I've never had before.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,800
If I'm your happiness, it will never be gone.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,720
No matter what puts us to the test, I'll be your happiness forever.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,000
I will be back.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,800
Don't get so worried and die before then.

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,280
So yesterday when you said it was the last day, that was our last day?

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,920
I told him not to worry to death,

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,680
but here I am dying.

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,200
When Mom and Grandma told me to study hard, I didn't listen.

00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,923
Who do you think you are, Boss?

12
00:00:26,923 --> 00:00:28,623
Who are you, Boss?

13
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,740
Shit!

14
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,740
I'm back, Boss.

Cher.

00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,860
Cher.

17
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,860
I'm here to do the housekeeping.

Jae, where are you taking me for lunch today?

28
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,320
This shop is very good, I'm telling you.

29
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,360
Let's go.

30
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,160
Oh, Boss. Hello.

31
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,380
Do you want coffee today?

32
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,140
My regular, please.

33
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,740
Today, Jack isn't here, right? I remember he has a competition.

34
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,000
That's right. It's the final round.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,920
I watched the live stream just now.

36
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,360
Nong Cher was leading.

37
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,320
Cher is good. I can't argue with that.

38
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,640
I've watched his live streams many times. Everyone else can barely compete with him.

39
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,723
Well then, please excuse me.

40
00:02:46,723 --> 00:02:48,523
Of course, Boss.

Ink, how could you say his name in front of him?

42
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,620
I'm going to pinch you. Come here.

43
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,982

Ai Zo, how were you so brave with that last move?

50
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,000
My heart fell out of my chest, I was so scared.

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,380
I had everything planned out. I knew we were going to make it.

- You're brilliant!
- That's my boyfriend!

See? I told you that you guys could do it.

Guys, listen.

Don't use what you love to do to pressure yourself too much.

00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,820
- Yes.
- Are you attending the ceremony?

71
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,940
No, I'm too lazy.

72
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,040
Besides, my mom and grandma won't close their restaurant to attend.

73
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,481
- You're not attending?
- Right.

74
00:04:55,481 --> 00:04:57,240

00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,920
Right.

00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,640

82
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,360
I did. Come down here already.

83
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,280
Okay. I'll be right there.

I do, but why the heck are you in it?

Just go with it. I'll tell you later.

00:06:07,443 --> 00:06:09,223
What you wanted.

91
00:06:14,262 --> 00:06:15,360
Hurry.

92
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,880
You should have let me get on it first.

93
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,600
Let's go.

94
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,480
Seeing your outfit makes me scared.

95
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,000
Please don't do anything weird.

96
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,163
I know. Just go to work.

97
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,760
- Do you understand?
- Yes!

98
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,320
Boss.

99
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,540

100
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,320
What are you doing?

101
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,420
Will you be my boyfriend?

102
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:23,240
As I told you, we were unsuitable for each other, like everyone said.

103
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,680
But I'm not an intern anymore.

104
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,440
Therefore, we can get rid of the policy that says,

105
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,280
the CEO of the company and the intern can't be together.

106
00:07:33,283 --> 00:07:35,043
One more thing—

107
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,370
I haven't finished my script yet, Boss.

108
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,240
Can I say it first?

109
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,720
And one more thing about me being a lousy kid,

110
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,020
who always puts you into trouble.

111
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,457
I've now improved myself.

112
00:08:04,457 --> 00:08:06,040

00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,620
I'm the national champion now.

114
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,780
I have a future. People know who I am.

115
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,460
Though I don't have as much money as you do,

116
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,060
I'll start building my life now.

117
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,840
You didn't really have to do this.

118
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,660
Of course, I have to do this much.

119
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,760
We must fix the problem at the root.

120
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,940
But you left me.

121
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,520
Good things come to those who wait.

122
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,260
What are you doing?

123
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,177
I'm tasting the good things.

124
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,220
Ai Boss! You're crazy!

125
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,080
- I love you.
- I know.

126
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,180
Why are you shouting?

127
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,378
I love you. I love you. I love you. Can you hear me?

128
00:09:06,378 --> 00:09:08,360
I love you. I love you. Can you hear me?

129
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,960
Shut up!

130
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,060
Ai Laem!

131
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,460
Boss.

132
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,560
My all bruised!

133
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,480
That's enough!

134
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,629
Enough already, Boss.

135
00:09:48,997 --> 00:09:52,200
Do you know I almost died?

136
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,320
My life without you turned dark.

137
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,080
You're exaggerating.

138
00:10:11,947 --> 00:10:14,237
Are we boyfriends now?

139
00:10:14,237 --> 00:10:16,280
Then who do you think I proposed to just now? Jae Aoi?

140
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,601
I knelt and shouted for the whole office to hear. Why are you even asking?

141
00:10:19,601 --> 00:10:23,520
I never thought I'd ever be proposed to in this life.

142
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,023
I asked you to be my boyfriend. It's not a marriage proposal.

143
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:32,440
Then, if we get married, let me be the one to kneel, okay?

144
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,380
And we'll call it even.

145
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,080
We should try dating first, Boss.

146
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,243
We've been together for less than 10 minutes. Are you thinking about marriage already?

147
00:10:41,243 --> 00:10:42,743
Yes.

148
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,640
I'm sorry, Ma'am.

149
00:10:58,837 --> 00:11:02,580
I'm sorry for getting him in trouble many times.

150
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,260
Cher.

151
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,320
But it won't happen again.

152
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,760
I graduated.

153
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,680
I'm the national champion.

154
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,311
I promise I won't stop developing myself.

155
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:20,553
I won't let anyone say the boss made a mistake by choosing me.

156
00:11:20,553 --> 00:11:22,903
By no one, you mean me?

157
00:11:22,903 --> 00:11:24,843
No, Ma'am.

158
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,440
I mean...

159
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,080
everyone in his life.

160
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,880
You're bold. I like that.

161
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,940
I promise I will make him happy.

162
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:59,140
I'll make him laugh and smile.

163
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,400
On the day he cries, I'll be comforting him.

164
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:12,180
Do you know anyone can say what you've just said?

165
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,620
I know. I don't want to swear,

166
00:12:19,223 --> 00:12:22,160
but I will show you

167
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,160
that I can do everything I just said.

168
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,540
I've seen it already.

169
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,380
Pardon?

170
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,380
I've seen that you can do it.

171
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,940
My son isn't as easy to take care of as anyone else.

172
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,080
I know that very well, Ma'am.

173
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,360
He's a picky eater. He isn't easy to read.

174
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,600
Besides, he doesn't say what's on his mind.

175
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,500
Cher. Easy.

176
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,720
As for your dad, he understands things pretty easily.

177
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,180
I'll talk to him for you.

178
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,540
Thank you for understanding.

179
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,220
Please take care of him.

180
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,520
Sure, Ma'am.

181
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,535
No worries.

182
00:13:09,535 --> 00:13:11,960
I'll handle the boss myself.

183
00:13:34,536 --> 00:13:36,200
I missed this room.

184
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,040
A 10 million baht condo isn't as comfortable as this tiny room, huh?

185
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:52,770
Even a 100 million baht condo won't be comfortable

186
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:55,260
without you lying in bed next to me.

187
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,060
You're a sweet talker.

188
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,020
- I'm going to take a shower.
- Can I come, too?

189
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,321
No. My bathroom can barely accommodate one person.

190
00:14:09,321 --> 00:14:12,323
Learn to wait. You know!

191
00:14:19,298 --> 00:14:21,120
I'll be right back.

192
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,280
Wait for me.

193
00:14:31,448 --> 00:14:35,614
- Are you done?
- Boss, I haven't taken off my underwear yet.

194
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:39,954
Let me lend you a hand.

195
00:14:39,954 --> 00:14:43,274
Boss, why are you here?

196
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:52,888
What's the matter?

197
00:14:55,736 --> 00:14:58,239
Next time, let me know what you wish to do.

198
00:14:58,239 --> 00:15:00,779
I was almost out of my mind.

199
00:15:03,296 --> 00:15:07,916
If I had told you, would you have let me go?

200
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:15,223
"Boss, may I walk out of your life briefly?"

201
00:15:15,223 --> 00:15:18,026
"I wish to go back to study hard and steady my life."

202
00:15:18,026 --> 00:15:19,569
"I'll be back soon."

203
00:15:19,569 --> 00:15:21,689
Would you have allowed me to leave?

204
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:23,099
No.

205
00:15:23,099 --> 00:15:25,119
See?

206
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:29,656
I'm sorry for letting you down, Boss.

207
00:15:29,656 --> 00:15:31,936
But I was really only gone for a bit.

208
00:15:31,936 --> 00:15:35,336
Here I am, back with you. Can't you see?

209
00:15:42,216 --> 00:15:45,896
Promise me you won't do anything like that again.

210
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,696
Yes.

211
00:15:49,696 --> 00:15:53,856
I did it because I want to be with you forever.

212
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,603
I want to be with you in a way that you're not embarrassed to be with me.

213
00:16:00,603 --> 00:16:04,150
Cher, I've never been embarrassed

214
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:07,940
by what or how you are.

215
00:16:07,946 --> 00:16:10,116
I don't care.

216
00:16:18,696 --> 00:16:20,396
Boss.

217
00:16:21,776 --> 00:16:24,336
We will not talk about this anymore.

218
00:16:25,336 --> 00:16:28,896
I'm back, and I won't go anywhere again.

219
00:16:29,936 --> 00:16:32,016
Your happiness,

220
00:16:32,656 --> 00:16:34,616
your smile...

221
00:16:35,778 --> 00:16:37,858
is now back.

222
00:16:48,096 --> 00:16:50,116
Cher.

223
00:16:50,116 --> 00:16:52,376
You started it.

224
00:16:52,376 --> 00:16:53,876
Boss!

225
00:17:01,876 --> 00:17:03,936
I missed your cheeks.

226
00:17:29,396 --> 00:17:31,276
I missed you.

227
00:17:35,943 --> 00:17:38,043
I missed you, too.

228
00:18:10,216 --> 00:18:13,856
How long will you be in Bangkok until you come home this time?

229
00:18:13,856 --> 00:18:15,316
Just for a day or two, Mom.

230
00:18:15,316 --> 00:18:17,716
Do you want anything from Bangkok? I'll buy it for you.

231
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,102
Thoop,

232
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,171
about P'Tian...

233
00:18:27,976 --> 00:18:29,956
I'm sorry.

234
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:34,216
P'Tian must be an angel in heaven by now.

235
00:18:53,936 --> 00:18:56,416
What's up, Coffee Boy?

236
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:59,076
You show your face here every day.

237
00:18:59,076 --> 00:19:00,676
You're even earlier than when you were an intern.

238
00:19:00,676 --> 00:19:02,296
So?

239
00:19:02,296 --> 00:19:03,936
I miss my boyfriend.

240
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:05,636
He works here.

241
00:19:05,636 --> 00:19:08,056
Do you have a problem?

242
00:19:08,056 --> 00:19:11,676
Well, well. You're calling him boyfriend so openly now.

243
00:19:11,676 --> 00:19:14,436
You must love him so much.

244
00:19:14,436 --> 00:19:16,316
The most! P'Ink.

245
00:19:16,316 --> 00:19:20,596
If the world was ending tomorrow, I'd lay down holding his hand,

246
00:19:20,596 --> 00:19:23,408
and we'd die togeth—

247
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:29,796
Sorry about that. I was choking on your love.

248
00:19:29,796 --> 00:19:30,939
That was intentional, Ai P'Jack!

249
00:19:30,939 --> 00:19:33,639
Not intentional at all.

250
00:19:36,016 --> 00:19:39,436
Fine. I'm leaving. My boyfriend is going to miss me.

251
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:44,936
I really want to splash him with water, freaking Laem.

252
00:19:48,936 --> 00:19:50,856
Please come in.

253
00:19:52,616 --> 00:19:55,356
Your coffee is served.

254
00:19:55,356 --> 00:19:57,336
Can I get a hug?

255
00:20:11,536 --> 00:20:13,376
So rewarding.

256
00:20:16,456 --> 00:20:17,636
Oh, hey, Boss.

257
00:20:17,636 --> 00:20:20,836
Is your new game being launched next week?

258
00:20:20,836 --> 00:20:23,596
Right. I'm thrilled.

259
00:20:23,596 --> 00:20:26,516
This is the biggest project since we founded this company.

260
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:29,799
Do you need a hand? I can help.

261
00:20:31,056 --> 00:20:33,256
We're 90% ready now.

262
00:20:33,256 --> 00:20:35,476
There's nothing to worry about.

263
00:20:36,616 --> 00:20:39,879
What about the 10%? What do you still need?

264
00:20:39,879 --> 00:20:43,499
I must confess I need you, Baby.

265
00:20:43,499 --> 00:20:45,736
Boss, so is this your character now?

266
00:20:45,736 --> 00:20:50,516
Where did my cool, calm, and handsome man go?

267
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:58,876
Why are you blushing?

268
00:21:00,896 --> 00:21:05,036
You said I was yours.

269
00:21:06,376 --> 00:21:08,836
Well, you're my boyfriend.

270
00:21:08,836 --> 00:21:11,236
You can't be someone else's, right?

271
00:21:15,456 --> 00:21:17,976
I love you so much.

272
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:23,176
If I got 1000 every time you say you love me, I'd be a billionaire.

273
00:21:24,296 --> 00:21:26,716
Well, I really love you.

274
00:21:28,716 --> 00:21:33,116
By the way, Boss, Ai Thoop wants to meet for a meal at our regular place.

275
00:21:33,116 --> 00:21:34,916
Do you want to come?

276
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,596
Sure, I can.

277
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:38,776
I'll be outside with P'Jack.

278
00:21:38,776 --> 00:21:42,056
Once you're done here, we can go together.

279
00:21:43,216 --> 00:21:45,576
Yes, Boss.

280
00:21:45,576 --> 00:21:47,856
Good job, Intern.

281
00:21:47,856 --> 00:21:51,276
You love this, don't you?

282
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:54,516
Of course, my little bro.

283
00:21:54,516 --> 00:21:56,456
Bye.

284
00:22:06,896 --> 00:22:08,396
I want more.

285
00:22:12,263 --> 00:22:14,836
You seem to like it.

286
00:22:16,016 --> 00:22:18,436
Sorry to interrupt your lovey-dovey moment.

287
00:22:18,436 --> 00:22:21,017
That's okay. You're fine.

288
00:22:21,017 --> 00:22:23,776
We'll stop loving each other for a second.

289
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:25,276
I'm kidding.

290
00:22:25,276 --> 00:22:28,096
Don't make such a hopeless face.

291
00:22:28,776 --> 00:22:30,796
Hi, Thoop. How have you been?

292
00:22:30,796 --> 00:22:34,556
I've been well. It's school break, so I'm staying with my mom to keep her company.

293
00:22:34,556 --> 00:22:39,556
I'm glad you and your mom can get along.

294
00:22:39,556 --> 00:22:43,396
I never thought this day would come, either. Thanks to you and P'Gun.

295
00:22:43,396 --> 00:22:46,076
Otherwise, I wouldn't have today.

296
00:22:46,076 --> 00:22:49,416
You're welcome. I'm happy to help.

297
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:51,636
I'm your big bro.

298
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:55,056
You can come to me with any problem. I'm ready to help.

299
00:22:55,056 --> 00:22:56,816
You've said that too many times.

300
00:22:56,816 --> 00:23:00,836
I always visit you with new trouble, don't I? You don't have to repeat it.

301
00:23:00,836 --> 00:23:05,316
We can't really make a peaceful conversation, can we?

302
00:23:05,316 --> 00:23:07,979
- You jackass.
- Aren't you used to it yet?

303
00:23:08,896 --> 00:23:11,977
Hey, we're having a New Year's party at Hia Tub's tomorrow. Do you want to come?

304
00:23:11,977 --> 00:23:14,416
No. I'm headed home as soon as I finish my errands.

305
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:16,456
I'm joining Mom for the New Year prayer.

306
00:23:16,456 --> 00:23:19,256
What? You're going to the temple?

307
00:23:19,256 --> 00:23:20,679
You'll get burned by hellfire.

308
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:22,839
I'm not you.

309
00:23:25,276 --> 00:23:27,156
Damn kid!

310
00:23:27,736 --> 00:23:29,456
Do you want to eat anything?

311
00:23:33,976 --> 00:23:35,716
Boss, do you want to eat anything?

312
00:23:35,716 --> 00:23:38,136
I'm full just by watching you eat.

313
00:23:39,496 --> 00:23:41,456
What a sweet talker.

314
00:23:44,136 --> 00:23:46,256
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

315
00:23:46,256 --> 00:23:49,036
Have you not seen people in love before?

316
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:52,296
Is this okay, Zo?

317
00:23:52,296 --> 00:23:55,552
- A little lower, P'Three.
- Okay.

318
00:23:55,552 --> 00:23:57,116
- A bit higher.
- A bit higher?

319
00:23:57,116 --> 00:23:58,896
Is this okay yet, Zo?

320
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:01,519
- A bit lower.
- Lower?

321
00:24:02,973 --> 00:24:04,880
- A bit higher.
- Higher?

322
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,620
- How about now?
- That's perfect, I think.

323
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,359
Perfect?

324
00:24:09,316 --> 00:24:12,140
When you say perfect,

325
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:16,276
do you mean that sign or us?

326
00:24:16,276 --> 00:24:18,896
- Come on, P'Three.
- What?

327
00:24:18,896 --> 00:24:21,936
The sign or us?

328
00:24:21,936 --> 00:24:23,736
Dammit!

329
00:24:23,736 --> 00:24:25,996
I have to give it to you two.

330
00:24:25,996 --> 00:24:28,776
Will you guys still be cheesy in 10 years?

331
00:24:28,776 --> 00:24:30,836
When will this honeymoon phase be over?

332
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:32,924
This phase will never be over, Hia.

333
00:24:32,924 --> 00:24:38,684
Because my boyfriend is cute, cute, and cute.

334
00:24:39,496 --> 00:24:40,856
Enough already.

335
00:24:40,856 --> 00:24:43,196
You guys express your love every single day.

336
00:24:43,196 --> 00:24:47,696
I know you love each other SO much!

337
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:49,436
Are you happy now?

338
00:24:49,436 --> 00:24:51,876
I can't help it. I love him so much.

339
00:24:51,876 --> 00:24:53,656
I love you, too.

340
00:24:53,656 --> 00:24:55,368
Gosh!

341
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,536
I guess I'm not standing right here!

342
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:59,976
Hia, close your eyes. We're having our moment.

343
00:24:59,976 --> 00:25:02,759
- Please.
- Fine.

344
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,616
I can't stand you two.

345
00:25:05,616 --> 00:25:06,699
Oops.

346
00:25:06,699 --> 00:25:08,719
The coast is clear.

347
00:25:10,493 --> 00:25:14,096
He won't know it. He's still stunned.

348
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:34,216
Cher.

349
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:46,817
What kind of oil is popping so much? Diesel?

350
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,379
Cher, what are you doing?

351
00:25:50,379 --> 00:25:52,819
I'm making you breakfast.

352
00:25:53,776 --> 00:25:55,016
You're awake.

353
00:25:55,016 --> 00:25:56,256
Of course, I am.

354
00:25:56,256 --> 00:26:00,276
I woke up hoping to say "Happy New Year" to my boyfriend.

355
00:26:00,276 --> 00:26:02,936
Not yet. It's New Year's Eve.

356
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,976
The new year is tomorrow.

357
00:26:04,976 --> 00:26:07,276
Did you get burned when cooking?

358
00:26:07,276 --> 00:26:09,776
Let me see your arm.

359
00:26:11,296 --> 00:26:14,756
They can turn into blisters.

360
00:26:14,756 --> 00:26:18,336
Wounds are common among warriors, Boss.

361
00:26:21,816 --> 00:26:24,036
I thought you bragged about being such a good cook.

362
00:26:24,036 --> 00:26:27,796
So the only menu you can cook is noodles?

363
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:30,216
But it was good, wasn't it?

364
00:26:30,216 --> 00:26:34,776
The pan wasn't completely dry when I started cooking. I didn't realize it.

365
00:26:34,776 --> 00:26:37,756
Let me handle the rest.

366
00:26:39,296 --> 00:26:41,796
Take it off.

367
00:26:42,453 --> 00:26:44,136
Give it to me.

368
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:45,896
Come.

369
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:48,436
Just sit and wait, Nong Cher.

370
00:26:48,436 --> 00:26:51,016
Now I can't show you my cooking skills.

371
00:26:51,016 --> 00:26:55,459
No need to show me. I'm afraid you'll blow up my kitchen.

372
00:26:55,459 --> 00:26:58,576
Okay. I'll just sit here, Dear.

373
00:27:16,216 --> 00:27:17,776
I'm hungry.

374
00:27:17,776 --> 00:27:20,196
Wait a little while.

375
00:27:20,936 --> 00:27:22,996
Here you go.

376
00:27:25,296 --> 00:27:26,896
That looks yummy.

377
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:28,816
You do a lot better than I do.

378
00:27:28,816 --> 00:27:31,276
Then you should eat a lot.

379
00:27:33,776 --> 00:27:35,876
Have you prepared your present for the gift exchange?

380
00:27:35,876 --> 00:27:38,756
What did you have in mind? Can you tell?

381
00:27:38,756 --> 00:27:42,400
If I tell you, it won't be a surprise.

382
00:27:43,876 --> 00:27:46,756
Come on. Tell me. I made the raffle.

383
00:27:46,756 --> 00:27:51,276
If I want yours, I'll make a fake raffle ticket for myself.

384
00:27:52,896 --> 00:27:53,979
You're a cheater.

385
00:27:53,979 --> 00:27:57,479
Just kidding. Don't be too serious.

386
00:27:58,616 --> 00:28:00,896
Actually, I can tell you what it is,

387
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:03,236
but I must get something in return.

388
00:28:04,856 --> 00:28:06,656
What?

389
00:28:09,376 --> 00:28:13,256
I was going to let you find out yourself, but it seems unlikely.

390
00:28:13,256 --> 00:28:16,399
What are you even saying, Boss? You don't make sense.

391
00:28:20,976 --> 00:28:23,220
It's been a year since your internship was over.

392
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,770
Aren't you going to stop calling me "Boss"?

393
00:28:27,576 --> 00:28:29,996
I'm used it.

394
00:28:31,336 --> 00:28:33,376
What should I call you then?

395
00:28:35,336 --> 00:28:37,476
P'Gun?

396
00:28:39,656 --> 00:28:43,319
See? You always get shy when I call you P'Gun.

397
00:28:45,136 --> 00:28:47,316
I'm not used to it yet.

398
00:28:56,747 --> 00:28:58,836
P'Gun.

399
00:29:00,176 --> 00:29:03,436
P'Gun, let's eat.

400
00:29:04,736 --> 00:29:08,776
Can you tell Nong Cher what your gift for the raffle is, P'Gun?

401
00:29:10,173 --> 00:29:14,756
It's not much. It's a one-year stay voucher at my Hua Hin hotel.

402
00:29:15,816 --> 00:29:20,216
Didn't I tell you the gift can't be over 150 baht?

403
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:22,976
I didn't know what to give.

404
00:29:22,976 --> 00:29:25,756
Wow. I was taught as a child not to grow up to be a cheater.

405
00:29:25,756 --> 00:29:27,439
Now that I know what your gift is, I want to be one.

406
00:29:27,439 --> 00:29:31,219
You don't have to fight for that kind of stuff.

407
00:29:32,656 --> 00:29:35,550
The company owner's boyfriend stays for free

408
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:38,110
for the rest of his life anyway.

409
00:29:43,456 --> 00:29:45,376
I didn't know that.

410
00:29:49,576 --> 00:29:53,916
Is that good, company owner's boyfriend?

411
00:30:00,176 --> 00:30:01,956
Eat.

412
00:30:02,456 --> 00:30:04,724
Company owner's boyfriend.

413
00:30:06,736 --> 00:30:09,056
So this is how it feels.

414
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,760
[Wab Gaming]

415
00:30:18,693 --> 00:30:21,016
The moment we've been waiting for has come.

416
00:30:21,016 --> 00:30:23,616
Let's draw lots.

417
00:30:23,616 --> 00:30:25,256
Come! Come!

418
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:27,736
Come around everyone!

419
00:30:27,736 --> 00:30:31,016
- Sadhu! Don't let it be P'Jack's gift!
- How can you say that?

420
00:30:32,136 --> 00:30:34,136
Jack! Here.

421
00:30:34,136 --> 00:30:35,516
Your turn, Boss.

422
00:30:35,516 --> 00:30:37,716
Who will open it first? Go on, Jack.

423
00:30:37,716 --> 00:30:41,456
I'm shit out of luck for the year! I got freaking Three's gift.

424
00:30:41,456 --> 00:30:43,296
Open it! Open it!

425
00:30:43,296 --> 00:30:44,816
I remember this.

426
00:30:44,816 --> 00:30:48,596
This was Ai Laem's gift from last year.

427
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:52,636
Well, I didn't use it, so I passed it on to you.

428
00:30:52,636 --> 00:30:54,256
It's cute!

429
00:30:54,256 --> 00:30:56,356
I recognize this present. Why didn't you stop your boyfriend, Zo?

430
00:30:56,356 --> 00:30:58,996
The gift is cute, Phi.

431
00:30:58,996 --> 00:31:02,156
Let's continue. My turn.

432
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:09,336
Hey, I got the boss's gift.

433
00:31:09,336 --> 00:31:12,036
I feel rich just by touching it.

434
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,136
What do I get?

435
00:31:15,176 --> 00:31:16,336
Shit!

436
00:31:16,336 --> 00:31:21,179
It's unbelievable. It's a free stay at a hotel in Hua Hin.

437
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,176
- I want that!
- Thank you, Boss!

438
00:31:23,176 --> 00:31:24,976
You're welcome.

439
00:31:24,976 --> 00:31:26,356
I'm so lucky.

440
00:31:26,356 --> 00:31:28,356
What about you, Boss?

441
00:31:31,336 --> 00:31:32,957
Cher's.

442
00:31:35,376 --> 00:31:36,539
What is this? Deathiny?

443
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:38,839
Destiny! Destiny!

444
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:41,536
You're awesome, Ai Cher.

445
00:31:41,536 --> 00:31:43,256
Here.

446
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,276
I don't want to give him this.

447
00:31:47,276 --> 00:31:49,396
But here.

448
00:31:49,396 --> 00:31:51,076
Thank you.

449
00:31:52,296 --> 00:31:54,576
What will it be?

450
00:32:04,176 --> 00:32:06,276
It suits you!

451
00:32:07,816 --> 00:32:09,176
It suits you so well!

452
00:32:09,176 --> 00:32:11,376
Boss, you have to try it on.

453
00:32:11,376 --> 00:32:13,276
Really!

454
00:32:13,276 --> 00:32:15,156
Wear it, P'Gun!

455
00:32:16,096 --> 00:32:18,236
Come out here, P'Gun!

456
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:24,256
He's definitely shaped by our society.

457
00:32:24,256 --> 00:32:29,636
I never thought the boss would get along with people like us.

458
00:32:29,636 --> 00:32:32,916
I even made a promise to his mom.

459
00:32:32,916 --> 00:32:36,876
What's your promise to her?

460
00:32:36,876 --> 00:32:42,256
I'd take good care of her son, make him happy and smile.

461
00:32:43,816 --> 00:32:47,836
Well, you didn't break the promise. Right?

462
00:32:48,936 --> 00:32:50,596
Right.

463
00:32:51,896 --> 00:32:55,676
P'Gun, wear this too. Wrap it around your neck.

464
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:01,136
That's cute, Boss.

465
00:33:02,656 --> 00:33:05,016
Please don't tell anyone in the office.

466
00:33:12,016 --> 00:33:14,296
Move your hips.

467
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:18,056
So, what's going to be, Boss?

468
00:33:18,056 --> 00:33:19,736
I'm shy dancing alone. Come dance together!

469
00:33:19,736 --> 00:33:22,776
One, two, three.

470
00:33:51,811 --> 00:33:53,916
Why did we leave early?

471
00:33:53,916 --> 00:33:56,296
We didn't get to do the countdown together.

472
00:33:57,256 --> 00:33:59,196
I'm not telling you.

473
00:34:02,636 --> 00:34:07,436
I'll pretend not to know you have a surprise for me.

474
00:34:07,436 --> 00:34:09,556
Was I that obvious?

475
00:34:09,556 --> 00:34:13,436
Of course, how could you not be? Who asks to leave before the New Year's mark?

476
00:34:13,436 --> 00:34:17,896
Besides, this isn't the way back to your condo.

477
00:34:19,276 --> 00:34:22,496
Can you keep on pretending not to know then?

478
00:34:25,676 --> 00:34:28,396
Can you give a little spoiler of what it is?

479
00:34:29,056 --> 00:34:32,059
Why? You will find out soon.

480
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,101
You dance like a boy band.

481
00:34:44,101 --> 00:34:46,696
- Right? That famous band, right?
- I remember them.

482
00:34:47,516 --> 00:34:50,399
Hey, look! They started the fireworks display.

483
00:34:57,853 --> 00:34:59,236
Dear fireworks,

484
00:34:59,236 --> 00:35:04,756
I, Three, want to do the countdown with Zo for as long as I can.

485
00:35:04,756 --> 00:35:08,036
I hope my wish is granted. Sadhu! Sadhu! Sadhu!

486
00:35:08,036 --> 00:35:11,456
I, Zo, want to do the countdown with Three forever, too!

487
00:35:11,456 --> 00:35:13,096
Yes!

488
00:35:15,916 --> 00:35:19,516
You know what? You two can just leave like Ai Laem did.

489
00:35:19,516 --> 00:35:21,276
- Right.
- Let's go, Zo.

490
00:35:21,276 --> 00:35:23,236
Hey! I was being sarcastic.

491
00:35:23,236 --> 00:35:25,497
- You believe us too easily.
- I was being sarcastic.

492
00:35:25,497 --> 00:35:27,736
- You guys were going to leave us.
- Oh, okay.

493
00:35:27,736 --> 00:35:29,654
- Hey. What's that?
- What?

494
00:35:32,216 --> 00:35:33,736
What was it?

495
00:35:35,156 --> 00:35:37,916
I just want someone to shoot the firework at me right now.

496
00:35:37,916 --> 00:35:39,536
Please do it.

497
00:35:39,536 --> 00:35:41,216
That was a joke.

498
00:35:43,616 --> 00:35:46,456
- Am I going to fall?
- No, you're not.

499
00:35:46,456 --> 00:35:48,437
- Take a slow step.
- Okay.

500
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:50,156
Why are you looking up?

501
00:35:50,156 --> 00:35:52,116
Don't look up. We're here.

502
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:53,939
Be careful.

503
00:35:56,376 --> 00:35:58,216
Don't peek. You will see it soon.

504
00:35:58,216 --> 00:36:00,336
I'm not.

505
00:36:01,716 --> 00:36:04,936
Once I lower my hands and count, open your eyes, all right?

506
00:36:05,816 --> 00:36:07,636
Okay.

507
00:36:07,636 --> 00:36:10,856
Three, two, one. You may open your eyes.

508
00:36:55,276 --> 00:36:58,676
Hey. This, really?

509
00:36:58,676 --> 00:36:59,776
Yes.

510
00:37:06,276 --> 00:37:10,776
Why isn't anyone here, though?

511
00:37:11,716 --> 00:37:14,059
- I reserved it for tonight.
- What?

512
00:37:14,936 --> 00:37:17,616
You reserved the rooftop on New Year's?

513
00:37:18,816 --> 00:37:20,756
How much did you pay?

514
00:37:21,436 --> 00:37:23,616
I only paid for the location.

515
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,419
The rest, I did it myself.

516
00:37:25,419 --> 00:37:28,816
The decoration, the balloons, and the lights.

517
00:37:28,816 --> 00:37:30,516
You're boasting.

518
00:37:31,156 --> 00:37:33,156
Where would you find the time to do this?

519
00:37:34,316 --> 00:37:36,216
I had time, all right.

520
00:37:51,427 --> 00:37:52,796
Here.

521
00:37:55,476 --> 00:37:59,876
I did my best to make this flower bouquet.

522
00:38:01,616 --> 00:38:03,136
Can you believe me?

523
00:38:03,136 --> 00:38:08,076
I never imagined myself getting flowers from anyone in my life.

524
00:38:11,016 --> 00:38:12,936
Do you like it?

525
00:38:24,896 --> 00:38:26,756
I love it so much.

526
00:38:26,756 --> 00:38:28,876
You mean the flowers?

527
00:38:31,336 --> 00:38:33,496
I mean you, Phi Gun.

528
00:38:45,296 --> 00:38:46,916
What?

529
00:38:46,916 --> 00:38:49,196
You started it and now you're blushing.

530
00:38:51,716 --> 00:38:54,756
Come. It's almost time.

531
00:39:05,536 --> 00:39:07,436
It's stunning.

532
00:39:11,503 --> 00:39:13,543
Let's start counting down.

533
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:20,396
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...

534
00:39:20,396 --> 00:39:22,176
five...

535
00:39:26,336 --> 00:39:27,936
four...

536
00:39:30,096 --> 00:39:31,876
three...

537
00:39:33,816 --> 00:39:35,456
two...

538
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,016
one.

539
00:39:37,016 --> 00:39:39,876
Happy New Year!

540
00:39:47,816 --> 00:39:49,656
I love you, P'Three.

541
00:39:50,376 --> 00:39:52,010
I love you too, Zo.

542
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:56,090
I love you all year, forever, and all my life.

543
00:39:56,096 --> 00:39:58,279
Get a room, you two! Go on! Go!

544
00:39:58,279 --> 00:39:59,690
- We want to be with you guys.
- No. That's enough!

545
00:39:59,696 --> 00:40:01,656
- Love you!
- I can't stand you guys anymore!

546
00:40:01,656 --> 00:40:03,296
Let's hug!

547
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:08,016
I hope this year is a good year!

548
00:40:16,656 --> 00:40:19,036
Happy New Year, Nong Cher.

549
00:40:23,096 --> 00:40:25,256
P'Gun, do you know,

550
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:30,556
that you're the best New Year's gift for me?

551
00:40:31,536 --> 00:40:33,636
You are as well.

552
00:40:33,636 --> 00:40:38,196
You're the most precious gift to me.

553
00:40:38,196 --> 00:40:41,876
Thank you for making me smile, laugh,

554
00:40:42,476 --> 00:40:45,016
and for everything you've done for me.

555
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:48,716
They are so meaningful.

556
00:40:51,316 --> 00:40:53,316
I love you, Phi Gun.

557
00:40:58,816 --> 00:41:01,956
Promise me we'll do the New Year countdown together every year.

558
00:41:04,916 --> 00:41:06,796
I promise.

559
00:41:06,796 --> 00:41:09,196
I'll stay with you forever, P'Gun!

560
00:41:09,196 --> 00:41:14,590
Whether you're sleeping, awake, eating,

561
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:16,390
or whatever you're doing,

562
00:41:17,376 --> 00:41:20,556
you'll always see me when you turn this way.

563
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:31,676
You're so adorable.

564
00:41:36,996 --> 00:41:39,216
Except when I'm using the bathroom.

565
00:41:39,216 --> 00:41:41,376
Let me have my personal time.

566
00:41:43,736 --> 00:41:46,356
