Ai Zo messaged me about having BBQ this evening to celebrate my smooth first day of internship.

2
00:00:05,065 --> 00:00:09,525
Ai Laem, you haven't told me why the boss asked to see you.

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,000
I finally found you.

Do you watch ASMR videos, too?

6
00:00:17,991 --> 00:00:21,433
Tonight, I'll call you and listen to your voice.

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,000
So? Have you realized the disadvantage of not knocking on the door now?

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,280

I did not forget.

10
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,500
Today's special is coconut juice with two shots of espresso.

11
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,220
No additional syrup, yet it is slightly sweet from the coconut juice.

12
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,705
You can have it, right? I haven't tried it, either,

13
00:00:59,705 --> 00:01:01,720
but the barista said it was good.

14
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,280
It's been served, Sir.

15
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,710
Last night, you dozed off in the middle of our call,

16
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,665
leaving me awake since then.

17
00:01:15,665 --> 00:01:17,040
Well...

18
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,545
You were suddenly quiet. I thought you fell asleep.

19
00:01:20,545 --> 00:01:23,380
Next time, don't judge anything you can't see with your own eyes.

20
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,320
Wow! How can I see your eyes through your voice?

21
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,020
Then we will change to video calls

22
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,750
so you can see whether I'm asleep or not.

23
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,725
How is it? Is it good?

24
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,460
It's pretty good.

25
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,980
See, Boss? There are many things on earth you overlook.

26
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:59,440
I'm starting to have fun choosing the coffee flavors for you.

27
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,480
What should I get you tomorrow?

28
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,080
What will I do when your internship is over?

29
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,840
The new intern will have to put up with my "any coffee is fine" menu.

30
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,820
Any coffee is fine, but no whipped cream.

31
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,847
That's right.

32
00:02:13,847 --> 00:02:15,490
I'm off to work now, Boss.

33
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:18,140
Please let me know if you need anything.

34
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,740

That was super delicious.

44

By the way, Nong Cher, you've been interning for a while now,

45
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,340
how is it? Do you feel like dying yet?

46

Gosh! What do you mean die? It's so much fun.

Well. Well. Well. Sure.

What if the boss wants to hire you? Will you stay on?

49
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,220
No. I don't like working in an office.

50
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,660
I want to get rich by playing games.

You can get rich by being a CEO's partner.

Were you talking to me?

53

How are you? We see you go in and out of the boss's office all the time.

You like it, right?

Gosh, Phi. Don't judge him so quickly.

00:04:29,499 --> 00:04:33,100
- When going into the boss's office, don't you get sexually harassed?
- What did you say, Phi?

60
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,682
Like getting your hands touched, your arms, or your butt. Things like that?

61
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,920
Besides getting yelled at or snapped at, I haven't experienced anything else.

If you had just walked in and cut them with your words,

then say that I've never touched an employee's bottom?

Cher, you're in your early twenties already.

94
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,740
Think about it. Giving explanations doesn't always solve every problem.

95
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:58,240
But those people are thirty already. Nearly forty, even.

96
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,930
Yet they don't realize that they shouldn't say things like that.

97
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,700
Because I don't want to become like them.

98
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,840

By what?

106
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,100
By the fact that I don't like women.

107
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,880
Why would I be?

108
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,280

109
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,560
When I tell people about this, they seem taken aback.

Many people seem to understand at first,

120
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:54,280
until they start asking who's top and who's bottom.

121
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,180
When we want to have kids, they want to know who will be the father and who will be the mother.

Boss, when he initiated this, he was under this company—

176
00:13:23,204 --> 00:13:25,093
Please excuse me.

177
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,840
Boss.

178
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:31,160
Oh my, what should we do?

179
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,563
All right, let's break it up.

180
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:35,403
Let's brainstorm what to do.

181
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:11,240
Normally, no one dares to approach me when I'm in this mode.

182
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,120
Why?

183
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,080
Are you going to yell at me, shoo me away,

184
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,920
or kick me down the building?

185
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,926
Woo! It's quite high, though.

186
00:14:25,926 --> 00:14:28,160
I'd be so dead if I fell.

187
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,320
Don't kick me down, okay?

188
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,359
I'm just kidding.

189
00:14:40,037 --> 00:14:42,500
Did people in your department ask you to talk to me?

190
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,960
No, Boss.

191
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,020
And there's no way.

192
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:50,160
As soon as I open my mouth to start a conversation with you,

193
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,720
P'Jack shoots lasers from his eyes to cut my throat.

194
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,940
If they didn't ask you to come up here to talk to me,

195
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,520
why are you here then?

196
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,220
I'm worried.

197
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,220
What?

198
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,640
I'm worried.

199
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,529
Are you worried about me?

200
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,400
Yes. I'd never seen you so sad.

201
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,210
But when I saw your face just now,

202
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:29,560
I knew right away you were hurt.

203
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,188
Are you lying?

204
00:15:31,188 --> 00:15:33,631
People always say I show no facial expression.

205
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:38,654
No one can tell whether I'm happy or sad.

206
00:15:38,654 --> 00:15:40,953
I don't think that's true.

207
00:15:40,953 --> 00:15:45,199
You're the one that's been lied to.

208
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:52,503
Cher, nobody has ever talked back to me this much.

209
00:15:52,503 --> 00:15:55,340
It's because you're so strict, Boss.

210
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:58,000
People listen to what you say.

211
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,920
When you say you're all right, people pretend they believe you.

212
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,800
But you know what?

213
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:09,000
Your face tells what you're feeling inside.

214
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,560
But you're not listening to what I say right now.

215
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,520
Let's say there are 60 million people in Thailand.

216
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,860
You might think you can control all of them, Boss.

217
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:26,720
But actually, you can control only 59,999,998 people.

218
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,780
The two people you can't control are yourself

219
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,120
and me, Ai Laem.

220
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,780
Why do you have to say something that is hard to understand?

221
00:16:43,648 --> 00:16:48,040
I don't know what you've been through,

222
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,249
and I won't ask,

223
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,200
but I want you to reconsider it.

224
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,227
Everyone worked so hard on this game.

225
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,140
I've seen Ai P'Jack pull an all-nighter to make it.

226
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,920
He even asked me to play it.

227
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:14,220
He looked so happy when I said the game was good.

228
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,280
But if you insist on your call,

229
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,800
everyone is willing to respect your decision.

230
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,520
I'll think about it.

231
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,723
- Boss.
- Yes?

232
00:17:39,723 --> 00:17:42,694
How about BBQ pork this evening?

233
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,840
[Wab Gaming]

234
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,480
Hia, what did Ai Laem say?

235
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,040
Why is his boss coming to eat BBQ pork with us?

236
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,280
I don't dare let him eat downstairs.

237
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,760
And I don't want to use the charcoal grill because the smoke stinks.

238
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:16,000
We're lucky P'Three got an electric grill from the New Year party's lucky draw.

239
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,800
Zo, don't carry it. It's heavy.

240
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:22,300
Put it down right now. Next time I'll carry it. You're so tiny.

241
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,860
You're allowed to carry only one thing.

242
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,480
What is Ai Zo carrying?

243
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,920
My heart. Is it heavy?

244
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,320
Even if it's heavy, you can't put it down

245
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,380
because I only have one heart.

246
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,680
Hia!

247
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,166
- Where is the boss sitting?
- Right here.

248
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:45,200
- Hey, Phi!
- Hi.

249
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,240
Hey.

250
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,500
What happened?

251
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,920
Why is your boss having dinner with us?

252
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:55,394
Your friend Ai Laem asked him to come, and he surprisingly said yes.

253
00:18:55,394 --> 00:19:00,566
He doesn't even eat food from street vendors, let alone BBQ pork.

254
00:19:00,566 --> 00:19:02,805
You're exaggerating, Ai P'Jack.

255
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,420
Hey! Is this a new grill?

256
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,800
We have an upgrade, Ai Zo?

257
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,720
We upgraded for your father.

258
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,760
Are you going to make the CEO eat from a charcoal grill downstairs?

259
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,299
Boss is just an ordinary man.

260
00:19:26,975 --> 00:19:28,902
Hello, Boss!

261
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,540
Hi, everyone.

262
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:38,360
Ordinary, my ass. His shoes are cleaner than your mouth.

263
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:43,880
Boss, look. Ai P'Jack was the one who told us stories about you.

264
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,580
Don't listen to him.

265
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,620
You're an ordinary person. Just enjoy.

266
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:52,160
- Enjoy.
- Yes, enjoy.

267
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,280
May I sit down?

268
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,620
- Please.
- Thank you, Sir.

269
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,280
- Give the boss water.
- I know. Just a moment, Boss.

270
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,920
Here's water, Sir.

271
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,200
You're the most exaggerated one, Ai P'Three.

272
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,620
Here, Boss.

273
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:09,720
Cooking and eating it at the same time is the highlight of BBQ pork.

274
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,700
Hey!

275
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,580
What do you think we are, turtles?

276
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:19,860
It will get stuck in our throats. Make it smaller first.

277
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,020
He's going to tell the "It's hot" joke. Trust me.

278
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,295
- Good?
- Yes.

279
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:32,740
Oh, he changed it up. No jokes this time.

280
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,460
- Because Zo fed me.
- Yuck!

281
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,460
Here, for you.

282
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,960
Come on.

283
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,220
That's right.

284
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,720
So?

285
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,800
It's good.

286
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,960
Right? It's yummy.

287
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,520
It's a very delicious meal.

288
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,657
If you like it, you can come join us anytime, Boss.

289
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,360
Thank you so much for today.

290
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,040
I had a really good time.

291
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,960
I don't remember the last time I had a meal with a large group of people.

292
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,440
I'll share my group of friends with you, Boss.

293
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,400
And thank you very much for talking to me today.

294
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,820
I intend to thoroughly think it over once again.

295
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,520
Think tomorrow, Boss. Or you won't be able to sleep tonight.

296
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,360
If you're afraid I can't sleep, give me a call.

297
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,740
I have team practice tonight.

298
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:45,240
But I'll message you once I arrive at my room.

299
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,677
If you can't sleep, we will work it from there.

300
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,040
Bye.

301
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,436
So he does smile.

302
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,520
Why are you all staring at me?

303
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,560
I know I'm the hottest,

304
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,740
but you don't need to stare.

305
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,660
What's going on between you and the boss?

306
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,600
What's going on?

307
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,100
I've never seen him this close to anyone.

308
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,440
Isn't it a good thing?

309
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,880
Your friend is close to your boss.

310
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,640
I can help you when you're in trouble.

311
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,380
Hey.

312
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,280
Listen to me.

313
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:03,220
If you're doing this to take advantage of him, just quit.

314
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:08,480
Based on what Ai Jack said he has a painful past, doesn't he?

315
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,320
The fact that he trusts you this much means

316
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,320
you can't hurt him, all right?

317
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,280
Come on, Hia.

318
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,720
Do you really think my brain can come up with something so complex?

319
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,720
Though I'm a master in gaming,

320
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,220
there's barely anything functioning in here. You know that.

321
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,460
Then what are you doing, P'Laem?

322
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:48,040
My voice helps him sleep, I guess.

323
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,740
That's all.

324
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:57,000
If that's all, you should keep your distance from your boss.

325
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,640
Don't go too deep, okay?

326
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,007
Calling each other every night

327
00:24:05,007 --> 00:24:10,680
or changing yourself for the other person is something I do for Zo only.

328
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,200
And Zo and I are boyfriends.

329
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,260
But you guys are an intern and the company owner.

330
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,860
Right?

331
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,880
Come on. Let's clean up the table so we can get to practicing.

332
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,244
We don't have that much time.

333
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,820
Will you listen to other people for once?

334
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,019
Just because this company was built with your money

335
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:21,020
doesn't mean you can do whatever you want.

336
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,350
I never thought of doing something like that.

337
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,900
That's what your mouth says,

338
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,240
but your actions are quite the opposite!

339
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,740
Can we just talk nicely?

340
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,020
I'm not talking to you

341
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:32,680
until you take me as a friend, not an employee.

342
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,380
Ai Thyme.

343
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,540
[Cher Sarun]

344
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,770
Ding dong!

345
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:27,600
Prophet Laem can tell that Khun Gungawin is tossing and turning in bed.

346
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,589
He can't sleep. Am I right?

347
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:31,074
Right. Oh!

348
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,680
You're spot on, Prophet Laem.

349
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,843
You said you'd be late. It's not even 11 yet.

350
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,200
Because I'm so good.

351
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,060
We know we'll definitely be the champion, so we called it a day.

352
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,400
You're making me have bad habits.

353
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,480
From now on, if I don't get to talk to you,

354
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,520
I can't sleep.

355
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,300
If you can't sleep, talk to me.

356
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,440
You're saying it as if you're willing to talk to me forever.

357
00:27:03,767 --> 00:27:06,240
Are you challenging me, Boss?

358
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,980
I don't like anyone challenging me because I won't give in.

359
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,040
Then I'm challenging you.

360
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,020
To do what?

361
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,820
You must talk to me before bed every night

362
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,820
until I'm tired of you.

363
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,520
Of course. Challenge accepted.

364
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,769
Good morning, Nong Cher.

365
00:27:55,769 --> 00:27:57,600
Hello, P'Aoi.

366
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,860
You don't have to get coffee for the boss today. He isn't coming.

367
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,000
Why not?

368
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,200
No idea. That's all he told me.

369
00:28:09,197 --> 00:28:11,140
The office will be so quiet today.

370
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,100
Ai P'Jack isn't here, either.

371
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,360
How is Jack doing?

372
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,040
He constantly takes sick leaves.

373
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,760
It's depressive disorder, Jae.

374
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,440
He must go see the doctor as scheduled.

375
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,760
He's been doing a lot better, though.

376
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,320
His doctor has reduced the number of pills he's taking.

377
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,880
Really? That's great.

378
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,600
Why does he have a depressive disorder, though? Can you tell?

379
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,874
It's about his family.

380
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,661
Since the boss isn't here,

381
00:28:45,661 --> 00:28:47,560
you guys must help me record a TikTok video.

382
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,160
There's a new challenge.

383
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,860
Let's do it.

384
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,640
Hey, Boss.

385
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,400
I thought P'Aoi said you weren't coming in today.

386
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,820
My errand was done pretty quickly.

387
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:18,540
If you're back, then my plan to leave early has been ruined.

388
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,640
Oops.

389
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,720
I'm kidding, Boss.

390
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,780
May I get a cup of "any kind of coffee," please?

391
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:33,063
Of course, Sir. You got it.

392
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,480
Jae.

393
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,160
Are you waiting for something?

394
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,819
I thought you wouldn't ask.

395
00:29:52,819 --> 00:29:54,888
I'm waiting for a document to be delivered.

396
00:29:54,888 --> 00:29:56,881
The messenger said he was coming, but it's been forever.

397
00:29:56,881 --> 00:29:59,150
My boyfriend keeps calling me.

398
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:02,870
He must have missed me so much already.

399
00:30:02,876 --> 00:30:04,600
Should I stay and wait for it on your behalf?

400
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,163
I don't have anything else to do today.

401
00:30:06,163 --> 00:30:09,440
Ai P'Jack isn't here. No one is rushing me to go home.

402
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,020
How will you get home then?

403
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,060
The bus, as usual.

404
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,020
No. It's about to rain.

405
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:20,080
You can go home. I can wait here by myself.

406
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,700
It's fine.

407
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,480
Are you sure?

408
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,880
Don't feel bad.

409
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,040
Darling, I'm coming!

410
00:30:30,106 --> 00:30:31,880
She's in a rush.

411
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,683
- Is that for Khun Aoi?
- Yes, Sir.

412
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,520
- Thank you so much.
- Sure.

413
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:50,120
I'm so sorry. It was pouring in the Bang Na area. It took me forever to get out of there.

414
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,720
- That's fine. Thank you so much. Get home safe.
- You're welcome.

415
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,040
Sadhu!
(T/N: An expression of approbation in a religious and secular context)

416
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,680
Please don't rain just yet. Let me go home first.

417
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,440
Hold it for me, please.

418
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,040
Sadhu!

419
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,220
Gosh!

420
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,740
The weather sure isn't cooperating!

421
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,360
Get in the car. I'll take you home.

422
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,640
Boss, were you still here?

423
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,480
Get in first. We'll talk later.

424
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,404
All right.

425
00:32:15,197 --> 00:32:18,560
There are tissue papers in the back seat. You can use them.

426
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,868
It's okay. This slight rain can't do me any harm.

427
00:32:22,868 --> 00:32:26,320
- Don't worry, Boss.
- I mean my car seat.

428
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,285
Please wipe it.

429
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,116
Why didn't you say it earlier?

430
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,520
All done, Sir. It's all dry.

431
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,320
It won't die because of the wetness now.

432
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,692
Have your brains ever produced sentences that are non-sarcastic, Cher?

433
00:32:48,692 --> 00:32:53,350
Simply speaking, you mean,

434
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:56,360
"Cher, you can't be foul-mouthed all the time."

435
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,840
Right?

436
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,560
I didn't say that. You said that yourself.

437
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,520
You didn't say it, but you thought it, right?

438
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:07,910
Let me tell you. Making me fast for seven days,

439
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:11,600
is easier than preventing me from being foul-mouthed for seven hours.

440
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,090
Where do you live?

441
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:20,740
Udon Thani.

442
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,755
Are you kidding me?

443
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,670
All right then.

444
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:30,180
Go straight, make a left turn, and we'll be there.

445
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,710
Why did you stay so late in the office?

446
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,520
Were you clearing up your work?

447
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,760
I stay until late every day.

448
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,380
Aren't you afraid of ghosts, Boss?

449
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,780
I have a company to run.

450
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:44,340
I don't have time to be afraid of ghosts, Cher.

451
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,780
Right.

452
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,540
Your seat is getting warmer.

453
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,600
What's wrong with it?

454
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,800
It's a car seat equipped with a heating system.

455
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,500
How nice.

456
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,020
Thank you for taking me home, Boss.

457
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,130
Where is your home, by the way?

458
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,800
Is it far?

459
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,840
Not so far. It's in Sathon area.

460
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,640
Wow! That's so damn far from here!

461
00:34:27,644 --> 00:34:30,620
By the time you get through the traffic, your knees would be in pain.

462
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:34,510
Though I have lots of responsibilities,

463
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:38,260
I'm not that much older than you.

464
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,572
- Are you saying that you—
- Hey!

465
00:34:40,572 --> 00:34:45,520
Stop translating other people's words into your language, Cher.

466
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:06,340
Do you want to go up and wait in my room?

467
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:09,304
You can leave when the traffic is lighter.

468
00:35:09,304 --> 00:35:12,180
I'll make you my special noodle recipe.

469
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:16,980
When it rains, nothing beats a hot bowl of noodles, Boss.

470
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,700
Are you interested?

471
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,363
Let's go. Come on, Boss.

472
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:45,520
Here comes Laem's wonton noodle soup.

473
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,540
This is yours. And this is Ai Laem's.

474
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,360
Did you make all these yourself?

475
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,590
It was magic. I cast a spell just now.

476
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:00,780
Abracadabra, abracadabra—

477
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,780
All right. I get it.

478
00:36:04,857 --> 00:36:08,300
Let's eat. You should eat while it's hot so it's delicious.

479
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,000
Well, well.

480
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,279
You've never had such delicious noodles, have you?

481
00:36:36,279 --> 00:36:39,300
- Right.
- Of course.

482
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:43,120
- I'm the best cook—
- Because I always eat healthy food.

483
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:47,080
It's good to eat something like this once in a while.

484
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:54,040
Boss, you can just give me a direct compliment. I won't get shy.

485
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,540
Let's eat. If you want more, I'll make you more.

486
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,040
I have a lot in the kitchen.

487
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:15,250
♫ If I ask you ♫

488
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:22,200
♫ Don't hold back on me. Only better ♫

489
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,240
I'll feed you.

490
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:30,220
♫ If you set it free ♫

491
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,120
- Oh, I missed.
- I see.

492
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:37,690
♫ There’s a shadow ♫

493
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:43,130
♫ Rising on the wall ♫

494
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:48,880
♫ Through a bottle ♫

495
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,960
♫ I can stand up tall ♫

496
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:03,140
Are you worrying about that issue?

497
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,420
Haven't you decided what to do?

498
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,720
Is Prophet Laem here again?

499
00:38:17,077 --> 00:38:18,957
Am I right, though?

500
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:30,500
You must have heard about me and my friend.

501
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:38,180
Ai Laem, I'll ask you for one thing.

502
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:41,200
Don't talk about Khun Thyme.

503
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,800
Who is Khun Thyme?

504
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,920
We used to have two bosses,

505
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:51,000
the boss we have now, and the other was Khun Thyme, his close friend.

506
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,980
I was the reason he left.

507
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,580
I'm...

508
00:38:59,855 --> 00:39:02,488
I'm just someone with a bad character.

509
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,320
I didn't say that.

510
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,600
I have no friends.

511
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,000
I'm antisocial.

512
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,540
And I'm what you know of me.

513
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:30,100
Come on, Boss.

514
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:34,900
I have no doubts about the first two statements.

515
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,020
But for the last one,

516
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:42,660
so what?

517
00:39:44,206 --> 00:39:46,388
It's not something wrong...

518
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:51,087
or a flaw in your life.

519
00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:01,020
I said it before, and I'll say it again.

520
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:06,880
I don't know what kind of people you've met,

521
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,777
but please know

522
00:40:09,777 --> 00:40:12,260
that at least you have me,

523
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,980
Ai P'Jack,

524
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,280
Ai P'Three,

525
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,320
Ai Zo,

526
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,280
and Ai Toobtub.

527
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,520
We've never felt disdain toward you

528
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:26,400
or regarded you as a freak.

529
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:38,870
You seem like you don't believe me.

530
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,180
Why?

531
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,700
Is hugging not enough?

532
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:51,460
Do you need more than a hug?

533
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,320
More than a hug?

534
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,680
Do you mean a kiss?

535
00:40:58,443 --> 00:41:00,300
Hey, Boss.

536
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:05,040
Don't challenge me because I'm not scared of you.

537
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,785
But you know what?

538
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:26,840
Your expression right now is challenging me.

539
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,098
I told you...

540
00:41:35,098 --> 00:41:39,300
I'm the type of person that likes to win.

541
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,640
I'm giving you a chance to surrender now.

542
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,740
I told you, Boss.

543
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,340
You...

544
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,620
can't control me.

[Next Week]
Ever since your breakup, could no one make you smile?

547
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:34,980
What kind of status must you have to kiss?

548
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,580
Maybe people who have feelings for each other.

549
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:40,420
When I give something, I give the best I can.

550
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:44,860
But when I want something, I have to have it.

551
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,500
Why do you want to visit my hometown?

552
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:50,020
There aren't nice hotels for you to stay. I'm telling you this now.

553
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:55,220
I can sleep anywhere, but it would be better if Cher could keep me company.
