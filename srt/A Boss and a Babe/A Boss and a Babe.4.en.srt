Ever since we broke up, has no one ever made you smile?

00:00:02,682 --> 00:00:05,319
When I give something, I give the best I can.

3
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:07,864
I'm taking a day off this Friday. I'm going back to my hometown.

4
00:00:07,864 --> 00:00:08,867
I'll go, too.

5
00:00:08,867 --> 00:00:10,919
How long have you been away from home?

6
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:13,991
About half a year. I usually come home once a year.

7
00:00:13,991 --> 00:00:16,119
For New Year or Songkran?

8
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:17,135
For an anniversary.

9
00:00:17,135 --> 00:00:19,135
Thank you for walking into my life.

10
00:00:19,135 --> 00:00:21,420
It feels great to have you.

11
00:00:22,562 --> 00:00:24,234
Boss!

12
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,525
Let's go, Boss.

13
00:00:34,442 --> 00:00:36,184
You don't have to take me traveling, actually.

14
00:00:36,184 --> 00:00:40,419
You get to visit your family once in a while. You don't need to take care of me.

15
00:00:41,272 --> 00:00:43,165
Boss, stop being so conscientious.

16
00:00:43,165 --> 00:00:47,818
If you were going to feel guilty, it should have been when you kidnapped me to sleep next to you last night.

17
00:00:47,818 --> 00:00:50,937
Otherwise, I would have gotten to sleep next to my mom and grandma.

18
00:00:50,937 --> 00:00:53,262
It's too late then.

19
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,039
Honestly, just me coming home to see them is enough.

20
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,660
I can't stay long or my mom will be so irritated.

21
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:07,135
Who knows? She might shoo me away ahead of schedule.

22
00:01:07,135 --> 00:01:09,030
Can't even your mom stand you?

23
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,419
That's the reason she sent me off to study in Bangkok.

24
00:01:13,419 --> 00:01:16,704
Their ears hurt from hearing me talk.

25
00:01:16,704 --> 00:01:20,979
That's why they were willing to send me far away for my education.

26
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,180
It's just you... who seems to want to stay close to me.

27
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,021
- Have I ever said that?
- Oh, please.

28
00:01:30,021 --> 00:01:32,539
You don't have to say it out loud.

29
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,140
So?

30
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,559
You've fallen for my charms, haven't you?

31
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,039
Why are you getting so close?

32
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,655
Let me tell you something.

33
00:01:56,655 --> 00:02:00,250
When I'm doing business, I always think about my profits.

34
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:05,280
Soon you'll find out which of us has fallen.

35
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,270
What you're saying doesn't make any sense.

36
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,890
I'm off.

37
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,019
Come on, Boss.

38
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,519

Don't tell me you're taking me traveling with this iron junk.

Boss, how dare you call my big bro iron junk?

49
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,847
Is it even older than you?

50
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,095

- Mom, keep it for me.
- Leave it right there.

If you throw it like that and it gets damaged, we might not be able to go back.

Don't worry, Boss.

A country boy like me has known how to ride a bike since I was eight.

74
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:08,413
Is that even legal? You can't get a license at eight.

75
00:05:08,413 --> 00:05:10,834

I'd be surprised if this thing can go 50 km per hour.

Will you be upset if I tell you I've been full since your mom's breakfast?

88

Riding a bike will shake you up and make you hungry again.

It's nothing, Boss.

97
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:22,793
It's a small community. Everyone knows everyone.

98
00:06:22,793 --> 00:06:25,633
You're not from around here. That's why they're staring.

Hey. Did you order it just to look at it?

103
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,553
No.

104
00:06:48,553 --> 00:06:52,959
Oh, Boss. Can I stop by this one place first? We'll continue traveling after that.

105
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,760
Of course.

106

If I cry, what are you going to do?

109
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:38,130
What can I do?

110
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:41,110
You're a grown-up, Boss. Don't be whiny.

111
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,365
I have a question for you.

112
00:07:48,365 --> 00:07:50,602
It might not be so pleasant to ask.

113
00:07:50,602 --> 00:07:54,108
If I want to hire you as a permanent employee, what do you say?

114
00:07:54,108 --> 00:07:57,379
No, I don't like it.

115
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:59,679
You didn't even take time to think.

116
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,139
Do you not like the job or me?

117
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,180
I don't like both.

118
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,460
Do you really not like me?

119
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,262
Boss.

120
00:08:25,262 --> 00:08:26,359
Yes?

121
00:08:26,359 --> 00:08:30,628
When did you find out you didn't like girls?

122
00:08:30,628 --> 00:08:32,870
It was so long ago that I can't remember anymore.

123
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:36,219
My mom even took me to a temple for meditation.

124
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:38,852
She thought that it would cure me of being this way.

125
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,368
Wow.

126
00:08:40,368 --> 00:08:43,878
Does it look that bad in the eyes of the adults?

127
00:08:43,878 --> 00:08:49,267

It's true, parents give birth to us.

But in the end, we solely own our lives.

00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,766
That's true.

132
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,579
So... why are you asking me this?

133
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,219
I just want to know...

134
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,679
how you figured out that this person is the one.

135

This is really good. You must try it. I'm serious.

139
00:09:46,621 --> 00:09:48,521
Try it.

140
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,059
So? Good right?

141
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,615
Yuck!

142
00:09:55,615 --> 00:09:59,219
Cher, you have such bad taste.

143
00:09:59,219 --> 00:10:02,519
What are you reading? Teach me.

144
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,179
I'm not telling you.

145
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,779
I have.

146
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:18,479
It doesn't matter if the person is male or female.

147
00:10:18,479 --> 00:10:22,139
If you feel love, that's the one.

148
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:29,179

149
00:10:35,581 --> 00:10:37,305

What the heck am I feeling?

151
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,640
Get up,

152
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,810
so we can continue on our way.

153
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,670
Or you can just walk home.

154
00:10:49,937 --> 00:10:52,520
My legs are tired.

155
00:11:01,654 --> 00:11:03,654

It's really refreshing.

159
00:11:09,975 --> 00:11:11,677
Go ahead and take deep breaths here, Boss.

160
00:11:11,677 --> 00:11:15,625
If you do that in Bangkok, you'll choke on pollution.

161
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:18,330
Hey, you don't have to stop.

162
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:21,340
The breeze is cool when we ride slowly.

- It's going to chase us.
- What?

164
00:11:25,031 --> 00:11:27,222
Hang on tight, Boss.

165
00:11:33,243 --> 00:11:35,251
This is not funny!

166
00:11:36,974 --> 00:11:38,621
It's coming!

167
00:11:38,621 --> 00:11:41,134
Watch your legs!

168
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,017
- Is it gone yet? Is it? Is it?
- It's gone!

169
00:11:51,781 --> 00:11:53,858

See? Life doesn't need to be so serious.

175
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,959
But I think you should get serious sometimes.

176
00:12:14,164 --> 00:12:17,997
I think our lives are total opposites.

177
00:12:17,997 --> 00:12:23,119
If we combine and divide by two, that should be quite balanced.

178
00:12:24,082 --> 00:12:25,695
Let's go!

179
00:12:25,695 --> 00:12:30,129
You know, with the speed you just used, I can stand on the seat just fine.

180
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:32,738
But a moment ago, you held onto me tightly.

181
00:12:32,738 --> 00:12:35,073
Because you told me to.

182
00:12:36,218 --> 00:12:37,660
And now you're listening to me.

183
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,348
None of your business.

184
00:12:39,348 --> 00:12:41,820
Can we go now?

185
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,420
Boss!

186
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,910
You're hugging so tightly,

187
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:48,280
what if I couldn't breathe and died riding?

188
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,551
You can loosen up your arms.

189
00:12:49,551 --> 00:12:51,240
With the speed of this old pal,

190
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,780
you will get only scratches if it crashes.

191
00:12:53,782 --> 00:12:55,865
It won't be as bad as breaking your skull.

192
00:12:55,865 --> 00:13:00,320
Well... I'm still scared.

193
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,581
Should I kiss your forehead to calm you down so you'd stop being scared?

194
00:13:05,581 --> 00:13:07,155
Should we do it now?

195
00:13:07,155 --> 00:13:09,003
I'm joking, Boss. Gosh!

196
00:13:09,003 --> 00:13:10,839
Let's get going!

197
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:22,402
I told you. To start it, turn the key first.

198
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,042
Thank you.

199
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,522
Ready, Boss?

200
00:13:33,158 --> 00:13:35,219
Let's go.

201
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,341
Where are you taking my stuff? Give it back. It belongs in this house.

202
00:13:51,341 --> 00:13:53,468
- Let go of me. Ouch!
- Phi! Phi!

203
00:13:53,468 --> 00:13:55,555
- Let me go.
- You thief!

204
00:13:55,555 --> 00:13:57,461
Give me my stuff back immediately!

205
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,351
It belonged to my sister, not you.

206
00:13:59,351 --> 00:14:00,344
Give it here!

207
00:14:00,344 --> 00:14:02,251
Let go!

208
00:14:02,251 --> 00:14:03,296
- Boss, stay here.
- But...

209
00:14:03,296 --> 00:14:05,080
Please.

210
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,880
- Let go!
- You!

211
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,239
Get out of my house!

212
00:14:10,821 --> 00:14:12,939
Hey! Stop!

213
00:14:17,831 --> 00:14:19,001
Don't be meddlesome!

214
00:14:19,001 --> 00:14:20,174
It's not the time for that, Ai Thoop.

215
00:14:20,174 --> 00:14:22,812
And why are you here? You said you wouldn't be back.

216
00:14:22,812 --> 00:14:25,051
You two leave right now. Go!

217
00:14:25,051 --> 00:14:26,180
No.

218
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,839
Cher!

219
00:14:28,517 --> 00:14:30,417
Go!

220
00:14:30,417 --> 00:14:32,140
Boss!

221
00:14:33,104 --> 00:14:34,380
Are you okay?

222
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,880
Leave this house or I'll call the police. Get out!

223
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,085
Let's go, Boss. I don't want to put you in trouble.

224
00:14:40,085 --> 00:14:41,422
Get out!

225
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:45,019
Get the hell out and don't ever come back here!

226
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,568
I'll drive it.

227
00:14:58,245 --> 00:15:00,654
You told me to trust you.

228
00:15:00,654 --> 00:15:03,337
It's your turn to trust me now.

229
00:15:05,245 --> 00:15:06,999
Thank you.

230
00:15:21,236 --> 00:15:22,779
Boss.

231
00:15:24,628 --> 00:15:26,979
Can we not go home yet?

232
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,099
Turn your face this way.

233
00:16:08,904 --> 00:16:11,482
It's good that the cut isn't too deep.

234
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,205
This will hurt a little.

235
00:16:32,018 --> 00:16:34,663
Ouch! It burns.

236
00:16:36,194 --> 00:16:38,934
If you're going to do that, just kill me.

237
00:16:38,934 --> 00:16:41,217
Stay still.

238
00:16:44,902 --> 00:16:47,659
Don't overreact.

239
00:17:03,436 --> 00:17:05,240
Thank you.

240
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,780
Cher.

241
00:17:26,443 --> 00:17:29,239
Is there anything you want to tell me?

242
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:36,039
No, there isn't.

243
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:38,366
What are you referring to?

244
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:41,360
I don't know, either.

245
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,671
Maybe it's about how people were looking at us strangely at that restaurant.

246
00:17:45,671 --> 00:17:48,899
Or about why you bought Thai milk tea, and just put it right here.

247
00:17:49,785 --> 00:17:53,464
Or maybe it's about why you risked your life, saving that boy.

248
00:17:55,437 --> 00:17:57,320
It's nothing, Boss.

249
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,060
You're overthinking it.

250
00:18:02,778 --> 00:18:05,251
I'll leave it up to you then.

251
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:08,975
You can tell me when you're ready.

252
00:18:08,975 --> 00:18:11,500
I just want you to know

253
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:16,120
that it's exhausting to keep something to yourself for so long.

254
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:25,520
For someone who keeps everything to himself,

255
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,670
do you think you can lecture me?

256
00:18:28,765 --> 00:18:30,682
Of course.

257
00:18:37,346 --> 00:18:40,760
Ever since you came and listened to my life stories,

258
00:18:41,607 --> 00:18:47,460
I've learned how exhausting it was for me before.

259
00:18:52,328 --> 00:18:54,900
Since I have you,

260
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,860
my life has been a lot lighter.

261
00:19:00,716 --> 00:19:03,559
So I want you to share it with me too.

262
00:19:10,628 --> 00:19:13,659
- But if you're not ready—
- Let me hug you.

263
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,330
How is it?

264
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:50,920
It's as exhausting as I said, right?

265
00:19:56,231 --> 00:19:58,860
I'll tell you about it later, okay?

266
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,030
Whenever you're ready.

267
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,330
No matter how long it takes.

268
00:20:04,977 --> 00:20:06,965
Thank you.

269
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:45,770
Are you leaving already?

270
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:48,270
Didn't you say tomorrow?

271
00:20:51,411 --> 00:20:53,342
I forgot that I have errands to run, Mom.

272
00:20:53,342 --> 00:20:54,977
My boss also has a meeting to attend.

273
00:20:54,977 --> 00:20:57,174
Come visit again, Dear.

274
00:20:57,174 --> 00:21:00,379
Sure. I'll visit again someday.

275
00:21:00,379 --> 00:21:02,994
You guys drive safely, all right.

276
00:21:02,994 --> 00:21:06,662
You're sitting in the passenger seat, so help him with directions too.

277
00:21:06,662 --> 00:21:09,122
Yes, Mom.

278
00:21:09,122 --> 00:21:11,060
We'll be leaving now.

279
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:14,100
Goodbye, Mom and Grandma.

280
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,299
Bye, Grandma.

281
00:21:17,946 --> 00:21:21,149
We miss you already.

282
00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:22,321
Bye bye.

283
00:21:22,321 --> 00:21:24,462
Your visit was so short.

284
00:21:24,462 --> 00:21:26,868
I'll come back again.

285
00:21:38,442 --> 00:21:42,812
You can sleep. I'll wake you up when we're in Bangkok.

286
00:21:42,812 --> 00:21:45,118
My mom just told me to help you with directions.

287
00:21:45,118 --> 00:21:48,114
I guess your mom doesn't know Google Maps.

288
00:21:48,114 --> 00:21:50,802
Are you saying she's low-tech?

289
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:53,393
That's true, though.

290
00:21:53,393 --> 00:21:56,922
Can you stop arguing and take a rest?

291
00:21:56,922 --> 00:21:58,979
Yes, Father.

292
00:22:05,108 --> 00:22:06,965
Happy now?

293
00:22:08,392 --> 00:22:10,086
No.

294
00:22:10,086 --> 00:22:12,979
I have to put a blanket on for you.

295
00:22:44,715 --> 00:22:46,719
Thank you, Boss.

296
00:22:47,822 --> 00:22:51,825
I've put you through many troubles today.

297
00:22:51,825 --> 00:22:53,525
That's all right.

298
00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:00,735
And sorry for spoiling the trip.

299
00:23:00,735 --> 00:23:05,060
But I'm glad to be with you in moments like this.

300
00:23:10,572 --> 00:23:12,966
Take a rest, good boy.

301
00:23:57,218 --> 00:23:58,394
Wow.

302
00:23:58,394 --> 00:24:01,320
What made you so tired?

303
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,239
My boss.

304
00:24:06,788 --> 00:24:08,959
Your coffee is here—

305
00:24:13,445 --> 00:24:15,179
Hello.

306
00:24:16,057 --> 00:24:20,788
Sorry. I didn't know he had a guest.

307
00:24:20,788 --> 00:24:23,859
That's okay. I'm not a guest.

308
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,408
I brought him coffee.

309
00:24:31,408 --> 00:24:35,894
Then... I'll just put it here.

310
00:24:36,746 --> 00:24:38,346
Okay.

311
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:56,130
♫ I'm just someone ordinary ♫

312
00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:02,440
♫ I don't have enough significance or importance ♫

313
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:10,276
♫ To make you, who is a star in the sky, lean toward me ♫

314
00:25:10,276 --> 00:25:13,777
Ai Laem. How was your hometown visit?

315
00:25:13,777 --> 00:25:19,455
It was good. I've missed my mom and it helped a little. I got to rest my brain too.

316
00:25:19,455 --> 00:25:24,137
I'm ready to fight for my life against you and the boss.

317
00:25:24,137 --> 00:25:26,886
Go ahead and take your best shots. I'm ready to fight.

318
00:25:26,886 --> 00:25:30,762
Excuse me, but are you sure you're refreshed?

319
00:25:31,751 --> 00:25:35,602
Why, Jae? Do I seem weird?

320
00:25:35,602 --> 00:25:37,871
Feeling refreshing has to be like, "Ah!"

321
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:39,654
- Do it again.
- Ah!

322
00:25:41,101 --> 00:25:43,288
I've known you for so long, I can tell.

323
00:25:43,288 --> 00:25:44,788
What's up?

324
00:25:46,994 --> 00:25:49,948
- Gosh! It's nothing.
- Wow!

325
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:52,294
If your voice got any higher, you can be a coconut tree.

326
00:25:52,294 --> 00:25:55,958
You keep playing around with that chicken and rice.

327
00:25:55,958 --> 00:25:59,667
You always make me feel worried.

328
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,802
When did you come in?

329
00:26:13,802 --> 00:26:16,060
Why are you sleep-deprived?

330
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:23,301
Did Cher just come in here a moment ago?

331
00:26:23,301 --> 00:26:27,233
So was he that boy you told me about?

332
00:26:27,233 --> 00:26:30,446
Hey, he's cute.

333
00:26:30,446 --> 00:26:31,796
Did you meet him?

334
00:26:31,796 --> 00:26:35,225
He brought you coffee when I was here.

335
00:26:38,544 --> 00:26:40,541
- Why didn't you wake me up?
- Oh, please.

336
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:43,935
You slept like a dead man. No one could wake you.

337
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:47,519
By the way, how did your invasion of his hometown go?

338
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:52,762
Look at you all smiling. I bet something good happened, right?

339
00:26:54,457 --> 00:26:55,791
There were good and bad things.

340
00:26:55,791 --> 00:26:57,960
How? Tell me about it.

341
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,720
That way I can help you.

342
00:26:59,728 --> 00:27:02,270
It went quite well at first.

343
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,812
Then something happened. He refused to tell me what it was.

344
00:27:04,812 --> 00:27:07,172
It seems like something serious. He may need more time.

345
00:27:07,172 --> 00:27:09,857
Did you recap it so that only you can understand?

346
00:27:09,857 --> 00:27:12,628
In simple terms, it went well.

347
00:27:12,628 --> 00:27:14,737
So did you two get along?

348
00:27:26,703 --> 00:27:28,780
Damn you, Ai Laem!

349
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,940
Do you have COVID?

350
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,073
That virus is super old!

351
00:27:33,073 --> 00:27:35,640
Everyone in the country has been immunized by now.

352
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,078
You can still catch it.

353
00:27:39,787 --> 00:27:41,940
Gosh! Jae!

354
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,582
I'll die because of you.

355
00:27:43,582 --> 00:27:46,460
Take care of yourself. Don't get sick.

356
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,414
- How about this?
- That's good.

357
00:27:49,414 --> 00:27:51,059
What's that?

358
00:27:53,391 --> 00:27:55,699
The coffee today was great.

359
00:28:17,351 --> 00:28:19,810
Khun Aoi, I won't be back in the office today.

360
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,220
I'll see you tomorrow at the meeting.

361
00:28:21,222 --> 00:28:23,120
Yes, Boss.

362
00:28:41,502 --> 00:28:46,150
- Oh, my goodness.
- Old flames reunited.

363
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:51,192
Ever since Khun Porsche got back from abroad, he's never left the boss's side.

364
00:28:51,192 --> 00:28:55,564
That's good though. He's brightening up the boss a little.

365
00:28:55,564 --> 00:28:57,443
That's true, Jae.

366
00:28:57,443 --> 00:28:59,481
Gosh, he's so hot.

367
00:29:21,243 --> 00:29:24,840
Hey. What have you been smiling at?

368
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,337
Can't you tell?

369
00:29:27,337 --> 00:29:28,894
About what?

370
00:29:29,507 --> 00:29:31,990
About Nong Cher.

371
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:35,350
I noticed he looked kind of stiff. It was strange.

372
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,660
Did I do something wrong?

373
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:42,131
No, you didn't. But you did the right thing.

374
00:29:42,131 --> 00:29:44,477
You must thank me.

375
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:48,563
What are you saying? I don't get it.

376
00:29:49,631 --> 00:29:53,339
Well, Nong Cher is jealous.

377
00:29:55,611 --> 00:29:57,469
Can't you tell?

378
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:03,139
P'Jack, I'm not riding home with you today.

379
00:30:03,139 --> 00:30:05,105
But we have a gathering at Hia Tub's café, don't we?

380
00:30:05,105 --> 00:30:07,364
I'm meeting my high school friends.

381
00:30:12,893 --> 00:30:14,688
Couldn't you tell?

382
00:30:21,116 --> 00:30:23,194
If it gets late, let me know. I'll pick you up.

383
00:30:23,194 --> 00:30:25,882
It's fine. I can go home myself.

384
00:30:29,225 --> 00:30:31,237
What the heck is wrong with him?

385
00:30:36,428 --> 00:30:40,060
Well, Nong Cher is jealous.

386
00:30:50,397 --> 00:30:51,483
Hello.

387
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:53,476
Boss.

388
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:57,419
And now you can't sleep if you don't hear my voice, can you?

389
00:30:58,214 --> 00:31:00,157
Come and see me.

390
00:31:02,344 --> 00:31:04,219
Where are you?

391
00:31:12,994 --> 00:31:14,919
Come and see me.

392
00:31:17,147 --> 00:31:18,992
Where are you?

393
00:31:22,788 --> 00:31:25,057
Hey, let's cheer!

394
00:31:25,908 --> 00:31:27,434
How is it going, Ai Cher?

395
00:31:27,434 --> 00:31:30,264
I haven't seen you since that incident.

396
00:31:30,264 --> 00:31:32,676
- What incident?
- Tian's incident.

397
00:31:32,676 --> 00:31:37,122
My condolences to you, man. Your wife and child both died.

398
00:31:37,122 --> 00:31:39,782
- Calm down, Cher.
- He's drunk and talking nonsense.

399
00:31:39,782 --> 00:31:41,480
The unborn child might not have been yours.

400
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,970
You also know that Tian was—

401
00:31:43,975 --> 00:31:46,676
You, Bastard! Tian wasn't like that!

402
00:31:46,676 --> 00:31:48,169
- She was a slut!
- You son of a bitch!

403
00:31:48,169 --> 00:31:50,222
- Easy there, man!
- Tian was a good person!

404
00:31:50,222 --> 00:31:54,428
- She's too good to be gossiped about by a lowlife like you!
- What the fuck are you saying?

405
00:31:54,428 --> 00:31:58,000
- You know nothing!
- Calm down! Calm down!

406
00:32:03,073 --> 00:32:04,625
Are we done here, Sir?

407
00:32:04,625 --> 00:32:06,437
Thank you.

408
00:32:11,643 --> 00:32:13,277

410
00:32:19,545 --> 00:32:21,065
Cher.

411
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:24,661

412
00:32:24,661 --> 00:32:26,731

413
00:32:26,731 --> 00:32:28,540
Please don't, Boss.

414
00:32:29,602 --> 00:32:31,890
I don't want the guys to know.

415
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:34,110
I don't want to worry them.

416
00:32:36,409 --> 00:32:38,739
I'll drive you to your dorm then.

417
00:32:42,452 --> 00:32:44,639

So?

420
00:33:12,917 --> 00:33:15,683
You would have yelled at me for being taken to the police station.

421
00:33:15,683 --> 00:33:18,439
You're not the Cher I know, either.

422
00:33:23,214 --> 00:33:25,868
What will I get from yelling at you?

423
00:33:25,868 --> 00:33:29,902
You already punched him. I already paid the fine for you.

424
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:35,530
The only thing left to ask is...

425
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:37,719
Do you have anything to tell me?

426
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:00,860
I don't know if you need to know this,

427
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,970
but I want to tell you anyway.

Hey, you're here.

441
00:35:30,636 --> 00:35:34,597
Tian, I found a way for us to make money.

442
00:35:34,597 --> 00:35:37,634
Not only for tuition,

443
00:35:37,634 --> 00:35:41,597
we can even move to Bangkok or even abroad.

444

- How?
- Well, you can sing really well, right?

445

Let me learn filming and video editing for a bit, then I'll help you.

448
00:35:54,408 --> 00:35:57,268
I tried doing it just now, and it doesn't seem that hard.

449
00:35:59,226 --> 00:36:00,910
I'm afraid it's too late.

Hey, don't get discouraged yet.

451

We still have several months until the university exam.

I just realized when she said it was too late,

453
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:12,610
she wasn't talking about making money.

454
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:17,290
I didn't know she was pregnant at that time,

455
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:20,200
until her body was found floating in the pond.

456
00:36:22,882 --> 00:36:25,454
The villagers think I knocked her up.

457
00:36:25,454 --> 00:36:28,019
How is that even possible, though?

458
00:36:29,338 --> 00:36:32,980
We only held hands once...

459
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:37,300
It was when I asked her to be my girlfriend and she rejected me.

460
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:41,779
Cher, it doesn't matter what people say, right?

461
00:36:43,645 --> 00:36:45,780
It does, Boss.

462
00:36:48,006 --> 00:36:51,480
I want people to stop looking down on her.

463
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,582
Actually, when you thought they were staring at us,

464
00:36:57,268 --> 00:36:59,419
I was the reason.

465
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:03,190
The villagers hate me.

466
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:06,510
It wasn't your fault.

I couldn't save Tian.

Whatever bad things Tian went through,

471
00:37:35,071 --> 00:37:40,459
