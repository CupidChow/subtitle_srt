Don't let anyone else ruin our relationship.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,370
The email that sent the evidence to that company came from your department.

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,705
I'm asking you who did this!

4
00:00:12,705 --> 00:00:14,408
I'm so disappointed in you.

5
00:00:14,408 --> 00:00:16,600
There, there.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,966
I don't want to lose him.

7
00:00:18,966 --> 00:00:20,974
I love him.

8
00:00:23,081 --> 00:00:24,505
Ai Thoop's friend called saying he's been arrested at the police station.

9
00:00:24,505 --> 00:00:26,280
What?

10
00:00:27,636 --> 00:00:30,288
I'm sulking, but I can lean on your shoulder.

11
00:00:30,288 --> 00:00:32,088
Of course.

12
00:00:41,131 --> 00:00:42,515
What should I do, Boss?

13
00:00:42,515 --> 00:00:44,091
What can I do to get him out?

14
00:00:44,091 --> 00:00:46,510
For now, calm down and go to him first.

15
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,160
I'll talk to the officer.

16
00:00:49,163 --> 00:00:51,094
You will be able to help Ai Thoop, right?

17
00:00:51,094 --> 00:00:54,419
Yes, but he's probably really scared and shocked right now.

18
00:00:54,419 --> 00:00:58,850
You must stay calm, be strong, and be his pillar.

19
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:06,293
Very good.

20
00:01:08,556 --> 00:01:11,041
Come back soon, Boss.

21
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:13,033
I'll be quick.

22
00:01:21,188 --> 00:01:23,136
Who told you?

23
00:01:23,927 --> 00:01:25,574
We can talk about that later.

24
00:01:25,574 --> 00:01:27,751
What happened to you?

25
00:01:27,751 --> 00:01:29,428
How did you end up here?

26
00:01:29,428 --> 00:01:32,001
Would you believe me if I told you?

27
00:01:32,001 --> 00:01:33,992
I've told the police a hundred times already.

28
00:01:33,992 --> 00:01:36,463
They don't believe it.

29
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:40,533
If you don't believe what I say, I won't say it ever again.

30
00:01:50,163 --> 00:01:51,833
Ai Thoop,

31
00:01:52,771 --> 00:01:54,833
I'm your brother.

32
00:01:57,282 --> 00:01:59,752
Consider what I've done to you.

33
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:02,960
If I were you, I would cut such a shitty brother out of my life.

34
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,783
That's you, not me.

35
00:02:06,783 --> 00:02:11,633
I will never cut you off my life, Ai Thoop.

36
00:02:15,448 --> 00:02:19,514
Will you tell me now how you ended up here?

37
00:02:25,542 --> 00:02:30,236
I didn't do it. I didn't take or sell.

38
00:02:30,236 --> 00:02:32,225
Everything happened so fast.

39
00:02:32,225 --> 00:02:37,416
The police suddenly barged in and Ai Ball shoved them into my hands.

40
00:02:38,034 --> 00:02:39,913
Ai Ball?

Thank you.

51
00:04:00,253 --> 00:04:02,324
How did it go, Boss?

52
00:04:02,324 --> 00:04:04,773
When will Thoop be released?

53
00:04:06,436 --> 00:04:09,754
His case involves narcotics.

54
00:04:09,754 --> 00:04:12,180
I have the company lawyer work on it.

55
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,120
He confirmed Thoop can get bailed out,

56
00:04:15,123 --> 00:04:17,941
but we need quite a large amount of money for the bail.

57
00:04:19,014 --> 00:04:21,159
How much?

58
00:04:21,159 --> 00:04:23,313
Will I be able to get it?

59
00:04:24,026 --> 00:04:26,276
I took care of that for you,

60
00:04:26,276 --> 00:04:29,691
but what I'm saying is that there are still measures to take

61
00:04:29,691 --> 00:04:33,937
which can delay Thoop's release to tomorrow.

62
00:04:34,585 --> 00:04:37,273
So Thoop must spend the night in jail?

63
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:53,014
I'm sorry I can't get him out today.

64
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:04,524
But Cher, the bail is temporary.

65
00:05:04,524 --> 00:05:08,712
Things will be over once we can prove his innocence.

66
00:05:08,712 --> 00:05:13,404
But if there is evidence that he's involved with drugs,

67
00:05:13,404 --> 00:05:15,936
we must comply with the law.

68
00:05:17,028 --> 00:05:19,679
But I believe him, Boss.

69
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:21,740
He said he didn't do it.

70
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,866

I'll punch you so hard that you get a broken jaw.

146
00:11:07,325 --> 00:11:10,529
Where is he, though?

147
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:12,765
Did he go back?

148
00:11:12,765 --> 00:11:15,853
He went to buy you some food.

149
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,019
There aren't many restaurants around.

It's not a pleasant place to be.

156

If you can stay, so can I.

157

You don't have to worry.

What can we do?

163
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:07,641
Can we go after Ai Ball and make him confess?

164
00:12:08,758 --> 00:12:10,730
You don't have to worry about that.

165

Put your mind at ease.

167

Do you get it?

180
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,957
You're looking so haggard.

181
00:13:23,957 --> 00:13:27,640
Stop crying like a baby. What a loser.

182
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,450
Look who's talking?

183
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,890
If I'm a loser, so are you!

184
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,068
You're a bigger loser!

185
00:13:32,068 --> 00:13:33,740
You didn't cry like this when your bike crashed when you're younger.

186
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,933
You're a bigger loser. Your snot is everywhere.

187
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:39,267
Your snot is all over my shirt! I have to go home and wash it.

188
00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:41,285
Let's eat now. You guys can stop fighting.

189
00:13:41,285 --> 00:13:44,105
If you get any louder, the police will chase us out.

190
00:13:47,715 --> 00:13:49,810
Eat it all up.

191
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:52,110
That way, you'll be energized for tomorrow.

192
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,716
Here, Boss.

193
00:14:05,737 --> 00:14:07,060
Should we go home?

194
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,430
We can come back in the morning.

195
00:14:10,321 --> 00:14:11,880
Boss, you can go home.

196
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,850
I will stay to keep Thoop company.

197
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:19,490
How can you stay? You can't sleep inside the station.

198
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,179
I can just lie down right here.

199
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:25,040
The sun rises in a few hours.

200
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,974
I don't want him to look this way and see no one.

201
00:14:29,653 --> 00:14:33,942
At least he'll feel at ease when he sees me.

202
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,499
Oh, Boss.

203
00:14:37,499 --> 00:14:39,702
Can I have a day off tomorrow?

204
00:14:39,702 --> 00:14:43,869
If P'Jack asks, you can say I'm sick.

205
00:14:43,869 --> 00:14:46,953
Why don't you tell your friends the truth?

206
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:49,094
I don't want it to be a big deal.

207
00:14:49,094 --> 00:14:52,844
Besides, I don't think Ai Thoop wants people to know he's in jail.

208
00:14:52,844 --> 00:14:54,996
Even though he isn't guilty,

209
00:14:54,996 --> 00:15:00,234
I think the less people know, the better. Right, Boss?

210
00:15:00,874 --> 00:15:02,474
Right.

211
00:15:10,258 --> 00:15:11,854
Hello, Khun Aoi.

212
00:15:11,854 --> 00:15:14,229
I'm sorry I called you this late.

213
00:15:14,229 --> 00:15:16,748
I don't think I can make it to the meeting tomorrow.

214
00:15:16,748 --> 00:15:19,071
There's a small issue at the hotel.

215
00:15:19,071 --> 00:15:21,121
And I won't be in the office tomorrow either.

216
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:22,941
Okay.

217
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,030
What are you doing, Boss?

218
00:15:27,031 --> 00:15:28,560
Don't you see?

219
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,640
I'm keeping you company.

220
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:35,125
Spending all night among mosquitoes isn't funny, Boss.

221
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,517
Am I laughing?

222
00:15:37,517 --> 00:15:39,616
Still in the mood to make a joke, right?

223
00:15:39,616 --> 00:15:42,854
Go home. You can come back tomorrow.

224
00:15:42,854 --> 00:15:44,751
No.

225
00:15:44,751 --> 00:15:47,112
The sun will rise soon, right?

226
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:51,011
Yes, but it's not comfortable here.

227
00:15:51,968 --> 00:15:55,069
If you can stay, so can I.

228
00:15:56,596 --> 00:16:00,467
Why is the boss in this company so stubborn?

229
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,070
I'm only stubborn when I'm with someone.

230
00:16:06,362 --> 00:16:10,742
And why does that unlucky person have to be me?

231
00:16:10,742 --> 00:16:12,231
I guess it's destiny.

232
00:16:12,231 --> 00:16:15,506
The rug that says "Welcome"?
(T/N: Destiny is a compound word that contains "rug")

233
00:16:15,506 --> 00:16:18,588
You already played that joke. Do you have a new one?

234
00:16:18,588 --> 00:16:20,731
I was just testing your memory.

235
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:22,447
I thought your brain was deteriorating since you're old.

236
00:16:22,447 --> 00:16:26,199
Though we're only a few years apart, please stop those jokes.

237
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:28,160
- I'm quite touchy about it.
- But your face is aging already.

238
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,808
Cher.

239
00:16:31,525 --> 00:16:34,413
Come on, I'm kidding.

240
00:16:34,413 --> 00:16:36,813
You're so stern.

241
00:16:41,396 --> 00:16:43,993
Should we play something to kill time?

242
00:16:43,993 --> 00:16:45,837
Like what?

243
00:16:47,432 --> 00:16:50,334
Like a truth confession game.

244
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,615
You said you have something important to tell me.

245
00:16:57,615 --> 00:16:59,415
Yes.

246
00:16:59,415 --> 00:17:01,142
Go on.

247
00:17:01,142 --> 00:17:04,730
About the evidence to expose Khun Thyme,

248
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:08,020
I was the one who did it.

249
00:17:08,574 --> 00:17:13,764
Nong Cher happened to see my email and took the blame for me.

250
00:17:13,764 --> 00:17:17,425
I was going to tell you the truth, but he told me not to.

251
00:17:17,425 --> 00:17:20,167
He said it's better to let you think this way.

252
00:17:20,167 --> 00:17:21,265
He said that?

253
00:17:21,265 --> 00:17:22,858
Yes.

254
00:17:22,858 --> 00:17:26,207
But I feel bad things turned out like this.

255
00:17:26,207 --> 00:17:28,794
I don't want people to think Nong Cher is responsible for it,

256
00:17:28,794 --> 00:17:31,274
especially you.

257
00:17:31,274 --> 00:17:32,897
Thank you for telling me.

258
00:17:32,897 --> 00:17:36,060
You can fire me or deduct my salary.

259
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,490
I'm really guilty.

260
00:17:37,498 --> 00:17:39,398
I won't do that.

261
00:17:39,398 --> 00:17:41,270
I don't know the reasons why Cher did that,

262
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:44,920
but one of them was that he wanted to protect you.

263
00:17:44,927 --> 00:17:48,841
- But Boss...
- I won't ruin his intention.

264
00:17:48,841 --> 00:17:51,336
You can take it easy now.

265
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:55,853
Thank you so much for telling me the truth.

266
00:17:57,275 --> 00:17:59,253
Shit!

267
00:17:59,902 --> 00:18:01,614
You knew about it?

268
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:03,114
Yes.

269
00:18:04,722 --> 00:18:09,634
What about last night when you said Thyme was important this and that?

270
00:18:11,537 --> 00:18:13,481
I just wanted to hear the truth from you.

271
00:18:13,481 --> 00:18:14,874
No way.

272
00:18:14,874 --> 00:18:17,350
I wanted you to confess

273
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:21,290
and to see how many lies you would keep telling.

274
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,511
You're savage.

275
00:18:25,511 --> 00:18:27,053
Yes.

276
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,844
Do you have anything else to say to me?

277
00:18:32,928 --> 00:18:38,694
I once spilled your coffee and replaced it with an instant 3-in-1 coffee.

278
00:18:38,694 --> 00:18:40,965
It was good, right?

279
00:18:40,965 --> 00:18:42,908
You troublemaker!

280
00:18:43,954 --> 00:18:46,353
I'm sleepy.

281
00:18:46,353 --> 00:18:50,851
If I sleep here, will the police step on me?

282
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,637
Are you asleep yet, P'Three?

283
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,637
No, I'm not.

284
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,300
Then... can I ask you something?

285
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,794
Yes, ask away.

286
00:19:12,004 --> 00:19:17,236
If we lose this competition, will you be upset?

287
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:25,640
Will I be upset?

288
00:19:26,448 --> 00:19:29,674
Of course, I will be.

289
00:19:29,674 --> 00:19:33,616
But I won't lose my head like last time, I promise.

290
00:19:33,616 --> 00:19:35,125
Don't worry.

291
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,239
Okay.

292
00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:40,437
I don't want you to blame yourself.

293
00:19:40,437 --> 00:19:42,051
We're a team.

294
00:19:42,051 --> 00:19:44,670
Everyone takes the blame equally.

295
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:46,050
Understood?

296
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,846
Yes, I know.

297
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:54,742
Why did you ask, by the way?

298
00:19:59,148 --> 00:20:01,140
Because I care about you.

299
00:20:04,363 --> 00:20:06,236
Because I love you.

300
00:20:08,861 --> 00:20:10,836
I love you, too.

301
00:20:27,881 --> 00:20:30,399
This is way more comfortable than sleeping at the stairs.

302
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:33,613
But your eyes might hurt a little when you wake up.

303
00:20:37,177 --> 00:20:40,146
Last time, we slept on the beach.

304
00:20:40,146 --> 00:20:41,983
This time, we're sleeping in front of the police station.

305
00:20:41,983 --> 00:20:45,536
What an experience, Ai Laem.

306
00:20:46,176 --> 00:20:47,935
Cher.

307
00:20:49,099 --> 00:20:50,599
Yes?

308
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,339
I haven't apologized to you yet.

309
00:20:56,436 --> 00:20:58,533
For what?

310
00:21:00,296 --> 00:21:03,331
For yelling at you in the meeting room.

311
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,744
Thyme was my only friend.

312
00:21:06,744 --> 00:21:09,503
I was willing to do anything to keep our friendship.

313
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,050
But it all failed in the end.

314
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,042
I understand, Boss.

315
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:19,113
You told me about it before.

316
00:21:19,786 --> 00:21:24,548
When I learned you did it, I got really upset.

317
00:21:24,548 --> 00:21:27,942
I thought you were the one who understood me the most.

318
00:21:30,204 --> 00:21:34,942
I'm sorry, too, for lying.

319
00:21:34,942 --> 00:21:38,120
Let's call it even.

320
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:43,250
Hey. Were you trying to use that as an excuse to keep your distance from me?

321
00:21:48,081 --> 00:21:50,173
Something like that.

322
00:21:51,115 --> 00:21:53,156
But I won't do it anymore.

323
00:21:54,156 --> 00:21:56,146
It's so damn exhausting.

324
00:22:00,171 --> 00:22:01,871
Cher.

325
00:22:03,825 --> 00:22:06,173
Please don't disappear on me again.

326
00:22:08,922 --> 00:22:14,333
I can't imagine a life without you.

327
00:22:17,957 --> 00:22:19,933
I know.

328
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:25,994
You'll probably be like a dog abandoned by its owner.

329
00:22:27,288 --> 00:22:28,891
Right.

330
00:22:30,385 --> 00:22:32,513
That is likely how it'll be.

331
00:22:38,404 --> 00:22:40,445
Let's get some rest, Boss.

332
00:22:41,891 --> 00:22:44,593
I want time to fly fast...

333
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,996
so Ai Thoop can be out.

334
00:23:04,719 --> 00:23:07,065
Ai Thoop, where are you, Scumbag?

335
00:23:07,065 --> 00:23:09,288
- Come out here! Ai Thoop!
- Shit.

336
00:23:09,288 --> 00:23:10,895
What's happening?

337
00:23:10,895 --> 00:23:12,845
Ai Thoop's mother and stepfather are here.

338
00:23:12,845 --> 00:23:16,193
We should hurry. Something bad must be happening.

339
00:23:21,406 --> 00:23:23,265
You made a fool out of me!

340
00:23:23,265 --> 00:23:25,878
Everyone now knows that the son of this household is a convict!

341
00:23:25,878 --> 00:23:29,962
Khun, please remain calm and silent. This is a government office.

342
00:23:29,962 --> 00:23:31,666
Who the hell is your kid?

343
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:35,056
Phi! Calm down. Let's ask him what happened first.

344
00:23:35,056 --> 00:23:37,919
Calm? Look at your son. Look what he did.

345
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,763
Relatives, please step outside to calm down.

346
00:23:41,763 --> 00:23:43,028
What's happening, Ma'am?

347
00:23:43,028 --> 00:23:46,568
You're the one who's the bad influence on Ai Thoop, aren't you?

348
00:23:46,568 --> 00:23:48,068
Hey!

349
00:23:49,008 --> 00:23:51,351
What are you doing? Are you ganging up against me?

350
00:23:51,351 --> 00:23:54,262
Officer, arrest them. They're hurting me.

351
00:23:54,262 --> 00:23:56,166
Don't even think I came to help!

352
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:57,778
I'm here to rub it in your face, you bastard!

353
00:23:57,778 --> 00:23:59,642
One day, you're going to die in prison.

354
00:23:59,642 --> 00:24:02,573
- Who's going to die in prison?
- You!

355
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:05,290
Thoop, what are you saying?

356
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:07,487
He's the one who raped my sister and made her commit suicide.

357
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,836
He's the one who's going to die in prison!

358
00:24:10,878 --> 00:24:13,917
P'Cher, you've been wondering why P'Tian committed suicide, right?

359
00:24:13,917 --> 00:24:17,190
It's him. That son of a bitch was the reason.

360
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:19,724
It's him. That son of a bitch was the reason.

361
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:23,354
You've been wondering why P'Tian committed suicide, right?

362
00:24:25,996 --> 00:24:27,643
Cher,

363
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:32,641
what do you think people live for?

364
00:24:36,436 --> 00:24:38,538
For their happiness, I guess.

365
00:24:39,325 --> 00:24:41,931
What if there's no way of finding happiness?

366
00:24:41,931 --> 00:24:44,571
Can we just die?

367
00:24:44,571 --> 00:24:46,194
Tian,

368
00:24:47,217 --> 00:24:48,919
are you okay?

369
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:51,051
Why are you asking that question?

370
00:24:51,629 --> 00:24:55,754
It's nothing. I keep seeing news on people committing suicide,

371
00:24:55,754 --> 00:24:57,442
so I just wanted to know.

372
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:07,137
I think everyone has their reason.

373
00:25:09,316 --> 00:25:10,963
Right.

374
00:25:10,963 --> 00:25:17,050
For some people, being happy might not be their answer in life.

375
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:20,853
Maybe what they want is just to be out of misery.

376
00:25:22,677 --> 00:25:24,554
That's all.

377
00:25:25,994 --> 00:25:28,439
Why didn't you tell me?

378
00:25:28,995 --> 00:25:31,540
I wanted to protect Tian.

379
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,796
I didn't want anyone to feel sorry for her

380
00:25:32,796 --> 00:25:36,964
because she had been raped repeatedly by her stepfather until she killed herself.

381
00:25:37,534 --> 00:25:39,776
Repeatedly?

382
00:25:42,132 --> 00:25:44,435
For three years.

383
00:25:44,435 --> 00:25:47,085
P'Tian had to put up with it for three years.

384
00:25:47,085 --> 00:25:51,743
I tried to convince her to tell you or anyone who could help.

385
00:25:51,743 --> 00:25:53,753
But she refused.

386
00:25:54,965 --> 00:25:57,296
How did that happen?

387
00:25:59,584 --> 00:26:03,571
I'm sorry for letting the villagers think you knocked her up.

388
00:26:03,571 --> 00:26:08,293
I knew everything, but P'Tian asked me not to say anything.

389
00:26:08,293 --> 00:26:10,873
She didn't want you to know it.

390
00:26:10,873 --> 00:26:13,334
She's afraid you would be disgusted by her.

391
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:19,269
It's not that she didn't love you when she turned you down.

392
00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:23,336
But she thought she was dirty and didn't deserve you.

393
00:26:30,936 --> 00:26:33,834
It's been such a long day for everyone.

394
00:26:33,834 --> 00:26:35,687
We should get some rest.

395
00:26:35,687 --> 00:26:38,785
Thoop, I'll get you some new clothes,

396
00:26:38,785 --> 00:26:41,231
but there's only one bedroom here.

397
00:26:41,231 --> 00:26:43,673
I can take the couch. It's fine.

398
00:26:44,351 --> 00:26:46,814
You should get some sleep then.

399
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:49,271
There's another bathroom over there.

400
00:26:49,271 --> 00:26:50,839
Sure.

401
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:56,722
Cher, let's wash up and go to bed.

402
00:26:56,722 --> 00:26:58,048
We'll think again tomorrow.

403
00:26:58,048 --> 00:27:00,604
Can we put that man behind bars, Boss?

404
00:27:00,604 --> 00:27:03,262
Can we get him locked up?

405
00:27:03,262 --> 00:27:06,843
I must consult my lawyer about this.

406
00:27:06,843 --> 00:27:09,977
But to be honest, it happened a long time ago,

407
00:27:09,977 --> 00:27:14,195
the evidence was gone along with Tian's body.

408
00:27:14,195 --> 00:27:16,841
And what if we have a witness who saw it happen?

409
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:21,111
Can we get him locked up in prison?

410
00:27:30,356 --> 00:27:33,594
We haven't slept for over 24 hours.

411
00:27:36,378 --> 00:27:39,922
I don't know how to begin to feel sorry for Tian.

412
00:27:39,922 --> 00:27:42,550
The matter about her getting raped by her stepdad,

413
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:46,374
or the fact that her mother knew all along that she was raped,

414
00:27:47,219 --> 00:27:50,113
but she pretended to see nothing.

415
00:27:56,915 --> 00:28:00,110
By now, she may have been reborn into a warm family,

416
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:03,340
or she might be an angel in heaven.

417
00:28:04,329 --> 00:28:10,331
What we shouldn't do is sit here and regret things we can't change.

418
00:28:10,331 --> 00:28:13,410
We must seek justice for Tian

419
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:18,740
and bring the one responsible to punishment.

420
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,035
I will surely do that, Boss.

421
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,634
Great.

422
00:28:25,419 --> 00:28:28,736
I'm not. You are.

423
00:28:28,736 --> 00:28:34,073
If it wasn't for you, I would have no clue when I could get Ai Thoop out.

424
00:28:35,573 --> 00:28:39,600
I couldn't do anything more

425
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,840
than sit next to him at the police station.

426
00:28:42,784 --> 00:28:47,195
Thank you, Boss, for not leaving me.

427
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:53,591
Let's go to bed.

428
00:28:54,174 --> 00:28:55,591
Come on.

429
00:29:34,075 --> 00:29:37,482
Can't sleep? Is it the couch?

430
00:29:37,482 --> 00:29:39,017
Do you want to sleep in the bedroom with us?

431
00:29:39,017 --> 00:29:40,752
It's okay.

432
00:29:40,752 --> 00:29:42,894
Why are you out here?

433
00:29:42,894 --> 00:29:44,671
I'm thirsty.

434
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:47,137
Is P'Cher asleep?

435
00:29:48,512 --> 00:29:50,393
Yes, he is.

436
00:29:51,563 --> 00:29:55,736
He slept as soon as he laid down. He must be tired.

437
00:29:56,612 --> 00:29:58,159
I...

438
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,493
I'm sorry I said bad things to you.

439
00:30:02,906 --> 00:30:06,480
Your big brother already apologized on your behalf.

440
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,520
I didn't take it to heart.

441
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:12,007
I was just being childish.

442
00:30:12,007 --> 00:30:16,345
I was afraid P'Cher would stop loving P'Tian. And P'Tian will be forgotten.

443
00:30:18,202 --> 00:30:20,333
That will never happen.

444
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:23,058
Cher never forgot about Tian.

445
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:26,669
She will remain in his heart forever.

446
00:30:26,669 --> 00:30:30,238
If P'Tian is the person in P'Cher's heart,

447
00:30:30,238 --> 00:30:33,769
then what about you? Who are you?

448
00:30:35,676 --> 00:30:37,243
Me?

449
00:30:43,629 --> 00:30:45,634
If Cher allows it,

450
00:30:46,531 --> 00:30:50,035
I can be his present and future.

451
00:30:50,035 --> 00:30:53,388
I don't know. This thing takes time.

452
00:30:53,388 --> 00:30:55,742
We should learn more about each other.

453
00:30:56,804 --> 00:30:59,600
Thank you so much for helping me.

454
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,493
Even though you helped because of P'Cher, I'm really thankful.

455
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,048
You're welcome.

456
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:23,196
Where have you been?

457
00:31:23,196 --> 00:31:24,944
Out to drink water.

458
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:28,422
Can Ai Thoop sleep fine?

459
00:31:28,422 --> 00:31:31,456
He can. Don't worry.

460
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:02,422
We're having this meeting because the 7th mission is facing an issue.

461
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:04,033
It failed the QA process.

462
00:32:04,033 --> 00:32:08,820
The QA team sent it right back to us because...

463
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,937
I'll see you later. Bye.

464
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,852
I know I'm good-looking,

465
00:32:23,852 --> 00:32:25,342
but you guys don't need to stare.

466
00:32:25,342 --> 00:32:27,418
Where have you been?

467
00:32:28,096 --> 00:32:29,609
I was sick.

468
00:32:30,729 --> 00:32:33,541
- I'm sick.
- What's your illness, Nong Cher?

469
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:36,819
I've got a stye.

470
00:32:36,819 --> 00:32:40,154
Where is the stye this time, Nong Cher?

471
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:45,013
On my nose, P'Ink.

472
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:47,720
I should go.

473
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,324
That's such an old joke.

474
00:32:49,324 --> 00:32:51,902
Tell him there are lots of illnesses he can choose from.

475
00:32:51,902 --> 00:32:53,551
He should change illnesses. He got caught.

476
00:32:54,661 --> 00:32:56,614
What? Why didn't you tell me?

477
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:59,542
I didn't want it to be a big deal.

478
00:32:59,542 --> 00:33:02,732
Ai Thoop was in jail. Of course, it's a big deal!

479
00:33:02,732 --> 00:33:05,923
Okay. I dealt with it.

480
00:33:05,923 --> 00:33:09,643
If I hadn't got the boss's help, I'd have come to you.

481
00:33:09,643 --> 00:33:11,789
- How much did the boss pay to bail Thoop out?
- 500.000.

482
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:13,201
What?

483
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:18,088
Keep it down. People are staring.

484
00:33:18,088 --> 00:33:19,991
500.000?

485
00:33:19,991 --> 00:33:22,309
Ai Thoop is such a troublemaker.

486
00:33:22,309 --> 00:33:25,056
Where will you get that money to pay him back?

487
00:33:25,982 --> 00:33:28,119
The boss said I could take my time.

488
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:31,696
Once the case is closed and Ai Thoop is proven innocent, we should get that amount back.

489
00:33:31,696 --> 00:33:34,977
Until then, it can take years.

490
00:33:34,977 --> 00:33:36,786
Yes.

491
00:33:36,786 --> 00:33:39,211
He doesn't accept installments.

492
00:33:39,211 --> 00:33:41,013
I don't know what else to do.

493
00:33:41,896 --> 00:33:43,838
How's Ai Thoop doing anyway?

494
00:33:45,126 --> 00:33:47,233
I dropped him off at his dorm this morning.

495
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:50,366
He felt so bad that I felt bad, too.

496
00:33:50,366 --> 00:33:52,893
He really didn't do it, right?

497
00:33:54,094 --> 00:33:56,133
That's what he told me.

498
00:33:57,307 --> 00:33:58,818
Good then.

499
00:33:58,818 --> 00:34:04,052
An arrogant kid like Ai Thoop probably loses confidence after this.

500
00:34:04,052 --> 00:34:07,109
Yeah. It's good for him to lower his ego a bit.

501
00:34:07,109 --> 00:34:10,276
I'm so tired of trying to get him to talk.

502
00:34:10,276 --> 00:34:12,596
Right, just like me who is so tired of you.

503
00:34:19,065 --> 00:34:20,485
What's up, Jae?

504
00:34:20,485 --> 00:34:21,929
Something huge just happened, Jack.

505
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:23,429
What?

506
00:34:27,014 --> 00:34:28,434
[Drug Case Involving the Heir to a Major Hotel Group]

507
00:34:28,434 --> 00:34:33,454
"The heir to a major hotel chain is involved in a drug case."

508
00:34:36,196 --> 00:34:39,100
That's a picture of the boss and you, Ai Laem.

509
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:42,469
[Heir to a national-level Hotel Group appears at the police station involving a drug case]

510
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:45,349
How did this happen?

511
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:48,034
The boss's mother visited just now.

512
00:34:48,034 --> 00:34:50,240
She's in his office.

513
00:34:52,276 --> 00:34:55,088
This is a misunderstanding. I can explain.

514
00:34:55,088 --> 00:34:57,087
But word has gotten out.

515
00:34:57,087 --> 00:35:00,036
And our reputation has already been sullied.

516
00:35:00,036 --> 00:35:02,996
Mom, the truth is the truth.

517
00:35:02,996 --> 00:35:04,961
If they get the wrong idea, we can just explain it to them.

518
00:35:04,961 --> 00:35:10,568
Gun, people in society are ready to step on us, not stand with us.

519
00:35:10,568 --> 00:35:13,236
What can I do?

520
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:15,834
Stop associating with him.

521
00:35:17,564 --> 00:35:21,632
- I can't do that.
- Your father asked me to negotiate with you about this.

522
00:35:21,632 --> 00:35:23,620
If you can't end it,

523
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:27,040
you know what can happen.

524
00:35:30,476 --> 00:35:33,429
I'm sorry for being rude and not knocking first,

525
00:35:33,429 --> 00:35:36,021
but I can't let anyone misunderstand him.

526
00:35:36,021 --> 00:35:38,559
Cher, please leave.

527
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:40,896
Boss really did nothing wrong.

528
00:35:42,259 --> 00:35:45,442
If there's anything he did wrong,

529
00:35:45,442 --> 00:35:48,640
it is one thing.

530
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,400
He was wrong to get to know someone like you.

531
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:55,262
Walk out of my son's life.

532
00:35:55,262 --> 00:35:58,420
It's the only way for someone

533
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:02,090
with nothing to compensate for all this.

534
00:36:11,216 --> 00:36:14,744
Yes, Ma'am. I'm sorry.

535
00:36:22,876 --> 00:36:26,638
She asked me to leave her son.

536
00:36:27,604 --> 00:36:30,299
It's the only way for someone who has nothing like me

537
00:36:30,299 --> 00:36:32,880
to compensate for what happened.

538
00:36:34,096 --> 00:36:35,915
Isn't that too harsh?

539
00:36:35,915 --> 00:36:38,660
Come to think of it, she has a point.

540
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:44,150
The boss and I aren't suitable for each other at all.

541
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:47,710
P'Laem, please don't falter because of that.

542
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,690
Well, think about it.

543
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,549
Our social statuses are drastically different.

544
00:36:52,549 --> 00:36:54,520
His one shoe

545
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:57,210
can probably pay for my dorm for half a year.

546
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:00,740
His bathroom is bigger than my bedroom.

547
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:03,379
I haven't mentioned his lifestyle yet.

548
00:37:03,379 --> 00:37:06,668
- We have nothing in common.
- I think you're overthinking.

549
00:37:06,668 --> 00:37:09,448
- You're blaming yourself.
- But am I wrong, though?

550
00:37:09,448 --> 00:37:11,397
Last time, he was in trouble helping me.

551
00:37:11,397 --> 00:37:14,120
This time, he is in trouble

552
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,710
because he helped me again.

553
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,300
Have you ever asked him

554
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:21,959
if he thinks helping you is troublesome

555
00:37:21,959 --> 00:37:26,270
or if he's just willing to do anything for you?

556
00:37:32,189 --> 00:37:34,050
I don't know.

557
00:37:34,974 --> 00:37:38,045
P'Laem, take it easy. Please don't think too much.

558
00:37:38,045 --> 00:37:41,264
You, Thoop, or the boss, no one is to blame here.

559
00:37:41,264 --> 00:37:44,448
No one should feel guilty about it.

560
00:37:44,448 --> 00:37:48,890
There is always a solution to every problem.

561
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:51,602
Hey, Ai Laem. You can do it.

562
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,482
You and the boss will get through this small issue eventually.

563
00:37:58,134 --> 00:38:01,065
[Boss]

564
00:38:01,065 --> 00:38:05,427
Just pick up his call. He's been calling a hundred times.

565
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:18,394
Where is he?

566
00:38:24,754 --> 00:38:27,334
Why don't you answer, Cher?

567
00:38:38,394 --> 00:38:40,093
I'm back.

568
00:38:40,093 --> 00:38:43,411
I bought you some delicious Som Tum (papaya salad) too.

569
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:06,571
I thought you did what my mom told you to.

570
00:39:09,876 --> 00:39:11,840
Which one?

571
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,127
She said lots of things.

572
00:39:14,127 --> 00:39:18,780
Cher, promise me no matter what happens,

573
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:22,326
we will fight it together.

574
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:25,028
That line was so old-fashioned.

575
00:39:25,028 --> 00:39:27,441
Like what a hero in a soap opera would say.

576
00:39:27,441 --> 00:39:31,547
Cher. Promise me.

577
00:39:32,834 --> 00:39:35,373
Yes, I promise.

578
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:41,234
Promise what?

579
00:39:41,234 --> 00:39:44,422
I promise no matter how tough it is,

580
00:39:44,422 --> 00:39:47,785
no matter how hard I have to try,

581
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:51,539
I will do anything to get back to you, Boss.

582
00:39:54,149 --> 00:39:56,347

She gave me only one heart, and I gave it all to you.

You're as cheesy as I am.

Can I?

Can't you tell from what we're doing?

Is it okay to walk beside me today?

Didn't you tell me yourself,

615
00:44:08,394 --> 00:44:10,908
that there's no CEO of a company and an intern?

616
00:44:10,908 --> 00:44:13,019
It's just you and me.

617
00:44:13,019 --> 00:44:14,280
Of course, Boss.

618
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:17,300
Or should I call you Babe?

619
00:44:22,634 --> 00:44:25,074
