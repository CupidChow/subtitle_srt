Is there anything you want to tell me?

- But if you're not ready—
- Let me hug you.

Sorry. I didn't know he had a guest.

8

Well, Nong Cher is jealous.

Come and see me.

00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:25,510
Holy shit, Boss!

19
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,910
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,555
Let me help.

21

Did that hurt?

I'm sorry about a moment ago.

So did you have a good night's sleep?

24
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:01,470
Boss, about last night, please forget about it.

25
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,983
I hadn't cried in front of anyone for so long. I'm embarrassed.

26
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,172
We should just change the topic.

27
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:14,031
- Like?
- Let's talk about eggs.

28
00:02:14,031 --> 00:02:15,450
Eggs?

29
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,680
I meant these fried eggs.

30
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,360
Do you think they are duck eggs or chicken eggs?

31
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,860
What?

32
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,660
Too lazy to go to work, right boss?

33
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:38,006
That's the new topic replacing the "duck eggs or chicken eggs"?

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,803
I guess so.

35
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,770
I have high respect for your employees.

00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,500
They repeat the same thing year after year.

37
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,759
Aren't they sick of it?

38
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:05,172
It's probably my company that gives them a happy work life.

39
00:03:05,172 --> 00:03:09,213
You're overconfident. The whole company wants to die. Don't you know that?

Please forget I said that.

42
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,936
Tell me everything my employees say.

- Well...
- Hey, I just wanted to know,

44
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,510
but it's not like I'll go on a rampage and fire them.

00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,440
You can rest assured.

46
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,330
Why do you want to know then?

47
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:41,840
In your eyes, you might think that I suck at the gaming industry.

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,930
And I seem to not care about Phenomenal Gaming
as much as I should.

What did you do to the boss?

I don't know. I came here myself.

70
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,230
I didn't come with him. I didn't see him last night.

71

We arrived at the same time because I met him downstairs.

00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,190
Maybe you should stop creating games and become an actor.

182
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,790
What?

183
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:18,130
You knew everything. Why didn't you say it?

184
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,659
You let me keep lying.

185
00:12:20,659 --> 00:12:23,560
Because you acted like you didn't want me to know.

186
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,830
I didn't want you to be worried.

187
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:30,513
I just happened to kiss someone on the foot.

188
00:12:33,525 --> 00:12:35,425
Fine!

189
00:12:35,425 --> 00:12:38,156
I had a bar fight last night.

190
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,590
Damn you.

191
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,180
Next time, you can tell us.

192
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:45,140
You were afraid to tell us, but you told the boss.

193
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,996
What were you thinking? Huh?

194
00:12:47,996 --> 00:12:50,544
Yes, I'm sorry.

195
00:12:50,544 --> 00:12:53,407
I really didn't want to concern you guys.

196
00:12:54,696 --> 00:13:00,836
But didn't you tell me that saying nothing is more concerning than saying something?

197
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,867
Whether you tell or not tell, you going missing makes me concerned anyway.

198
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,730
Don't scold me.

199
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:13,792
I'm truly repentant now.

200
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,760
What if I cry?

201
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,900
Will you be able to comfort me?

202
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,630
All right, but don't do it again.

203
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,780
Ai Zo, Ai Three, Hia Tub, and I

204
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:27,300
almost went looking for your unclaimed dead body.

205
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,556
Come on. Aren't you exaggerating?

206
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,900
Can you put ointment on for me?

207
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,301
It's this side!

208
00:13:36,301 --> 00:13:38,416
Ouch! Be gentle.

209
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,030
Put some ointment on for me.

210
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,630
I tried but couldn't do it myself.

211
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,460
I accidentally put Betadine in my mouth. My stomach must have turned yellow by now.

212
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,800
Where is the first-aid box?

213
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,215
- On my desk.
- And?

214
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,970
- Go grab it, please.
- Fine.

215
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:53,920
I'll go get hot water too and pour it over your bruise.

216
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,360
In case the bacteria from that guy's foot is still in your mouth.

217
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,680
Okay, Sir.

218
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,330
Make sure it's boiling hot, dude.

219
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:05,800
In case it's not effective enough.

220
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:44,080
- ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
- Thank you.

221
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,440
Hey, make a wish first.

222
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,388
What wish?

223
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,884
Just wish for anything. The candle is burning out already.

224
00:14:51,884 --> 00:14:54,780
I don't want to eat a cake topped with candle drippings.

225
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:59,005
Well then...Can I wish for a new dad?

226
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,400
I'll make a wish for you then.

227
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,350
I wish you good growth, love from lots of people,

228
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:11,970
a good family, and a good life.

229
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,170
Promise me you'll make that happen.

230
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,760
So is it a wish or a promise?

231
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,296
It's both.

232
00:15:19,296 --> 00:15:22,090
The cake is about to catch fire.

233
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,515
Okay. Whatever you say.

234
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:29,696
I chose the color you like. Pink, right?

235
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:31,420
Let's snap some photos.

236
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,100
Make sure we look good.

237
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,868
Smile. One, two...

238
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:41,177
Be my older sister again in the next life.

239
00:15:41,177 --> 00:15:43,604
And I'll be your super stubborn brother.

240
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,650
Wow. Very good timing.

241
00:16:11,234 --> 00:16:13,640
Did he install cameras in my room?

242
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,000
Hello, Boss.

243
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,350
I walked out of the bathroom just now.

244
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:30,140
Once my back hit the bed, my phone rang.

245
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,718
It must be destiny.

246
00:16:32,718 --> 00:16:34,980
What's destiny? Is it the thing that has "welcome" on it?
(T/N: "Destiny" and "rug" share a compound word)

247
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,090
That's a doormat to wipe your feet.

248
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,540
Hey. You know how to continue my jokes now.

249
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,320
You're used to being with me now.

250
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,513
More like I'm used to having you in my life.

251
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:55,950
Are you going to sleep yet? I'll put you to sleep.

252
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,335
I don't want to sleep yet.

253
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,277
What are you going to do then?

254
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:07,012
Can I keep on talking to you?

255
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:11,360
I'll be streaming games soon. I won't be able to put you to sleep.

256
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,800
Game streaming?

257
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,210
Yes.

258
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,930
I told my fans I'd do it.

259
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,750
You have fans?

260
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:23,600
I don't want to brag but a hundred people like me.

261
00:17:24,262 --> 00:17:26,860
- A hundred people like you?
- Yes.

262
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,400
But a million people hate me.

263
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,690
You may have to add additional people.

264
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,403
So that makes one million and one people?

265
00:17:32,403 --> 00:17:35,375
It's actually a hundred and one.

266
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,200
What's wrong with me?

267
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,100
Cher? Cher?

268
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,010
Sorry, Boss. I just dropped my phone.

269
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:59,515
So are you going to sleep? I'm going to stream games now.

270
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,135
I want to watch you do the game streaming.

271
00:18:04,135 --> 00:18:07,090
Come on. No.

272
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,990
You have to be a member first.

273
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:11,530
How much? I'll pay.

274
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,880
It's troublesome.

275
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,780
How about this?

276
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,300
Just put down your phone.

277
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,360
I'll watch you stream through this FaceTime.

278
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,250
But I'll be loud.

279
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,720
Don't get annoyed.

280
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,440
I won't be.

281
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,790
I like it.

282
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,980
I like your voice.

283
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:39,443
I'm so loud that your earwax will shake.

284
00:18:39,443 --> 00:18:41,548
Be prepared.

285
00:18:43,245 --> 00:18:45,444
I like your voice.

286
00:18:47,483 --> 00:18:48,720
What are you saying?

287
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,818
[On Air]

288
00:18:49,818 --> 00:18:52,370
Ai Laem is here!

289
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:55,900
Greetings to 79 people who are still awake.

290
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,432
If you're going to bed, leave this streaming on.

291
00:18:58,432 --> 00:19:01,852
If the viewers count is 0, I'll be really sad.

292
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,615
If you're sleepy, go to bed.

293
00:19:06,615 --> 00:19:09,168
Were you talking to me?

294
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:15,530
Leave a comment if you've ever lost a game.

295
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:20,216
Because I, Ai Laem, have never lost any.

296
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,060
Let's check out some comments here.

297
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,140
"I heard a man's..."

298
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,044
Shit!

299
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,730
What man? I'm here alone.

300
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,660
You're scaring me.

301
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,783
"You just stuck out your tongue at someone, P'Laem."

302
00:19:36,783 --> 00:19:39,246
"They must be lovers."

303
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:42,640
That's crazy! What lovers? It's nothing.

304
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,560
What are you laughing at?

305
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,660
- You're talking to someone again.
- Wondering who's behind the camera.

306
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,863
Please reveal who that is.

307
00:19:50,863 --> 00:19:54,692
Hey! Let's play the game now.

308
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,760
Bring it on.

309
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,460
You can't shoot me.

310
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,660
Come on in.

311
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,090
I'm the best!

312
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,723
You just got shot in the head.

313
00:20:04,723 --> 00:20:07,000
The three of you? I'll dodge to the left.

314
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,300
Come on. I'll dodge to the right.

315
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,540
A sniper?

316
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,030
You'll face me.

317
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:15,260
Hold on. Let me go B13.

318
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:19,176
Get shot by my shotgun and you're down.

319
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:22,024
We're on different levels, Bro.

320
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:26,088
This is boring. I won again.

321
00:20:26,088 --> 00:20:27,740
Let's just go to bed, guys.

322
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,190
Have a good night.

323
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:38,559
Sweet dreams.

324
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,840
See? P'Laem said sweet dreams twice.

325
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,600
Who did you say it to, P'Laem?

326
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,870
- That breaks my heart.
- The second time he didn't look at the camera.

327
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:49,984
Bye! Bye! Bye!

328
00:20:49,984 --> 00:20:52,603
I'm leaving for real! Let's go to bed.

329
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,610
Did you upgrade now?

330
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:09,550
You can sleep listening to the mouse clicking and keyboard typing.

331
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,847
I'm off to bed, Boss.

332
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,240
Sweet dreams.

333
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:40,360
Ai Laem.

334
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,633
What's up, my dear brother?

335
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:45,160
What's going on with the game? Did the boss tell you anything?

336
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,160
He said he just set up a schedule to meet with his friend.

337
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,286
But I think they haven't met yet.

338
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:55,410
The game has become popular on the market now. It'll be hard to get it back. What a shame.

339
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:59,180
Hey, calm down. Don't stress it.

340
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,228
But I think it's weird.

341
00:22:02,228 --> 00:22:04,540
The game might be Khun Thyme's idea,

342
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:08,504
but the details inside can't be this identical.

343
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,600
- Have you played it?
- Yes.

344
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,688
Although the one that Jack asked me to play was a tester,

345
00:22:15,688 --> 00:22:18,240
I'm 100 percent sure

346
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,060
that the details of both are exactly the same.

347
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:26,836
P'Jack and P'Laem, you should discuss this with the boss.

348
00:22:26,836 --> 00:22:29,083
I'm afraid the boss might be even more stressed.

349
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:36,080
What was the situation like when Khun Thyme quit the company?

350
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,000
They fought. It was such a huge fight the company almost collapsed.

351
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,568
Phenomenal Gaming was almost closed down.

352
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:46,780
I think this is one of the reasons the boss became cold and grumpy.

353
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,720
He used to be a lot friendlier.

354
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,608
What should we do?

355
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:55,904
If there's really a rat in our company,

356
00:22:55,904 --> 00:22:58,964
it will be even harder for the boss to trust someone again.

357
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:03,810
But if there's really a rat, you must tell him.

358
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:07,388
You have to be completely certain first before you say anything.

359
00:23:07,388 --> 00:23:09,190
What should we do?

360
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:11,430
Quietly dig into it...

361
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:14,000
until you're sure then say it at once.

362
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,636
This is to protect your boss's feelings too.

363
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,460
Gosh.

364
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,720
What should I do?

365
00:23:24,704 --> 00:23:28,060
I'm already dumb. I can't think of a solution!

366
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,260
My head hurts!

367
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,612
And what about this?

368
00:23:38,612 --> 00:23:40,939
You can sleep on your own now, huh?

369
00:23:40,939 --> 00:23:43,201
I don't think I need to call you then.

370
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,060
I'm driving to Pranburi to check out the resort there.

371
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,563
There's been a little problem. You can go to bed.

372
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,875
I should get there around 2 a.m.

373
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:04,409
See you on Monday at the office.

374
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:08,780
Okay. Let me know when you arrive there.

375
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,360
If I'm still awake, I'll reply.

376
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,930
But if I'm already sleeping, I'll reply tomorrow.

377
00:24:13,508 --> 00:24:15,532
Please drive safely.

378
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,630
- Khun Porsche, hello.
- Morning, guys.

379
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:31,420
These are some gifts from Pranburi.

380
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,530
Did you just take a trip to Pranburi?

381
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:36,430
Yes. I accompanied this kid here.

382
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:40,110
It was not safe to drive alone at night. I was worried.

383
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,260
I'll be in my office.

384
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,020
- Go ahead. I'll be right after you.
- Sure.

385
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,550
Okay.

386
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,163
I missed you guys. It's been such a long time.

387
00:24:48,163 --> 00:24:49,540
Jack, have you been doing well?

388
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,570
I have.

389
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:55,057
How about we have lunch together today? Let's have Ai Gun treat us.

390
00:24:55,057 --> 00:24:57,240
We don't want to be a burden.

391
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,596
Whenever I eat with him, I feel like I'm eating with a statue.

392
00:25:01,596 --> 00:25:02,960
I can picture that.

393
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,560
Cher.

394
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,520
Yes?

395
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,159
Please join us.

396
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:19,468
Enjoy the meal. The boss is paying.

397
00:25:19,468 --> 00:25:22,220
- Thank you, Boss.
- Please help yourself.

398
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,840
- Do you want some chicken?
- Thanks.

399
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,640
Take a full bite.

400
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,520
Cher, is the food not good?

401
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,892
I noticed you're just poking at it.

402
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,350
It's good.

403
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:41,460
Very good.

404
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:44,390
- You can order whatever.
- I need to pee.

405
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,500
Please excuse me.

406
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,130
Of course, Sir.

407
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,680
Cher.

408
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,902
What's up with you?

409
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,748
I'm an intern.

410
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,940
Was that supposed to be sarcastic?

411
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:23,600
What kind of answer do you want then, Khun Boss?

412
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,180
Cher, I'm serious.

413
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,950
What's the matter?

414
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:49,090
I updated Jack and P'Aoi about Thyme.

415
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:52,910
As I said, Ai Gun was waiting all day. But Thyme didn't show up.

416
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:55,853
I guess we need to go to his company and meet him in person.

417
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:01,152
Honestly, I don't want it to escalate.

418
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:04,596
But if he's like this, it's not okay, Boss.

419
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,596
Ai Laem, what's wrong with you?

420
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,450
I couldn't poop.

421
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:13,808
"Poop" all over your face.

422
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,124
Thank you so much, Boss.

423
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,870
- Jack, come on out.
- Jae, can you release the seat for me?

424
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:28,790
Do it yourself. The button is around here.

425
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,173
Please do it for me!

426
00:27:30,173 --> 00:27:32,547
I don't know how to, dammit!

427
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,920
Such an expensive, who would know how to release the seat?

428
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,610
Hurry!

429
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:37,980
Jae!

430
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,470
- Gosh you.
- What?

431
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:44,140
It'll be great if Khun Porsche comes every day so that we'll get a free lunch.

432
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,640
That's true.

433
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:53,310
The more you pull, the alarm will go off.

434
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:56,940
Do you think I'm a middle schooler?

435
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,330
Go ahead. And we will be the center of attention.

436
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:04,920
People will know that an intern and the CEO

437
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,870
are alone together in the car.

438
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,290
Go on.

439
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,648
What do you want, Boss?

440
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:23,250
What's the matter with you?

441
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:29,456
What kind of answer do you want, Khun CEO?

442
00:28:29,456 --> 00:28:32,018
I already answered you.

443
00:28:32,018 --> 00:28:33,550
Cher.

444
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:41,160
You want to know what's wrong with me?

445
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,230
Dangit, I have no idea either.

446
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:48,184
I suddenly became freaking frustrated.

447
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,180
Have you ever thought you were important

448
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:55,160
but you were wrong?

449
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:59,180
I thought I was number one, but that's just not true.

450
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,540
Not even number two and three.

451
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,830
I'm like number 100.

452
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,808
Will you stop whining and explain it to me nicely?

453
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,550
Will you open the door for me?

454
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:16,168
Do it before I destroy your car.

455
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:21,593
Are you jealous?

456
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,000
Jealous, yeah, right!

457
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,998
That's for lovers. Not an intern

458
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:32,204
Are you upset with me?

459
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:33,710
No.

460
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:37,970
Do you think I regard Porsche as more important than you?

461
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,650
Isn't it so?

462
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:43,790
You didn't tell me you went to see Thyme.

463
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:46,100
Because I didn't see him.

464
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:51,100
My words weren't the reason you reconsidered this issue, right?

465
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,960
Next time, don't say it if it's not true.

466
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,580
Porsche was being straightforward with you.

467
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:59,804
But I really reconsidered it because of your words.

468
00:29:59,804 --> 00:30:01,980
I'm not stupid enough to believe you.

469
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,246
Let me off the car.

470
00:30:30,479 --> 00:30:32,913
How do you feel to get kissed by me?

471
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,892
What are you doing, Boss?

472
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,420
Do you feel bad?

473
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:52,110
If I said no, would you think I feel good about it?

474
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:55,120
You don't have to answer me now.

475
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,520
You can think it through when you go home.

476
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,440
When you're confident, let me know.

477
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,480
I want answers to two things.

478
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,090
One,

479
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,340
how did you feel when I kissed you?

480
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:15,108
Two, are you whining now because you're jealous?

481
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,836
See you, Cher.

482
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,510
Juke! Juke!

483
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,450
Help me, Ai Laem!

484
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:46,223
AI Laem, help me. Ai Laem!

485
00:31:47,504 --> 00:31:50,660
Damn you, Ai Laem! What the hell are you doing?

486
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,560
Sorry. I didn't mean to.

487
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,930
Are you okay, P'Laem?

488
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:56,910
What has been going on with you lately? Say it!

489
00:31:56,910 --> 00:32:00,010
Something's on my mind. I'm sorry.

490
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:01,370
Sorry, my ass.

491
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:04,000
You said you were tired, so I reduced our practice time.

492
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,917
What more do you want?

493
00:32:05,917 --> 00:32:08,680
- Should we disband our team? Do you want that?
- Easy there.

494
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,948
P'Three, please don't fight.

495
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,971
I'll check on him. He's been kind of stressed lately.

496
00:32:19,786 --> 00:32:21,386
I'm sorry.

497
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:25,591
I'm going home then.

498
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:30,536
Hey, is it about the boss?

499
00:32:30,536 --> 00:32:32,080
What?

500
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:37,479
Does he like you or do you like him?

501
00:32:37,479 --> 00:32:40,100
Don't speak nonsense, Ai P'Jack.

502
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,480
Right. I'm speaking nonsense.

503
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,330
It's impossible anyway.

504
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:48,089
The CEO and an intern.

505
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,540
Right.

506
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,411
It's really impossible.

507
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,590
I'm off now.

508
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,884
See you.

509
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,310
Hey, where is everyone? Why are you the only one left?

510
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:16,168
They're off to do their own shit, I guess.

511
00:33:18,557 --> 00:33:19,723
What the heck?

512
00:33:19,723 --> 00:33:22,360
Why do you seem irritated?

513
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,520
I'm leaving.

514
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,020
Huh?

515
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,350
What the hell?

516
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:38,920
P'Three, are you feeling better?

517
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,600
Can we talk later?

518
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,496
Please?

519
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:48,370
I understand you, P'Three.

520
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:54,312
But as I said, everyone has their priorities to deal with.

521
00:33:55,070 --> 00:34:00,476
Thank you for trying to talk some sense into me.

522
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,890
I'll try.

523
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:04,590
Sure.

524
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,420
Zo, why is your body feeling hot?

525
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,240
Zo? Zo!

526
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,000
Zo! Zo! Zo!

527
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,520
Zo!

528
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,520
Am I stupid...

529
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,890
for giving you time to think it through?

530
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:29,484
What if your answer has nothing to do with me?

531
00:34:30,465 --> 00:34:32,749
What will I do?

532
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,552
See you tomorrow at 10 at the same place.
[Time]

533
00:34:53,075 --> 00:34:56,571
I'll be late tomorrow. I'm meeting with Thyme.
[Gungawin]

534
00:34:59,207 --> 00:35:01,507
Do you want me to go with you?
[Laem, Phon's Son]

535
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,360
It's okay. I'll see you at the office.
[Gungawin]

536
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,940
Up to you.

537
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,576
You don't even share the snacks.

538
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,520
Was that the boss? Did I see it right?

539
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,672
Is he the wind? He breezed through so fast.

540
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,112
What are they doing?

541
00:35:46,112 --> 00:35:47,663
How would I know? I'm sitting here with you.

542
00:35:47,663 --> 00:35:49,370
I want to know.

543
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:57,160
Boss.

544
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,020
Please leave.

545
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,200
I don't want to see anyone right now.

546
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,400
Sure.

547
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,676
Where have you been?

548
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,580
- The bathroom.
- Oh, really?

549
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,080
Yes.

550
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,514
- Khun Aoi.
- Yes?

551
00:36:32,514 --> 00:36:34,380
Ai Gun is back, right?

552
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,360
Yes.

553
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,424
He just walked into his room.

554
00:36:37,424 --> 00:36:39,431
I'll go check on him.

555
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,480
That person goes. This person comes.

556
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,290
Then one comes, and another one goes again.

557
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,760
Should I go too?

558
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,129
- Yes.
- To where?

559
00:36:52,129 --> 00:36:54,908
To a hospital to check your brain.

560
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,220
Guys, I'm going home now.

561
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,967
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye, Jae.

562
00:37:05,967 --> 00:37:07,567
Yes. Bye, Jae.

563
00:37:12,276 --> 00:37:14,540
How are you getting home? Want a ride?

564
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,810
I'm doing some shopping first.

565
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:18,510
You can go.

566
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,900
I did warn you.

567
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,160
What?

568
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,830
You like Somtum with salted crab and fermented fish.
(T/N: Somtum is Papaya salad)

569
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:32,740
Despite how delicious different kinds of Somtum are,

570
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:36,824
you'll end up eating Somtum with salted crab and fermented fish anyway.
(T/N: He means they aren't a good match)

571
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,260
I'm off.

572
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:42,450
I'm saying this because I'm worried.

573
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:46,964
The further you go, the more exhausting it will be to walk back.

574
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,410
See you tomorrow.

575
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,702
Get home safe.

576
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:25,120
Here comes Laem's wonton noodle soup.

577
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,450
Did you make all these yourself?

578
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:40,510
It's nice to eat something like this once in a while.

579
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,634
I can't even find the way back, Ai P'Jack.

580
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,748
Let alone the way out.

581
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,550
Cher.

582
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,310
There.

583
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:09,862
He isn't only haunting my mind. He's haunting my ears too.

584
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,056
Cher? Cher?

585
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:17,024
Damn it!

Song: My Luck by Book Kasidet

587
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,860
♫ As warm as the morning sunlight ♫

588
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:31,230
♫ You're a cool breeze when I'm feeling anxiously hot ♫

589
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:34,600
♫ Let's cuddle to cool down the heat ♫

590
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:41,450
♫ Sometimes the sky is overcast
but now I have you to lead the path ♫

591
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:44,910
♫ You're more precious than anything, I can't lose you ♫

592
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:49,490
♫ Because you're the only one that's meaningful ♫

593
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:55,850
What is it that you're doing right now, then?

594
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:57,660
Are you pursuing me?

595
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:01,248
If I told you I liked you, would you be uncomfortable?

596
00:40:01,248 --> 00:40:03,040
I like myself when I'm with you.

597
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,160
I like smiling because of you.

598
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,785
Doing crazy things you told me to.

599
00:40:06,785 --> 00:40:08,783
If it's you biting me, I'll let you.

600
00:40:08,783 --> 00:40:12,400
- Wearing this outfit makes me look posher.
- It's cute.

601
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,560
You'll say I'm cute even if I wear only boxers.

602
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,020
You troublemaker! Such a troublemaker, are you?

603
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,343
It's ticklish!

604
00:40:19,343 --> 00:40:23,663
I'm glad to have you come into my life.

605
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:26,260
[Song: Selfless by Louis Thanawin]

606
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:31,140
♫ I'm just someone ordinary ♫

607
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:37,370
♫ I don't have enough significance or importance ♫

608
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:40,150
♫ To make you, ♫

609
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:43,930
♫ Who is a star in the sky, lean toward me ♫

610
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:50,040
♫ I'm not worthy enough for you to love me  ♫

611
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,710
♫ Let the ordinary me gaze up at you ♫

612
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:56,750
♫ I'm just someone ordinary ♫

613
00:40:56,750 --> 00:41:01,100
♫ I don't have enough significance or importance ♫

614
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:05,610
♫ To make you, ♫

615
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:09,550
♫ Who is a star in the sky, lean toward me ♫

616
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:15,670
♫ I'm not worthy enough for you to love me ♫

617
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:22,440
♫ Please go back, let the ordinary me gaze up at you ♫
