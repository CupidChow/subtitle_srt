It will be easier for the next intern when my internship is over.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,203
Is your internship about to end?

3
00:00:06,203 --> 00:00:09,020
Come on. Not even close. I'm only halfway there.

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,083
I'll be here to get on your nerves for a long time.

5
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:13,210
You're used to being with me now.

6
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,243
I like it.

7
00:00:15,243 --> 00:00:17,925
I like your voice.

8
00:00:17,925 --> 00:00:19,120
What are you saying?

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,120
A sniper? You'll face me.

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,770
Did you upgrade now?

11
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,620
You can sleep listening to the mouse clicking and keyboard typing.

12
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,158
Will you open the door for me? Do it before I destroy your car.

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,010
How do you feel to get kissed by me?

14
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,080
You don't have to answer me now.

15
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,640
You can think it through when you go home.

16
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,100
When you're confident, let me know.

Please leave.

26
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,320
I don't want to see anyone right now.

27
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,904
The further you go, the more exhausting it will be to walk back.

28
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,943
I can't even find the way back, Ai P'Jack.

29

Let alone the way out.

Yes!

58
00:04:31,464 --> 00:04:37,218
To be frank, I'm so dense about this stuff. I can't tell.

59
00:04:37,218 --> 00:04:39,240
I'm not pursuing you.

If that's all, why was I the one who was asked to leave your office, not him?

67
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,280
Because Porsche has seen lots of bad things about me.

You know what?

I'm freaking trying to approach you.

72
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,740
But once I get closer, you back off.

73
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,258
We're moving forward and backward as if we were dancing.

Oh, please. I take one step forward, you take two steps back.

00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,750
We're probably a kilometer apart now.

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,592
Okay. I like you.

Are you a chicken?

83
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,330
So?

84
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:33,562
The kilometer distance you mentioned is now gone.

85
00:06:33,562 --> 00:06:37,080
From now on, I won't let you be far away from me,

86
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,373
even for a meter.

87
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,150
Can I ask you something?

00:06:43,682 --> 00:06:45,380
What is it?

00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,437
This thing between us,

90
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,202
can we not tell anyone yet?

91
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:55,680
I'm afraid Ai P'Jack would make it a big deal.

92
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,980
Then you'll have to pay me to keep my mouth shut.

93
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,510
With what?

94
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,612
Like...

95
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:13,265
That served you well!

96
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,451
I'm going to eat my noodles now!

97
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,870
Are you sick, Son?

98
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:31,427
I'm not. Someone must be gossiping about me.

99
00:07:31,427 --> 00:07:33,560
Once you're done with that, go to bed.

100
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,710
You need to get up early for work tomorrow, don't you?

101
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,559
No. I'm staying to help you.

102
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:40,868
So stubborn.

103
00:07:40,868 --> 00:07:42,360
Mom.

104
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,936
Once I get a pay raise, you can take a break.

105
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:49,370
I don't want that.

106
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:52,160
It would be boring to stay home and do nothing.

107
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,115
Working like this is fine. That way I'll be active.

108
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,550

00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,580
Here, eat this,

111
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,790
so you can recover quickly.

112
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,690
Got it?

113
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,932
Chew slowly.

114
00:08:25,932 --> 00:08:27,020
Is it good?

115
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,020
I'm full.

116
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,000
One more spoonful, okay?

117
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,235
You've been studying hard

118
00:08:37,235 --> 00:08:40,970
and practicing with me so much that you don't have time to rest, right?

119
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,190
It's true, right?

120
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,308
It's not that.

121
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,415
Don't blame yourself, P'Three.

122
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,800
No, no, no, Zo.

123
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,760
I'm not blaming myself, but I do understand now.

124
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,985
You said that everyone has their priorities to deal with.

125
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:15,070
I'm sorry.

126
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,344
I love you, P'Three.

127
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,444
Aw, come here!

128
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,670
Boss!

129
00:09:41,837 --> 00:09:45,583
I told him to hide it. Here I am revealing it. Damn you, Ai Laem.

130
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:48,080
What are you mumbling about?

131
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,610
Don't be nosey!

132
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:52,350
I'm going to work. I don't want to be late.

Is Cher there? Tell him to see me immediately.

135

Yes, Boss.

136
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,120
Nong Cher, the boss wants to see you in his office.

137
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,552
He sounded furious.

138
00:10:05,552 --> 00:10:09,064
Ai Laem, what the hell did you do to him now?

139
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:15,950
You're so screwed, Ai Laem!

Am I going to get scolded again?

141
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,880
Ai P'Jack, can you draft a will for me to sign?

142
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,280
I'm afraid I won't get back alive.

143
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,571
Stop exaggerating!

144
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,190
I better go.

145
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,920
Come in.

146
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,784
You asked for me.

147
00:10:46,784 --> 00:10:48,784
What is it, Sir?

148
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,751
I just missed you.

149
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:13,230
If your internship is done, will I still get to see you every day?

150
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,990
I guess not.

151
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,590
You have to work,

152
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:20,210
and I have one last semester to complete.

153
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,620
I want to see you every day.

154
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,500
I like myself when I'm with you.

155
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,280
Doing the crazy things that you tell me to do.

156
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,570
Come on, Boss.

157
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,320
Everyone can do crazy things.

158
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,940
I even bowed to a dog once because someone told me to.

159
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:40,284
That's not the same.

160
00:11:42,016 --> 00:11:43,890
Get yourself a real pillow.

161
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:46,580
I can't disappear for long. People will get suspicious.

162
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:50,420
Please. I was being so dramatic to Khun Aoi.

163
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:54,380
People must be thinking you're being yelled at, big time.

164
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,868
Let me nap for a bit.

165
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:03,151
The boss in this company is so whiny.

166
00:12:03,151 --> 00:12:05,260
Can you stop being so clingy?

167
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,560
It's annoying.

168
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,320
Let me tell you something.

169
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,916
You'll never be annoyed by me.

170
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,710
Stop being cocky.

171
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,320
Don't tease me.

172
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,541
Are you really sleeping?

173
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:28,020
I can't because of you.

174
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,280
All right. Get some rest.

175
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:41,604
- So why did the boss—
- H-huh, w-what is it, Sir?!

176
00:12:41,604 --> 00:12:46,524
I was just asking Ai Laem why the boss wanted to see him.

177
00:12:51,776 --> 00:12:54,192
He called me to scold me as usual.

178
00:12:54,192 --> 00:12:57,420
I got on his nerves somehow. It's nothing.

179
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,750
That's our boss.

180
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,590
He yells at people a lot.

181
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:04,010
He yells at me all the time, but I don't take it to heart.

182
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,048
Like I'm scared.

183
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:11,550
When you were talking to him, did he mention anything about Khun Thyme?

184
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,200
What's going on with the game?

185
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,779
Right. Did he tell you anything?

186
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:17,510
Oh...

187
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,420
I forgot to ask.

188
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,540
I feel like it's a shame.

189
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,150
I've been working here for three years.

190
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,330
That game was our first achievement.

191
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:27,870
True.

192
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:30,960
It will be such a pity if we don't get it back.

193
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,300
Exactly, Jae. It's really pitiful.

194
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,000
I already planned to spend my bonus money.

195
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,675
I thought I'd pay my debt with that. And my mom can stop working.

196
00:13:42,675 --> 00:13:45,090
But your mom wants to work, doesn't she?

197
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,260
She's just saying that.

198
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,520
Let me know if you need anything, Ai P'Jack.

199
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,090
I might be able to help.

200
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,080
Let me know if you need anything, Ai P'Jack.

201
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,560
I might be able to help.

202
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,460
Jae, Ai Laem already said that.

203
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,190
I know, Sir.

204
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,170
I just want you to feel better, Sir.

205
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,590
- I'm even more stressed now.
- Yes?

206
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,820
Don't be. You're making me stressed, too.

207
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,350
I'm losing my appetite now.

208
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,290
I'm stressed along with Ai Jack.

209
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,939
Gosh, Jae. Thank you.

210
00:14:13,939 --> 00:14:15,660
I'm still okay.

211
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:20,460
I will find the right moment to ask the boss and see how it goes.

212
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,830
[Laem, Phon's Son] Have you eaten?

213
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,007
[Gungawin] Not yet. I'm having a meeting at the hotel.

214
00:14:29,007 --> 00:14:30,860
[Laem, Phon's Son] Will you come back to the office?

215
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:34,156
[Gungawin] No. I'll see you at your place later.

216
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:50,620
Watch where you're going! Don't just look at the phone.

217
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,140
- You're big and obstructing the way.
- So it's my fault?

218
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,850
- Why did you stop then?
- Are you blaming me?

219
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,022
Fine. I'll walk away first.

220
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,420
He said he just left the hotel. Is he here already?

221
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,224
Boss, I thought you said...

222
00:15:10,224 --> 00:15:12,860
Don't act like you just saw a ghost.

223
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,600
Ai Thoop.

224
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:22,724
So what's up?

225
00:15:22,724 --> 00:15:24,060
What brought you here?

226
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,220
- Can I borrow 8,000?
- What?

227
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,700
I crashed my friend's car. He wants the money now.

228
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,243
Since when do you know how to drive?

229
00:15:30,243 --> 00:15:32,936
If I did, I wouldn't crash, would I?

230
00:15:32,936 --> 00:15:34,667
And why did you even drive if you don't know how to?

231
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,280
If I didn't try, I wouldn't be able to drive at all. Stop asking questions.

232
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,130
- I'll pay you back on Wednesday.
- Pay me back?

233
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:42,170
- Where would you possibly get 8,000 from?
- Will you lend it to me or not?

234
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:45,083
If not, I'll ask someone else. What a waste of time.

235
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,200
Are you happy now?

236
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,196
Thanks.
[Savings Account: X-1043 Amount Available: 8,000 Baht]

237
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,920
You don't need to rush it to pay me back.

238
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,540
I'll transfer you some again at the end of the month as always.

239
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:10,613
Tian's death anniversary is next month. Are you coming?

240
00:16:10,613 --> 00:16:12,773
I'd be an asshole if I didn't come.

241
00:16:18,364 --> 00:16:21,715
Is he borrowing my money, or am I borrowing his?

242
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,740
Hello, Boss?

243
00:16:44,144 --> 00:16:46,240
You can't pass, Sir.

244
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,043
It's okay. He's with me.

245
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,860
That's all right. You can leave now.

246
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,000
Yes, Sir.

247
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,770
You said it was a little injury.

248
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:00,231
See. It's really a little.

249
00:17:00,231 --> 00:17:02,830
What did you do to end up getting hurt?

250
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,820
There was an accident at the construction site.

251
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,030
It's fine.

252
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:10,044
Khun Gungawin, please get your medicine at counter number two.

253
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,900
There are two types here, antibiotics and painkillers, and remedy cream.

254
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,500
Thank you.

255
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,304
How did you get here, by the way?

256
00:17:33,304 --> 00:17:35,604
A taxi.

257
00:17:35,604 --> 00:17:39,520
I told you that taking a taxi alone at night is dangerous.

258
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,228
Besides, it's not even a big injury.

259
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,912
You're talking as if I'm so small.

260
00:17:44,912 --> 00:17:46,720
Didn't you see your bodyguards blocking me?

261
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,300
They might have thought I was here to kill you.

262
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,441
Are you upset?

263
00:17:52,441 --> 00:17:54,040
About?

264
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,200
About them keeping you away.

265
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,440
Do you think I'd care about that?

266
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,110
Are you afraid I'd be thinking I don't deserve a guy who owns the country's top hotel?

267
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,796
Have you watched too many dramas?

268
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,130
What are you smiling at?

269
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,120
Well, well.

270
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,112
You're thinking about how cute I am, aren't you?

271
00:18:17,112 --> 00:18:18,810
I'm so damn cool, right?

272
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:21,308
Of course, I am.

273
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,716
Yes, you're so freaking cute.

274
00:18:30,592 --> 00:18:33,024
What's wrong now? Where did the cool guy go?

275
00:18:33,024 --> 00:18:35,457
I'm just complimenting you.

276
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,240
I'm leaving.

277
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,303
Are you coming?

278
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,520
Where are you going? My car is parked over there.

279
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,480
I was going to the bathroom.

280
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,280
Come on.

281
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,380
Car key?

282
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,543
Do you know how to drive?

283
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,591
Yes. I've done it in GTA.
(T/N: GTA, "Grand Theft Auto" is a game)

284
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,370
Just kidding, Boss. I do know how to drive.

285
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,920
- Your hand is injured—
- Ouch!

286
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,060
Sorry, sorry.

287
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,356
Give me the key.

288
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,370
Are you sure you can?

289
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:08,413
Just trust me.

290
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:11,233
I almost got bitten by a dog last time.

291
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:14,320
That are two different scenarios. Don't link them together.

292
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,190
Driving has nothing to do with that.

293
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:19,420
But you almost got bitten because you're just unlucky.

294
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,828
Are you coming or not? There's no dog to bite you anymore.

295
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:24,363
It's just me who will bite you.

296
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:32,232
If it's you biting me, I'll let you.

297
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,490
Come on.

298
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,550
I don't get to crash at your place tonight.

299
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:56,696
Why do you like my tiny room so much?

300
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:00,316
I don't like your tiny room.

301
00:20:00,316 --> 00:20:03,180
I like its owner.

302
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:07,563
Stop that. Go take a shower.

303
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,971
How can I?

304
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,910
Don't try to seduce me.

305
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:21,900
Go take a shower. I know what you're thinking.

306
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,872
I can't unbutton my shirts to start with.

307
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,600
Done.

308
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,700
Go take a shower.

309
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,810
Yes, Sir.

310
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,564
Cher, I can't open the shower gel bottle.

311
00:21:18,564 --> 00:21:21,384
Yes, I'm coming.

312
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,872
Cher, the shampoo bottle too.

313
00:21:31,872 --> 00:21:33,820
Yes, Sir.

314
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,140
Does he really need to wash his hair?

315
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,409
Cher, there's shampoo in my eyes.

316
00:21:41,409 --> 00:21:44,036
Yes, I'm coming.

317
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,090
I bet he'll call again for sure.

318
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:50,220
Cher?

319
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,370
Yes!

320
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,749
Why couldn't I be this accurate about the lottery?

321
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:09,040
You seem so happy bathing in the water in which my foot has soaked.

322
00:22:09,816 --> 00:22:13,280
Cher, you just love to ruin good moments.

323
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,450
Well, isn't it true, though?

324
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:19,300
My feet are in the water you're bathing. See?

325
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:27,680
I actually don't mind it.

326
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,809
You can even get your whole body in the bathtub with me.

327
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:32,792
No. I'm not falling for your trick.

328
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:39,260
Right. I wasn't able to scrub my back.

329
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:42,236
Can you do it for me?

330
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:56,528
You have no pimples. Your back is so smooth.

331
00:22:56,528 --> 00:22:59,655
Are you saying...

332
00:22:59,655 --> 00:23:01,790
even my back is handsome?

333
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:04,484
I do know that.

334
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:09,100
Boss, if it wasn't for the fact that you're injured,

335
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,857
I would dunk your head and drown you right now.

336
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,947
What a showoff.

337
00:23:13,947 --> 00:23:16,150
Here, let me give you a massage.

338
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,190
Feeling nice?

339
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:20,348
Very nice.

340
00:23:20,348 --> 00:23:22,000
My foot?

341
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,326
I mean my back.

342
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:33,150
Boss. I forgot to ask.

343
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:36,480
How did it go with the discussion about the game?

344
00:23:37,046 --> 00:23:38,840
It was as if I went there to get yelled at.

345
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,304
Ai Thyme will never talk nicely to me.

346
00:23:42,304 --> 00:23:43,890
What?

347
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:46,068
Why not?

348
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:54,430
Like I told you, he thinks he owns the idea.

349
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,760
This game is my idea.

350
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,470
And I didn't take any money from you when I left your company

351
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,280
I just took my brains back.

352
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,920
If this only affected me, I wouldn't even bother talking to you.

353
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,040
But it also affects my team.

354
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,040
Your team?

355
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,100
Do you regard other people as your team now?

356
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,300
You just see them as machines to make money for you.

357
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,660
That included me.

358
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,880
That was never my intention.

359
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,743
Not your intention, but it was your action, Ai Gun.

360
00:24:19,743 --> 00:24:22,476
Are you here to tell me you've changed?

361
00:24:22,476 --> 00:24:25,920
You must die and be reborn.

362
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,670
That's the only way to change your nature.

363
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:31,070
You know what?

364
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:36,396
When you left, people were saying you were jealous of me

365
00:24:36,396 --> 00:24:38,437
because I was richer.

366
00:24:38,437 --> 00:24:42,830
I was defending you, saying you would never think of me that way.

367
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:45,310
You left because I was stupid,

368
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:47,240
But now I know.

369
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,992
I was truly stupid for not listening to other people's words.

370
00:24:50,992 --> 00:24:52,593
I'm not jealous, Ai Gun!

371
00:24:52,593 --> 00:24:53,700
You are.

372
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,020
I have everything, while you have nothing.

373
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:01,464
You've tried so hard, but you've gained so little compared to me.

374
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,560
About the game you stole, I will let you slide.

375
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:16,755
That might help to make your life half as good as mine.

376
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,470
Ai Gun!

377
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:23,728
People approach you only for your money!

378
00:25:23,728 --> 00:25:26,810
No one truly cares for you!

379
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:31,960
I don't think we can do anything. We might just need to let it go.

380
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,528
I feel sorry for P'Jack.

381
00:25:39,528 --> 00:25:41,270
Why?

382
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:44,601
Here is the thing, Boss.

383
00:25:51,344 --> 00:25:54,007
[PHQ-9 Depression Test]

384
00:25:54,007 --> 00:25:58,794
I never knew Jack had a major depressive disorder.

385
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,550
It was a long time ago.

386
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:05,247
He's been taking medication and getting a lot better.

387
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:09,880
I've hurt him so much.

388
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,991
I feel bad.

389
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:15,140
It's okay, Boss.

390
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:20,054
P'Jack had lots of expectations for this game.

391
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,360
He thinks if the game sells well,

392
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,440
he'll pay his household debt with the bonus money.

393
00:26:26,441 --> 00:26:30,730
But now I just don't want to imagine

394
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:33,590
how he will feel if he knows.

395
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,752
I can give him financial support, actually.

396
00:26:38,752 --> 00:26:42,160
Come on. He'd never allow you to.

397
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,927
Why are you making that face?

398
00:26:53,927 --> 00:26:55,864
What's going on?

399
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,760
I don't want to talk about it yet.

400
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:07,280
Hia Tub said I must be certain before I say anything.

401
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,835
But I think you should know this, Boss.

402
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:19,124
Do you remember when I said P'Jack let us try the test version of the game?

403
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:24,680
After your competitor launched the game, P'Three downloaded and played it.

404
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:29,150
We all agree that the details inside are exactly

405
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:33,760
the same as the game P'Jack's team developed.

406
00:27:33,764 --> 00:27:36,050
Are you saying

407
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,460
our company has a mole?

408
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:44,101
Hia Tub said I should recheck until I'm sure before telling you this.

409
00:27:44,101 --> 00:27:46,430
He's afraid you'd be anxious

410
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:50,500
and have a bigger trust issue.

411
00:27:50,509 --> 00:27:53,768
But I still think you should know.

412
00:27:53,768 --> 00:27:57,044
Yes, I'm anxious now.

413
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,320
Don't worry. Ai P'Jack is trying to find the leak.

414
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,140
I'll let you know if he has any updates.

415
00:28:10,614 --> 00:28:12,576
Thank you so much.

416
00:28:12,576 --> 00:28:14,340
It's late.

417
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,947
You should go take a shower.

418
00:28:16,947 --> 00:28:19,210
Don't overthink it.

419
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:22,600
I'm on your side no matter what. You know?

420
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,180
I'm going to take a shower.

421
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:28,242
Don't miss me. It will take just a little while.

422
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:42,024
Wearing this outfit makes me look fancier.

423
00:28:42,024 --> 00:28:43,610
It's cute.

424
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:48,712
You'll say I'm cute even if I wear only boxers. Right?

425
00:28:48,712 --> 00:28:51,522
Yes, you're right.

426
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:58,101
Come to bed. Stop talking.

427
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:10,850
I might toss and turn so much that I hurt your hand.

428
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:13,610
If I do, just scream really loud.

429
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:17,000
Or you can kick me off the bed. Okay?

430
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,400
You're afraid you would toss and turn?

431
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,980
If so, you must be locked up.

432
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:30,664
Boss! Boss, I can't breathe.

433
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,750
Sleep. Let's sleep.

434
00:29:38,816 --> 00:29:41,661
Does your hand still hurt?

435
00:29:41,661 --> 00:29:43,752
A little.

436
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:23,576
I'm glad to have you in my life.

437
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,890
Don't act like the main character in a novel who confesses while the other one is asleep.

438
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:31,200
It's cliché, Boss.

439
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,800
- Are you pretending to sleep?
- I haven't even fallen asleep yet.

440
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,220
I thought you were sleeping.

441
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:39,840
If I was, would I hear your cheesy line?

442
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,440
You troublemaker!

443
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,480
Such a troublemaker, are you?

444
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,566
It's ticklish!

445
00:31:02,356 --> 00:31:04,852
Can I kiss you?

446
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,120
How should I respond?

447
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,630
Yes, you may.

448
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:13,400
Go ahead.

449
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,300
You can—

450
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,900
Damn it.

451
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,460
We've won a hundred games before. Today we just lost one.

452
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,600
They're condemning us as if we just caused the manatees to go extinct.

453
00:31:50,267 --> 00:31:53,892
That's social media. Don't read the comments.

454
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,280
Come on. I prepared you guys BBQ pork.

455
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,170
It was supposed to be a championship meal, but whatever.

456
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:02,554
Let's just eat. Come on.

457
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,830
Holy hell! Everything just went wrong for us.

458
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:09,297
We made a hideout in one place, but our tower was destroyed at another.

459
00:32:09,297 --> 00:32:13,210
Shit. It's like we read the wrong book for the exam.

460
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,750
It's too bad.

461
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:17,269
It's as expected.

462
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,000
We didn't have enough time to practice.

463
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,480
Honestly, we might even lose to high schoolers right now.

464
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,920
Hey!

465
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,535
Are you saying we didn't give it our all?

466
00:32:27,535 --> 00:32:29,120
Was this your all?

467
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,920
You were busy. You needed to run errands. You got this and that to do.

468
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,192
I didn't see anyone being serious about it at all.

469
00:32:35,192 --> 00:32:37,100
Hey. I have my own responsibilities.

470
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,300
- I'm not lazing around without a care in the world like you.
- Jack, you asshole!

471
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,760
You guys need to calm down.

472
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,700
We're on the same team.

473
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,260
I'm sorry, Hia.

474
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,976
I'll go check on him.

475
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,800
What now?

476
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,800
I prepared a lot.

477
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,610
Come on. Let's eat.

478
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,100
They're gone.

479
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:15,540
Let me clear these bowls away.

480
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,372
Was I being too harsh?

481
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,670
Hey, where are you going?

482
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,835
Clear things up with Ai Three.

483
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,540
I don't think you should go now.

484
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:39,156
You're both still angry.

485
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,110
You should separate and cool down for now.

486
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:45,450
You guys can talk later. Trust me.

487
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,243
Sit back down and eat.

488
00:33:49,243 --> 00:33:51,290
All right.

489
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:16,889
P'Three, may I come in?

490
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:21,184
Zo, can you please give me some time alone?

491
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:24,720
Please leave.

492
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,220
No.

493
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,254
Let me keep you company.

494
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,860
- P'Three—
- Zo!

495
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:36,760
Don't ask me anything at the moment.

496
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:41,040
I'm willing to answer every question. Just not right now.

497
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,330
Please?

498
00:34:42,338 --> 00:34:44,768
Can you understand me?

499
00:34:44,768 --> 00:34:46,740
I do.

500
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,530
P'Three.

501
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,300
I know how much you dedicate to

502
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,420
and expect from this competition.

503
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,892
But we all really did our best.

504
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:07,700
Just because we lost once doesn't mean we will lose forever.

505
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,100
Right?

506
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,680
P'Three?

507
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,948
Smile for me, please.

508
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,036
P'Three.

509
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:28,440
If you keep stressing, you'll age quickly.

510
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,308
Show me your smile.

511
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:37,233
Do it right. Are you going to do it right?

512
00:35:37,233 --> 00:35:38,788
Just watch.

513
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:48,616
It doesn't make a smile.

514
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:51,140
You're just the cutest.

515
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,830
- Give me a hug.
- Hm?

516
00:35:53,993 --> 00:35:55,300
Give me a hug.

517
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:58,340
- What?
- Can I get a hug?

518
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:08,460
I love you, P'Three.

519
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,770
Your hug can actually kill me.

520
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:14,908
But I'm willing to die in your arms, Zo.

521
00:36:14,908 --> 00:36:17,224
Let me hug you, too.

522
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:19,670
I can't breathe!

523
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,676
You can't breathe?

524
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,470
What are you playing?

525
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:29,410
I'll give you CPR.

526
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:32,570
No, I don't want it.

527
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,580
No! No! I don't want it!

528
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:37,367
- What do you mean, no? You like it, don't you?
- No. It's ticklish!

529
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,876
Your coffee, Boss.

530
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,870
Where's Cher?

531
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:50,572
Nong Cher and Jack took a day off. They have a game competition.

532
00:36:50,572 --> 00:36:54,425
Competition? No one informed me.

533
00:36:54,425 --> 00:36:58,816
We normally submit leave requests to HR. Not you, Sir.

534
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:01,310
Khun Aoi.

535
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:03,952
I'm sorry, Boss.

536
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:07,120
Thank you for the coffee.

537
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,940
Sure.

538
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,120
Boss.

539
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,824
You've been much livelier lately.

540
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,140
Is it a good thing?

541
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,677
It's a very good thing.

542
00:37:24,677 --> 00:37:28,130
My old boss is about to return.

543
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:31,840
Things are going great right now.

544
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,370
I don't know if we're talking about the same topic,

545
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:36,910
but as someone who's worked with me for so long

546
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:40,556
and has seen me through many stages of life,

547
00:37:40,556 --> 00:37:43,020
I'd like you to know that I like him very much.

548
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,920
Oh, gosh!

549
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,645
If Khun Porsche knows about this, he must be quite upset.

550
00:37:50,645 --> 00:37:55,232
You didn't really express yourself like this when you were with him.

551
00:37:55,232 --> 00:37:56,920
I don't know.

552
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,150
Maybe Porsche and I never thought of each other as more than friends.

553
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:02,500
That's why we were like that.

554
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:06,040
But it's different with Cher, isn't it?

555
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:13,480
Khun Aoi...

556
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:18,063
I won't bother you now. I'll just let you spend your time missing him.

557
00:38:18,063 --> 00:38:20,447
I'll get back to work.

558
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,730
I told you, Boss.

559
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:35,936
You can't control me.

560
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,844
Since I have you, my life has been a lot lighter.

561
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:48,544
I'm glad to have you in my life.

562
00:39:05,673 --> 00:39:07,373
Boss.

563
00:39:07,373 --> 00:39:09,589
Can I do more?

564
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:13,304
Doesn't your hand hurt?

565
00:39:13,304 --> 00:39:16,200
I can take medicine tomorrow.

566
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,448
If you say no,

567
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,012
I'll go back to sleep right now.

568
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:27,061
It's the same answer as the one for the first question.

Ask your friends to go on a beach trip.

Let's consider it a trip to clear things up and clear your mind.

P'Gun.
