You'll probably be like a dog abandoned by its owner.

If P'Tian is the person in P'Cher's heart, then what about you?

If Cher allows it, I can be his present and future.

I thought you did what my mom told you to.

I promise no matter how tough it is, no matter how hard I have to try,

I will do anything to get back to you, Boss.

Don't you pity me?

22
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,443
Why would I do that?

23
00:01:46,443 --> 00:01:50,937
Because I'm cute and adorable.

He was kicked out of the meeting the other day.

54
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:10,374
Boss is done with him and wants to switch to someone else.

55
00:04:10,374 --> 00:04:12,254
He's just an intern after all.

56
00:04:12,254 --> 00:04:14,639
No boss would get serious with him.

57
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,330
I heard his internship is almost over.

58

I guess the boss wants to get rid of him already.

Employees of this company sure are idle!

You normally keep your distance from me.

00:11:57,617 --> 00:11:59,119
Dammit. Just my luck.

183
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:02,911
Boss, the seniors are treating me to Som Tum as a farewell meal.
(T/N: Som Tum is papaya salad)

184
00:12:02,911 --> 00:12:04,631
Would you like to join us?

185
00:12:11,457 --> 00:12:13,802
This has no fermented fish sauce and is not spicy.

186
00:12:13,802 --> 00:12:16,085
Can you handle it?

187
00:12:16,085 --> 00:12:17,569
I'll try it.

188
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:18,920
This restaurant is great, Boss.

189
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,550
I recommend it to everyone.

190
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,526
Good as always.

191
00:12:29,214 --> 00:12:31,794
Your eyes are beaming, Boss.

192
00:12:33,647 --> 00:12:35,140
Here.

193
00:12:38,256 --> 00:12:40,220
Delicious?

194
00:12:41,788 --> 00:12:43,745
It is good.

195
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:49,436
What's good? The Som Tum or grilled chicken I shred for you?

196
00:12:50,527 --> 00:12:52,696
Both.

197
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,253
Oh my.

198
00:12:55,253 --> 00:12:59,260
Boss, even if I'm not here,

199
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,790
you can join these guys for lunch.

200
00:13:03,836 --> 00:13:06,694
Guys, if you come again, invite the boss too.

201
00:13:06,694 --> 00:13:09,608
No problem. Of course, we can do that.

202
00:13:09,608 --> 00:13:12,568
I always ask him along, but he never agrees to it.

203
00:13:13,475 --> 00:13:14,822
He's easy to treat.

204
00:13:14,822 --> 00:13:18,129
Som Tum with one chili and grilled chicken will do.

205
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:20,276
You know him so well.

206
00:13:20,276 --> 00:13:23,241
But no one will shred the chicken for you.

207
00:13:24,796 --> 00:13:27,111
On your free day, you can come to have lunch with us.

208
00:13:27,111 --> 00:13:28,588
That's right, Boss.

209
00:13:28,588 --> 00:13:33,048
Having Nong Cher with us is heartwarming.

210
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,988
What's the matter, Ai Cher?

211
00:13:39,988 --> 00:13:42,745
You look like you don't want to see us anymore.

212
00:13:46,008 --> 00:13:49,934
Well, I won't get to visit for a while.

213
00:13:49,934 --> 00:13:52,825
Why? Where are you going?

214
00:13:54,656 --> 00:13:56,480
It's nothing. Let's just eat.

215
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,070
It's hot out here.

216
00:13:59,076 --> 00:14:01,376
Let's eat, everyone.

217
00:14:01,376 --> 00:14:04,268
Boss, this is also good. Try it.

218
00:14:08,142 --> 00:14:09,297
Jae.

219
00:14:09,297 --> 00:14:11,297
Green bean again? Give me something else.

220
00:14:11,297 --> 00:14:13,741
For someone so pretty.

221
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:28,853
Please come in.

222
00:14:32,845 --> 00:14:35,954
You've come to my office twice already today.

223
00:14:35,954 --> 00:14:38,949
So? Can't I?

224
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:41,133
You always can.

225
00:15:04,072 --> 00:15:06,034
Cher.

226
00:15:06,034 --> 00:15:07,056
Yes?

227
00:15:07,056 --> 00:15:09,030
What's the matter?

228
00:15:09,733 --> 00:15:11,742
It's nothing.

229
00:15:11,742 --> 00:15:14,838
I just want to slack off work.

230
00:15:14,838 --> 00:15:19,900
Boss, we're celebrating my internship completion, at Hia Tub's place this evening.

231
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,051
Grilled pork BBQ as always. Are you interested?

232
00:15:22,051 --> 00:15:23,785
I'm interested.

233
00:15:24,446 --> 00:15:27,849
- You're easy.
- Only for you.

234
00:15:27,849 --> 00:15:29,483
Yuck.

235
00:15:30,713 --> 00:15:33,153
Can I take a quick nap?

236
00:15:33,153 --> 00:15:35,154
Sure.

237
00:16:16,702 --> 00:16:18,538
We missed you so much, Boss.

238
00:16:18,538 --> 00:16:19,874
Long time no see.

239
00:16:19,874 --> 00:16:21,591
I missed you guys, too.

240
00:16:21,591 --> 00:16:23,242
How have you guys been? We haven't met in quite a while.

241
00:16:23,242 --> 00:16:25,379
We've been well. What about you?

242
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:26,498
I'm good.

243
00:16:26,498 --> 00:16:28,054
Let's eat then!

244
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:29,530
Eat all you want today.

245
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,090
Have fun all you want.

246
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,206
Let's celebrate Ai Laem's completion of his internship.

247
00:16:33,206 --> 00:16:34,429
We didn't think he would make it.

248
00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:36,960
Good job, Ai Laem! I'm so proud of you!

249
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,239
Well done!

250
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:43,154
- Cheers.
- Bottoms up!

251
00:16:43,154 --> 00:16:45,990
Yay!

252
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:48,600
What was that Ai Laem?

253
00:16:51,361 --> 00:16:53,733
I'm drunk.

254
00:16:53,733 --> 00:16:55,659
Can drinking plain water make you drunk?

255
00:16:55,659 --> 00:16:58,114
Yes, drunk in love.

256
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,719
I lost my appetite.

257
00:17:09,844 --> 00:17:12,629
Wow! You used to put the whole stalk of it into the pot.

258
00:17:12,629 --> 00:17:16,698
He has now evolved. Give him a round of applause.

259
00:17:16,698 --> 00:17:18,305
Bravo!

260
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:20,982
Cher likes to say I'm shaped by society.

261
00:17:20,982 --> 00:17:24,128
I didn't believe him at first, but it seems true now.

262
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:29,385
Boss, if you're shaped by our society, don't be afraid.

263
00:17:29,385 --> 00:17:31,793
We're all good people. No worries.

264
00:17:31,793 --> 00:17:33,751
It's true.

265
00:17:33,751 --> 00:17:35,996
Come on. Let's eat.

266
00:17:50,121 --> 00:17:52,298
Where will you crash tonight?

267
00:17:55,488 --> 00:17:57,147
Laem!

268
00:17:57,738 --> 00:17:59,155
Why do you have to shout, Ai P'Jack?

269
00:17:59,155 --> 00:18:01,737
- I asked you a question, but you didn't hear me.
- What did you ask?

270
00:18:01,737 --> 00:18:03,960
I asked, where will you sleep tonight?

271
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,810
Do you want me to take you home?

272
00:18:05,812 --> 00:18:08,783
No. I will stay at the boss's tonight.

273
00:18:08,783 --> 00:18:10,832
As a goodbye, right?

274
00:18:10,832 --> 00:18:13,933
You guys have been stuck to each other today.

275
00:18:13,933 --> 00:18:16,553
Yes, as a goodbye.

276
00:18:18,128 --> 00:18:20,428
All right.

277
00:18:20,428 --> 00:18:22,454
Keep washing.

278
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:25,037
Aren't you going to help?

279
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:28,736
- Do I need to?
- Yes. Help me clean the plates.

280
00:18:28,736 --> 00:18:30,832
I'll wash them.

281
00:18:39,336 --> 00:18:41,354
Can I wash up first?

282
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:44,690
Sure, go ahead.

283
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,140
I'll watch TV while waiting for you.

284
00:18:47,967 --> 00:18:49,767
No need.

285
00:18:50,945 --> 00:18:53,133
Can you help wash my hair?

286
00:18:56,036 --> 00:18:59,133
Did you do something that hurt your hand?

287
00:19:00,537 --> 00:19:02,373
No.

288
00:19:03,965 --> 00:19:05,965
You're acting weird.

289
00:19:05,965 --> 00:19:08,435
I'm already head over heels for you.

290
00:19:08,435 --> 00:19:10,713
Why are you being cute now?

291
00:19:11,571 --> 00:19:14,316
I just want to be pampered by someone here.

292
00:19:14,316 --> 00:19:16,240
Can't I?

293
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,175
Of course, you can.

294
00:19:18,175 --> 00:19:20,339
Please lead the way then, Nong Cher.

295
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:22,917
Phi Gun will take good care of you.

296
00:19:34,876 --> 00:19:40,733
Hey, did you know I've never washed anyone's hair before?

297
00:19:40,733 --> 00:19:43,014
You're the first.

298
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,713
I'm glad.

299
00:19:48,411 --> 00:19:50,210
What about me?

300
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,290
Am I the first?

301
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:54,293
In what category?

302
00:19:54,923 --> 00:19:57,194
How many categories are there?

303
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:04,735
There are many. I'm too lazy to think of any.

304
00:20:09,716 --> 00:20:11,010
What are you doing?

305
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,300
Why did you get in here with me?

306
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:18,714
Am I your first kiss?

307
00:20:20,204 --> 00:20:22,100
Of course, not.

308
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,213
The first kiss at 23 years of age?

309
00:20:25,213 --> 00:20:26,560
That's pretty late.

310
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,610
No way.

311
00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:34,442
I'll be your latest kiss then.

312
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:38,353
Who keeps track of their latest kiss?

313
00:20:38,353 --> 00:20:43,334
I mean your latest kiss and every kiss from now until forever.

314
00:20:43,334 --> 00:20:45,836
I'm the only one allowed to kiss you.

315
00:20:46,758 --> 00:20:49,418
You're making agreements one-sidedly.

316
00:20:49,418 --> 00:20:51,634
Well, you're mine.

317
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,112
You're talking too much.

318
00:20:57,112 --> 00:21:01,438
If I talk too much again, will you kiss me again?

319
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:12,443
Cher, you're my happiness.

320
00:21:13,156 --> 00:21:16,842
The happiness that I've never had before.

321
00:21:29,336 --> 00:21:31,054
Remember this.

322
00:21:32,025 --> 00:21:34,517
If I'm your happiness,

323
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:39,414
it will never be gone.

324
00:21:40,728 --> 00:21:43,650
No matter what puts us to the test,

325
00:21:45,036 --> 00:21:48,014
I'll be your happiness forever.

326
00:21:53,271 --> 00:21:55,239
You're so cute.

327
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,433
I love you, Boss.

328
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,033
I love you, Phi Gun.

329
00:22:53,601 --> 00:22:55,343
I will be back.

330
00:22:55,805 --> 00:22:58,451
Don't get so worried and die before then.

331
00:23:21,292 --> 00:23:23,334
Can I give you one kiss?

332
00:23:27,636 --> 00:23:29,674
That's it for now.

333
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:50,060
I never imagined myself doing anything like this.

334
00:24:57,185 --> 00:24:59,502
Let's just cut to the point.

335
00:24:59,502 --> 00:25:01,753
When you're reading this...

336
00:25:05,179 --> 00:25:07,138
how do you feel?

337
00:25:07,561 --> 00:25:13,994
Are you upset, sad, or feeling nothing?

338
00:25:14,478 --> 00:25:19,082
I'm just asking. I won't get to hear the answer anyway.

339
00:25:19,082 --> 00:25:23,390
Do you see how much trouble you've caused Gungawin yet?

340
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:26,611
You two are not a good match.

341
00:25:26,611 --> 00:25:29,142
Walk out of my son's life.

342
00:25:29,142 --> 00:25:31,368
Let him find someone suitable for him.

343
00:25:31,368 --> 00:25:34,112
Someone who he can lean on.

344
00:25:34,112 --> 00:25:36,873
Not some lousy kid like you.

345
00:25:39,324 --> 00:25:42,076
From now on, you must be happy.

346
00:25:42,076 --> 00:25:46,074
Work hard and don't get moody so often.

347
00:25:46,074 --> 00:25:50,184
The concept you came up with doesn't match my requirements.

348
00:25:50,184 --> 00:25:52,033
Please start over.

349
00:25:53,239 --> 00:25:56,594
Eat Som Tum with Ai P'Jack and the rest sometimes.

350
00:25:56,594 --> 00:26:00,753
Guys, eat all you want. I'll order for you.

351
00:26:01,479 --> 00:26:03,999
But please pay for us, Sir.

352
00:26:03,999 --> 00:26:06,893
I've been paying for many meals already.

353
00:26:07,491 --> 00:26:09,789
Here, let me get Som Tum for you.

354
00:26:09,789 --> 00:26:14,113
Keep eating so you can keep growing. Got it?

355
00:26:17,931 --> 00:26:20,044
Here.

356
00:26:20,044 --> 00:26:24,111
What is it, Boss? Why are you staring at me?

357
00:26:30,184 --> 00:26:32,253
Jae! Jae!

358
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,633
What's the matter with the boss?

359
00:26:36,658 --> 00:26:38,933
Don't look for me.

360
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,705
Because you'll find me so easily.

361
00:26:42,705 --> 00:26:45,122
The only place I'll be is Hia Tub's gaming cafe.

362
00:26:45,122 --> 00:26:48,002
If I go any place further, that'd be my hometown Udon Thani.

363
00:26:50,376 --> 00:26:55,420
As of now, we're not compatible

364
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,630
as everyone else says after all.

365
00:27:00,991 --> 00:27:03,671
That's what I have to accept.

366
00:27:04,634 --> 00:27:07,342
So yesterday when you said it was the last day,

367
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:11,373
that was our last day?

368
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:20,590
♫ I'm not worthy enough for you to love me  ♫

369
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:27,510
♫ Please go back, let the ordinary me gaze up at you ♫

370
00:27:30,352 --> 00:27:32,816
Okay, come on! Come on!

371
00:27:32,816 --> 00:27:35,513
Attack! Attack now!

372
00:27:38,676 --> 00:27:40,004
And it's done.

373
00:27:40,004 --> 00:27:43,013
See? We won so easily.

374
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,284
We did great tonight. Let's go to bed now.

375
00:27:46,284 --> 00:27:47,412
Goodnight, everyone.

376
00:27:47,412 --> 00:27:49,965
Please go to bed, P'Cher. Don't stay up so late.

377
00:27:49,965 --> 00:27:54,520
All right. Don't worry about me. I'll read a little and go to bed.

378
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,840
Take care of your health.

379
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,417
Yes. Goodnight, guys.

380
00:28:12,389 --> 00:28:14,217
Goodnight, Boss.

381
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:35,251
Did he not tell you at all what he's doing?

382
00:28:35,251 --> 00:28:39,025
No, Boss. He didn't tell me anything.

383
00:28:39,025 --> 00:28:42,535
He only goes to class, practices the game, and studies.

384
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:46,556
Well, then.

385
00:28:47,546 --> 00:28:50,074
Please tell him...

386
00:28:50,074 --> 00:28:53,657
Don't be too hard on yourself. And take care.

387
00:29:02,442 --> 00:29:05,035
You're so obvious, Boss.

388
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:11,110
I can tell right away these old-fashioned words aren't from Jack,

389
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:13,130
but from you.

390
00:29:19,531 --> 00:29:21,150
Cher.

391
00:29:24,037 --> 00:29:25,934
I love you.

392
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:33,213
I love you too, Phi Gun.

393
00:29:45,588 --> 00:29:49,405
Hey, you. Are you okay?

394
00:29:49,405 --> 00:29:51,041
Hey!

395
00:29:51,991 --> 00:29:53,693
Are you all right?

396
00:29:56,542 --> 00:29:59,514
I didn't realize that was our last day.

397
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:04,113
There was no sign at all.

398
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:09,049
Am I too stupid to see anything?

399
00:30:09,049 --> 00:30:11,935
Hey, easy there.

400
00:30:13,699 --> 00:30:15,608
Calm down.

401
00:30:15,608 --> 00:30:21,776
I really can't keep anyone with me after all, Porsche.

402
00:30:22,801 --> 00:30:24,542
You,

403
00:30:25,607 --> 00:30:27,291
Thyme,

404
00:30:28,084 --> 00:30:29,874
and Cher.

405
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:34,243
Everyone left me.

406
00:30:36,128 --> 00:30:38,216
I have no one left.

407
00:30:40,144 --> 00:30:43,474
But Nong Cher seems really reasonable.

408
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:45,697
I don't know.

409
00:30:45,697 --> 00:30:48,313
Although I've only met him a few times,

410
00:30:49,094 --> 00:30:51,780
but Nong Cher seems like a thoughtful person.

411
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,990
He also looks quite strong.

412
00:30:56,602 --> 00:31:00,093
He doesn't seem like the type to disappear without reason.

413
00:31:01,571 --> 00:31:03,291
Don't think too much.

414
00:31:48,942 --> 00:31:52,253
Let's go to the bedroom. Sleeping here can give you back pain.

415
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,773
No. It's comfortable right here.

416
00:31:57,276 --> 00:31:59,536
Go lie down in bed. Come on.

417
00:32:01,634 --> 00:32:03,323
Let's go.

418
00:32:03,323 --> 00:32:05,511
No.

419
00:32:06,576 --> 00:32:08,271
Give me a hug.

420
00:32:09,201 --> 00:32:10,880
A hug.

421
00:32:22,086 --> 00:32:23,975
Wow, are you seriously doing this?

422
00:32:25,935 --> 00:32:28,132
You want it this way, right?

423
00:32:43,177 --> 00:32:46,954
I'm still waiting for you, Cher.

424
00:32:57,732 --> 00:32:59,353
Cher.

425
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:05,460
Yes?

426
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:08,393
Cher.

427
00:33:19,639 --> 00:33:21,431
Cher.

428
00:33:25,607 --> 00:33:29,457
Cher, get up and have breakfast.

429
00:33:29,457 --> 00:33:32,641
No. I'm not hungry.

430
00:33:35,354 --> 00:33:37,054
Cher.

431
00:33:58,719 --> 00:34:01,114
I told him not to worry to death,

432
00:34:03,026 --> 00:34:05,646
but here I am dying.

433
00:34:06,529 --> 00:34:08,862
I miss you, Boss!

434
00:34:29,968 --> 00:34:31,988
May I get a coffee? My regular, please.

435
00:34:31,988 --> 00:34:33,714
Of course, Sir.

436
00:34:35,072 --> 00:34:38,884
Jack, haven't you talked to Nong Cher yet?

437
00:34:38,884 --> 00:34:40,757
The boss is back to his old self.

438
00:34:40,757 --> 00:34:43,669
He's been drinking the same coffee flavor for five days now.

439
00:34:43,669 --> 00:34:45,608
I haven't.

440
00:34:45,608 --> 00:34:47,262
I pity him.

441
00:34:47,262 --> 00:34:49,085
He's not lively. He's not happy.

442
00:34:49,085 --> 00:34:50,768
So indifferent.

443
00:34:50,768 --> 00:34:52,673
How can he be happy?

444
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:55,636
His happiness disappeared from his life.

445
00:34:58,605 --> 00:35:01,752
What we can do is keep taking care of the boss.

446
00:35:01,752 --> 00:35:05,176
Jack, please bring Nong Cher back soon.

447
00:35:11,739 --> 00:35:15,536
Hey, it's been a while. Are you here to visit?

448
00:35:15,536 --> 00:35:18,894
I was just in the area, so I came to get something to drink.

449
00:35:18,894 --> 00:35:21,221
What would you like today?

450
00:35:21,221 --> 00:35:22,867
Whatever.

451
00:35:23,416 --> 00:35:26,773
I haven't made that menu in a long time.

452
00:35:26,773 --> 00:35:28,424
Why not?

453
00:35:28,424 --> 00:35:33,710
After you left, your boss went back to drinking his regular menu.

454
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,573
He drinks it every day.

455
00:35:36,256 --> 00:35:39,239
What about his tumbler?

456
00:35:41,151 --> 00:35:43,151
He hasn't used it since.

457
00:36:00,154 --> 00:36:02,242
Without you,

458
00:36:03,865 --> 00:36:08,742
my tiny room seems tremendous.

459
00:36:12,124 --> 00:36:14,434
And it's freaking lonely.

460
00:36:37,943 --> 00:36:41,442
Are you coming back, Cher?

461
00:36:58,102 --> 00:37:00,593
- What is it, Hia?
- You scared me.

462
00:37:01,321 --> 00:37:03,980
Tell me what happened.

463
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:06,277
- What is it, Hia?
- Just say whatever you want to say.

464
00:37:06,277 --> 00:37:08,705
Why are you hitting the table?

465
00:37:08,705 --> 00:37:12,722
Spill it. Or I'll use my God damn foot to open your mouth.

466
00:37:12,722 --> 00:37:14,353
P'Three!

467
00:37:14,353 --> 00:37:16,526
Don't say that. It's foul language.

468
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:20,871
Nong Zo, I am truly sorry. I didn't mean to say that.

469
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:22,873
It slipped out.

470
00:37:23,778 --> 00:37:26,166
Zo, help me.

471
00:37:26,166 --> 00:37:29,270
If you still regard me as your little bro,

472
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:31,945
tell me what happened.

473
00:37:31,945 --> 00:37:35,651
If you don't want to tell, that's okay.

474
00:37:35,651 --> 00:37:37,296
I understand.

475
00:37:38,242 --> 00:37:41,242
You're harsher than my language.

476
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:46,340
It's not something you should hide from us.

477
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:49,819
Even though we may look like this but we are horny.
(T/N: He said the wrong word)

478
00:37:49,819 --> 00:37:52,123
- Worry!
- Yes, worry.

479
00:37:52,123 --> 00:37:53,845
All right.

480
00:37:55,245 --> 00:37:58,402
The boss's mom told me to stay away from him.

481
00:37:58,402 --> 00:38:00,056
And you listened to her?

482
00:38:00,056 --> 00:38:05,179
As you can see, I caused him so much trouble.

483
00:38:05,179 --> 00:38:07,502
I'm absolutely not a good match for him.

484
00:38:07,502 --> 00:38:09,263
You're backing off because of this little thing?

485
00:38:09,263 --> 00:38:11,586
Listen first.

486
00:38:11,586 --> 00:38:16,292
To be honest, when I talked to his mom, I was angry.

487
00:38:16,292 --> 00:38:17,960
I was furious.

488
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,434
But come to think of it, it's true.

489
00:38:22,534 --> 00:38:26,905
I can't argue with that. It bugs me big time up until today.

490
00:38:26,905 --> 00:38:29,185
What are you going to do?

491
00:38:29,185 --> 00:38:31,602
I'm retreating to stand firm.

492
00:38:31,602 --> 00:38:33,206
I'll go back again when I'm ready.

493
00:38:33,206 --> 00:38:36,119
Did you tell the boss you're going back?

494
00:38:39,054 --> 00:38:41,639
Someone else might fucking take him.

495
00:38:45,571 --> 00:38:50,233
Someone else might get to him before that. Let me tell you.

496
00:38:50,233 --> 00:38:52,308
Yeah.

497
00:38:52,308 --> 00:38:56,729
You know that if I told him he wouldn't agree to it.

498
00:38:56,729 --> 00:38:59,664
You know how stubborn he is.

499
00:38:59,664 --> 00:39:04,170
Besides, if he finds someone more suitable,

500
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,010
I'll be happy for him.

501
00:39:07,016 --> 00:39:10,016
Though I might be sad, I will be glad too.

502
00:39:20,112 --> 00:39:22,374
I usually just want a passing grade.

503
00:39:22,996 --> 00:39:26,439
Who would've thought I'd look forward to getting honors for my final year?

504
00:39:31,751 --> 00:39:35,271
When Mom and Grandma told me to study hard, I didn't listen.

505
00:39:35,271 --> 00:39:36,967
Who do you think you are, Boss?

506
00:39:36,967 --> 00:39:38,803
Who are you, Boss?

507
00:39:44,826 --> 00:39:47,425
Did he put some kind of black magic on me?

508
00:39:47,425 --> 00:39:50,281
Why am I head over heels for him?

509
00:39:51,925 --> 00:39:54,240
Sādhu!
(T/N: Buddhist version of Amen, used in a religious context)

510
00:39:57,179 --> 00:39:58,753
Let's do this.

511
00:40:03,511 --> 00:40:05,213
Shit!

512
00:40:07,848 --> 00:40:09,438
Boss!

513
00:40:27,894 --> 00:40:29,274
Boss.

514
00:40:32,236 --> 00:40:33,458
Here.

515
00:40:33,458 --> 00:40:35,171
What are you doing?

516
00:40:36,018 --> 00:40:37,650
Will you be my boyfriend?

517
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:41,080

your smile is now back.

525
00:41:24,545 --> 00:41:27,596
I promise I'll make you happy.

I love you very much.

527
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,994
What a sweet talker.

528
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,134
Phi Gun.

529
00:41:38,551 --> 00:41:43,493

00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:33,630
♫ I'm not worthy enough for you to love me  ♫

541
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:38,930
♫ Please go back, let the ordinary me gaze up at you ♫
