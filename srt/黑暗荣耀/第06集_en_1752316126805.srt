Dark Glory

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,230
-Hello-Hello

3
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,280
-Hello-Hello

4
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,110
Well, go quickly.

5
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,030
Good to know

6
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:18,950
Enjoy your lunch

7
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,870
Thank you!

8
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,410
(Seoul Joo Hospital)

9
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,040
But senior

10
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,210
I don't need a prince

11
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,050
I don't need a prince

12
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,300
But someone who can be with me

13
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,010
Sword Dance Executioner

14
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,140
Your drinks and salad are ready.

15
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,350
Thank you

16
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,560
（Shida Coffee House）

17
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,160
How dare you, a resident doctor, be so presumptuous?

18
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,490
The dean is called here and there

19
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,450
Isn't it nice to walk to the park?

20
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,120
- Is this your lunch? - It's breakfast.

21
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,580
What? It's really heartbreaking.

22
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,460
-No matter how busy you are, you have to eat-I am losing weight

23
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,590
Just lose another 4kg and wait till Christmas

24
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,510
I'm going to Guam to wear a bikini

25
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,840
Is that so?

26
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,970
-Come on -Come on

27
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,810
Mom, I have made up my mind.

28
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,560
What to do?

29
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,980
I don't want to be a professor

30
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:28,980
This is understandable

31
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,190
I want to open a clinic

32
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:32,730
That's fine too

33
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:35,070
But did you just decide?

34
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,480
It's been a while

35
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,610
I just decided to tell you

36
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,530
(Resignation letter)

37
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,200
- Really? - I'm serious.

38
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,130
Okay

39
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:58,920
I'm grateful that you didn't end up in the military.

40
00:02:59,010 --> 00:02:59,970
Opening a clinic is nothing.

41
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,470
Where will it be opened? Apgujeong? Cheongdam?

42
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,390
No

43
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:05,760
In Shiming City

44
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,730
The person I like lives in Shiming City

45
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,850
Are you in love?

46
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:13,980
Not in discussion yet

47
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,280
Mom, you know some people

48
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:22,660
I am as calm as in the water, but I make others stand in the storm

49
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:25,240
Is she a fisherman?

50
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,530
Mom, this is a metaphor.

51
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,330
Your purpose is not to make money

52
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,540
It is not to support poor areas.

53
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,660
It’s actually for love?

54
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:35,130
Did you write that here too?

55
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,210
Oh, really.

56
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,420
I'm going to rewrite Mother

57
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,720
Oh, you are such a loser.

58
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,840
Are you a vegetarian?

59
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,230
There was a time when I believed in various gods.

60
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,020
Like a glimmer of hope

61
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,150
Looking for terminally ill patients all over the country

62
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,450
Kneeling before the gods who have abandoned me, begging for salvation

63
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,870
Where and what would you pray for now?

64
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,000
Find a hidden place in your bag and sew it on

65
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:22,510
Don't let anyone else touch it, you have to sew it yourself

66
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,550
Thank you mom

67
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,550
But I said

68
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:31,180
Did you just find out now that she became Ye-Sul's homeroom teacher?

69
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,850
You are so stupid...

70
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,060
Anyway, you go up first.

71
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,530
I'll take care of this.

72
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,860
Whose son-in-law is the guy in the policy office of the Ministry of Education?

73
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,780
Never mind.

74
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,530
It's better not to provoke her.

75
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,370
That bitch is so cruel that if she exposes my affairs

76
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,410
What should we do if everyone in the world knows it?

77
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,250
I'm scared of my mom

78
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,210
What is there for her to be afraid of when she is just a bitch?

79
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,710
I'm not afraid of her, I'm afraid of Ye-ryul

80
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,420
If everyone knew about it, Yilu would also know it.

81
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,300
Even if she doesn't know now, what if she knows everything when she grows up?

82
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,510
This is even more terrifying

83
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,020
Park Yeon-jin

84
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:15,980
Look at Mom

85
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,360
I told you this before, right?

86
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,820
Don't look back

87
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,570
The solution to the problem is not behind

88
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,280
It is always in front

89
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,160
Life is like this

90
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,790
Got it?

91
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,600
(Flight schedule from October 31 to November 6)

92
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,150
Then I realized

93
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,440
God does not exist

94
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,570
Just pretending to exist

95
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,450
So what about you?

96
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,700
Pray to me for Yeon-jin

97
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,790
Can redeem you

98
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:16,790
That's me

99
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,540
Wow, he's quite handsome.

100
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,500
Your boyfriend?

101
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,550
Very young

102
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,130
-Teacher Jiang is going to get us coffee. -Hmm?

103
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:32,850
Good

104
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:33,760
I don't need a thank you

105
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,180
It doesn't matter

106
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,060
Really

107
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,440
That's your problem

108
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,020
You don't know what to do until I tell you

109
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,940
Do you have anything to say to me?

110
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,190
Oh what can I say?

111
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,530
I already know you are excellent

112
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,280
I just want to have a cup of coffee with you

113
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,710
(Auntie)

114
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,670
Please call me in case of emergency

115
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,750
Is your boyfriend good to you?

116
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,630
He must be good to you

117
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,880
Somehow I initially thought

118
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,640
You will definitely like older men

119
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,350
No, you are playing both sides.

120
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,180
Just kidding

121
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,520
Do you have a partner?

122
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,070
Do I look like that?

123
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,110
You don't look

124
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:28,860
Why?

125
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,110
Didn't anyone tell you?

126
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,870
Then I won't say anything.

127
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,830
This is our first meeting.

128
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,040
But I think you are the kind of

129
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,620
The type who speaks in an irritating way

130
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,830
You are the type who is awkward when speaking

131
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,330
What?

132
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,670
You really

133
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,260
I should be grateful that I am a woman.

134
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:55,340
If you were a man, you would have been punched hard by me, do you understand?

135
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,350
Is this true or false?

136
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,060
You look

137
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,600
I only fight with girls.

138
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:07,770
I'm kidding too

139
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,150
Your pronunciation just now is very cute so I want to try it too

140
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,420
Sun Mingwu's whereabouts unknown

141
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,960
Because Sun Mingwu rides a motorcycle, I sometimes lose him

142
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,510
But before, it was only one or two days.

143
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,630
I'll go to his house and wait and I'll see him again.

144
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,970
But after this day

145
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,930
He was nowhere to be found at his home or on the golf course.

146
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,180
So this travel agency is where he was last seen?

147
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,100
Yes

148
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,850
Did he take a large sum of money and join forces with them?

149
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,230
He bought a plane ticket on this day

150
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,440
If you are leaving the country the next day, this makes sense.

151
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,400
I will confirm with the travel agency

152
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,370
Let's wait and see until the weekend.

153
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:02,750
Good

154
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,040
Unless he's dead

155
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,210
Uncovering the disappearance of Sun Mingwu is not our goal

156
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,130
Dead...

157
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:10,960
Not being killed?

158
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:12,960
I mean

159
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,760
Is it possible that he is no longer alive?

160
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,880
Sun Mingwu?

161
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,140
This possibility cannot be ruled out

162
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,470
I'll call you

163
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,600
That

164
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,470
It won’t be…

165
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,480
If yes

166
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,440
You did

167
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,980
Are you asking if I was the one who attacked Sun Mingwu?

168
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,110
If this is the case

169
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,660
I also need to have an idea in my mind so that I can prepare for a rainy day.

170
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,580
No

171
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,830
Even if I did it, you don't have to know

172
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,000
What?

173
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,080
The agreement between you and me is simple

174
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,710
You go do what I ask you to do.

175
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,550
I will do what you entrusted to me.

176
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,760
That's all

177
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:58,880
We are now

178
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,300
Getting too close

179
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,840
Louis' dad is here

180
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,050
Dad hasn't been home for a long time.

181
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,640
Sorry

182
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,310
What?

183
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,810
Louis

184
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,480
Damn

185
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,910
What's your attitude?

186
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,030
Dad just apologized to you, didn't he?

187
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,290
I know you're mad at me because I didn't come home

188
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,750
What's going on?

00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,310

Where the hell is your mother now?

191
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,860
Your mother was here

192
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,280
It seems that this bastard doesn't want to live anymore

193
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,280
No, I'm not talking about you

194
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:43,990
But Louis

195
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,160
What were you doing at that time?

196
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,870
Did you bite him?

197
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,250
If you are just a bystander, Dad,

198
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,670
I will be disappointed in you

Oh my god, did you hear that?

208
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,950
You said it loudly.

209
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,460
The truth from the predecessors usually sounds loud

210

00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:44,300
You have to listen to what the stylist says

213
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:47,260
She said my husband has placed an ad again this time

214
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,430
Don't you know what this means?

But he spent at least 220 million won on this radio station

Youth is capital?

00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:07,720
So isn’t the amount I gave different from the amount I gave 18 years ago?

240
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:13,060
I heard that you bought the hotel in your sister's name.

241
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,470

249
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,710
I checked Sun Mingwu's flight information

250
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,040
Except for a one-way ticket to Vladivostok

251
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,090
No other purchase records

252
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:49,050
But there is no boarding record for this one-way ticket

253
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,010
I also checked the hotel he booked.

254
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,680
He didn't check in because he didn't show up.

255
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,220
It seems that he did not leave the country.

256
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,560
Yes

257
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,140
But what happened to Sun Mingwu?

258
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,100
What can I do for you?

259
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,060
Yeah

260
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:06,780
But I'm not sure he's just unavailable.

261
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:07,940
Or accidental death?

262
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,490
Don’t you have a lot of black clothes?

263
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,040
Well, I have a lot

264
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,000
Sun Mingwu should have been broken, right?

265
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:25,170
Well, memory cards are consumables.

266
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,050
Then what's next?

267
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,970
Should I find one that can flap its wings?

268
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:33,970
A real butterfly?

269
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,230
I know a butterfly with silk wings

270
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,230
It can trigger hurricane Yanzhen

272
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,760
On behalf of our city, I would like to thank you

273
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,970
It's so late now. Thank you for your hard work, Mr. He.

274

Why don't you come to my house?

283
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:44,980
Shall we meet?

284
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:45,980
Why?

285
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,190
Read my text message quickly

286
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:08,830
Which ring looks better?

287
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,130
This bastard didn't go to work today.

288
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:12,960
He stole my clothes and watch.

289
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,510
Help me choose one of these three

290
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,510
Oh my god, is this true? Which watch?

291
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,970
I'm giving you an advance payment.

292
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,140
Making phone calls is one thing, working is another

293
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,900
Would you like to see other models?

294
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,280
Big ones may be uncomfortable to wear

295
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:43,780
It doesn't matter

296
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,580
I like the big ones.

297
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:50,370
Everything is better when it is bigger

298
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,380
Taesuk

299
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,680
You said you would arrive later, so why are you here so early?

300
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,930
They all look great so I haven't decided which one I want yet

301
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,550
Give us 5 minutes

302
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,530
Hey, I told you to wear high heels when you see me

303
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,740
I like you to be tall

304
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,580
You won't make me taller than you.

305
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,540
How can you live with me if you think my height is embarrassing?

306
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,120
I flew all day yesterday and my legs hurt so I didn't wear it

307
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,580
I will definitely wear high heels next time

308
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,960
I won't propose to you formally again

309
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,130
You said as long as the diamond ring is bigger than your friend's, it's fine.

310
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,300
This is the biggest

311
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,010
Really? Huh?

312
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,100
Oh my god, it’s bigger than hers. I love it so much!

313
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:49,890
Oh, there is

314
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,190
My mom asked you to call her.

315
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,400
My mother likes the food in the temple

316
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,940
Don't take her to eat meat, okay?

317
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:58,860
I know everything

318
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,950
I don’t like eating meat either.

319
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,660
(Auntie calls)

320
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,370
Turn quickly!

321
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,880
Someone is following your car!

322
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,970
How did you get there?

323
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,720
Now that's not important

324
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,510
I really do this every day.

325
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,770
Why didn’t we expect that the other party would follow us?

326
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,060
Anyway, I will try to get rid of them.

327
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,560
I don't need to do it myself

328
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,110
Don't let them see you.

329
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,010
Are you looking for death?

330
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,560
How can anyone brake like you?

331
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,810
I'm sorry, are you not hurt?

332
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:59,230
Oh my neck, oh my waist

333
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,310
What are you going to do?

334
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,190
We are a bit busy

335
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:03,940
You either call the police

336
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:05,860
Or give cash and decide quickly

337
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,650
The option you mentioned is wrong.

338
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:10,700
Usually the insurance company is called instead of the police.

339
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,450
If you rent a car, you will call the rental company

340
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,540
You're really smart.

341
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,960
This is my favorite rental car.

342
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,010
You hit my car.

343
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,510
You should call the police first.

344
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,060
Or you should take out cash.

345
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:37,480
My car was smashed and I was still scolded on the street

346
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,060
How could this be possible?

347
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,560
Then cash. It seems everyone is busy.

348
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,440
Tell me your account number

349
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,440
That's not cash.

350
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,110
That's called the remittance sister

351
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,200
Enter your number. Mobile number

352
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,130
I'll call you

353
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,050
Just bring cash with you.

354
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:07,190
Are you not hurt? Let me see

355
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,150
Aren't you supposed to follow Jeon Jae-joon today?

356
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,030
Why are you behind me?

357
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:17,160
Why are you following me?

358
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,160
No, why should I follow you?

359
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:27,170
Are you doubting me?

360
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,130
I am cautious

361
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,590
You feel uneasy, don't you?

362
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,760
I can go find your husband.

363
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,800
Tell him: "Your wife asked me to kill you"

364
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,100
I can reveal everything.

365
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:42,680
You should have thought about this possibility, right?

366
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,530
Jeon Jae-jun is at the gate of your school

367
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:53,610
He looked at Ye-Sul from a distance for a while and then left.

368
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,070
I was following Jeon Jae-joon so I was there too

369
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,870
I just saw you

370
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:02,660
I was so happy when I suddenly saw those people's cars

371
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:07,250
I have that thought in my mind

372
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:09,840
It is possible

373
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:14,630
But I never thought about it

374
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,010
No other thoughts at all

375
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,100
I am already busy just operating the camera and driving.

376
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:25,730
Get off and take a look

377
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,420
The restaurant that Jeon Jae-jun frequents is inside the Mangwon Market

378
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,380
Where to buy Hainanese cabbage

379
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:57,590
Eat it as soon as possible. It has already fermented in the car.

380
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,050
And my wife

381
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,720
If I want to file a complaint as you said, I have more people to talk to.

382
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,690
Park Yeon-jin, Jeon Jae-joon, Lee Sara

383
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:10,610
When buying cabbage

384
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,150
I'm just happy

385
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,360
Because after meeting you, I have a dream

386
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,780
It's just having dinner with our Shan Ya

387
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:28,750
Not the kind you eat in a hurry

388
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,090
It's the kind that cooks soup and fries eggs.

389
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:36,880
You can eat slowly

390
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,640
That kind of dinner is my dream

391
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:45,850
I am happy just thinking about it

392
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:55,280
It's not like you don't have any other thoughts.

393
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,200
Oh yeah

394
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,040
Sorry

395
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,790
I really don't know why I'm always like this

396
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,260
Because you are a good person

397
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,850
I offended you today.

398
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,390
I will help you realize your dream

399
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:35,150
I appreciate the spicy cabbage

400
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,990
Madam and Aunt

401
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,080
That's how we call each other

402
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,290
Between two people who conspired to die

403
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,840
What other name could it be?

404
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,340
Yeonjin, we understand

405
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,640
What we are conspiring is darkness

406
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,680
We know how dark the end is.

407
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,980
Unable to connect...

408
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,020
Yeonjin isn't answering the phone?

409
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,030
Sun Mingwu also did not answer

410
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,320
They won't be together, right?

411
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:27,410
I can't guarantee that Yeonjin will only sleep with you.

412
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:29,870
How the hell do you talk?

413
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,830
What for?

414
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,000
I said that because they couldn't get in touch with me.

415
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,540
No, forget it.

416
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,540
Cui Huiting

417
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,550
If you want to be a bitch, you gotta do it right

418
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,800
This is what makes a wise woman, not a mean woman.

419
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,100
Sometimes you act like a rookie

420
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:53,690
I'm leaving

421
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,230
There is a flight tomorrow

422
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,190
Who

423
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,110
Yeon-jin's daughter

424
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,450
-Ye-lu-What happened to Ye-lu?

425
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,790
Isn't that Yeon-jin's shoe?

426
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:16,080
I bought it when I flew to London

427
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,920
I didn't know Yeonjin had the same one

428
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,380
What happened to the art rate?

429
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,630
Do you know Ye-ryul's birthday?

430
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,420
Ye-ryul's birthday?

431
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:24,670
Did you know?

432
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,550
I don't know the exact day.

433
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,010
When Yanzhen was pregnant with her

434
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,890
I remember her mother picked a date before the Mid-Autumn Festival.

435
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,220
Talking about the life before Mid-Autumn Festival

436
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:33,890
Only then will you have good fortune

437
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,140
Why are you asking this suddenly?

438
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,570
I wonder if she is my daughter.

439
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,400
You are crazy

440
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:49,530
If the sun does not set below the horizon in summer

441
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,740
The night will be as bright as the day. This phenomenon is called white night.

442
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,660
Yes, the night will be bright, right, my listeners?

443
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,170
During this white night, the other hemisphere

444
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:02,550
Have you heard that you have to endure the long polar night?

445
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:05,420
I think it would be painful if the night was too long

446
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:08,760
The opposite of white night is not black night but polar night.

447
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,220
That is to say, the polar night is extremely long.

448
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:17,350
Was your night in the past week a white night or a polar night?

449
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:22,020
In these difficult times, I hope you all will spend this week wisely.

450
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,190
My name is Park Yeon-jin

451
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,610
Yes, the weather anchor lady

452
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,280
The Queen of Famous Quotes, every word is a pearl

453
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,070
Thank you Park Yeon-jin for supporting Hwang Kwang-hee's "Shine or Go Crazy" today

454
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,330
Let's listen to the ad before continuing.

455
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,580
(Shiming)

456
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:51,090
The ceiling is high here

457
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,600
And there is a skylight for good lighting

458
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,220
It looks more spectacular at night

459
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,770
This is pretty good.

460
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,520
This is a newly built building and is very close to the station.

461
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:05,230
So it's good both during the day and at night.

462
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,610
The yoga room is downstairs and the gym is upstairs

463
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:12,120
I heard that people who come here to exercise often get injured.

464
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,080
It's a good place to open a hospital

465
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,660
What subject do you specialize in?

466
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,910
If it's orthopedics, then you don't even need to see it.

467
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,330
I am a plastic surgeon

468
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:20,710
That's even better!

469
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:24,040
People who come here to exercise also want to have double eyelids.

470
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:27,920
This is pretty good.

471
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,260
Are you really a doctor?

472
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,630
What?

473
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,050
You are so straightforward that you seem like a liar.

474
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:38,890
The face looks so fresh

475
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,810
Oh, really.

476
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:42,850
I usually don't tell others because it sounds like bragging.

477
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,110
But my nickname is Sunkist

478
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:47,730
Because of my appearance, no one believed me when I said I was a doctor.

479
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,740
What's more, he graduated from high school early and is a member of Mensa.

480
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,990
These things cannot even be mentioned

481
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,370
You'd better not speak.

482
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,120
These are the itineraries and some letters for next week.

483
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,210
The documents delivered that day are placed on top.

484
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:04,420
Same-day delivery?

485
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,020
(Sun Mingwu)

486
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:01,140
(Sun Mingwu, Platinum Diamond Golf)

487
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:05,770
The user you dialed has turned off the phone. After the beep sound...

488
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,360
Who's coming?

489
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,650
Long time no see

490
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,700
It’s been about three years, right?

491
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,450
The last time I saw you was at the opening party of your father-in-law's new office building.

492
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,790
Three years

493
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:28,580
You're not here to play golf.

494
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,630
Why are you here? I'm curious.

495
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,970
I can't contact Sun Mingwu

496
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,550
Where is Sun Mingwu now?

497
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,760
Hey, why are you looking for Sun Mingwu too?

498
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,850
I can't contact that guy either.

499
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,600
What do you want from him?

500
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:55,990
Do you smoke?

501
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,070
No smoking

502
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,580
Is there no other way to contact him?

503
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,080
What's the reason?

504
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:06,910
You haven't said yet

505
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,920
I need to talk to him in person.

506
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,670
His address or family members, anything is fine.

507
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,930
Did you receive anything too?

508
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,180
It seems that

509
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:23,510
What did you receive?

510
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,220
How did that bastard threaten you?

511
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,810
What did you receive?

512
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:33,150
We can't communicate like this.

513
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:36,190
How about the person who finds him first and then takes the initiative to contact him?

514
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:39,530
You should be able to find him faster than me, right?

515
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,040
Are you friends?

516
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,080
We are not friends

517
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,710
He's just someone I hired.

518
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:55,050
Then

519
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,760
I'm going to be busy first

520
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:20,740
The user you dialed has turned off his phone. After the beep, the call will be transferred to the voicemail.

521
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,620
You fucking Sun Mingwu you bastard

522
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,330
It turns out I'm not the only one you threatened

523
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,330
But what can you use to threaten Ha Do Young?

524
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,040
Is it a woman or

525
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,340
Girl?

526
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:40,800
If

527
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,510
You tied me and Ha Doyoung together because of Ye-ryul

528
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,060
You're going to die in my hands you fucking bastard

529
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:50,810
Wow, what is this?

530
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:52,980
So beautiful

531
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,770
I really shouldn't continue.

532
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,360
What for?

533
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,120
Did you really win? That's pretty impressive.

534
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,410
-Play a round with me. -Okay.

535
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:09,370
Yes, OK

536
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,040
So cool

537
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:17,420
This is what is called Go

538
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:19,590
Oh, you have to be careful.

539
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:22,010
This needs to be posted online

540
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:30,890
Check the bumper.

541
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,940
Just go to the office and pay and get the key

542
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:35,770
Thank you

543
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,940
Good

544
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,790
I thought about it and found

545
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:56,420
I didn't finish a complete game of chess with you last time.

546
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,710
There are still some points left

547
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,880
Oh my god, what happened? Are you okay?

548
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,500
What's wrong with you?

549
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,250
This lady

550
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,550
Are you okay?

551
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,150
What's wrong with you?

552
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,610
Come in quickly

553
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,330
What happened? Are you feeling unwell?

554
00:38:58,750 --> 00:38:59,580
Come in first

555
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:07,840
The furniture has not yet arrived

556
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,470
Wait a minute, I'll get you some water. Sit here.

557
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:14,060
Where is this place?

558
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:21,940
What happened to you?

559
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,810
Did I contact you at the wrong time?

560
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,610
Have you moved?

561
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:30,990
There is a senior who opened a clinic. I heard that he made a lot of money in Shiming City. So...

562
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,410
I also came here to be a resident doctor, but I quit.

563
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:35,200
I wanted to tell you this cheerfully.

564
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,410
But it’s over now, right?

565
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,870
You want to order?

566
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,920
I have to know the reason if I lose.

567
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,170
I think if I say that you'll come over

568
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,260
You are so smart

569
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,010
You asked me before

570
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,350
Where am I going?

571
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,890
Why do we need to do this?

572
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,980
This is a long story.

573
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,490
There is not a single beautiful moment.

574
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,120
Do you want to listen?

575
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,540
In the polar night and the white night

576
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:23,370
My life has always belonged to the white night

577
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,340
Always bright

578
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:30,010
Of course

579
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,760
Why are you saying this?

580
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,430
Wow

581
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,640
Is Mom going to the party?

582
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,680
Mom is going to work

583
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:43,230
She is going to attend a famous fashion awards ceremony

584
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:45,020
Wow, that's awesome!

585
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:46,560
Right?

586
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:50,150
I also want to become someone like my mother soon

587
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:53,700
Then I can wear a necklace like this

588
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,610
Wearing a skirt like this

589
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,750
Mom, I want to wear this. It looks good.

590
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:06,880
OK

591
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:10,590
Very heavy

592
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:14,720
Expensive jewelry, expensive watches

593
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,550
Expensive bags, expensive cars

594
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,260
Both are heavy

595
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:23,520
Expensive coats, expensive skirts, expensive shoes

596
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:25,730
Very light

597
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,400
Got it?

598
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:28,900
Got it

599
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:32,900
Don't worry about the performance rate

600
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,450
Mom will never fall below the horizon

601
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,160
No matter what happens

602
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,760
(Gene test name: Jeon Jae-joon)

603
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,340
(Probability of parent-child relationship: 99.999%)

604
00:41:57,930 --> 00:41:58,890
No wonder

605
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,640
She is so beautiful

606
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,480
Damn

607
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:20,370
(River Art Rate)

608
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,200
Senior

609
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,540
Hello

610
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:27,920
The person from the information desk just came

611
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,920
Have you found my phone?

612
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,090
It seems that the phone is not very thin.

613
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,340
- Someone said they were coming to deliver this - same day delivery?

614
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:29,770
So now

615
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,690
I'm taking revenge. I'm betting my whole life on it.

616
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:46,540
You don't

617
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:48,830
Want to stop thinking?

618
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,960
Wen Dongen is better than those people.

619
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,000
I don't want to be better than them

620
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,090
I'm getting worse and worse

621
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:02,010
After revenge

622
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,550
Your world will become a ruin

623
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,910
I envy you, senior.

624
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:28,910
You should have had a childhood like a chocolate box

625
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:31,330
When he grew up, he became a righteous and flawless person.

626
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:35,670
You can live comfortably in this world if you only speak reasonable words

627
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,010
Have you seen my scars?

628
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,680
Can it be fixed?

629
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:00,530
How long has this scar been there?

630
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,660
You only saw one arm.

631
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:13,910
Can you already make that kind of expression?

632
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:16,210
What else do you say?

633
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:18,670
Want to stop?

634
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,180
It was like a white night

635
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:19,350
It's like polar night

636
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:28,410
These are

637
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:31,580
Did those people do it?

638
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:35,250
Those bastards did it?

639
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:39,960
I have no dignity. I am a broken ruin.

640
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:42,500
So you better go back

641
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:47,510
I will further my loyalty to anger and evil

642
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:02,020
I do

643
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,070
I'll be the executioner

644
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:11,490
I'll do the sword dance

645
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:15,290
Speak

646
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:17,700
What do you want me to do first?

647
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,120
What do you want me to do?

648
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:24,500
Among those

649
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:28,670
Which one should be killed first?

650
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:35,970
