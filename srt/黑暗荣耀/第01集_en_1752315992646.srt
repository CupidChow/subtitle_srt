(Eden Apartments)

7
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,260
Have you moved in?

8
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,390
How are you doing?

9
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,360
Oh, you finally moved in.

10
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,440
It took a long time

11
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,990
Welcome

12
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:06,280
This flower is called the Devil's Trumpet

13
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,910
The one called the Angel's Trumpet because it is facing down towards the ground

14
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The reason why it is called the devil's trumpet is because it raises its head to the sky.

15
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,540
It's said that in God's eyes that attitude is a bit arrogant

16
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:22,630
Maybe that's why the flower only emits fragrance at night.

17
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:27,600
Ceramic flower pots should be broken before throwing away

18
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,620
Dear Yeon-jin

19
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,250
Do you remember

20
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,710
Did I hate summer?

21
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,760
Luckily I moved before the weather got even hotter.

22
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,930
I started organizing the photos yesterday.

23
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,390
It takes a lot of time to sort out the familiar faces

24
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,020
(Sunshine Unlimited Weather Anchor Park Yeon-jin)

25
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,890
As I watched, I began to imagine

26
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:17,850
One day

27
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:22,320
The moment you open this door

28
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,740
What are these?

29
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,450
Jae-joon, Sarah

30
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,080
The ones in the photo are all us

31
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,420
However

32
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,670
Who are you?

33
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,630
It's me, Yeonjin. It's me.

34
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,840
You really haven't changed at all

35
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,890
Still so rude

36
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:56,390
Take off your shoes when entering someone else's home

37
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,940
This gives me one more reason to kill you.

38
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,910
You should at least recognize me.

39
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,530
Kill me?

40
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,870
Can you kill me like this?

41
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,200
I will

42
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,460
I will do my best to kill you

43
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,130
So please come quickly, Yeonjin

44
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,170
I'm already here

45
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,710
That’s right!

46
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,220
On your way

47
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,050
Do you want me to tell you?

48
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,100
How did I get here?

49
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,310
There is an official report on this case.

50
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,690
So the guardian still has to come and go through the process.

51
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,860
I'll let her go after giving her a warning, so don't worry.

52
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,190
OK, I'll call you back.

53
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,320
(Summer 2004)

00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:50,410
Park Yeon-jin

55
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,580
- Um- Why do you bully your friends?

56
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,410
Don't come here again because of this kind of thing.

57
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,250
Your mom said it's almost time, let's go

58
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,500
She is not my friend

59
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,750
But this uncle

60
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,420
What is your exact relationship with my mother?

61
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,380
We are junior high school classmates

62
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,800
Like my mother's Sun Mingwu

63
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,880
That's why you gave me evidence of my dad's cheating when my mom got divorced.

64
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,180
Collect them all for her.

65
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,390
I thought you slept with my mom.

66
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,110
Let’s go quickly!

67
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,820
There are a lot of takeout orders that haven't been delivered yet. Let's get up and go.

68
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,150
It's so embarrassing that I told you not to come!

69
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,320
They just hugged each other after they reconciled.

70
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,660
Sarah Lee, hurry up

71
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:45,960
Excuse me, what's going on here?

72
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,670
I am Wen Dongen's legal guardian and her class teacher.

73
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,720
You girl

74
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,140
How dare you come to the police station in school uniform?

75
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,060
You call the police just because your friends play a prank on you?

76
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,680
After receiving the call, the vice principal...

77
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,560
I'll tell you later to get up quickly

78
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,150
Teacher, please take me with you.

79
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,900
I'm going to be an orphan for a week

80
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,570
My parents went abroad

81
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,910
-Go play golf. -Is that so?

82
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,990
You should give me a call, kid.

83
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,740
Can this guy come with me too?

84
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,990
Yes

85
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,660
I wonder why you stay here.

86
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,420
Then how do you solve the problem of three meals a day?

87
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,500
-There's a nanny at home? -Is that so?

88
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,640
I told you something important happened today.

89
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,720
You disappoint me so much

90
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,060
I didn't expect this to end up at the police station.

91
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,230
I am disappointed in you because of this

92
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,560
Can't even handle a girl with nothing

93
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,690
And didn’t I tell you to only spend time with Jaejun?

94
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,900
If you are bored, Sarah is also fine.

95
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,700
The wizard said

96
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:01,040
People whose names contain a back nasal sound are considered to be evil spirits and should be avoided, right?

97
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,870
I'm talking about Sun Mingwu, Cui Huiting and others!

98
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,960
Come in, we're late.

99
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,130
(Wen Dongen)

100
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,980
Dong En is coming soon!

101
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,400
Yes, it is Wen Dongen who comes here every day.

102
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,650
Welcome Dongen

103
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,620
I'm sorry I always bullied you during this period.

104
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,700
I want to apologize, can you calm down?

105
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,170
But you won't go to the police station, will you? You scared me.

106
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,460
Speaking of which, Dong En

107
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,800
Start today

108
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,140
Can you help me check the temperature of my hair straightener?

109
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,480
Let me go!

110
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,730
You are committing a crime! Let go!

111
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:53,230
I'm just asking you for a small favor. How is this a crime?

112
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,150
I've apologized, but you still don't give me face

113
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,230
You just need to check if it's hot.

114
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,240
Is it hot? Is it very hot?

115
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,250
It seems hot enough

116
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,960
Let me see

117
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,460
Please, someone help me, I beg you!

118
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,260
Don't waste your energy

119
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,050
No matter how loud you shout, no one will notice

120
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,300
No one will come to rescue you

121
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,600
The PE teacher gave us the key directly.

122
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,820
Why are you doing this to me?

123
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,190
Why on earth do you treat me like this?

124
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,490
I'm tired of hearing this.

125
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,910
Why are you guys asking this?

126
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,290
That's because I can be safe with you.

127
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,750
No matter how much you make a fuss, it will be useless.

128
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,420
Look at yourself

129
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,580
You went to the police station and made such a scene, but you are still here

130
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,670
Anything changed?

131
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,970
Dongen, I mean no one will protect you.

132
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:05,470
Neither the police nor the school nor even your parents will

133
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,970
How do you express this in four words?

134
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,520
Vulnerable groups

135
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,520
I heard you were staying in a hotel.

136
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,320
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't know what a monthly rented apartment is.

137
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,610
Does renting a house by the month mean that the moon will rise in the room?

138
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,740
It's like a fairy tale world

139
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,820
Oh my god, Dong En must be my fairy grandmother.

140
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,990
You would help me check the temperature of the straightener so that I can do my hair, right?

141
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,540
Let go!

142
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,330
Let me go!

143
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,500
-Let me go! -It's so noisy!

144
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,800
-Let me go-Sun Mingwu blocked her mouth

145
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,710
Let go!

146
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,880
Yelling in public is annoying

147
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,240
Hydrogen peroxide?

148
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,290
Just give it to me. I'll do it myself.

149
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,790
There's a stain on the shirt

150
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,120
What stain?

151
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,630
Is it blood?

152
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,090
Just give me hydrogen peroxide.

153
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:33,390
How could this happen? Who did it?

154
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,850
Have you told your class teacher?

155
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,060
I've seen you like this before

156
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,900
If it's not convenient for you to go alone, can I go with you?

157
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,820
Who did it?

158
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,460
Hello? Mom

159
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,300
I'll call you back

160
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,260
I did it

161
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,640
It was me last time too.

162
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,440
Yeonjin, do you know?

163
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:30,870
Your daughter likes to see the world upside down

164
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,370
That's because in the upside-down world

165
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:39,120
Can you be understood by others even if you can't tell the difference between colors?

166
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,840
Your shoes are exactly the same as my mother's

167
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,060
So it's you

168
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:01,270
You are Park Yeon-jin's daughter Ha Ye-ryul

169
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,440
Do you know my mother?

170
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,900
I have never forgotten her for a single day.

171
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:11,490
Some hatred is like longing

172
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,120
Can't get rid of

173
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,280
Hatred?

174
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,450
I don't know what hatred means?

175
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,300
Do you want to know what hatred means?

176
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,330
I'm dying of laughter

177
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,550
What's wrong?

178
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:14,930
Do you want to slip away?

179
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,160
When she's having fun, her eyes get darker.

180
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,410
Why did you take so long?

181
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:41,410
I miss you so much

182
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,500
When you smile, the corners of your mouth rise

183
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,380
Even every strand of hair is so beautiful

184
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,920
Putting it all together

185
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,340
It's hatred

186
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,850
Oh my god, she took off her shoes before coming in.

187
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:01,600
We are really assholes and need to reflect on ourselves

188
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,350
Let me come

189
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,440
Is this yours?

190
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,770
I found it in the rice jar.

191
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,610
I couldn't believe my eyes

192
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,110
Give that back to me

193
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,950
Oops

194
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,360
Is Wen Dongen angry?

195
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,580
Good reception

196
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,990
Quite a lot.

197
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,290
Is this true? So sad

198
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:26,460
Wen Dongen

199
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,960
You are so frugal.

200
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,460
What medicine did you take wrongly, you crazy woman?

201
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,050
Cold syrup or glue?

202
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,300
No! Stop it!

203
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,100
Thanks to Wen Dongen for being rich

204
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,310
-About 200,000 won, right? -Are you treating me today?

205
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:48,230
You are not short of money and you don’t need that money!

206
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,820
Please, please give that back to me, Yeonjin.

207
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,530
This time, Wen Dongen became polite.

208
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,160
Okay

209
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,820
Then I'll give it back to you.

210
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,160
In exchange you can dance while we drink.

211
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,830
How about I not touch the money?

212
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,380
- What? - I asked you to dance

213
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,170
Drinking and having fun can't just be about drinking without singing and dancing, right?

214
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:15,880
What?

215
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,260
Don't want to jump?

216
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,180
If you really don't want to, there are other options.

217
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,310
I found this in your house.

218
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,190
You are in a very bad state now.

219
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,270
If you are showing off your self-esteem at this time

220
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:36,940
It will become even more embarrassing

221
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,490
So you should dance.

222
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,950
It will make you feel ashamed

223
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,870
If you don't want to, forget it.

224
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:53,040
But today I discovered

225
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,710
You have nice legs too.

226
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,980
I'll choose the song

227
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,810
I have a lot of mobile ringtones

229
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,260
(The school doctor has resigned and the infirmary is temporarily unavailable)

230
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,180
Really? When?

231
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,510
I'll call you back

232
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,690
Hello, Wen Dongen has applied to drop out of school.

233
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,270
I heard that she wrote our names in the reason for dropping out of school.

234
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:45,650
Then it was handed directly to the vice-principal's office. So now the head teacher is being criticized by the vice-principal.

235
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,950
Are you a physical education teacher?

236
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:51,820
Did she start with the one she hit the most or did she write it in alphabetical order?

237
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,200
Which one would I be on the list?

238
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,700
Don't you understand how serious this is?

239
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,790
Hello!

241
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:05,960
Come here for a moment

242
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,760
You damn girl

243
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,770
If you want to drop out of school, just do it!

244
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:20,520
Are you not wrong? Not at all?

245
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,770
The fact that things have come to this point shows that you have problems too, damn it!

246
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,730
Come to me right now and rewrite the reason for dropping out!

247
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,080
(Withdrawal Application Form)

248
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,990
If this is submitted directly to the principal

249
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,750
There will be problems with your performance evaluation

250
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,750
I know, okay?

251
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,510
What are you writing?

252
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,100
What reasons did you write for dropping out?

253
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,430
School violence

254
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,060
Park Yeon-jin, Lee Sara, Jeon Jae-joon, Choi Hye-jung, and Son Myeong-oh are the perpetrators

255
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,690
You are a bystander

256
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:09,190
Shut up!

257
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,700
Did anyone break your arm or cripple your leg?

258
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,950
You have all four limbs and can walk around

259
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,620
What about violence?

260
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,660
What about bystanders?

261
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,910
You are mentally ill, you know that?

262
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,660
It's okay to fight between friends

263
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:23,750
Why

264
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,920
Is it okay to hit him?

265
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,590
What?

266
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:32,720
You're bragging everywhere about your son going to a normal university, right?

267
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:38,180
Then you would think it’s okay if your son is beaten by his friends…

268
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,230
You don't want me to be nice to you.

269
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,150
You really want me to be rude to you, right?

270
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,190
Good

271
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,900

What do you want me to say again?

275
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,120
Get up and stop pretending

276
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,040
Hey

277
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:05,000
-Move aside, what did you say? -Teacher Jin

278
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,830
-Get up! What did you say? -Teacher Jin

279
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,380
Okay, stop fighting.

280
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,260
-Teacher Jin-Get out of the way!

281
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,630
- Stop hitting me.

Oh my god

289
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,530
Hello?

Yes

00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:01,510

299
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:19,450

Can I just write my name?

306
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,340
Of course

307
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,880
Just write your name there and re-enter the reason for dropping out.

378
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:59,140

The personal dream displayed on your Saiwo.com homepage is

383
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:19,990
Is it true that you can be a good wife and mother?

384
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,160
Is that true? Did you write it like that?

391
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:45,020
I also have a dream. I want to become a millionaire.

392
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,850
Dong En, I don’t have any dreams.

393
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,360
Dreams are what people like you need

394
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:54,280
For example, you, him and her

395
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:57,280
When you realize your dreams, I will just spend money to order you around.

396

What I need is not a dream but a job

397
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,830
A job you can talk about

398
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,040
Then I will pick a good man when I am young and beautiful.

399
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,790
