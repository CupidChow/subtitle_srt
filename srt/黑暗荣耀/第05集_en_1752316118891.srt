1
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:05,980
Dark Glory

2
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,160
Ouch

3
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,450
Really

4
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,980
What a sunset...

5
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,320
Still so beautiful

6
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,780
Did you buy it with the money you won from me?

7
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,530
I bought this with the money I already had.

8
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:45,790
Do you want to eat?

9
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,380
Do you like other types of gambling?

10
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,170
I once bet my entire life

11
00:02:58,970 --> 00:02:59,800
Did you win?

12
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,220
I was planning to win

13
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,520
Is your home near here?

14
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,730
I've seen you a few times in the chess hall.

15
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,350
Is your home near here?

16
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,770
Not far

17
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:15,900
Is your company near here?

18
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:19,780
Why don't you eat? Don't you eat food from the convenience store?

19
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,200
It's not that this one has a high carbon content.

20
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,540
I haven't learned anything yet, right?

21
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,540
Do you like asking so many questions?

22
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,790
I usually

23
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,920
You may not believe me if I don't like to talk

24
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,300
Why do you like playing Go?

25
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:49,720
I like the feeling of fighting desperately in silence

26
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,560
The other party's carefully constructed territory

27
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,610
I also like that you have to destroy it to win.

28
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,130
How about we play chess together occasionally?

29
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,590
We have come to understand each other's tastes and styles of play

30
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,510
(Ha Dao Ying Zaiping Construction Company)

31
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,470
My name is Ha Do-young

32
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,720
You should bring more money next time.

33
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,020
You don't want to eat this?

34
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,590
Is that your breakfast?

35
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,550
You come here early every morning.

36
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,350
Don't you cook for yourself?

37
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,850
Have you eaten yet?

38
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,400
Do you work at Shiming Primary School?

39
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,940
I saw the sticker on your car.

40
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,400
Your job is good.

41
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,740
Can I ask you a question, too?

42
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,080
Are you also running Shiming Real Estate Agency?

43
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,500
When I first went for consultation

44
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,170
I think I've seen you there.

45
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:40,960
There have been

46
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,010
After living here for a while, I found

47
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:47,180
The price you rented out was much lower than other houses nearby.

48
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,180
Why?

49
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,470
Cheap is a good thing. Why are you still asking this and that?

50
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,270
Teachers' salaries are not much

51
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,520
But you didn't know I was a teacher at that time.

52
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,530
Sorry to ask you this question

53
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,410
However

54
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,580
Is this house haunted?

55
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,620
What?

56
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,710
I thought you were a cold-blooded animal, but I didn't expect you had this side

57
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,750
Very good

58
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,710
Don't throw plastic bags around. Remember to take them with you when you leave.

59
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:37,060
These are the receipts for parking, gas and other expenses this month.

60
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,480
I'm sorry, right? Revenge is expensive.

61
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,530
（Parking fee this month）

62
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,490
(Fuel fee)

63
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:51,410
(Other expenses)

64
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:54,530
I worked as a tutor to save money in my 20s

65
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,330
It's for times like this, don't worry.

66
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,880
After following them for a while, I found that Choi Hui-jung was the easiest to deal with among the five.

67
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,340
She holds her phone in her hand all day long

68
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,510
I wonder if I can just take her phone and have a look.

69
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,520
I seem to have some talent

70
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:19,980
Never mind

71
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,150
(I seem to have some talent)

72
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,780
Can you get it?

73
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,950
Leave this to me

74
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,200
By the way, have you met Park Yeon-jin?

75
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,910
Is everything alright?

76
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:47,840
Should we meet?

77
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,180
Are you not nervous? Are you not scared?

78
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,720
Shouldn't we just crush her hard?

79
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,430
One of the three did it.

80
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,640
That's good

81
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,980
Great job!

82
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,440
I'm still worried

83
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,320
Do you know Park Yeon-jin's mother?

84
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,450
Oops, the picture is a bit blurry

85
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,330
She also went to see the wizard every two weeks this month.

86
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:21,660
I went with that guy again.

87
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,000
I thought they were in love but they were both in their own cars.

88
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,670
When we come, we come individually.

89
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,710
There must be a reason for such regular actions.

90
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,130
Please inform me of any new discoveries.

91
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,010
Then

92
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,930
Have you ever followed this person?

93
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,470
What's the tail?

94
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,520
Don't follow this person

95
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,350
I didn't tell you before because I was worried you would be scared.

96
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,150
This person is a policeman

97
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,940
He used to be the director. His current position should be much higher than that time.

98
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,610
Now he is the security inspector of the Northern Police Department.

99
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,280
My classmates have all been promoted to the position of Prisoner of Public Security.

100
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,660
I heard that he is the only one still struggling

101
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,320
How do you know?

102
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,290
Didn't you see my receipt from the beef bone soup restaurant?

103
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:05,120
I picked four beef bone soup restaurants in front of the Northern Police Station and staked out

104
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,750
The day you threatened me for the first time

105
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,010
I didn't see your true face at all

106
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,720
Hmm?

107
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,600
Don't put yourself in danger

108
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,810
Good

109
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,860
Oh, and please look here.

110
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,530
- Just treat it as part of the job - No I...

111
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,080
What's wrong? Are you okay?

112
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,130
Sorry

113
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,550
I am now quite good at taking photos of flowers and birds

114
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:59,390
But when I pat someone, my palms start to sweat

115
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:07,560
It doesn't matter

116
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,940
Come again

117
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,540
I'll try again

118
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,450
Ouch

119
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,280
This is our first Gucci

120
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,200
Do you like the gift from grandma?

121
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,330
Hmm?

122
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,580
“What does a newborn baby know?

123
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,380
Why buy a brand name if you can’t even wear it for a month?

124
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,130
Right?

125
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:17,960
Hmm?

126
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,760
It's that kind of thinking that makes you live that kind of life

127
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,800
To be different at the finish line, you have to start at the starting line

128
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,970
- Find a new babysitter. - Okay.

129
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,060
The salary will be transferred to you including today's salary and other expenses

130
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,020
Thank you for your hard work

131
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,410
Keep your baby's first piece of clothing safe and bring it to her on important days.

132
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,990
It is intended to encourage her to use all her strength to suckle.

133
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,160
Doyoung was the same when he was a child

134
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,830
Good mom

135
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,420
Oh my god

136
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,000
Art Rate

137
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,960
Call grandma

138
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,920
"Grandma"

139
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,970
Our family will never have that kind of

140
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,220
Things that require her to use all her strength

141
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,160
Hello, Principal

142
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,490
Can I see you for a moment?

143
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,780
For now

144
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,580
Is this Mr. Wen Dongen?

145
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,370
Teacher Wen was recommended by the chairman

146
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,380
Teacher Yang Yujing suddenly resigned and we were in a difficult situation.

147
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,300
Oh wait

148
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:43,380
Do the chairman and Wen Dongen know each other?

149
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:44,800
What's the relationship?

150
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,390
We don't know that either.

151
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,810
So is she not qualified enough but because...

152
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:52,890
No

153
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,480
We have also carefully checked her qualifications.

154
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,020
It's quite rare to transfer from a public school to a private school, so I was a little surprised.

155
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,360
Oh, I see.

156
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,200
Can I see her resume?

157
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,910
Oh this...

158
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,910
These days, people are more sensitive to the leakage of personal information

159
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:14,750
Of course I know this can't be done

160
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:19,000
The principal just needs to hold it in his hand.

161
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,250
I'll take a quick peek

162
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,460
How is it?

163
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,680
Oh, you are wrong

164
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,520
How could you paint it like that?

165
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:01,500
Teacher, the cherry blossom here should be painted pink, right?

166
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,880
I can paint my flowers however I want.

167
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,260
My cherry blossoms are transparent

168
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,300
How can that be possible?

169
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,390
Didn’t Teacher Ha Yi-ryul do something wrong?

170
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,810
Shengya's tulips are painted with full colors, so they are very beautiful

171
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,520
Ye-ryul's cherry blossoms are transparent and beautiful

172
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,940
The teacher thinks both are great.

173
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,670
Let's finish it together, shall we?

174
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,230
Ask a price

175
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,570
Stop pretending.

176
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:09,490
Tell me how much you want

177
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,660
I'll give you as much as you want.

178
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,870
Physical and mental damages

179
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:18,830
I will compensate you for everything

180
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,670
You made a lot of money

181
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,260
Do you want me to write it to you?

182
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:34,090
"I will never appear before your eyes until I die"

183
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,850
Just write this sentence and sign your name.

184
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,390
Like on your withdrawal letter

185
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,730
Your mother signed her name like this

186
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,440
The biggest perpetrators of harm to people like you are your family.

187
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,650
But why do we always have to settle accounts with others?

188
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,950
You are welcome to bid.

189
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,660
You do these

190
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,370
Not to see me

191
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,580
Apologize to you sincerely or something?

192
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,870
We are all approaching 40 years old. It's too much like a fairy tale for Dong En.

193
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,920
These are all old stories

194
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,710
What else can I do now? Is that right?

195
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,470
Of course not to see you apologize

196
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,340
Don't apologize

197
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:18,350
How could I risk my entire life from my teens to my 30s just to see you apologize?

198
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,930
I'm going to punish you

199
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,020
If God helps you, you will be punished.

200
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,270
If God helps me, you will be punished.

201
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,560
God?

202
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,900
Oh, we are not talking about fairy tales but scriptures?

203
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:31,940
What God?

204
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,150
Who is this person?

205
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,660
You hold someone else's child hostage

206
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,080
What else?

207
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:40,790
God will help you?

208
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,910
Hostages?

209
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,960
Me?

210
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,420
What did I do?

211
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,420
Did I pinch Ye-su's neck or punch her in the chest?

212
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,970
I didn't slap her.

213
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,380
No hot objects were used to burn her body.

214
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,430
What did I do to Ye-ryul?

215
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,770
Someone can't understand why there are seven colors in the rainbow

216
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,490
The process of fruit ripening cannot be detected

217
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:14,700
She lives in this world

218
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,160
But I still encouraged her.

219
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,410
Because in my classroom, color doesn't matter.

220
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,040
But this situation

221
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,120
It's just a little disadvantageous to you

222
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:28,170
You…

223
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,380
How do you know?

224
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,920
I don't know how to take the art rate

225
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,550
I have many choices besides her.

226
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,850
For example, parent talk

227
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,020
But parents talk

228
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,350
You know you can't just talk to moms.

229
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:58,740
So don't try anymore.

230
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,530
How far will I go?

231
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,330
How far will you be pushed?

232
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:11,380
The longer this moment of your gradual withering lasts, the better

233
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:16,970
Let's slowly wither and die together, Yeonjin

234
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,800
I'm in a very good mood now

235
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,190
They are

236
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,400
What's going on?

237
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:41,700
Hi Samsung Xiaobei

238
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,910
Call the pup

239
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:48,330
Calling the puppy's phone number

240
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,540
(Dog cub)

241
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,250
The user you dialed has turned off his phone. After the beep, the call will be transferred to the voicemail.

242
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,960
And start billing

243
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,670
Do you really not want to live anymore?

244
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,850
Someone from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions just sent this here

245
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:08,810
- Send it here? - Yes

246
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,310
Send it to this street?

247
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,060
Is it the Avengers?

248
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,620
(River Art Rate)

249
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,490
What is this?

250
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,330
(River Art Rate)

251
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:36,920
Our secretary's office is not doing a good job.

252
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,010
No outsiders are allowed to enter here

253
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:40,920
Did you make a lot of money today?

254
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:47,640
I like you better in work clothes than in suits.

255
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:49,640
Look sexier

256
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,190
Now both Zegna and Versace are going bankrupt

257
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,900
Husband, why don’t we just send Ye-ryul to study abroad?

258
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,740
What does it mean?

259
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,950
Ye-ryul is only 8 years old now

260
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,830
There are many professional guardian services now.

261
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,620
Many families also send their children abroad early.

262
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,540
What happened to you suddenly?

263
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,170
Do you want to go abroad yourself?

264
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,550
No

265
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,010
Otherwise it's even weirder

266
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:26,390
You need the driver and the babysitter to take her to school even if it's only a 15-minute walk away.

267
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,390
Are you willing to send her abroad?

268
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:32,020
Honey, have you played golf with Chairman Kim Shin-tae a few times recently?

269
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,940
Can you arrange a meeting between me and the chairman?

270
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,860
Nothing else but the head teacher of Ye-ryul's class changed.

271
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,360
She's crazy

272
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,950
How crazy?

273
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,030
Crazy enough that you have to talk to the chairman?

274
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,990
Can you tell me in detail how I should arrange it when I have no idea?

275
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,450
It's okay, don't worry about it

276
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,000
I'm a little tired now, so I'm a little emotional

277
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,790
I'm going to my mom's house on the way to work and I'll call you later.

278
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,480
Financial relationships, relationships between men and women, and family relationships must all be checked

279
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,810
Friends, colleagues, and distant relatives all need

280
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:18,940
Anything is fine. Please help me check it.

281
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:20,520
Strike

282
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,190
Your mom broke 90 yesterday

283
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,570
(CV)

284
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,150
Who is Wen Dongen?

285
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,610
(Jaejun)

286
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,910
So I asked you to help me find out who she is.

287
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,660
What I knew before has no meaning anymore

288
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,770
Vitamin effervescent tablets?

289
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,980
Yeah

290
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,900
Put the vitamin effervescent tablet into the water

291
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,990
Won't it create bubbles?

292
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,200
Listening to the bubbling sound, my heart will calm down

293
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,410
Why does that sound make you feel calm?

294
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:18,370
It's a bit like the sound of a ginkgo tree being blown by the wind.

295
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,290
It's a bit like the sound of raindrops falling on a chessboard.

296
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,550
So I feel lonely when I listen to it.

297
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:30,970
Probably like this

298
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:35,310
Your body is healthier but your heart is lonelier

299
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,310
Try changing your surroundings

300
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:41,480
Such as moving or traveling

301
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,900
I'll think about it

302
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,820
I'm going to see the patient too.

303
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,320
You seem to be a good doctor.

304
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,030
You were not always on time when you came to consult me.

305
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:53,410
You charge by the hour, so my lateness is a good thing for you.

306
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,540
You need a CT scan to know this.

307
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,000
But if it's this hard, it's probably a bone tumor.

308
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,630
Is it necessary to have surgery even if there is no pain?

309
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,420
Although there are no symptoms now

310
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,510
But there is still a possibility of pain in the future

311
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,470
How long will the hospital stay be for surgery?

312
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,100
I am a primary school teacher so I want to do it during the holidays

313
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:22,190
Preoperative examination and surgery take a week in total

314
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,480
-Are you a teacher? -Yes

315
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,690
Which school are you in? How is school life?

316
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,820
I saw a video blog where the teacher was going to eat with the students.

317
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,530
So I can't eat well.

318
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,870
How are the students? Do they listen to the teacher?

319
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,960
Are you a parent?

320
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,120
Oh

321
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:43,380
It's not the students that I care about.

322
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,790
I am curious about the life of a teacher.

323
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:47,130
What?

324
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:22,160
(Shanghai)

325
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,850
Have you lost weight?

326
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,610
Yeah a little bit

327
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:50,320
Didn't I tell you to keep the same weight as me?

328
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,530
Otherwise the effect will be different when worn!

329
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,150
I can't give you a high performance score.

330
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,360
Sorry

331
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,290
The one who really retired, next one

332
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:01,240
Good senior

333
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,500
Return to your original weight before your next flight

334
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:10,750
Your weight needs to change...

335
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,130
What the fuck?

336
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,170
What happened to the cell phone?

337
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,840
Did it get confused with a foreign passenger's phone?

338
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,100
How do I know?

339
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:22,810
Call Incheon Airport and ask if anyone has found any lost items.

340
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:23,730
Good

341
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,060
It's driving me crazy!

342
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:34,900
Really?

343
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,580
These are easy

344
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:47,620
What else do you need? Just ask

345
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,090
Thank you for your hard work. See you next time.

346
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:54,380
Oh my god wait a minute

347
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:57,130
You are so cold-hearted every time.

348
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:01,100
Let's eat something first

349
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,810
I guess we'll see each other outside today.

350
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,430
Last time I was outside, I felt pretty good, like I was on a picnic.

351
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,020
This is

352
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:12,940
With hidden meaning

353
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:16,400
"The bird is trying to break free from its eggshell

354
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:19,200
The egg is the world

355
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,660
From "Lai Mei'an"

356
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,660
I have seen Shan Ya read this book

357
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,620
The bird couldn't break free from its shell

358
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,750
Because you cooked it.

359
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,500
The book about Lai Mei'an's apartment is called "Demian"

360
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:37,510
This is baked, not boiled.

361
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:40,890
Can't a vengeful woman be romantic?

362
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,850
Ouch, I hit the bruise.

363
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:52,730
I'm going to get bruises again. Oh my god.

364
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,400
"Dear Brother

365
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:01,280
Don't seek justice yourself, rather give in and let God wrath take its course

366
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,700
For it is written: The Lord says

367
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:05,990
'Vengeance is mine, I will repay'"

368
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,450
Amen

369
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,910
Let us remember the famous words in Romans 12:19

370
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,080
Let's pray together.

371
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:13,000
Good start

372
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,510
Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you from the bottom of our hearts

373
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,840
The Lord always embraces us with love despite our many shortcomings

374
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:24,550
Thank you again for the blessings God has bestowed upon us.

375
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:29,480
The Lord always tells us to love our enemies

376
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,940
But our love and care for our enemies

377
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,360
How deep is it?

378
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:38,990
We failed to live according to the Lord's teachings and instead harbored hatred and resentment toward our enemies.

379
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,320
May the Lord forgive us

380
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,410
What is the business of this humble person in such a distinguished place?

381
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,670
Sarah, I'm really curious.

382
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,420
Do you really believe in the existence of God?

383
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,340
Really?

384
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,300
You are blaspheming

385
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,550
Repent or you will be punished by God

386
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,970
- Really? - Yeah

387
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,480
Yeah

388
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,900
I just made a deal with God when I prayed

389
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,110
He said it's okay

390
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:23,990
Are you going to cross the line, crazy woman?

391
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,780
Do you think that all beings are equal when we grow up?

392
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,160
You're in big trouble now, Sarah.

393
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,580
“All beings are equal” comes from Buddhism

394
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,290
Wait a minute

395
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:40,050
Oops

396
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,010
Your master is furious

397
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,060
He said you're going to hell

398
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,770
Hello!

399
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,690
Are you crazy? Are you on drugs?

400
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:55,020
You are the one who takes drugs

401
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:56,900
There are many types of suction

402
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,570
More frequency

403
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,860
What the hell is this bitch doing?

404
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,660
Give you half a month

405
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,370
Fill it with cash and wait for my call. I need US dollars.

406
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:11,290
Hello

407
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,620
You are blackmailing a bitch

408
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,080
Do you know how many police officers attend our church?

409
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,790
It seems you haven't been coerced.

410
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,010
Hey, let go!

411
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,430
Damn it!

412
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:33,980
I haven't started to threaten you yet.

413
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:35,730
Sarah

414
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,030
Turn left at the intersection of Shida Park

415
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:53,370
(Shida Park)

416
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,160
(Senior Ruzheng)

417
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,370
Do you have my number saved?

418
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:34,490
If you haven't already, this is my number.

419
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,000
I am Zhou Ruzheng

420
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,800
It's going to be hot today. Are you doing well?

421
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:52,100
It will snow heavily today

422
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,220
Be careful not to fall, walk slowly one step at a time.

423
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,100
Take care

424
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:58,690
Did you see the sky today? It's sunny.

425
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,520
Pay attention to your health and don't get sick

426
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,660
(Cialis)

427
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:25,040
(Recipient: Joo Yeo-jeong, Seoul Joo Hospital)

428
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:27,590
(Sender: Kang Young-cheon, Cheongsong County, North Gyeongsong)

429
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,890
Zhou Ruzheng, you sent me a text message

430
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,560
(Dong! En! Younger!)

431
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,320
Oh my god! My phone must be broken!

432
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,400
It’s impossible to reply to text messages sent seven or eight years ago now, right?

433
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:52,280
Although I recently encountered

434
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,530
But she will suddenly reply my text message?

435
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:55,580
Was I a little bit handsome that day?

436
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:58,580
Oh yeah

437
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,950
Yes, a little bit

438
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,790
Is Dongen married or single?

439
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,380
Why are you reading my text messages? Damn it.

440
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:07,920
What? What did she say?

441
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,630
It's not an invitation, is it?

442
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,050
Is she getting married? To whom?

443
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,470
Oh, divorce for sure.

444
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,100
Is she going to remarry?

445
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,010
Are you going to remarry?

446
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:19,890
She asked what Cialis was

447
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,100
What is this medicine?

448
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,310
(Dong! En! Younger!)

449
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,320
Let's meet and talk. Where are you now?

450
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,110
Are you crazy? The professor will be here soon.

451
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,740
Oh, not now. Where will you be after 7 o'clock?

452
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:07,730
I hope you're not busy then.

453
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,520
I became quite busy after receiving the text message

454
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,030
Busy shift

455
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,080
Did you play chess again later?

456
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:22,910
Sometimes I win some money

457
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,080
Are you still in Seoul?

458
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:29,750
Or in Shiming City?

459
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,550
How do you know?

460
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:35,880
Last time you said you hadn't moved to Shiming City yet

461
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,100
Looks like you moved there.

462
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,560
I work at Shiming Primary School

463
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:50,110
Is the patient familiar to you?

464
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,070
Medicine Box Owner

465
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,650
Not yet

466
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:55,110
Not yet

467
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,240
I'll tell you once so listen carefully

468
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:05,290
Cialis is a drug with tadalafil as its main ingredient

469
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:06,370
Long-lasting effect

470
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:08,120
So what?

471
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:09,460
So it will be okay

472
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,050
Similar products include Viagra

473
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,090
I know that

474
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:18,380
Will this medicine be used for other purposes besides those?

475
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,930
What do you mean by those and other uses?

476
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:25,310
I mean there could be other situations.

477
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:29,400
It is said that some people take this medicine to treat altitude sickness.

478
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,610
But from the perspective of formal medicine

479
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:34,400
It is a drug used to treat erectile dysfunction

480
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:38,320
Does that person live in Shiming City?

481
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,030
That's not what we're talking about now.

482
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,620
Find someone who doesn't need to take medicine.

483
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:43,870
As a doctor, I am somewhat concerned about him.

484
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:45,700
But from a man's perspective

485
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:46,950
He makes me a little upset

486
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,500
It's not like that

487
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,840
It's been a while since I've seen you become so bossy.

488
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,840
When the situation is not favorable to you, you should change your tone

489
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,220
The medicine box

490
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,640
It's just an excuse. You can see it clearly.

491
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:13,940
I can see it

492
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,570
Because you can find out what Cialis is by searching online.

493
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,110
However

494
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,370
I don't know why you make excuses.

495
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,280
So I'm a little excited

496
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:28,830
Then I thought

497
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,460
“I don’t know if this man has any other diseases.

498
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:34,250
I really hope there is nothing normal about him from head to toe."

499
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,550
That's what I think

500
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,770
I want to apologize to you

501
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:51,850
Apologize?

502
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,980
I don't know what happened to you during that period.

503
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,360
But I was

504
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:00,860
I am really sorry for you.

505
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:05,370
If I hurt you, I apologize.

506
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:17,920
However

507
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:20,380
How do you feel about apologizing like this?

508
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,880
Like saying goodbye?

509
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,770
I got it right.

510
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,190
You want me to stop texting you?

511
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,070
Why do you do this?

512
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,200
You don't reply to messages anyway.

513
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,700
Am I that bad?

514
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:47,490
Yeah, that's bad.

515
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,790
You're not my type

516
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:51,500
How is it possible?

517
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,460
No matter what

518
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:05,090
Although I really don't understand why you do this

519
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,090
But you can do whatever you want

520
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,810
Do whatever you want

521
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,390
Also, fall in love with me

522
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,270
I will make you happy

523
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,650
I said those moments

524
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:26,200
For example, if you like someone

525
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:28,450
Those moments when it’s okay to like someone

526
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,290
If those moments add up to life

527
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:34,790
Then when I am truly alive

528
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,830
How many days are there in total, Yanzhen?

529
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,420
You really are

530
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,760
What are you laughing at?

531
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:47,760
Maybe I felt happy just now

532
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,060
But senior

533
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,150
I don't need a prince

534
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,860
I don't need a prince

535
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,240
But someone who can be with me

536
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,870
Sword Dance Executioner

537
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:28,050
What? It's nonsense to say that you can pass out within 8 seconds.

538
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:31,510
-Sun Mingwu hit her chest to try-Huh?

539
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,100
It is said that you need to hit hard all at once to make someone faint

540
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,640
If she doesn't faint, it will prove how soft Sun Mingwu's fist is.

541
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,810
Hello

542
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:39,150
Do you know who broke the record of the Jongno-gu Dragon Boxing Machine?

543
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:41,480
That's me

544
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,280
Dong En, if you feel pain, I will pray for you.

545
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:47,860
Look here

546
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:50,570
Wen Dongen, stand up straight

547
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,080
If you miss, it will hit your breasts.

548
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,100
Talking about such an important matter

549
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:25,900
You found a tteokbokki restaurant and haven't ordered yet

550
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:28,490
(Everyone is mortal)

551
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:29,650
This side

552
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,530
Order a rice cake, fried vegetables and rice sausage set

553
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:32,450
Okay

554
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,580
Do you want to eat rice sausage?

555
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,450
You don't cover your tattoos anymore?

556
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,370
Tattoo?

557
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,120
Oh, the neck

558
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,750
Now no one talks about it

559
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:45,250
Remember our second foreign language is Spanish?

560
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,840
I used to hate Spanish

561
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,470
But

562
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,260
Because of your tattoo, I fell in love with Spanish again

563
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,470
Oh my god

564
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:55,930
I didn't expect you to be so ignorant

565
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:58,850
This is not Spanish, it's Latin

566
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:02,690
“Don’t forget that you are mortal”

567
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:03,600
But

568
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,770
You didn't cover it completely with the plaster.

569
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,320
The exposed part has a different meaning in Spanish

570
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:09,780
What does it mean?

571
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:18,370
I eat rice sausage

572
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:21,330
Have you been to the hospital?

573
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:22,960
Yeah

574
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:29,840
Hey, you really hit the bull's eye.

575
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:33,470
Yoon So-hee's body is really there

576
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:37,430
How much money does this cost?

577
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:38,760
So who is it?

578
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,930
How much money you can ask for depends on who the person is.

579
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:43,640
What happens after I tell you?

580
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:44,850
Just tell me who it is

581
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,480
The rest is easy to handle

582
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,280
I would bark at him all day long

583
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,190
He couldn't eat or sleep.

584
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,320
He was half dead.

585
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,450
Bring it to you again

586
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,620
First of all, it wasn't me.

587
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,420
Is it one of these four people?

588
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:06,880
Sarah Lee?

589
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,880
Dry after getting high?

590
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:10,960
Park Yeon-jin?

591
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:13,880
She is the most terrifying one among them

592
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:15,630
Cui Huiting

593
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:19,680
If Suxi was the one who spread the story about the PE teacher and Huiting, then it was Huiting.

594
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,100
Jeon Jae-joon?

595
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,480
If Suxi had said anything about his eyes, it was this kid

596
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,610
We are on the same side now

597
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:31,070
Who among the four people killed Yoon So-hee?

598
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:47,420
Wen Dongen asked you for money? How much did she want?

599
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,330
Don't know

600
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,460
She threw me a suitcase and told me to fill it with cash.

601
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,630
Damn, that bag is so big!

602
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,130
Why don't you answer my call?

603
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,380
When did you call?

604
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:57,340
I'm not talking about you

605
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:58,510
I'm talking about you, but

606
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:00,430
Did she really not come to see you?

607
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:02,180
Her purpose is not money

608
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,310
I mentioned the money to her a while ago, but she looked disdainful.

609
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:08,600
Why can't I contact Mingwu? Was he fired?

610
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:10,310
The guy who was fired definitely doesn't know either.

611
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,360
Because he didn't answer my calls

612
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,780
She doesn't answer my calls either.

613
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:13,860
Do you remember

614
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,650
Something about our high school days? More specific?

615
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:17,780
How is Yilu doing?

616
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:19,660
Who will take care of her while you are here?

617
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,490
What have we done to Wen Dongen?

618
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:24,290
Is it too much?

619
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:26,160
Did she really not throw the luggage bag to you?

620
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:29,000
She watched a lot of movies, damn.

621
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:31,590
Her crazy wife also asked me to take US dollars. Damn it.

622
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:33,550
By the way, Ye-ryul should be in elementary school now

623
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:35,590
Which school? Shiming Primary School?

624
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:37,260
If she wants to retaliate against us in the same way

625
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:39,760
What would she want to do?

626
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,390
As an uncle, I have never bought her a school bag.

627
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:43,560
What is the art rate?

628
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:58,280
(Don’t forget that you will die one day)

629
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,040
Where are you going? One way or round trip?

630
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,870
Wow, this is the scene I have always longed for.

631
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:13,090
Finally, there is such a day in my life.

632
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,220
One way to Vladivostok

633
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,810
I've been thinking about you all day today

634
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,140
Let's meet

635
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:29,600
Get lost

636
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:32,190
We two meet? Why?

637
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:35,150
I'm curious why you want to see me

638
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:37,320
Who? Sun Mingwu?

639
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,490
Where the hell is your mother now?

640
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:41,700
Where's Yeon-jin? Did you make a date with her?

641
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:04,300
"Me"

642
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:07,260
I

643
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:12,980
"Mori"

644
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:18,610
Dead

645
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:24,150
