00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,790

(Sarah Lee)

(Finally finished)

(What should I wear to the beach tomorrow?)

10
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:41,930
What are you looking at?

11
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,480
Can intravenous drips help them draw better?

12
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,600
It will make them listen to me more obediently.

13
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,070
500 g

14
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:54,480
Save some money

15
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,030
Thank you for giving me food today

16
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,330
How can you, a thief, have 500 grams?

17
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,250
How dare you steal my inspiration?

18
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,580
How can you, a drug addict, pretend to be an artist?

19
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,790
By sticking that thing in your hair you can draw something like...Mona Lisa?

20
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,920
The only one you know is the Mona Lisa, right? Because you saw it when you wiped your butt.

21
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,800
I'm letting you go because I feel sorry for you, so stop talking bullshit and get out of here

22
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,100
Damn the bitch

23

(Noon nap)

26
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,590
Do you need anything?

27
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,930
Can you sing me a lullaby? I can't sleep.

28
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,890
Do you need a warm towel?

29
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,260
Are there any other warm services?

30
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,230
Stop talking nonsense and go to sleep

31
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,360
Dear passengers, any incidents that may affect flight safety…

32
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,280
I'm so tired, can you give me a ride?

33
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,370
(Recipient: Jae-jun)

34
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,390
You buy a bottle of energy drink and take the airport bus. I have something to do.

35
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,560
Let me try this one

36
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,850
Sorry

37
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,610
The fitting room suddenly leaked and could not be used

38
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,780
As compensation, I'll give you a 10% discount.

39
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,280
No need to try this one on, it will suit you

40
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:08,490
(We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you during the repairs)

41
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:43,700
Do you know why I named this boutique Noon Sleep?

42
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,490
Because you like to have sex with me during the day

43
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,710
That's right.

44
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,420
Because you are going to meet another woman at night?

45
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,890
Are the wedding preparations going smoothly?

46
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,600
Why are you asking if you are not curious about that at all?

47
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,060
This makes me look considerate.

48
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:16,600
Nonsense

49
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,190
If you want to get married someday, just tell me.

50
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,490
I won't share the cake with other women

51
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,620

54
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,750
(Thank you for the beautiful view outside the hotel window)

55
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,460
(Which wedding dress should I choose? It’s so hard to choose)

56
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,260
(There are a lot of things to prepare but I am so happy)

57
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,080
(Rand Travel Agency)

58
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,590
-Is the work interesting? -It is very interesting

59
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:26,130
The branch manager here likes you very much

60
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,260
Since I asked you to do after-school tutoring

61
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,680
Their daughter first put on light makeup

62
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:37,980
OK

63
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,980
Recently, they have all started to switch to IG

64
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,110
The bitch Cui Huiting has been replaced

65
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,610
No longer using Facebook?

66
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,110
Don't be discouraged

67
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,780
How can revenge be so easy?

68
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,330
If they all switch to us, we can use this

69
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,910
Login information is the same as Facebook account and password

70
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,750
I didn't expect there would be so many things I needed to learn

71
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,000
You really are

72
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,170
So I say, it's not too late to change your mind now.

73
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,880
Revenge is supposed to be vicious

74
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,930
I know some gangster brothers

75
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,350
We grew up in the same nursery.

76
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,390
Will your brothers help you kill people?

77
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,230
Murder?

78
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,070
Unfortunately, my purpose is not to kill people.

79
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,360
I have come this far and I cannot let this go.

80
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,160
So even if it's a little slow, I'll take it step by step.

81
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,330
Also

82
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,750
Fortunately, we have already completed half of the journey

83
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,460
There was a report today saying that that bitch Park Yeon-jin is getting married. Did you see it?

84
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,170
Yeah

85
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,220
Actually, I just guessed

86
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,100
So I felt very lucky after seeing the news.

87
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,730
Chengxi, do you know what are the benefits of not having religious beliefs?

88
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,610
Your destination is already determined

89
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,280
Hell

90
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,330
No matter I am a good person or a bad person in this life

91
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,000
If the final destination is hell

92
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:32,970
I'm going to be more straightforward

93
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,180
(Go story and actual Go game)

94
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:51,280
Yeonjin, I hope you still want to see me dance

95
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,070
Of course the dance I'm doing is a bloody sword dance.

96
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,380
(From: Park Seung-hoon's mom, can you also tutor me in math?)

97
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,220
Let's derive the root-finding formula

98
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:20,680
In the derivation process, we will use the perfect square method to solve the quadratic equation

99
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,430
ax square plus

100
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,520
-bx plus c equals -teacher

101
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,810
Where did you buy that dress?

102
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:30,570
On the Internet

103
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,650
- Where did you hear that? - It's beautiful.

104
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,200
Where did you hear that?

105
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,450
-You have a mock exam next week. -I think it will look better without it.

106
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,830
If you show me your breasts, I will really do well in the exam this time.

107
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:48,040
You will earn more if my grades rank higher.

108
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,880
Thanks to you, Yeonjin

109
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,380
This situation is not enough to surprise me

110
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,920
How do you see me?

111
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,890
-Today is the last time I will teach you.-Why?

112
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:03,390
Because I have my own way to make more money

113
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:06,560
And you kid, whether your grades improve or decline

114
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,310
In the end, you will wear clothes provided by the government

115
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,270
I mean prison uniforms.

116
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,610
Are you crazy?

117
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,230
If my mom knew, you'd be screwed.

118
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,190
Your mother knows

119
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,570
She has been listening to our class since the first lesson.

120
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,990
Mother Chengxun, do you know that this can be recorded?

121
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,740
If you want to silence me, just use money.

122
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,660
Too speechless, damn

123
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,420
You said you wanted to be a teacher

124
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,630
Can I rely on you to do this?

125
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,630
Is it not okay if you are not clear?

126
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,670
Good luck on your exams

127
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,670
Fortunately, he was sent in quickly after getting into a dispute nearby.

128
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,300
Anyway, this kid shouldn't be given a holiday.

129
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,880
Recently, the TV is always showing that perverted thing

130
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,090
Because the verdict is out.

131
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,010
Really?

132
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,890
I can't cut off his power supply. I really can't do anything about him.

133
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,890
10% glucose plus vitamin B and vitamin C, give it to him

134
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,730
-By the way, the vice president... -I know

135
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:46,080
Family members of Ward 62 patient Kim Min-jong

136
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,410
Please come to the ward.

137
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:51,660
Family members of Ward 62 patient Kim Min-jong

138
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,040
Please come to the ward.

139
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,290
Sincerely wish you a happy wedding, Yanzhen

140
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,500
I'm sorry I didn't prepare any gifts.

141
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,680
But in life, besides weddings

142
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,340
There will be other weddings and funerals.

143
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,430
“Although fog and clouds are both water vapor

144
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,600
But the names are different depending on the height at which it is formed.

145
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:59,440
If it is close to the sky based on the ground, it is called a cloud.

146
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:03,150
If it is close to the ground, it is called fog.

147
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,700
What's wrong? Is there a typo?

148
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,370
No

149
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,120
I think you wrote it well, so I read it a second time.

150
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:18,750
But you guys

151
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,920
Why do you always get scared in advance?

152
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,300
Seulgi

153
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:32,430
You know that other weather anchors say bad things about me, right?

154
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,100
I can't even write my own script, so how can I be a weather anchor?

155
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,350
What?

156
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,060
Don't give me that look. You know it all.

157
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,480
I don't write it myself because

158
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,490
As long as you are paid, you can get such manuscripts

159
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,280
But if I write it myself, it will be terrible.

160
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:51,990
Do you have a passport?

161
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,950
- No - Go get one.

162
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,870
Tell me when you have decided which country you want to visit during this vacation

163
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,710
The manuscript is well written

164
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,750
Really?

165
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,630
Thank you

166
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,510
I'll search it now.

167
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:19,980
I spend a little money

168
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,480
But he became her God

169
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:31,120
"When driving in the morning or at night when fog is likely to form

Turn on the double flashing lights and drive slowly and carefully.

171
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,880
Damn it

172
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:58,430
This puppy doesn't poop when I take it for a walk

173
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,900
I have to wait until I get home to pull it

174

It's not a puppy, it's called Louie

175

Louis XI

176
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,610
Louis is 11 years old this year. He is old, so he is like that.

177
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,360
But how can you, a young bastard, be like that?

178
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,120
What's wrong with me? What?

179
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,120
Do you touch that stuff too?

180
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,370
What the hell?

181
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,380
Drugs

182
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:33,550
Sarah Lee said you always embezzle her goods

183
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,890
I'm not embezzling

184
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,980
I was worried about Sarah so I gave her a taste first.

185
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:42,900
Hello

186
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,480
Hello

187
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,280
Is the purpose of giving you work to play?

188
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,570
I'm just playing with you and you think we're still friends.

189
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,370
I have a lot to inherit.

190
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:06,250
But what if you drive under the influence of drugs and cause me to die early?

191
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,300
Do you think I am wronged? Answer me

192
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,470
I told you to answer the damn

193
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:25,560
Not this one.

194
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,290
Sorry

195
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,510
Wait a minute

196
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,060
Wait a minute

197
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,100
Patient in Ward 41…

198
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,020
Ah, what?

199
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,940
I know I look a bit like that

200
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,070
But I'm an intern here.

201
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,860
I'm taking a day off today

202
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,200
Wait a minute

203
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,250
Press and hold for about 5 minutes

204
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,150
Where did the patients here go?

205
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,980
She seems to be gone

206
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,110
I'm fine now

207
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,490
She just passed away even though her hematocrit level was so high?

208
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:40,280
I am a patient too, okay?

209
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,910
I was just sent in. Look.

210
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,370
I think you deserve a beating

211
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,910
Go to sleep and don't move.

212
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,130
She left before she even finished the infusion?

213
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,090
What's wrong? Show me

214
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,380
(Anemia test)

215
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:00,880
“Malnutrition?”

216
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,890
Okay, so before we go to class,

217
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,310
I would like to ask

218
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,560
The handsome guy sitting in the back

219
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,570
Who are you?

220
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,820
I think you are not a student of my class.

221
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,110
Hello, Professor.

222
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:21,530
Your classes are well-known for their excellence

223
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:22,660
So I came here to eavesdrop

224
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,330
- If you allow it, there will be no such thing

225
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,620
Who is so outstanding? Who are you looking for?

226
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:31,920
That is definitely your respect for me and you. I love you.

227
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,590
Oh, what should I do?

228
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,170
I'm already a married man, please get out

229
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,760
Oh, I didn't know you were married.

230
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,140
Then I'm leaving

231
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:47,100
Who is it that surrenders? Who is so outstanding?

232
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,200
Senior

233
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,920
You didn't reply to my message, so I thought you were not in school.

234
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,210
I'm just taking a class and need to make up credits.

235
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,050
Are you here at school for something?

236
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,710
I'm here to treat the younger members of the club to a meal.

237
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,130
Have you had lunch yet? If not, let's go eat together

238
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,550
Can you drink alcohol?

239
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,320
Fortunately, you look pretty good today.

240
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,660
How do you know which school I go to?

241
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,410
Oh, when the nurse is looking for your family's contact information

242
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,460
I saw your student ID so I know

243
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,170
Then I went to your classroom because

244
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,710
Your blood test results are seriously abnormal

245
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,510
But you left without even taking the prescription, so I went to give you the prescription.

246
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,970
I see you don't understand your situation

247
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,890
At your current level, you will need to take anemia medication for at least 6 months.

248
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,890
The last prescription I brought to your school was expired.

249
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,690
You must check again

250
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,600
You must take medicine

251
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,990
Do you like playing Go?

252
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,450
Can you?

253
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:29,620
Hey, I'm awesome.

254
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,410
How long does it take to learn Go?

255
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,540
To defeat the master?

256
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:40,460
Who do you want to beat? Lee Sedol?

257
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,170
Who is Lee Sedol?

258
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,260
I think you need one-on-one counseling.

259
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,560
Do you want me to give you Go tutoring?

260
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:02,110
Is it okay to come later? I am also a tutor

261
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,900
（Shida Coffee House）

262
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,110
Class of 2006?

263
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:12,280
I don't look like one, right? Everyone thinks I don't look like a 2006 student.

264
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:13,910
This

265
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,250
It sounds a bit boastful so I usually don't say it.

266
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:19,040
Actually, I was born in 1989.

267
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,880
But when I was young, I was a bit of a genius, so I skipped a grade.

268
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,840
How about using senior or junior as the address?

269
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,890
So you like that kind of name?

270
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,890
Is it me who catches the black man? Because this is the first time

271
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:40,520
It seems that you know what the upper and lower hands are.

272
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,940
You go down

273
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,120
Wow

274
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,330
Good

275
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,670
To define Go in one sentence is

276
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,550
Rivals compete to see who occupies more territory

277
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:09,050
So start from the corner to the center

278
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,300
While circling your own territory

279
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,300
Also want to destroy the other party's territory

280
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,180
To be fierce in silence

281
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:20,230
Gradually approaching

282
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,940
I like

283
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,040
Although I am not studying Korean medicine

284
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,250
However, Qingxinhuan is the most effective food for taking the national exam.

285
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,500
I found out that the exam is next week. I hope you can pass it this time.

286
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:46,060
Thank you for giving me guidance during this period

287
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,020
You must be a good doctor

288
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,190
Will we never see each other again?

289
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,780
Why?

290
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,360
You still need coaching. You haven't beaten me yet.

291
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:01,500
You're not the one I want to defeat.

292
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,590
The qualifications required to be a teacher are

293
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,090
Have a deep love for humanity

294
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,800
As for the practice of quality education

To cultivate outstanding talents who can contribute to national development and…

297
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,350
The spring of 2015 was so beautiful

298
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:25,020
After two attempts, I passed the exam.

299
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:28,270
I'm so grateful that you're a mother again

300
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,600
I am here for your child who will be born in the fall.

301
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,930
I thought of more than 100 names.

302
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,150
I also toast to you

303
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:12,770
For me who is about to fall

304
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,780
Also

305
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:17,820

307
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,540
(Summer 2021)

308
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,740
Happy Birthday

309
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,150
Oh my god, it's so beautiful

310
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,240
Why did you choose such a bright color?

311
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:04,990
I think Park Yeon-jin can handle this color

312
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,000
It is Jingtai

313
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,960
He and Sang Hyun asked me out for a drink

314
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,880
What time is it? They are all crazy.

315
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,960
Just the two of them?

316
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,880
How is that possible?

317
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,430
You really don't want to go?

318
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:24,390
Girls who don't go with them are not good-looking

319
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,350
If they are good-looking, would you go?

320
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,220
It depends on how good it looks.

321
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,270
Can you still brush your teeth now?

322
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:38,110
So I'm not rushing?

323
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:44,070
But I say Jingtai is a mama's boy and very boring.

324
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,910
There is nothing special about him except being an accountant, but his girlfriend keeps changing.

325
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:49,830
I used to find this confusing.

326
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:54,330
But thanks to Whiting I now know why.

327
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,800
What is the reason?

328
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:01,220
They did it in the hotel lobby bathroom

329
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,050
The atmosphere became heated when we got the room key.

330
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,680
That damn guy is crazy

331
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,310
What? I'm quite curious.

332
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,980
The space inside is narrow and there are people outside

00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:41,420
Let's leave at 3 o'clock, so the time should be about the same

360
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,090
Why is it early in the morning? Has the news time changed?

361
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,260
They think I'm old.

362
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:50,720
So I said husband

363
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,680
Can you place an ad during our news hour?

364
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,640
I want to do the contract extension the capitalist way

365
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,770
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

366
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:02,110
Why go through things that hurt your self-esteem?

367
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,980
Problems that can be solved with money

368
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,610
The easiest problem to solve in the world

369
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,030
Really?

370
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,450
You are so handsome, husband.

371
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,870
Will people from the Propaganda Department come to the TV station tomorrow?

372
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,080
I will go in the afternoon

373
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,420
Did you change your cigarette?

374
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:23,920
Hmm?

375
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:25,590
Yes

376
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:33,090
By the way, your flight attendant friend

377
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:36,260
Her name is Huiting. It's been so long, you should remember it.

378
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,350
But what happened to her?

379
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,980
She seemed to tell Jingtai about your high school life.

380
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:44,650
Said at the banquet

381
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,570
What did you say about me? How did you say it?

382
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,530
Saying you are not as good at studying as she is

383
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,330
It's only once that my grades lagged behind hers, so are you angry?

384
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,040
Because your wife has poor grades?

385
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:07,840
I don't like them using our affairs as a pretext for drinking

386
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,050
It's not "our" business.

387
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:14,590
She treated me as a snack, didn't she? I won't let you worry about this again.

388
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:21,850
Mom

389
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:27,440
Ha Ye-ryul

390
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,490
What should you do first when you come back from outside?

391
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:33,240
Wash your hands I'm going to wash my hands

392
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,540
Did you see that? My motherly reaction?

393
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,580
Yeonjin, what do you do first after smoking?

394
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:45,120
You are so cute

395
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,550
Damn

396
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:55,180
When will it arrive?

397
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,930
What happened to her today?

398
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:05,520
Not bad

399
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:10,730
Good looking

400
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,870
What's wrong? What happened?

401
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,000
Did you buy new clothes?

402
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,670
Yes, my boyfriend gave it to me.

403
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,420
He said he thought of me when he went to Galleria

404
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,760
Whiting

405
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,680
Is Sarah Li your boyfriend?

406
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:40,140
Have you really always been wearing guest clothes?

407
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,930
Didn’t I say it?

408
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:44,520
If you send your clothes to be cleaned, she will definitely wear yours.

409
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,560
She has good vision.

410
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:50,230
I just picked yours among so many clothes.

411
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,520
Hello Choi Hui-jung

412
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,490
Because of you, I wasted a piece of Chanel clothing today

413
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,410
You bitch, you have plenty of money to wear perfume

414
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:59,870
The quality of the product should be important, the price is not important

415
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,410
This is the best thing to remove odors

416
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:05,870
Really

417
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:08,750
Only two sets of this model were imported from Korea

418
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,250
Your vision has become higher.

419
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,380
Cui Huiting

420
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,850
Wake up!

421
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,470
If Wen Dongen hadn't been there, it would have been you.

422
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,850
You will be the one being fried.

423
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,480
Do you understand?

424
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,520
Whiting

425
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,110
Yin Jingtai is a chatterbox

426
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,450
You actually told him about me

427
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:45,620
Just drink some wine and move your body.

428
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,170
Why bother talking?

429
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,380
Right?

430
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,960
We are no longer in high school

431
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,340
Can we be friends just by friendship?

432
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:01,180
From now on, stop talking nonsense

433
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:06,180
You should be self-aware when wearing clothes and carrying bags, okay?

434
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,520
Nod if you understand.

435
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:22,780
I'll take this.

436
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:29,750
Sarah

437
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:32,250
Sorry, I'll have this dress dry cleaned...

438
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,340
Hey, are you fucking crazy?

439
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:39,090
Your breasts are already enlarged, why don't you wear it?

440
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,740
Thank you for the gifts from friends

441
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,540
Surprise Weather Anchor Park Yeon-jin

442
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,410
It’s the first weekend of March.

443
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,250
But the weather is unpredictable

444
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:13,790
Connect with weather anchor Park Yeon-jin

445
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,960
Yes, I am in Kichijoji, Seoul.

446
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:21,630
The trees around the temple are in full bloom with beautiful spring flowers

447
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,680
The forsythia is particularly impressive. As the name suggests, it is the flower that welcomes spring.

448
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:29,600
During the Joseon Dynasty, the number one scholar also wore a jasmine on his head.

449
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,930
Therefore, it is also called the imperial flower.

450
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,650
Since the spring rain started to fall yesterday afternoon

451
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,480
Cold weather reappears across the country

452
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,320
This weekend's precipitation will spread across the country

453
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,490
Then it will turn into spring cold

454
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:44,740
The temperature is about 7 degrees lower than usual

455
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,740
Rain will turn to snow in the mountains

456
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,200
Snow accumulation is likely to increase today and tomorrow

457
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,830
If you are planning to go hiking this weekend…

458
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:55,080
I watch the Weather Channel every morning.

459
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,630
…So please keep warm

460
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:00,300
My name is Park Yeon-jin

461
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,100
(Zaiping shares tomorrow with you)

462
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,390
(Zaiping creates the future with you)

463
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,430
(Zaiping Construction Company)

464
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:36,330
Oh, this fake patient is really

465
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:39,960
I told you not to go out, why are you coming out again?

466
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,340
It's boring to stay in the house, so I come out to get some fresh air

467
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,880
Doctor Zhou, what about you? What are you doing here?

468
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:46,930
Stood up again?

469
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,220
Stand up? Who? Me?

470
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:52,930
No, it’s not like that. There’s no other time either, okay?

471
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,640
How can a good-looking person...

472
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:57,520
I don't know if the dean knows that you are like this.

473
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,650
Really

474
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,400
Shouldn't we involve family members? That's too inhumane.

475
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,820
If you give me a sip of coffee, I will consider it.

476
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,820
Don't even think about it

477
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,410
Why are you going there? There is water over there.

478
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:09,490
- Hmm? - Come over here

479
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:10,910
- I know - you really are

480
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,630
Damn, it keeps raining

481
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,920
Did Jaejun call?

482
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:27,340
Yes, I asked you to bring some sweaters.

483
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,510
Wait a minute

484
485
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,830
Huh?

485
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,870
It's Wen Dongen

486
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,630
That is

487
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:08,920
Wow, how could it be such a coincidence?

488
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,260
I am Sun Mingwu, remember?

489
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:16,470
Of course I remember it's been a long time.

490
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,560
That's right

491
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,560
Wow

492
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:24,980
How are you doing? What do you do?

493
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,070
Primary school teacher

494
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,200
Is this true or false?

495
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,910
I often think of you

496
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:33,410
Is that so?

497
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:38,660
You want to buy shoes?

498
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:42,120
No, I'm just trying it out.

499
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,630
Wait, don't take it off.

500
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,760
It suits you very well.

501
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,720
Try it

502
00:39:59,140 --> 00:39:59,980
Look in the mirror

503
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,370
Would you like something to drink?

504
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,080
There is everything here

505
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,580
Don't take off your shoes yet, just come over

506
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,750
This is my own shop.

507
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,930
Wine, water, coffee, what do you want?

508
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:41,930
Coffee

509
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:58,910
Back to the point

510
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,330
What do you miss about me?

511
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:06,380
I shouldn't be

512
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:08,790
Your first kiss, right?

513
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:12,420
No wonder you think of me so often

514
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,640
Is this store really yours?

515
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:19,930
Almost

516
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,220
I do a lot of different things

517
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:24,350
So I'm busy.

518
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:29,110
Jaejun called and asked why you didn't answer the phone

519
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:33,150
He asked you to pick up your clothes from the laundry and buy some dog food for Louie.

520
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:40,530
Damn, this guy is

521
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,250
Without me he can't do anything

522
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
You remember Jeon Jae-joon, right?

523
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:49,630
You are still the same

524
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:52,710
Are you still running errands for Jeon Jae-joon?

525
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,300
Damn, it's not like that.

526
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,550
This world is so unfair

527
00:41:57,550 --> 00:42:00,510
During the time when I became a teacher and you went to buy him dog food

528
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:04,810
They just happened to have wealthy parents who inherited a golf course and opened this kind of store.

529
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:12,860
So I just wanted everything here to belong to you.

530
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:15,030
Can you choose one between a slap or three rubs?

531
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:18,660
You have to speak nicely next time.

532
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:20,660
I still beat women.

533
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,370
How about you stop hitting me and hit some other sandbag?

534
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:30,580
If you want, I think everything here can really belong to you.

535
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:32,420
What are you talking about?

536
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,670
I recently got some news

537
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:38,090
But the content is a bit stimulating and I can't handle it alone

538
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,350
Are you curious why I'm telling you this?

539
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:50,350
Because I think you can understand the feeling of wanting to trample them underfoot

540
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:52,820
And

541
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:55,110
Actually at that time

542
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,150
The person I fear most is you

543
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,200
Not them

544
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:06,290
Really?

545
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:09,460
What is it?

546
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:11,670
What's so exciting?

547
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,340
It turns out that you are deliberately drinking less, not because you can't drink

548
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:22,050
I would get drunk if I drank one glass

549
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,930
It seems that I am enjoying drinking today.

550
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:27,180
I am also happy when you say that. I feel like I am a different person.

551
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,060
Senior, you are indeed different to me.

552
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:31,770
What?

553
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:33,610
But I see you always

554
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:37,070
Wearing that watch

555
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:37,990
Watch?

556
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:40,610
Oh this one?

557
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,700
My dad bought this watch when he was assigned to work for the first time.

558
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,780
He said he wanted to pass this watch on to his son.

559
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:47,290
He is very interested in heirlooms and the like.

560
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,410
Wow, he's so cute

561
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:52,290
But he is old

562
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,250
Need to hire a therapist and medical expenses

563
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,210
These expenses are really a lot

564
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:00,090
So I must pass the exam to become a civil servant in an educational institution this time.

565
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,220
My wife even does early morning prayers for this

566
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:04,010
Is it useful?

567
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:07,770
I have to take another step on my own this time

568
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,680
Because God never helps me

569
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:11,600
What?

570
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,360
Oh, are you praying for something too?

571
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:20,820
Yes, you passed the test.

572
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,450
Senior, you must pass the exam.

573
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:25,820
I sincerely cheer for you

574
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:28,870
Oh ok thank you

575
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:32,750
I think your eyes are beautiful when you drink

576
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:33,750
No

577
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:36,880
My legs are more beautiful

578
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:43,260
Good

579
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,050
Hello?

580
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,310
Hello, this is Shiming Real Estate Agency

581
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:56,770
The apartment you want is now available.

582
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:57,690
(Monthly Lease Contract)

583
00:44:57,770 --> 00:44:59,150
Bring your stamp and come for a visit

584
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:28,050
You need this, right?

585
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,370
When did it start?

586
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,460
I noticed you last fall.

587
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:58,830
Don't deny it

588
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,500
Although you cleverly avoided surveillance

589
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:05,220
But I have a photo of you showing your face on my phone

590
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:09,220
I have kept all the records for the past six months.

591
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,640
See, God won't help me.

592
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,310
The servant of the chairman of the foundation is not only quick-witted

593
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:19,150
Isn't it necessary to have super patience?

594
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,910
If you want money, I'll give it to you.

595
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,280
I don't want money and I don't want to call the police

596
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,620
I don't know what you're going to do with this.

597
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:41,040
But if you persist for half a year, you should be able to make a name for yourself.

598
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,130
So I want to join forces with you

599
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,220
I will help you

600
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:51,350
But you have to help me too

601
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:59,270
What exactly do you need to do?

602
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,230
You help me...

603
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:06,440
Killed my husband

604
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,790
