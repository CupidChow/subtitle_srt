1
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:05,980
Dark Glory

2
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,130
Are you so selfish?

3
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,840
We are all waiting for you. How can you go to evening study alone?

4
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:48,980
Do you want to get up?

5
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,530
Oh, by the way, Wen Dongen

6
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,490
You said you wanted to study architecture.

7
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,120
Hey, if there's anything you don't understand, just ask me, okay?

8
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,330
Physical work is my specialty

9
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,580
Is a professional idiot

10
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,580
That's what I said, you crazy woman

11
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,670
You just said "special" idiot

12
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,790
Who are you trying to teach a lesson to, you fucking stupid person?

13
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:46,370
With the pair of feet that walk in front when torturing others

14
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,120
All the feet that have passed in parallel

15
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,170
With a mouth that laughs at other people's misfortunes

16
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,590
All the mouths that have responded

17
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,760
With those sinister eyes

18
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,510
All the eyes that have looked at each other affectionately

19
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:24,070
With the hand that teases and hurts others

20
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,910
All the hands that have been connected

21
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,120
Also

22
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,880
Your soul that is ecstatic in all these moments

23
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:38,710
I'm going to walk there, Yeonjin

24
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,220
There is no forgiveness

25
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,680
So there won't be any glory.

26
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:49,640
Damn you crazy bitch

27
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:52,640
Letting go

28
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,310
Can you just go back to being a high school student without having to see your classmates?

29
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,230
Let go!

30
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,610
So have all your dreams come true?

31
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,110
A job that can be taken out is already available

32
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,070
You married a man with good conditions when you were at your most beautiful.

33
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,240
Are you living a happy life?

34
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,950
I think you must have done it, right Park Yeon-jin?

35
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,210
Oh my god, the candles are about to melt

36
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,130
Be careful and slow down

37
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,630
When was this prepared?

38
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,880
-Happy birthday to you-Happy birthday to you

39
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,550
Happy birthday to you

40
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,930
My beloved Park Yeon-jin

41
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,480
Happy birthday to you

42
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,320
What is your purpose in doing this?

43
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,240
You should have searched for news about me getting married

44
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,610
-What's your purpose? -Hey

45
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,780
You can't kill her now.

46
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,030
There are students everywhere outside

47
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,750
Please understand that Yanzhen is still like a child.

48
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,120
Unable to control one's emotions

49
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,840
You guys are really the same as always

50
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,300
The friendship between you two is really enviable.

51
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,220
You seem different from before

52
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,600
In high school you were black and white, but now

53
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,770
It seems to have become colorful.

54
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,310
Is that so?

55
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,110
I have to go

56
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,740
Yeonjin, I will watch your show

57
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,450
Do you mind if I occasionally leave a message on the program's official website?

58
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,160
Anyway, it's nice to see you today.

59
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,870
But Jaejoon

60
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,790
Haven't you seen

61
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,090
A colorful world?

62
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:56,230
(Sunghan High School 2022 Honorary Alumni Award Ceremony)

63
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:14,870
The bag you want

64
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,210
You don't go to work and don't answer your phone all day.

65
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,080
I'm a little confused lately

66
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,790
I drive more than you do

67
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,710
Why the fuck are you the one getting paid?

68
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,130
Sorry, I drank too much.

69
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,470
Do you need anything else?

70
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,190
Go check what Wen Dongen is doing

71
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,730
Wen Dongen?

72
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,070
Oh, who was that person before?

73
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,450
To the one you have blocked before

74
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,410
How long does it take?

75
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,700
That you...

76
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,210
Have you slept with Wen Dongen?

77
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,090
Did she give birth to your child?

78
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,420
Are you high?

79
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,340
Are you crazy?

80
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,880
Have you decided to go the brainless route?

81
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,470
Eh? Are the three of us going in together?

82
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,720
No

83
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,600
Because he doesn't buy me a bag

84
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,860
Oh my god, the night view is so beautiful

85
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:35,870
Jaejun, how about I just live here with you?

86
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:37,740
What's your name?

87
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:40,750
Hena

88
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,790
Our Hena

89
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,250
Why don’t you learn to draw inferences about other situations?

90
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,840
Hena

91
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,420
Do you think I'm confused?

92
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,720
Our Hena doesn't even dare to say her real name, but her ambitions are quite ambitious

93
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,640
I think this is very sad

94
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:06,940
But Hena

95
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,480
You said your hair is red, right?

96
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,400
Yes

97
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,820
Can't you see it?

98
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,700
Hena

99
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,880
Do you know who is the woman I hate the most?

100
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,750
Anne of Red Hair and Little Red Riding Hood Cha Cha

101
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,300
Our red-haired Ha Na

102
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,430
Do you also want to live a lonely and sad life with strength?

103
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,640
Hmm?

104
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:40,890
My phone is always on

105
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,520
Patient No. 701, Yun Jung-hwan, please call me if you have any consultation requests.

106
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,980
Excuse me, may I ask you a question?

107
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,940
Ask me. He has to go there right away.

108
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,530
I'll take care of this, just go quickly

109
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,070
I know you'll figure it out, that's why I asked you to call me

110
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:53,990
I'm leaving first

111
00:08:58,570 --> 00:08:59,620
What's the matter, you ask?

112
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,540
Is Senior Ruzheng the dean’s son?

113
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,750
Really? He is the dean's son?

114
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,790
Wow, I thought it was a daughter.

115
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,580
Because he looks good in pink

116
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,750
Wow, it's true.

117
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,590
I just found out yesterday

118
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,300
Then in this case

119
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,010
Yoo Jung-sama's father

120
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,640
Is that the former dean who passed away?

121
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,430
Do you need to ask so much? Just search online and you will find it.

122
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:30,520
Was he really murdered by his own patients?

123
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,280
Today is the anniversary of the death of the former dean.

124
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,820
That's why he leaves work early.

125
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,990
Oh

126
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,660
Do you also remember the death anniversaries of your boss’ family members?

127
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,660
Ruzheng's mother is my cousin

128
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,580
Oh

129
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,950
What?

130
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,010
Why would a doctor smoke?

131
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,140
Some of them are thoracic surgeons.

132
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,100
Have you filled your stomach?

133
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,060
Can I have two drinks?

134
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,070
The uncles are already too drunk

135
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,280
Where are the playing cards?

136
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,530
I will write it later

137
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,490
This

138
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,330
It's what your dad used before.

139
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:29,960
Now it's for you

140
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,760
Let's go, Dad is waiting for us

141
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,190
Yesterday I thought I saw a ghost

142
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,360
Did she come here on purpose?

143
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,120
I think she did it on purpose. Doesn't anyone know what she is going to do?

144
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,530
Mingwu, go check it out

145
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,160
Who will pay for this job? How much?

146
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,550
(Lisa's poisonous milk)

147
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,890
Bring me what I want first

148
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:08,510
(Marijuana, methamphetamine, US dollars in cash)

149
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,650
This color is a bit...

150
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:18,440
Hello

151
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,150
Show me that one

152
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,330
But Park Yeon-jin, are you okay?

153
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,460
What if your official news website spreads inexplicable rumors?

154
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,880
Is it true that someone will throw eggs at you on your way home from get off work?

155
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:40,250
This dead girl Wen Dongen is really sad

156
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,670
Fuck that bitch

157
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,430
(Baby girl)

158
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,970
Did you have lunch, baby?

159
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,180
Mom is getting off work

160
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:55,100
Well, I accidentally spilled milk on my indoor slippers.

161
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,810
My feet got wet so I'm barefoot now.

162
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,400
Barefoot? No, it's dangerous.

163
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,650
Have you told the teacher?

164
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,610
From today on, I am no longer Teacher Yang Yujing

165
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,740
What does that mean?

166
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,330
The head teacher has changed. She will come later.

167
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,290
Is that so?

168
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,750
Why didn't you give any advance notice...

169
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,590
Mom is going to school tomorrow.

170
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,510
You will be happy to see her because she is your friend.

171
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,470
Hmm? Who?

172
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,300
New teacher!

173
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,390
Teacher Wen Dongen

174
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,190
What is the name of the head teacher?

175
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,190
Nice to meet you

176
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,820
Various school affairs

177
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,030
Please give me some advice, please.

178
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,700
-Principal-Yes

179
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,990
Please take care of our teacher Wen in the future.

180
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,160
Teacher Yang Yujing has resigned

181
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,460
I am your new head teacher. My name is Wen Dongen.

182
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,670
From today on in our classroom

183
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,420
There are three things that have no power.

184
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:06,800
That's the occupation of my parents.

185
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:10,340
Parents’ financial resources and connections

186
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,680
Then I hope you will abide by the following three points

187
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,440
You are not allowed to wear better clothes and drive a better car.

188
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,610
Bully other students if you live in a better house

189
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,280
If someone still bullies his classmates, the teacher will

190
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,740
Let the mother buy clothes for him

191
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,030
And his father who drove him

192
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,160
And buy a house for his grandparents

193
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,200
All come and beg for mercy

194
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,880
I hope we can get along well in the future

195
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,340
-Yes! -Yes!

196
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,470
Let's brush our teeth

197
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,350
Pass me the toothbrush.

198
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,640
What is her relationship with the chairman?

199
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,520
The chairman of the board also came to introduce

200
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,480
Probably a relative.

201
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:11,780
Teacher Jiang, you are pretending to be innocent.

202
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,870
Does it make you feel like a good person?

203
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,290
Would it make you proud?

204
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,250
Sorry

205
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,370
They should be going to bed.

206
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,630
Or already asleep

207
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,500
It must be

208
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,850
(Shiming)

209
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,310
Our class teacher

210
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,480
Is that really you?

211
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,200
Ye-ryul spilled milk so he's barefoot

212
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,950
Her feet are small and tender

213
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,790
This doesn't seem like a coincidence, does it?

214
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,210
Of course not

215
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,790
No step of my journey here is a coincidence

216
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,170
I have completely fallen into your trap now, right?

217
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,090
Absurd

218
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,020
I thought you were gonna meet some poor guy

219
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,350
Give birth to a bunch of poor people

220
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,900
Living a poor life, but you are really good

221
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,900
When did you start planning?

222
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,030
It's a pity that you don't know that you are my dream, Park Yeon-jin

223
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,490
Didn’t I say there would be a date later?

224
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,450
You've come all the way here

225
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,620
Every day is definitely interesting

226
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,410
The way here was painful

227
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,120
But now I come here and see that it is really interesting

228
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:29,590
Then you should have died right then!

229
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:30,920
Isn't that too cheap for you?

230
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,880
Even bad guys like you are doing well.

231
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,880
Why should I die?

232
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,640
Fortunately, I am still alive and can see you again

233
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,100
Especially today I find it very interesting

234
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,930
Welcome to my gym, Yeonjin

235
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,230
I can understand you too.

236
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,820
Carefully planned every step finally got here

237
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,700
It's normal to feel good about yourself

238
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,620
Things worthless can also be pretended like this

239
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,210
Okay, come and try it.

240
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,080
Come on

241
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,560
(Huiting: Do you still remember your homeroom teacher in your senior year of high school?)

242
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,480
(He occasionally contacts me about buying plane tickets)

243
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,730
(His wife just contacted me)

244
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,060
(Jaejun: You have a wide network of contacts)

245
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,110
The head teacher is dead

246
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,920
Are you a teacher?

247
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,010
Are you in college?

248
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,970
Yes, teacher.

249
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,050
Thanks to you

250
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,890
Thank you, teacher

251
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,020
Oh, I'll collect this for him.

252
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,600
My dad has asthma

253
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,600
So I can't send flowers, especially lilies.

254
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,310
Oh

255
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,570
Then I'll give this to you as a gift, Senior.

256
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,700
Congratulations on passing the civil service exam for an educational institution

257
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,280
How come you are so well-informed?

258
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,240
I just heard

259
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,080
Dad, I passed the first test.

260
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,410
Further interviews left

261
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,710
But I am a little worried about the interview

262
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,420
What are you worried about?

263
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,090
You come from an excellent educational family

264
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,090
You even took off your watch the day I handed in my application for withdrawal

265
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,590
Shut up!

266
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,630
Dad

267
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,800
Damn you blood sucker

268
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,350
You useless bastard!

269
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,560
Hello!

270
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,350
-Hey dad. -Hey

271
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,310
Hello

272
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,610
Do you think you can still live a good life after ruining my life?

273
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,820
I would have known this earlier.

274
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,200
I killed you right away.

275
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,490
-Damn it! -Dad!

276
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:06,240
When you were destroying my life, did you ever worry about whether you could live a good life?

277
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,410
Wen Dongen, wait a minute, calm down too.

278
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,660
Dad, you go in first.

279
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,290
Everyone is watching. Hurry up.

280
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:14,710
You know what she said is all false, right?

281
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,090
Nothing good to hear!

282
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,010
Wen Dongen

283
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,310
Please explain

284
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,350
What's wrong? What's going on?

285
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,640
Before posting to the Education Department's official website

286
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,650
Let me tell you first

287
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,560
Department of Education?

288
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:39,860
Of course I know you are innocent

289
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:41,440
But

290
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,320
I was innocent then too

291
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:49,120
After all, you are an adult now and

292
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,500
I'm only 18

293
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,180
It wasn't you who did this?

294
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,640
Homeroom teacher's affairs

295
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,930
What are you asking your class teacher about?

296
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,560
About his death?

297
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,890
Or is it about being punished?

298
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,270
Dad!

299
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,110
Dad!

300
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:20,860
Dad!

301
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:22,570
Dad!

302
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,990
Dad!

303
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,410
Someone has already sent flowers to congratulate Dad.

304
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,580
I'm a dad too.

305
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,290
A father should give everything for his children, right?

306
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,510
What are you talking about now?

307
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,130
What does it mean?

308
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,300
You know I'm only left with the final evaluation, right?

309
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,350
Education civil servants are just around the corner

310
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,850
I will try my best to help you get that

311
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,690
Even though I'm retired...

312
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,560
Soo-han, open the window

313
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,150
Don't

314
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:06,570
Don't do that. You know bad things spread far and wide.

315
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,570
Word of mouth spreads far and wide, and rumors become fame

316
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,160
I'll give you the watch back.

317
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,660
Good

318
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:21,460
Soo Han opened the window

319
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:25,050
What can you do for me now?

320
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:28,220
Only one thing

321
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,180
Continue to be a father I respect

322
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,310
As a father who was awarded the Medal of Merit

323
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,140
Stay in my heart

324
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,810
Please

325
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,400
Soo-han opens the window

326
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,740
Dad!

327
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,070
Dad!

328
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,160
Dad!

329
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:02,710
What happened to the head teacher?

330
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,380
It's his fault, not mine.

331
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,720
If you have to find someone else

332
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,880
That means you are not me

333
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,640
Smelly Bitch

334
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,680
Is this the right thing for you?

335
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,890
I'm so glad you haven't changed at all.

336
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:22,600
So let’s start now

337
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,610
Let's talk about what you are most curious about

338
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:27,940
Ye-Ryeol's Mom

339
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,950
Your daughter, Ye-ryul, is pure and gentle.

340
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,080
Good-hearted

341
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,660
It seems that your success rate is the punishment you will suffer.

342
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,670
I'm going to kill you

343
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,710
If our Yi-ryul loses a hair

344
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,420
See how I deal with you

345
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:49,420
I'm so curious

346
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:51,930
How will you deal with me?

347
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:56,350
My body has been damaged by you and my soul has been broken because of you

348
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,600
What else can you do?

349
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,560
Do you want Ye-ryul to transfer to another school?

350
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,310
Stop dreaming

351
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:07,650
You want me to relocate?

352
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,860
Don't even think about it

353
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,530
From now on, you will suffer.

354
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,160
Like I used to

355
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,780
Damn it!

356
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,400
How much does the funeral package for a class teacher cost?

357
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,110
Damn, his wife texted me again.

358
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:37,200
Classmates package 100,000 won Friends package 500,000 won

359
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,200
If it is a dog you have owned before, it is 1 million won.

360
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,410
Homeroom teacher provides 50,000 won

361
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,410
How much will you give me when I get married?

362
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,210
100

363
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,250
So cool

364
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,630
South Korean Won

365
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,340
Damn

366
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:38,470
Excuse me, could you please hold the umbrella for me?

367
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,180
The wine that the secretary asked me to bring you is on the passenger seat.

368
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,230
It is said that it was given by Mr. Shen of Hanchen Flooring

369
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,610
Oh, you can drink it.

370
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:59,450
If it was sent by Mr. Shin, the value should not be less than 1 million won.

371
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:00,410
Hmm?

372
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,870
Oh, this is not okay.

373
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:08,250
I don't have any hands now

374
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,210
But how can I take such a valuable thing?

375
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:15,920
I can't tell whether the wine is good or bad. It doesn't matter if Mr. He is

376
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,630
"It's okay" is what I said

377
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,260
And I've already said

378
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:22,930
I don't know where the problem is

379
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:24,180
Hmm?

380
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,060
Then you go to a convenience store on your way home and buy a bottle of wine for 10,000 won.

381
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,600
And some cheese

382
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,810
First, take a sip of the 10,000 won

383
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,980
Drink this again

384
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:36,980
Then you will naturally know the good from the bad.

385
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,030
See you tomorrow

386
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,310
Do you know what my previous wish was?

387
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,770
Dad

388
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,900
Dad's Vitamin Dad's Treasure

389
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,990
I hope one day

390
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,030
I can forget your name

391
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:28,540
I forgot what you look like.

392
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,540
When I see you again somewhere, I can say

393
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,290
"Who are you?"

394
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:40,670
I hope I can forget you completely

395
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:47,010
Thinking of my world filled with you

396
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,020
Doesn’t it feel cruel?

397
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:55,730
Because my world is full of you

398
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,520
So in your daughter's future world

399
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,780
It will be full of me

400
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,280
I will bear the deep hatred and resentment that arises from this

401
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,580
It's the price of revenge

402
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:20,800
(To Yeon-jin)

403
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:37,900
How could this happen? Who did it?

404
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,070
I received the photo you sent.

405
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,530
Suxi's photo will also be useful

406
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,040
Thank you, teacher

407
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,700
This is what I should do

408
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,410
I was too young then

409
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:00,880
Were you and Suxi close at that time?

410
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,880
I want a pack of sanitary napkins without wings

411
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:08,800
Wait a minute

412
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,230
Give you hydrogen peroxide and burn ointment

413
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,150
4700KRW

414
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,240
No

415
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,620
When Suxi was bullied

416
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:32,870
I just...

417
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:35,910
Bystander

418
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:39,000
Then I became a victim

419
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,630
So next

420
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,760
I want to be the perpetrator

421
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,470
Although it's a bit late

422
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,800
But I won't sit idly by anymore

423
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,560
Then

424
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:58,560
Is a long battle about to begin?

425
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:00,520
Yes

426
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:04,110
Then I can only tell you

427
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,240
You must win

428
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:12,820
18-year-old Wen Dongen and 36-year-old Wen Dongen

429
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,080
I support all

430
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,080
Yeah

431
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:22,920
I

432
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,590
The teacher who will win

433
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,350
Come on, I was worried you wouldn't come.

434
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:42,560
I have no reason not to come.

435
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,190
Have you met them?

436
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:47,030
You didn't tell them about my meeting with you.

437
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,230
I have no reason to tell them.

438
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:52,660
Because I'm betting it all on you.

439
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:55,870
So

440
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:01,210
If you take me with you, you'll be dead.

441
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,260
Have you eaten yet?

442
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:14,680
Let me tell you briefly

443
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,600
Tell me in detail while eating.

444
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,510
What do you like to eat?

445
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:28,520
This side

446
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,320
Get a bottle of soju

447
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:35,700
Why don't you eat?

448
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:38,160
I have eaten

449
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,620
Where is the thing I asked you for?

450
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,260
Would you like a drink?

451
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,720
I've drunk wine too.

452
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:06,650
Sarah Lee's Supply Book

453
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,230
Background of the man Choi Hye-jung desperately wants to get

454
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,320
Where is the hair I gave you?

455
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:16,360
Genetic consistency

456
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:21,660
Really?

457
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:24,160
Does Jaejoon really have a child? Where is he?

458
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,670
That's the card I want to play.

459
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:28,500
This is for you

460
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,500
(Seoul Joo Hospital)

461
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:35,340
Mortuary? What's there?

462
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,930
Are you sure this card is better?

463
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:39,800
I'm sure if your goal is money

464
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,100
Go and see for yourself who is there.

465
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,560
This looks like it will be worth the money

466
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:50,860
Right?

467
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,540
D3 is here

468
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,290
(The late Yin Suxi was 18 years old)

469
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,380
(Female, resettled on December 15, 2004)

470
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:16,010
So

471
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,090
Yoon So Hee is here

472
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:21,100
How many decades has it been left?

473
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,220
That's right

474
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,020
The outstanding amount is more than 100 million won

475
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:28,390
The police concluded that it was suicide, but the deceased's parents could not accept it

476
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,940
Her parents refused to answer our calls.

477
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:32,690
Unless the bereaved family agrees

478
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,650
We cannot remove the body without permission.

479
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,150
Now…

480
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,490
Can you take a look at that...

481
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,660
A corpse? Oh, that's not good.

482
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,250
You are not her immediate family member, are you?

483
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:48,160
Yes

484
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,040
I am her friend

485
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,500
We were together since high school.

486
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:55,050
Then you must come with the deceased's family.

487
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,630
We also have our difficulties.

488
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,970
So please help persuade the family of the deceased

489
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,890
Is it okay for them to give up on retrieving the body?

490
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:10,060
You ask what is my purpose?

491
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,530
Do you think I'm expecting Sun Mingwu's flapping wings to cause a hurricane?

492
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:21,950
What kind of wings can Sun Mingwu have, Yanzhen?

493
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,500
Such a beautiful thing

494
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,750
It shouldn’t grow on Sun Mingwu, right?

495
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,430
Sun Mingwu is like the memory card of my camera

496
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:45,140
I had something I wanted to photograph so I just clicked it in.

497
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,850
This will be worth a lot of money

498
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,650
Wow, Wen Dongen has become so interesting.

499
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:13,000
(Patient No. 701’s name is Yoon Jung-hwan)

500
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,630
Has patient No. 701, Yoon Jung-hwan, been transferred to another ward?

501
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:24,550
Don’t you know?

502
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,680
He suddenly went into shock this morning.

503
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,380
Oh my god, are you okay?

504
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,340
Isn't it hot?

505
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,180
Nothing

506
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,090
Art Rate

507
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:43,300
Does anyone bully you at school? Does anyone hit you?

508
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,470
Mom, what's wrong with you?

509
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:47,510
Even if the teacher does something to you to punish you, that's not okay, you know?

510
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,850
Hot Objects Has anyone ever put anything very hot on you?

511
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:54,060
Why would you stick something so hot on someone else? That's too bad.

512
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,440
That should be a lesson.

513
00:37:57,770 --> 00:38:00,310
I'm going to play a game with my friends.

514
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,610
Art Rate

515
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:18,210
Visit once a week every Friday

516
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:21,290
Now about three out of five photos are clear.

517
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,100
(Pagoda Chess Hall)

518
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:15,320
Yeonjin, I learn Go very quickly

519
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:18,080
Because my purpose is clear

520
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:23,540
And it is a game that is won by taking over the opponent's carefully constructed territory.

521
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,090
It's wonderful

522
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,680
You haven't been to the chess club for a long time, right?

523
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,930
I'm busy making a living

524
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,730
What do you do for a living?

525
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:49,480
Find innocent men to cheat them out of money and break their hearts

526
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:53,280
I don't know if your business is good or not.

527
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:54,860
Not so good

528
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:57,160
Because I am a good person

529
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,330
Where did you learn Go?

530
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:07,250
In the community park

531
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,670
Oh

532
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,210
Your answers are very unexpected

533
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:37,410
I see it's 20,000 won per plate.

534
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:48,040
Eat

535
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,090
There is no possibility of working

536
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:54,670
You don't want to transfer money?

537
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,010
What?

538
00:41:57,970 --> 00:41:58,800
Oh

539
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,100
I had a lot of fun playing chess today.

540
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:11,520
50,000 KRW per plate

541
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:14,940
How about another plate?

542
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:19,530
But Yeonjin

543
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:24,540
Would you like to hear the real reason why I like Go?

544
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,790
That's gambling.

545
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,790
Is that so?

546
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,590
Play Go

547
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:36,590
It is to express desire in silence

548
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:39,090
Seducing and being seduced in silence

549
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,010
Strip off the opponent's shell

550
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,390
What if the other party doesn’t respond?

551
