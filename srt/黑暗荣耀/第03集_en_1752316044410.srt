The reason for the heavy fog in winter is

91

Warm winter weather after the cold wave at the end of the year

92
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,190

00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,610
You try your best to cover it up

187
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:59,120
I told her it was dangerous.

188
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,160
Okay, I'm fine.

189
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,290
Wow, Yilu has grown a lot taller

190
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,710
Yeah, I want to be a weather anchor when I grow up.

191
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,800
Thank you for watching I Am Ha Ye-ryul

192
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,630
But mom’s shoes are green, right?

193
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,430
Oh, it's red.

194
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,770
Ha Ye-ryul looks at her mother

195
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,310
It doesn't matter what color it is.

196
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,940
The important thing is that it is expensive

197
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,690
There are only a few pairs in Korea

198
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,940
More importantly

199
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:35,200
No matter how many pairs you have, you can have it

200
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:39,700
Nothing in the world is priced by color

201
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,830
Prices are in numbers

202
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,790
Do you understand?

203
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,670
Should we keep it a secret from Dad?

204
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,510
Hey All

205
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:01,140
He is the boss here

206
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:06,350
Wow, how long has it been since we last met?

207
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,650
-Hello-Hello

208
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,610
Madam, you are still beautiful.

209
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,740
If you had called me in advance, I would have rolled out the red carpet.

210
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,450
You really are

211
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,870
When I was in Spain, I was a neighbor of Quan Zong.

212
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,290
By the way, this is my friend

213
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,420
I would like to recommend her to become a member

214
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,000
Please think about it, okay?

215
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,590
Make it so special

216
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,300
Do I need to pass the review to buy a membership?

217
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,840
How do you feel today?

218
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,010
Our club's greens are the best in Korea

219
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:42,510
There are people who have never been here, but there are also people who have only come once.

220
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,680
It's good to go anywhere to exercise

221
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,560
The dumplings in your restaurant are delicious.

222
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,480
The membership system here is very strict

223
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,530
You must have at least four valid members' recommendations to submit an application

224
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,530
Well, she is fully qualified.

225
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,620
Her son is the president of Zaiping Construction Company

226
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,880
If you send me your application materials, I will take a good look at them.

227
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,500
Then I'll take my leave. I have other plans.

228
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,590
-I'll call you back. -Okay.

229
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,890
We are not reviewing new members for the time being, so please do not accept application materials.

230
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,430
And damn!

231
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,730
Stop Letting Restaurants Sell Dumplings

232
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,480
Throw them all away!

233
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,570
It is the All-China Federation of Trade Unions

234
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,860
(Pagoda Chess Hall)

235
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,800
After parking the car, send the keys to the chess hall and then go home.

236
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,720
Is today Friday?

237
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,260
Thank you

238
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,430
Lawyer Cui said he has arrived

239
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,770
Thank you

240
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,730
The Jingfudong development project has obtained the land execution rights

241
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,490
As for the Go Square

242
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,280
You can open the shop as soon as the landscaping is completed

243
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,450
I have already discussed it with the city government.

244
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,870
I changed the landscape design company midway, which delayed me a bit.

245
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,830
Wow!

246
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,920
Today's young people

247
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,920
Generally not interested in Go

248
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,130
I just think it's novel

249
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,850
The important thing is that she won the game of chess with the owner of the chop shop twice.

250
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:50,020
This made Boss Park furious

251
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:54,100
They bet 20,000 won per round.

252
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,020
Is that so?

253
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:16,670
Kill the dragon first

254
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,300
There's no way out there

255
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,800
If you bet now, you will lose ten points.

256
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,320
She took it

257
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,570
Really?

258
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,950
That's amazing

259
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,070
Lost 20,000 won?

260
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,490
Did you see that there are ten eyes over there?

261
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,290
- Huh? - I didn't see that.

262
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,370
Ten Eyes

263
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,040
- Really amazing - You are such a great person

264
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:04,470
(bound for Incheon Airport)

265
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:29,870
(Jaejun)

266
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:32,240
I've arrived in Seoul. I'll be resting tomorrow. It's so boring.

267
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,550
Oh, wrong post.

268
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,970
No way?

269
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,490
You think you're in love with me?

270
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,620
Damn, I laughed my ass off

271
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,200
Open the door for me

272
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,050
You made a fortune this time

273
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,470
My tablet is in the back.

274
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,600
Is it okay for you to drive Jae-joon's car casually like this?

275
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,350
You drive this car to pick up girls, right? Pretend you own the car

276
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,980
How can I do this kind of job if I don’t even have that kind of benefits?

277
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,060
69

278
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,690
6969

279
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,780
is the password

280
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,650
Numbers are wonderful, aren’t they?

281
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,990
Dirty damn

282
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,660
He is indeed divorced

283
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,330
There are many real estate and properties.

284
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,410
There are still horses in Jeju Island

285
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,840
I thought it was all bullshit. It's amazing.

286
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,010
Then can you help me check his ex-wife?

287
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,220
Appearance, education, family background, anything is fine

288
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,680
I can just transfer another 300,000 won to you, right? How long will it take?

289
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,390
What are you in such a hurry for?

290
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,020
If it's 450,000 won, I'll take it

291
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,690
I'm a bit busy lately

292
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,520
He asked me to go to Jeju Island with him next week

293
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:25,070
I need to think ahead about whether I want to spend the night with him.

294
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:30,320
You're right. I was the one who ruined the fun.

295
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,570
I need to pay more attention

296
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,490
I almost said "sao"

297
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:36,580
Damn it!

298
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,160
I'm too lazy to scold you

299
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:42,250
Do you know where the class division is most thorough in the world?

300
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,170
On the plane

301
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,750
First Class, Business Class, Economy Class

302
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,630
Each cabin is separated by a curtain, but no one will cross that boundary.

303
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,220
What are you talking about?

304
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:55,550
I told you to take your salary which is not enough for a meal.

305
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,970
Stay behind the curtain

306
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,180
I'm going to cross that border

307
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,600
Stop Jae-joon's car

308
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,230
Is it that fun?

309
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:49,360
From here on, the outcome was already determined, but she dragged it to the end

310
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,690
Why?

311
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,150
Who is it?

312
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,030
People in the chess hall

313
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:57,240
What's wrong?

314
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,160
I want to take a nap before work.

315
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,330
Why bother playing something so nerve-wracking?

316
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,210
It is very clean and neat, both in terms of appearance and gameplay.

317
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,050
Smoking is harmful to your health, why do you still smoke?

318
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:10,960
Also

319
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,090
However

320
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:16,010
Why did you marry a smoking wife if you don’t smoke yourself?

321
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:18,010
Because you are very neat and tidy except smoking

322
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,430
This is true both in terms of aesthetics and gameplay.

323
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,440
I just like that about you

324
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,310
You have answers to all questions

325
326
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,690
You went on blind dates with two other people besides me.

326
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,690
Why did you choose me?

327
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,570
Because you are the one wearing the least

328
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:38,870
Wearing the least

329
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,740
And they are all Dior

330
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,950
I really can't stand you

331
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:47,750
You are a very elegant person but sometimes you look like a gangster when you see the things you like.

332
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,630
Come quickly if you want to

333
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:55,840
I sleep in very little clothing.

334
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:57,470
5 minutes

335
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:49,850
Is this a dream?

336
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:52,560
Mirror?

337
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:55,610
I looked in the mirror this morning.

338
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,580
Let's start in 10 minutes.

339
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,620
Have you passed the compilation exam?

340
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,090
-Yes-Oh, I passed the exam.

341
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,090
Congratulations

342
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,670
Is the blessing too untimely?

343
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,550
Thank you

344
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:31,520
There was an academic conference in Shiming City and we went to attend it with the professors.

345
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,610
How are you doing?

346
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:39,990
Yeah

347
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,820
I heard that you were serving in the military medical department.

348
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,580
It's been millions of years since I retired from the army

349
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,290
But where did you hear that?

350
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,040
Listen to what the uncles say in the park

351
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,210
They said: "The unemployed young man went to serve in the army"

352
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,210
And said you will learn to cheer up there

353
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,260
Did you go to the park?

354
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,560
I should have written you a letter of condolence.

355
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,770
Do military doctors also receive letters of condolence?

356
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,560
Usually love letters

357
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,150
Do you receive a lot of love letters?

358
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,440
(Recipient: Zhou Ruzheng)

359
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:23,450
(Sender: Qingsong Prison)

360
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,160
I hate people writing to me.

361
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:28,870
By the way, what happened to you in Shiming City?

362
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,120
Do you work there?

363
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:32,710
Not yet

364
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:35,080
Today I have something to do

365
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,880
Is she going with you?

366
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,340
I've been staring at you since the beginning

367
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,180
I have to go

368
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:49,890
Me too

369
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,430
However

370
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:54,940
At that time

371
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:58,190
It was when I first taught you how to play Go in the park.

372
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,570
That was the saddest period of my life.

373
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,070
Give guidance to Dongen's juniors

374
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,750
It was my only daily activity and appointment at that time

375
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,710
If I looked gentle

376
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,130
That's because of you.

377
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:25,930
I've always felt a little uncomfortable

378
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:37,980
I'm right here

379
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,440
Maybe you will be curious

380
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:45,780
Then you go.

381
00:29:56,540 --> 00:30:01,130
(Joo Yeo-jeong, Seoul Joo Hospital)

382
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:12,970
Wait a minute

383
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,690
(No. 71, Shiming Road, Eden Apartment)

384
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:18,900
Don't you usually live here?

385
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,020
Are you No. 301?

386
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:24,190
I am the landlord of this apartment

387
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:26,490
Hello

388
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:29,200
So you don't live here?

389
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,950
I see that your household only has basic water and electricity charges.

390
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,870
I have never been late with rent

391
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,200
I know this

392
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,420
But you seemed to have to live here.

393
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,420
But your house has been empty for months, so I wonder

394
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:48,340
My current job has not been assigned to Shiming City

395
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,260
I'm trying to

396
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,180
I know we don't meet each other.

397
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,770
But today there is a video

398
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:00,810
Then I got in the car

399
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,900
I thought you would come up this way

400
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,990
Oh sorry, I'll write this down next time.

401
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:15,370
I zoomed in so it's not very clear.

402
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:16,830
Watch carefully

403
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:18,960
Good

404
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,680
Look here

405
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,470
Cough

406
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,070
"Chairman, will you sit in the front today?"

407
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:51,780
You confused me

408
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,870
"My dear, please sit in the front today."

409
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:09,010
Is this driver's name Zhao Xiuxian?

410
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:10,590
Oh my god, how did you know?

411
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,930
It turns out that Zhao Xiuxian is not a woman

412
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,430
There was a box of erectile dysfunction medicine in the garbage bag so I thought…

413
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:20,600
However, the duration has nothing to do with gender.

414
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,150
I should focus on age.

415
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,530
You take this matter so seriously.

416
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:36,320
What's wrong?

417
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:39,370
Do you think a woman who gets beaten all day never smiles?

418
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,290
Although I am always beaten, I am a cheerful person.

419
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:44,370
You really are

420
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:52,510
You should have told me this earlier.

421
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,340
-What's the matter? -You have a cheerful personality.

422
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,970
I don't want to laugh

423
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,310
Why?

424
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,310
I'm afraid if I laugh too much I'll forget

425
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,480
What do you want to do?

426
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:12,610
Oh, I didn't expect this.

427
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,280
I will be careful

428
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,370
Well, is this why I got beaten?

429
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,030
How come?

430
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:31,300
I feel very happy now

431
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:36,430
I used to be very cheerful but I never had the chance to be cheerful. Now I can breathe a sigh of relief.

432
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:37,970
That's why I always want to laugh

433
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,270
Don't worry, I won't hold you back.

434
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,850
Let's work harder together

435
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:52,900
This person and I

436
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,110
We

437
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,360
Why do we have to work harder every day?

438
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:01,660
It takes a lot of effort to make an extra effort

439
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:05,250
I've had enough, I need to work harder, Yeonjin

440
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:06,330
OK

441
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,560
Teacher, how are you doing?

442
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,140
I am Dong En

443
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,020
Who?

444
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,650
Seonghan High School

445
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,400
I am Wen Dongen who dropped out of school in 2004.

446
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:36,530
Don't you remember?

447
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,660
Who do you say you are?

448
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,500
Hello, Senior

449
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,880
How did you come to this community?

450
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,500
Wen Dongen, why are you here?

451
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:57,050
My parents live here and he is my father

452
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:58,630
Really?

453
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,970
How could we be so predestined?

454
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,350
I am your father's student.

455
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,270
Now you remember who I am?

456
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,110
By the way, teacher

457
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,610
I am a teacher

458
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:20,990
You just said

459
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:21,950
My son

460
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:24,410
What happened?

461
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:27,120
What do you want me to say again?

462
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:49,890
I asked you to come for a nap, but you didn't come. Why did you choose to meet in a place like this?

463
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,150
When we were in school, this was an abandoned building.

464
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,400
It is still

465
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,820
Stop talking nonsense.

466
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:01,950
Don't you want to do

467
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,530
Revenge?

468
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:04,990
Yes

469
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:07,660
Wow, look at your unflinching attitude

470
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:09,790
Why exclude me?

471
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,000
How can I take revenge on you when you have nothing?

472
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:18,840
They all have a lot to lose but you have nothing.

473
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,300
You can really curse someone in person?

474
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:24,050
Being pushed down from this height is a dead end.

475
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,680
Be careful when speaking

476
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:28,720
I know

477
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:31,520
I've stood there before.

478
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,560
Because you bullied me

479
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:35,610
Are you threatening me?

480
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:38,770
You're afraid, aren't you?

481
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,480
Are you looking for death? Damn it

482
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,910
Do you remember Yoon So Hee?

483
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,490
- What? - There was a terrible rumor that she transferred to another school.

484
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,120
The one who committed suicide was Yoon So-hee

485
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:54,250
You should remember

486
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:57,420
Before shouting "Wen Dongen is about to appear"

487
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:01,010
You must have also shouted "Yin Suxi is coming soon"

488
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:09,720
This is where Yoon So Hee fell

489
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,310
She didn't commit suicide

490
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,450
Hey, what are you talking about? It wasn't me.

491
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,070
I didn't kill her

492
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:27,990
Know

493
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:31,450
I asked you to ask for money from the murderer who killed her.

494
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,120
This is the information I have.

495
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:41,050
Who is the murderer?

496
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,130
I said my business comes first

497
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:54,270
There was dog hair everywhere and I had a hard time picking it out.

498
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,890
Ten hairs have roots, right?

499
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,270
However

500
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,150
You shouldn't...

501
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,280
You gave birth to Jae-joon’s child, right?

502
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,360
You will be born faster than me

503
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,490
I will call you after confirmation

504
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,870
I didn't exclude you.

505
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:19,580
How come you have nothing?

506
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,290
There is one you have

507
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,340
Life

508
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,410
Let's go

509
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,750
Don't hit your arm on the back of your hand. I heard it hurts.

510
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,380
Li Sarah, wake up and detoxify, you have to go to the art exhibition

511
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,760
So dazzling

512
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,050
Are you an angel?

513
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:14,260
Wake up!

514
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:16,810
You have a special exhibition today

515
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:20,730
If you want to smoke, smoke something lighter.

516
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:24,570
Aren't there thin cigarettes? Don't you smoke those?

517
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:32,370
(Li Sarah's special exhibition: ideals observed in fantasy)

518
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,620
Hey, I want that one.

519
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:39,620
Send it to the golf course

520
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:42,170
Do you know that the delivery fee for this customer is calculated separately?

521
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,000
Rich people are more stingy

522
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,670
I will deduct the tax and return the rest intact.

523
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,460
Basically it's a skill donation.

524
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:50,670
People like you who pay income tax for labor remuneration will not understand

Sarah Lee

528
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,980
Hey, hide the wine.

529
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,320
This is the wife of Chairman Zhang of Fuyi Machinery

530
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,610
Is that so? Hello

531
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,690
You draw really well.

532
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:15,120
God has given us such a great talent as the painter Li Da

533
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,530
Amen

534
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:20,250
-She bought three paintings-Thank you

535
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,580

Where should I send the home or company package to?

537
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,670
Oh my god

538
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,550
How can our great painter Li pretend so well?

539
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,460
Looks like a normal person

540
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,800
Next month I'm going to receive a super funny award

541
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:36,680
Y'all will come over and make a fool of yourself with me, right?

542
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:39,060
Painter Li Da must also come

543
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,890
Damn it, that's enough

544
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,650
What prize do you want?

545
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,480
(2022 Honorary Alumni Award Ceremony)

546
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:53,450
Wow, it's exactly the same as before.

547
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,610
This is my first time here after graduation.

548
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,780
Really? Didn't you meet your PE teacher after graduation?

549
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:00,870
Whiting dumped his PE teacher and made him cry and make a scene

550
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,790
Were you not in Korea at that time?

551
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:05,000
Well, I was in Paris watching "Paris Lovers"

552
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:08,750
It took three days to download but I watched it anyway

553
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,880
Very good looking

554
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,260
Why doesn't this guy answer the phone?

555
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,300
I have something to ask him

556
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,220
Do you understand?

557
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,220
Can’t get in touch today?

558
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:20,100
Damn it! I also want something from him.

559
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,020
Don’t you know either?

560
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,770
He must be drinking and sleeping somewhere again

561
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:26,310
Stupid guy, why don't you just fire him?

562
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:57,640
Oh my god, it's been a long time.

563
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,010
How are you all doing?

564
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:02,430
She looks so familiar

565
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:07,980
Wow, is this the first time in 17 years that the six sides have faced each other?

566
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,070
Is it the five parties facing each other? Sun Mingwu is not present

567
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,940
By the way, you are Wen Suxi, right?

568
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:16,240
You mixed up Moon Dong-eun and Yoon So-hee

569
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:19,910
I heard she worked in a factory.

570
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,700
How did you get here?

571
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:23,910
You didn't graduate with us.

572
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:27,410
I'm sorry my memory is always blurry, so sad

573
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,870
Anyway, nice to meet you, Suxi

574
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:30,630
Is it Wen Dongen?

575
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,090
I come to this stadium from time to time.

576
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:40,300
But there are many familiar faces here today.

577
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,890
Yeonjin, how are you doing?

578
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,100
I'm watching your show

579
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:50,650
You look so kind on the screen

580
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,320
What about you?

581
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:01,620
How are you doing?

582
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:04,830
I recently changed jobs and I am very busy every day.

583
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:09,250
Buy new clothes and eat high-quality sashimi

584
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:12,540
Are you the chairman of the school under the Shiming Foundation?

585
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:14,210
Congratulations

586
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:20,510
What are you doing?

587
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:22,510
Have you searched my trash can?

588
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,810
Because there is no other way

589
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,350
Your driver's name is Zhao Xiuxian, right?

590
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,270
Your son and future daughter-in-law

591
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:37,610
Did you know that Cho Soo-hyun also has a share in the inheritance you are going to inherit?

592
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,700
Are you threatening me now?

593
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,120
Sorry

594
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:47,330
But the conditions I want to discuss are actually very simple

595
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:50,910
I want the position of head teacher of Class 2, Grade 1, Shiming Primary School

596
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:53,500
I have all the qualifications required

597
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:55,960
The address has been moved to Shiming City

598
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,760
As for my current school, I have already offered to resign voluntarily.

599
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:00,840
You said you are a teacher?

600
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:02,260
Yes

601
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:06,760
Then I will prepare to start working in the new semester, okay?

602
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,850
(Shiming Primary School)

603
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,580
(River Art Rate)

604
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,580
We are now starting the award ceremony

605
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:35,630
Today's winners are

606
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:38,800
23rd alumnus Park Yeon-jin

607
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:44,390
(2022 Honorary Alumni Award Ceremony)

608
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:52,100
From today on, every day

609
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:55,150
Terrible, cruel, and tormenting

610
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,980
Can't stop, can't get rid of

611
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:04,910
Because I will become a rumor that haunts you for a long time

612
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:06,660
Yeonjin

613
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:21,260
Come on Park Yeon-jin!

614
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,840
You are awesome!

615
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:26,510
Well done Yeonjin!

616
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:50,990
