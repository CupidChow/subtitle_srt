Dark Glory

2
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,360
I think the left side should be a little lower.

3
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,240
Master Zheng, move a little to the left

4
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,030
How about moving this one a little to the right?

5
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,950
(Zhou Ruzheng Plastic Surgery)

6
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,000
My hand might touch you

7
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:29,960
Don't be scared

8
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,180
When I was in the auto repair shop

9
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,640
A cufflink fell off

10
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,310
I'm like a madman

11
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,480
Crawling on the ground

12
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,450
Scary, right?

13
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:59,820
My scars

14
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:01,870
That's called a wound

15
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,330
Next time you fall, call me.

16
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,830
Don't aggravate the wound

17
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,380
I've been to rock bottom so I know

18
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,960
The weight of resentment

19
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,310
Wait a minute, I'll sew new buttons on for you.

20
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,440
Come

21
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,500
Trust me

22
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,460
My needlework skills are better than most tailors.

23
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,890
But who is that person?

24
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,100
Who are you trying to defeat by learning Go from me?

25
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,900
The user you dialed has turned off his phone. After the beep, the call will be transferred to the voicemail.

26
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,920
Have you been here all this time?

27
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,170
I thought you weren't home

28
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,250
I'm going to work

29
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,220
What? Why are you suddenly nostalgic?

30
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,220
I never thought you would look these up yourself.

31
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,640
You said you were high school classmates?

32
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,230
This is a photo of Whiting before he had a nose and breast augmentation.

33
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,650
I should also have breast augmentation. Do you think I should do it?

34
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,820
Isn’t the person named Sun Mingwu in this photo?

35
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,860
Let me see where he is.

36
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:06,450
But you

37
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,490
How do you know enlightenment?

38
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,080
Do you see each other often?

39
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,620
Jeon Jae-jun, Son Myeong-oh and others

40
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,750
Occasionally

41
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,290
Because I went to Jae-joon's store to try on clothes

42
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,880
Sun Mingwu has been out of contact recently

43
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,890
Ahem, it's embarrassing.

44
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,720
He will do some ridiculous things

45
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,310
Did Mingwu also come to find you?

46
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,140
Threatening you or something?

47
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,640
What did he threaten you with?

48
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,610
I feel like something is fishy.

49
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,730
You and your friends are the same

50
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,150
As soon as I heard Sun Mingwu's name, I asked if I had been threatened.

51
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,030
Drive carefully

52
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:10,140
(Historical destination: Platinum Diamond Golf Club)

53
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,140
Did he meet Jae-joon?

54
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,780
It's Ha Do-young

55
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,030
President of Zaiping Construction Company

56
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,370
He is Park Yeon-jin's husband

57
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,370
What happened to the perpetrator's husband?

58
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,580
One day, after I have taken my revenge,

59
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,170
I want Yeon-jin to be alone

60
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,050
Whether it's a friend, a parent, a daughter or a husband

61
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,350
Anyone

62
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,770
No form of love can stay

63
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,190
That chess game

64
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:08,400
Did you win?

65
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,700
Won

66
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,370
Because my teacher is excellent

67
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,710
The door lock code is 3724

68
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,590
A few months or a few years

69
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,180
Play another game of chess with me.

70
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,260
My next son

71
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,810
Then one day you come over and make the next move

72
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,770
Then I will know you have been here

73
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,560
It's okay if you don't answer the phone

74
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,190
It's okay if you don't call me

75
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,730
This is how you keep in touch with me

76
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,030
That's enough

77
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,410
As long as you say it, no matter what you say

78
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,540
I will treat it as an imperial decree.

79
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,540
I will dance with swords happily

80
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,440
Write your name here

81
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,350
Good

82
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,980
-I heard this place is very effective-Is it true?

83
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:31,950
In love?

84
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,080
Hey

85
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,790
Do so many girls usually come here?

86
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:42,960
Is this place very spiritual?

87
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,500
I don't know. It's my first time here.

88
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,880
But I heard from friends who have been here before that

89
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,260
The wizard will give you a fundamental solution

90
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,090
Fundamental?

91
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,550
Next

92
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,470
Kang Hyun-ah

93
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,680
Is Jiang Xianya here?

94
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,230
Oh Kang Hyun-ah!

95
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,400
This is me

96
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,700
That's a grease stain.

97
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,740
Can it be washed off?

98
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,660
Both are OK

99
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,120
Do I need to replace this button with a new one?

100
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,620
Buttons

101
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,250
Just leave it like that

102
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:36,010
A wreath has been sent to Dr. Zhou Ruzheng to congratulate him on his opening

103
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:39,060
These are the letters sent to the hospital.

104
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:39,970
Thank you very much

105
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,430
This guy

106
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,190
Did you send your credit card bill here?

107
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,420
(Recipient: Zhou Ruzheng)

108
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,760
(Sender: Jiang Yongtian, Qingsong Prison)

109
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,420
(Director of Seoul Zhou Hospital was stabbed to death by a patient)

110
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,220
(Serial killer Jiang Yongtian was arrested on the spot)

111
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,900
(Hello, Dr. Zhou Ruzheng, I am Jiang Yongtian)

112
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,900
(Your father is a good man)

113
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,440
(I remember the pungent smell of blood)

114
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,320
(The blade pierced into the neck and the blood vessels burst)

115
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,740
Beast

116
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,580
Beast

117
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,520
1.82 m

118
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,230
75 kg

119
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,430
You should at least have some basic morals, Dong En.

120
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,310
Why did you choose such a sacred place for robbery?

121
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,270
I like it here

122
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,560
Feel your Father in heaven

123
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,020
Will notarize it for us

124
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,660
I don't have to count them one by one, right?

125
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,870
I used to be worse than dog shit

126
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:31,080
Now that you have some knowledge in your head, you have become so mean

127
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:33,960
I'm leaving now.

128
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,040
I, a bitch, have other plans later.

129
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,710
Hey, you can't go to heaven now.

130
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,800
But I can

131
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,510
Me

132
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,970
I confessed what I did to you and I was redeemed.

133
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,390
Your backer is so reliable

134
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:55,690
Pretty good

135
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,480
You must go to heaven when you die

136
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,980
Because your life will be like hell

137
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,240
What do you mean by that?

138
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,110
Not finished yet?

139
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,070
Take your hands off

140
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,990
Otherwise I will put your father in the pastor's office

141
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,910
Also called out for notarization

142
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,080
Hey, bitch!

143
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,170
Give me your answer before you go.

144
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,330
Hello!

145
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,180
Are we going to have class here?

146
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,020
Today you will take a level test

147
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,680
Don't worry, it's very simple

148
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,480
You go take the exam. I'll wait for you.

149
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,150
What level test?

150
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,900
I want to send you to study abroad

151
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:43,650
Go to the United States

152
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:44,650
Study abroad?

153
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,780
Something unexpected happened and I can't tutor you anymore.

154
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,240
So I'm going to find you a better teacher.

155
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,160
Really

156
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,290
Aren't you bragging too much?

157
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,540
How can you send me to study abroad? Even in the United States?

158
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,040
Are you rich?

159
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:02,960
Yeah

160
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,960
I just got a lot of money

161
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,640
Come in

162
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,970
(Follow-up: Is the money ready, sister-in-law?)

163
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,900
My daughter is really cool today

164
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,820
Just like Son Heung-min

165
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,080
But the student wearing pink socks

166
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,040
I really have no idea about fair competition.

167
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,620
That will hurt others

168
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,420
Is that No. 2 Kim Ji-wook?

169
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,460
Yes, he makes tackles all the time.

170
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:48,840
Is that so?

171
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,840
Yes

172
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:53,680
Dad has a parent visit class next Friday

173
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,180
Only dads please come

174
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,470
But it's okay if you can't come.

175
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,560
I like busy dads

176
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:02,900
How could that be?

177
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,860
No matter how busy my dad is, he has to go.

178
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,240
By the way, Yilu

179
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,570
Your new head teacher

180
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,330
Mom doesn't like her very much

181
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,830
What do you think? Are you okay?

182
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,660
No, they are friends.

183
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,290
Friend?

184
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,040
Who is it?

185
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,250
Our head teacher and mother

186
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,380
They were friends in high school.

187
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,300
Ha Do Young?

188
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,640
Why are you suddenly asking about Yeon-jin’s husband?

189
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,890
I wonder what kind of guy he is.

190
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,020
I realized I knew nothing about him

191
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,520
He is a good guy on the surface but he is actually bad.

192
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,610
You always run into that kind of person when you're waiting for your flight.

193
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:50,110
They think that stewardesses are just maids who can speak a little English.

194
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,280
Damn, I don't know how many competitors I've left behind.

195
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,290
This is Vera Wang's new model

196
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,830
This mermaid style

197
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,080
Very suitable for people with good figure like you

198
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,710
How is it?

199
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,470
Does it look good?

200
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,510
It's exactly the type I like

201
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,510
Back to the point

202
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,140
What is a good person who is actually evil?

203
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,350
What's the difference with me?

204
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,690
You are a beast from the outside.

205
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,770
But what did Ha Do-young say?

206
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,110
Only if you look closely can you tell it's a beast

207
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,400
The point is that he has no ill intentions

208
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,900
It's just that I've always been used to ordering others around since I was a child.

209
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,780
It turns out that the look in his eyes that day was that kind of look

210
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,540
Have you met Yeon-jin's husband?

211
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,450
Why?

212
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,620
You and Yeon-jin were discovered?

213
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,040
Whiting

214
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,750
Hmm?

215
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,260
Even if Yeonjin and I are discovered, it won't be your turn.

216
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,130
You should be more sensible

217
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,470
This wedding dress suits you very well

218
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,310
You should get married

219
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,930
Otherwise, where can you find one at your age?

220
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,560
The boyfriend who bought you a Vera Wang wedding dress?

221
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,980
You must ask your boyfriend.

222
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,810
Which hotel did he hold his wedding at last?

223
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,150
They can give you a discount.

224
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:11,900
Remarried guests are also considered regulars

225
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,160
Isn't he the groom?

226
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,290
Do you want to try other wedding dresses?

227
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:28,920
Didn’t you say this is the most expensive?

228
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,710
Change my bra size or I'll be strangled!

229
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,020
Asshole

230
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,380
It's bigger than Yeonjin's.

231
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,300
It’s okay as long as it’s big. What’s the problem?

232
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:24,100
Snow White also spent her life with seven people.

233
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:25,770
Why?

234
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,980
Because they went to the mines to dig for gold

235
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,650
(Who knows the address of Sun Mingwu?)

236
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,220
The user you dialed cannot be connected and will be transferred to voicemail after the beep.

237
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,850
Where are you? You're not at home either.

238
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,310
Have you met my husband?

239
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,900
His car navigation system has your golf course address.

240
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:16,650
(Jaejun posted a new message)

241
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,830
Huiting, if you go to his house, please help me find my watch.

242
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,950
No. 34-9, Eulseo-ro, Jongno-gu

243
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,370
Password unknown

244
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,790
(Jaejun calls)

245
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,500
Why can't you get in touch with me? Where are you now?

246
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,920
You were the one who didn't answer my call first, right?

247
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,050
I'm very busy recently. Did you read my text message?

248
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,680
Let's meet and talk. Where are you now?

249
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,260
Well, maybe another day

250
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,100
I'm out of town for a family reunion.

251
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,480
Art Rate

252
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:01,950
Art Rate

253
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:56,960
Sorry

254
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,250
Uncle is so happy to see you

255
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,050
I can cross the road too.

256
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,090
Never mind

257
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,050
Where is mom?

258
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:09,050
Oh, today, uncle is the only one who comes to see you.

259
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,310
What do you like?

260
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:15,390
Game console? Doll?

261
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,480
I like stocks

262
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,310
Samsung Electronics or Kakao Corporation

263
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,770
What?

264
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,940
Just kidding

265
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:24,610
My mother said that if someone asked me this, I would answer

266
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,070
Oh

267
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,830
Wow, an 8 year old can understand this joke.

268
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,200
Wow you are awesome...

269
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,080
You are very smart

270
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,750
Who did you inherit your genius IQ from?

271
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,930
This is a child protection area.

272
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,640
Be careful or I'll break your hand. Damn it.

273
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,060
Can't you see any children here?

274
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:03,900
Uncle has decided

275
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:06,530
I just made up my mind

276
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,280
From today on I will protect you

277
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:14,290
I Love You, Ye-Ryul

278
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,000
Oh my god, it stinks

279
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,260
What's wrong with this guy?

280
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,510
Did he slip away or not?

281
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,260
This damn guy

282
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,520
I really stole Jaejoon's things.

283
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,070
Oh my god!

284
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:45,940
Shouldn't you go to church? What are you doing there?

285
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,490
Prayer can be done anytime and anywhere

286
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,030
I'm curious which sister will come.

287
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:51,740
It turned out to be Whiting

288
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,200
You crazy woman, you are speechless

289
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,950
Why are you curious about that?

290
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,830
Don't you know that criminals will return to the scene of their crimes?

291
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,920
Cut the crap

292
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,290
Where is Sun Mingwu? Wasn't he here when you came?

293
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,840
Did you translate all these?

294
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,880
Yeah

295
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,710
“Knock and the door will be opened to you”

296
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,470
So I knocked and the door opened.

297
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,090
Look, I got a response.

298
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,680
When you take it off, the clothes will smell

299
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,600
Damn, I have to see this guy.

300
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,020
If he suddenly showed up at my wedding

301
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,140
Post weird photos

302
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,230
Then I'm done!

303
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:22,440
Why would he be so sincere in trying to trick you?

304
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,190
Because he can't have me

305
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,110
Hey, do you know what he said to me on the phone?

306
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,240
How do I know?

307
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,150
This guy seems to be traveling

308
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,070
Travel?

309
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:33,740
Vladivostok?

310
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,240
Why are you going to Russia?

311
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:38,120
Oh, do you really want to be a dog?

312
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,410
Are we going to go sledding there?

313
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,330
What?

314
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,580
Is it true that you are going to Russia?

315
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,380
Then why didn't you go?

316
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,000
Damn it!

317
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,050
-It's not really because of me, is it? -He didn't go?

318
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,670
Don't you have your passport?

319
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,600
Oh my god, why are you yelling?

320
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,310
The lights were on inside and I saw everything.

321
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,390
Open the door quickly!

322
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:05,150
Aren't you anxious?

323
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:08,020
Why don’t you answer the phone when someone wants to come and see the house?

324
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,570
What? It's like something big happened.

325
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,580
-Did you read the message in the group? -It seems he is dead

326
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:19,740
What not to say at the same time?

327
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,370
Sun Mingwu is missing

328
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,620
We went to his house and the landlord said he couldn't contact him.

329
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:25,130
He has given up the lease of his house.

330
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,040
The luggage is packed

331
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,040
There are still plane tickets at home

332
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:27,960
Something is wrong

333
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,880
Then you call the police.

334
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,380
Call the police

335
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,670
What's the point of you calling me?

336
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,630
Call the police? What police should I call?

337
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,800
Well, we're just saying it's a little weird.

338
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:37,930
Do you need to call the police if it's strange?

339
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,720
Yes, Sarah is right.

340
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,770
I'm getting married soon and the police department is so...

341
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,270
Why are you ordering me around?

342
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,560
I have to go shoot on location. I'm busy.

343
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,030
That

344
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:53,490
Didn’t Sun Mingwu call you?

345
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:54,570
Before he disappeared

346
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,750
I often call

347
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,130
After all, he is Jun's driver.

348
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,710
What specific time are you talking about?

349
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,880
Around October 19th or 20th

350
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,340
Why do you ask this?

351
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,430
Because I received a very strange phone call

352
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:24,600
So I want to know if he called you guys too.

353
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,310
What's strange?

354
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,480
I got a call from him

355
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:32,690
Right?

356
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,610
What did he say? How did he tell you?

357
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,030
I don't know why he said he wanted to give me a gift.

358
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,530
I thought he was talking nonsense so I hung up

359
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,490
And he was not in his right mind at that time.

360
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,290
So you received a gift?

361
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,130
Damn, I was confessed to!

362
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:51,630
That bastard suddenly said he liked me

363
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,590
Ask me to go to Russia to see him!

364
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,380
I'm not stupid

365
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,260
Now that I think about it, it’s even more infuriating and hateful

366
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,180
I said how could he like me?

367
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,560
It's like a toad wanting to eat swan meat.

368
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,030
What mistake did you make to Sun Mingwu?

369
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,860
He even confessed his feelings to me

370
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,660
You were taught a lesson by him.

371
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,200
Oh my god, I am dying of laughter

372
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,660
I'm leaving first

373
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,290
I have to go shoot a location, don't call me

374
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:28,290
So that's how it is

375
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:30,500
I wonder how you know their password.

376
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,790
696969

377
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,130
Don't you know that? How did you get in?

378
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:36,210
I've been there a few times before

379
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,430
I just don't remember how I got there

380
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:40,720
I wish you two love each other

381
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,390
Damn it! That’s not true!

382
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:48,390
Saturday at 3 p.m.

383
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,020
The password for safe deposit box C7 is 4885

384
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,360
(Storage and transfer of items)

385
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,990
(Resume is quiet and beautiful)

386
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,410
Teacher An Jingmei?

387
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,630
Yes, nice to meet you.

388
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,880
I have often heard of you

389
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,590
Please take care

390
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:58,510
You too

391
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,380
Please take care

392
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,590
How are you feeling?

393
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:05,970
Very good

394
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:08,600
I sleep well and start exercising

395
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,600
You said you opened a clinic in Shiming City

396
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,850
Congratulations

397
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,310
Thank you

398
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,190
Last time you asked me to change the surroundings

399
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:19,110
I regret that I didn't take your advice sooner.

400
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,860
How about a nice meal?

401
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,070
There are many restaurants in Shiming City

402
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,580
The sound of vitamin effervescent tablets foaming

403
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,990
Does it calm you down lately?

404
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:34,920
I came to say goodbye to you.

405
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,170
I think I won't be able to come later.

406
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,510
Two hours round trip, come once a month

407
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,300
Is this difficult too?

408
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,930
No, it's not because of the distance.

409
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,640
It's because you didn't heal me at all.

410
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:06,090
So what shit did you pull this time?

411
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,930
Who pooped, you bastard? Damn it.

412
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:10,300
You don't have to wipe my ass this time.

413
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,100
There is a small and precious thing

414
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,270
I want to take it back

415
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,190
Small and precious?

416
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,110
Gemstone?

417
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,440
Hey, have you resorted to stealing?

418
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:26,610
I was stolen, damn it.

419
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:30,450
Hey, friend

420
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:32,870
Listen to me carefully

421
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,580
Okay, let me tell you the conclusion first.

422
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:38,790
This is impossible.

423
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:40,330
Can't get the child back

424
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,920
Why not?

425
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,050
Why? I am her father.

426
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:46,380
You are not the father, you are the biological father

427
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,260
Children born during the couple's marriage

428
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,590
Legally presumed to be the couple's children

429
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:52,890
So her father is Ha Do Young

430
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,100
Hey, where the hell is there such a thing?

431
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,390
I have done a paternity test

432
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,440
The consistency is over 99%. Isn't this scientifically proven?

433
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,230
Why do you do that when you have nothing to do?

434
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,980
Don't even mention 99%, even if it's more than 990%

435
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,400
Unless the legal father abandons the child

436
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,240
You are always second

437
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,450
You bastard, you have to

438
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:14,240
Filing a lawsuit or something?

439
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:18,120
A third party other than parents does not have the conditions to sue at all

440
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,960
Why am I the third party? I'm her father, damn it.

441
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:22,670
Damn

442
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,250
Where is this kind of bullshit law?

443
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,340
For example, one party is in prison or on a long business trip

444
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,880
Only this kind of surface can clearly see

445
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:34,100
When the legal parents are unable to conceive

446
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,180
Only third parties are eligible to sue

447
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,140
But is this possible?

448
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,310
No, they have a very good relationship.

449
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,570
So did the legal father abuse the child?

450
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,150
If so, why would I look for you? You idiot

451
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,400
I'll just go to the police station.

452
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:51,320
Then

453
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,780
In this case, the advantage to you is not to sue.

454
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,950
It is the legal mother's divorce

455
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:01,290
Because custody is another matter.

456
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,380
Divorce?

457
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,420
I went to the wizard

458
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:13,010
But no clear clues have been found yet.

459
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,010
I need to go there a few more times and then I'll tell you later

460
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,600
Then

461
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,560
You don't want to take out the eggs?

462
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,600
How is that possible? I'm really here to work.

463
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:24,900
Oh, what is that?

464
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,150
The guys who rent cars

465
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:33,910
We caught him red-handed

466
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:38,790
(Item storage and transfer box)

467
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:48,000
I started tracking them from the safe deposit box

468
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,550
They took the Northern Main Line for a while.

469
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:55,300
Then we went to Namyangju and checked into a hotel.

470
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:02,180
I was thinking about whether to withdraw.

471
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,100
Guess who showed up?

472
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:13,950
Yes, that's the policeman who went to see the wizard with Park Yeon-jin's mother.

473
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,160
It turns out they are all in the same group

474
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:17,780
Incredible, isn’t it?

475
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,790
I'm not nervous now.

476
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,710
So I thought about it

477
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:28,380
If I were reborn in my next life, I would be a spy.

478
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,010
I will wear bright red lipstick then

479
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:33,380
Wear a leather jacket

480
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:37,050
You can wear bright red lipstick in your life

481
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,390
I think Sun Mingwu

482
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,850
Hey, how can I...

483
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:41,310
It shouldn't be a simple disappearance.

484
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:43,100
Why else would I wear red lipstick?

485
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,850
Not just a disappearance?

486
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,150
That Sun Mingwu

487
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:50,520
Really

488
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,280
Dead?

489
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,910
I think these people are Park Yeon-jin's people.

490
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,910
Help her deal with matters beyond the law

491
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:02,240
That policeman is not Park Yeon-jin's backer

492
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:04,830
On the contrary, Park Yeon-jin is the policeman's backer

493
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:07,290
So what you said

494
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,540
What is beyond the law is...

495
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,250
Yes

496
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,960
This is the reason why Sun Mingwu disappeared

497
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,630
Sun Mingwu didn't trust me and went on his own

498
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,390
He has already bought the plane ticket

499
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,810
So he must have met Park Yeon-jin

500
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,180
Then it disappeared

501
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,060
What should I do then?

502
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:31,650
Then…

503
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:36,070
What do you want from Sun Mingwu?

504
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,080
We are on the same side now

505
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:47,960
Who among the four people killed Yoon So-hee?

506
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,630
Park Yeon-jin

507
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:03,720
Good job!

508
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:05,850
However

509
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,690
Yeonjin must know about Yoon So-hee's stay at Zhou Hospital

510
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:12,690
Do you have any evidence?

511
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:14,860
Can it be proved that Park Yeon-jin is the murderer?

512
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:21,700
When Suxi fell that day, she was holding this thing in her hand

513
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,120
(Park Yeon-jin)

514
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,290
Why is this in your place?

515
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,840
Were you there that day?

516
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,260
Now you are there too.

517
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,350
Because we are on the same side now

518
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,640
Oh my god!

519
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,070
I'm going crazy

520
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:58,940
I asked her for 1 billion won?

521
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,650
Call me after you make an appointment with Yeon-jin

522
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,950
I'll give you this brand then.

523
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,910
No matter how much you ask her

524
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,290
That money is all yours

525
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:13,710
I want something else

526
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,040
Something else? Something else?

527
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:20,170
Park Yeon-jin's confession

528
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,800
If Sun Mingwu can get the money

529
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:25,970
That means she pleaded guilty.

530
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:27,930
Sun Mingwu promised me

531
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,560
He will record the whole process

532
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:34,980
However

533
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,360
Wasn't the case concluded as suicide?

534
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,320
Can the conclusion be overturned by confession alone?

535
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,990
So I want to destroy her through social means

536
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,200
Because taking legal action is not good for me

537
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:50,580
I want to get Park Yeon-jin's confession

538
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,500
Expose her crimes to the world

539
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,880
Let her feel the burning pain for the rest of her life

540
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,260
The feeling of pus dripping

541
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,930
I want her to stop laughing and eat.

542
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:05,640
I can't live a comfortable day

543
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:11,520
Then we will never hear it.

544
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,230
Have you got Park Yeon-jin's confession?

545
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,020
We can't go look for Sun Mingwu's body.

546
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:19,770
What to do?

547
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,240
First, look for

548
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,070
How to find it?

549
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,280
Relaxation

550
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,830
What can this test detect?

551
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:41,420
It can detect 12 sexually transmitted diseases, so basically everything can be detected

552
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,670
You added a human papillomavirus test

553
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,180
So both common bacteria and sexually transmitted infection bacteria can be detected

554
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,220
In addition to those

555
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,800
It won't detect anything else, right?

556
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:54,480
This is the file you asked for, auntie.

557
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,020
Proof of family relationship

558
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,230
University diploma

559
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,020
and gynecological examination results

560
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:00,690
You just send a message.

561
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,820
Who still runs around with documents these days?

562
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,950
I'll just take a look at this.

563
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,070
Which bank do you mainly use?

564
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:09,990
Hmm?

565
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:13,080
It would piss me off if you had a bunch of negative balance accounts

566
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,830
Just tell me which bank

567
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,040
The rest I will do by myself...

568
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:18,210
Teacher Wen?

569
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,250
Teacher Wen!

570
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,210
Oh, long time no see!

571
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,920
How long has it been since we last met?

572
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:28,720
You are getting more and more beautiful

573
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:34,270
Cui Huiting?

574
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:40,020
Do you two know each other?

575
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,650
She is my son's girlfriend

576
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:44,480
Oh, we are high school classmates.

577
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:49,110
It seems I can't call you aunt anymore.

578
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,820
Ouch, what are you talking about?

579
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:53,530
She can't be compared with Teacher Wen

580
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,580
I'm sad that you said that.

581
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,750
We will have dinner in the temple

582
00:38:57,830 --> 00:38:59,580
If you can, please eat with us.

583
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:01,670
I already have other plans today.

584
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,000
Are you getting married?

585
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,130
Congratulations

586
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:15,350
Next time I come to the Dharma Assembly, I will leave enough time for Aunt

587
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,930
Okay, then you go.

588
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:24,020
I put a lot of effort into getting Tae-woo to marry you.

589
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,150
What a pity

590
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,910
Oh, this dead guy is really

591
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,240
But why didn't you say hello?

592
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:38,080
Teacher Wen is very happy to see you

593
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,120
Just because it was too sudden

594
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:44,090
We were not very close in school.

595
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:46,750
Auntie, please wait a moment.

596
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,470
Dong En!

597
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,270
It was so sudden that we didn’t have time to talk, right?

598
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,560
Oh my god, isn’t this such a coincidence?

599
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:03,940
Nice to meet you

600
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,690
Can we talk now?

601
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,160
OK

602
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,950
What are you busy with?

603
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:22,210
Why don't you answer the phone?

604
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:24,710
Do you know how many calls I made?

605
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:25,920
You hit 17 times

606
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:28,420
So I said Yeonjin

607
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,420
Don't you have anything to say to me?

608
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:33,430
What?

609
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,850
Why on earth did you meet my husband?

610
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:38,720
You really have nothing to say to me?

611
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:40,310
Don't change the subject

612
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,440
Who said we should meet first? You or my husband?

613
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,900
First of all, it's not me you want to see

614
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,740
Your husband came to your house in person.

615
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,830
First fucking ask me where Sun Mingwu is

616
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:00,450
Now I'm asking you!

617
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,670
You really have nothing to say to me?

618
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,380
What?

619
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,590
What about Wen Dongen being Yilu's class teacher?

620
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:16,340
That one counts

621
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:17,800
But there is something else

622
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:19,310
Anything else?

623
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:22,180
What do you want to know? Please tell me more specifically.

624
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:28,190
You are crazy

625
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:31,360
You are crazy

626
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,740
How dare you make my daughter become Ha Do-young’s daughter?

627
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,490
Give me a good answer

628
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:38,660
You only found out she was Jeon Yi-rok after you gave birth.

629
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,240
I still know that she is a full-time

630
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:42,660
Pretend she's Ha Ye-ryul's reincarnation?

631
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:46,580
I'm really curious

632
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:49,960
You knew you were pregnant with my daughter.

633
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,170
Are you still continuing your marriage?

634
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,170
You know this very well.

635
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,130
And abandon me again?

636
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:58,010
Damn, you have...

637
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,140
Have you ever loved me?

638
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,690
If my capillaries burst, I won’t be able to appear on camera tomorrow!

639
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,330
-Jiyuan-Runxi

640
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:08,250
Han Rate

641
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,000
How are you?

642
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:26,770
Rain

643
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:36,860
We've been meeting quite frequently lately.

644
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:39,190
We'll become good friends if this continues.

645
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,280
What are you doing here?

646
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,410
Actually, I have an illegitimate child.

647
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,250
Just kidding

648
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:54,540
I came to see my classmates

649
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:01,380
Not in that group of people

650
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,530
Nice to meet you all

651
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,110
I am Wen Dongen, the head teacher of Class 2, Grade 1.

652
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:31,000
She and I are classmates

653
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:34,420
Wen Dongen, head teacher of Class 2, Year 1

654
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:42,680
I heard

655
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,430
You and Yeon-jin graduated from the same high school

656
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:48,430
Did Yeon-jin tell you that?

657
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,970
They didn't have a very good relationship at that time.

658
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,350
It seems that you have a good relationship with her.

659
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,440
I have seen everything I should and shouldn't see.

660
00:44:57,230 --> 00:44:58,270
It can be said that we have a deep friendship

661
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:00,530
I know

662
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:04,410
What is the skin like under that clothing?

663
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,790
Yes, I suddenly became curious

664
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:16,130
Before you

665
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:20,210
Have you ever had something precious to you taken away by someone else?

666
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,060
Okay, let's start the visit class now

667
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:43,060
