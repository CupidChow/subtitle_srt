1
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:05,980
Dark Glory

2
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,440
Dong En!

3
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,150
It happened so suddenly that we didn’t have time to talk about it, right?

4
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:17,490
Oh my god, isn’t this such a coincidence?

5
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:18,870
Nice to meet you

6
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,790
Let's talk now

7
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,160
Is it okay?

8
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,210
OK

9
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,170
This side

10
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,740
Spare me, Dong En

11
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,650
Please forgive me this time.

12
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,990
I made mistakes before.

13
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,620
I don't want your forgiveness. I don't have any excuses.

14
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,740
It's really all my fault

15
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,210
I have always lived with a heart of atonement and will

16
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:09,170
I'm serious Dongen

17
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:13,460
I haven't even started yet and you're already kneeling

18
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,380
What should we do next?

19
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,590
You know, my parents run a laundry business.

20
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,260
I really didn't want to, but they...

21
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,600
So I have no choice

22
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,770
We were all too young then

23
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,310
Everyone makes mistakes as they grow up.

24
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,560
Please, Dongen, please?

25
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,440
Then you see whether this is a mistake or an evil deed.

26
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,580
Are you crazy?

27
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,240
I'm a flight attendant!

28
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:52,880
This behavior is called evil stewardess

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,210
Knowing the consequences but still doing it

30
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,670
Intentionally hurting others

31
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,720
You treat me like this every day

32
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,100
I admit I'm sorry

33
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,350
I'm really sorry. I deserve to die.

34
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,480
But Dong En

35
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,480
Could you please forgive me just once?

36
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,690
Please don't tell me that my mother-in-law is wrong.

37
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,190
Please don't contact her directly. I beg you.

38
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,530
Just wait until I get married, okay?

39
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,070
I have already applied for retirement. If this marriage doesn't work out,

40
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,540
If I don't have any income, I'm dead.

41
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,160
Please, Dongen

42
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,540
Your unconventional attitude is a good strategy.

43
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,630
But you are too hasty and too rash

44
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,170
I don't want to ask you for anything.

45
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,260
Whether it's money or an apology

46
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,800
You've already done everything, kneel down and beg for mercy

47
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,010
You also used threats.

48
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,100
Let's try the next trick

49
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,430
Damn

50
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,100
So what?

51
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,110
What do you want?

52
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,480
What do you want? You bitch!

53
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,360
Have you ever lost your phone?

54
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,000
That's right.

55
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,500
That's the phone you lost.

56
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:20,880
Is that you?

57
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,920
Wasn’t it Sun Mingwu who posted those photos?

58
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,590
You are crazy!

59
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,010
So think about it

60
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,680
I know how well you should be

61
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,100
From now on you have only one way to live

62
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,100
Think about it

63
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,020
What are you best at?

64
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,650
Then I won't meet your future mother-in-law

65
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,580
I

66
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,750
From today until death, I will follow you, Dongen

67
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,250
What do you want me to do first?

68
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,050
Understanding the disappearance

69
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,300
Call the police first

70
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,400
Thank you

71
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,440
Beware

72
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,380
Ha Ye-ryul looks ahead

73
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:02,900
Is there anything else you want to say to me?

74
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,320
Nothing

75
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,690
Seeing the children laugh makes me happy too.

76
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,610
It's like watching an air purifier commercial.

77
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,950
I never thought about getting married.

78
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,120
Because all the adjectives about married men are bad.

79
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,950
Same playing with women

80
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,290
If you are single, you are romantic, but if you are married, you are cheating.

81
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,960
- Really? - There are a lot of kids here.

82
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,750
Wow, you're a good dad.

83
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,670
However

84
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,590
You are a bit boring

85
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,630
I think Ye-ryul has a good sense of humor

86
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,600
Who did she inherit it from?

87
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,430
What are you doing? Just now in the classroom

88
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,690
Oh my god, I feel like you're going to hit someone.

89
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,270
There are many children here

90
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,110
Then I'll take my leave.

91
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,820
I have to meet my classmates

92
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,870
Oh, right.

93
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,790
Have you contacted Mingwu?

94
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,380
I don't need to contact him now.

95
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,130
Today I figured it out

96
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,200
Stand here and don't move

97
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,700
If you come up with your hands, you will be in trouble.

98
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,740
Hello here

99
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,430
Put your hands down or you will be in trouble

100
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,300
Which class are you guys from?

101
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,600
-The bell rang a long time ago-Damn it

102
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,980
Do you drink a lot of strawberry milk?

103
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,030
No more drinking

104
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,400
Am I right?

105
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,200
Does Wen Dongen have very big breasts?

106
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,800
Hello, Wen Dongen?

107
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,050
The pretty girl that Park Yeon-jin plays with

108
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,930
Became the homeroom teacher of Park Yeon-jin's daughter

109
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,180
Is this a coincidence?

110
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,390
It seems that Yeonjin didn't tell you

111
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,650
I told her it was no coincidence

112
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,900
If this is not a coincidence

113
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,120
It means that from that day in the gym to this moment

114
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,030
It was all planned in advance.

115
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,370
That would be terrible.

116
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,710
You have this side too.

117
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,880
I thought you were just playing basketball somewhere.

118
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,550
I don't know why my premonition of sadness is always so accurate.

119
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,600
Well, it's too late to defend.

120
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,930
There is no way to avoid

121
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,310
Will this revenge only end when everyone has been tricked by you?

122
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,310
Like the plum rain of that year

123
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,990
Wow, now you're going to lose your temper.

124
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,200
I came here just to see how brave you become.

125
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,950
Oh, right.

126
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,250
You seem to have scars on your body?

127
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,750
Is everything okay? Isn't it hot now?

128
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,170
I ask you a question, you have to answer it.

129
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,440
Oh, there is more

130
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,070
Let me relieve your pain

131
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,240
I'm warning you

132
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,700
Don't touch Yeon-jin's daughter

133
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,040
No matter what method

134
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,930
Have you received Ye-ryul's toothbrush?

135
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,140
I guess it's important so I sent it over that day.

136
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:45,850
That

137
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,020
Did you send this?

138
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,520
I also warn you

139
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,730
Don't help Park Yeon-jin in any way.

140
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,070
If you want Ye-ro, I'm the one who can help you now

141
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,660
Not Park Yeon-jin

142
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,620
Since you still don't know, I'll tell you.

143
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,950
I was also someone's daughter at that time.

144
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,790
Jaejun

145
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:24,800
My mother told me

146
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,770
Listen carefully to your teacher

147
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:30,890
Yes

148
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,150
Nice to meet you friend

149
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:39,690
A gift for you

150
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:50,370
(River Art Rate)

151
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,060
Visiting class?

152
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,430
Today?

153
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,020
Yeah, a lot of dads came.

154
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,190
My dad is the most handsome

155
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,230
He Yi rate!

156
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,780
Why don't you keep your promise?

157
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,570
What happened in school and what did the teacher say?

158
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,110
Are you going to tell me that I didn’t tell you?

159
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,910
If there was such a class, you should have told your mother earlier.

160
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,080
I said it last time we had dinner.

161
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,250
I said the dads are coming to school

162
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,670
Oh, mom has been so busy these days.

163
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,710
Sorry

164
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,210
Did your dad talk to the teacher?

165
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,050
Did you greet each other?

166
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,300
No

167
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,260
Dad only chats with Uncle Jae-jun

168
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,600
Did Uncle Jaejun go to your school? To your class?

169
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,830
You said we wanted to have dinner together, and I thought it was interesting at first.

170
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,580
I'm also curious about what you have going on.

171
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,340
But I didn't expect this at all

172
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,050
What does this mean?

173
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,590
No meaning

174
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:12,260
It's similar to sending a fruit basket. I think I can't come empty-handed.

175
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,180
Your contact information and what you like

176
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,390
Jingtai and I asked these questions. I hope they didn't cause you any trouble.

177
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,140
No, but it makes me a little uneasy.

178
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,110
Because the fruit basket is just to my taste

179
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,700
Do you know Wen Dongen?

180
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:37,500
To be exact, I want to know what the relationship between Yeon-jin and Moon Dong-eun is

181
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,840
How do you know Dongen?

182
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:44,960
Let's play Go together

183
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,890
Wow, it's a small world.

184
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,140
Does Yeon-jin know that you came to see me?

185
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,470
She probably doesn't know I'm not going to tell her

186
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:07,110
The relationship between Yeonjin and Dongen is not complicated.

187
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:09,900
We are all high school classmates

188
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,160
Yeon-jin bullied Dong-eun in high school

189
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,410
It's like school violence.

190
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,790
Bullying behavior?

191
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,830
Not "like school violence"

192
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,750
That's school violence.

193
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,010
How did you bully me?

194
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,180
Extremely bad

195
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,690
We are in the same class

196
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,280
We haven't talked.

197
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,490
Right? Dong En

198
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,820
What's the matter?

199
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,280
I said hello but she ignored me

200
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:57,280
Okay

201
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,790
Nothing, I just need your help

202
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,710
Actually, I can't stand the smell of disinfectant.

203
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,420
But it was my turn to clean the toilet.

204
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,840
How is it?

205
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,300
What?

206
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,180
You obviously understood it all

207
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,680
Can you save yourself from hurting your self-esteem by delaying the offer?

208
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,770
Anyway

209
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:23,270
Can I ask you to clean the toilet for me?

210
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,310
Until last week I had a helper

211
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,730
But she transferred to another school

212
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,480
Did Yoon So Hee transfer to another school?

213
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:30,400
Transferred to another school

214
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,280
So we have to find out where she went.

215
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,490
Now it's your turn to answer

216
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:39,370
I really want to hear your voice

217
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,330
If I say I don't want

218
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:45,830
What would you do?

219
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,170
I like quick answers. I don't have patience.

220
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,380
So you say

221
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,130
You don't want to help me?

222
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,550
My patience

223
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:00,760
All used up

224
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,520
Hey Sun Mingwu

225
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,810
How come you can't hold it for even a minute?

226
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:13,860
This is how it all started

227
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,410
The ending is that Wen Dongen dropped out of school on his own

228
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:23,200
For the part in the middle, just ask Yeon-jin directly

229
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,870
Because this is a very passionate story

230
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,590
So Moon Dong-eun wasn't even the first victim?

231
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,670
It seems that you and your spouse rarely talk to each other.

232
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,680
Try it today

233
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,680
I'm leaving first

234
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,180
Oh, right.

235
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,560
Can I ask you a favor?

236
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,310
If you see Dong En

237
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:51,400
Can you tell her I told you all this?

238
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,480
Be sure to tell her

239
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:02,870
Do you like other types of gambling?

240
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:07,290
I once bet my entire life

241
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,870
Did you win?

242
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,210
I was planning to win

243
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:34,440
How could you be so cruel to an old man?

244
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,780
You should give way.

245
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,320
Can I take back my move this time?

246
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,320
That's not right.

247
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,370
That's right, you young man are not a robber.

248
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:44,410
Okay

249
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,580
I lost this game, old man.

250
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:49,960
This is for you

251
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,580
My friend is here

252
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:55,460
You are here

253
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,710
Let's go

254
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:00,970
Am I your friend?

255
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,890
Let's play the next one ourselves.

256
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,390
Please save me

257
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,060
One-on-four, I played three games with them

258
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:28,660
Doesn’t your wife hate you playing Go?

259
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,750
She probably hates more than just that

260
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,170
Are there still people selling that kind of stuff now?

261
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,340
Oh this

262
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,090
The students I used to teach Go invited me to be their guest

263
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,180
I don't know the other person's preferences

264
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,340
You two are so cute

265
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,730
Do you really have friends coming over?

266
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,230
I have to make a phone call

267
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,690
But I haven't sorted out my thoughts yet

268
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:08,240
Do you live near here?

269
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,500
Oh, I just moved here not long ago.

270
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:15,130
Shiming City is pretty good, right? The air is good too.

271
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,710
I didn't move here for practical reasons.

272
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,380
I want to avenge someone

273
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,300
Revenge in Korea

274
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:28,930
It shouldn't be easy

275
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,430
Can't hold a gun

276
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:35,440
Even though half of the country's population can shoot guns

277
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,360
But there is a knife

278
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:43,070
The gun can shoot at long distances

279
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,160
But if you use a knife, you have to get close to the opponent.

280
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,950
So close that it is in the other person's eyes

281
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,700
You can see your own eyeballs

282
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,670
Oh, sorry.

283
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,050
I don't have any patients these days.

284
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,760
I watch Netflix all day so I…

285
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,470
Oh, right.

286
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,850
I have opened a new clinic. Welcome to visit.

287
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,900
There are many male customers, so don't be embarrassed.

288
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,150
Good luck

289
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,650
Hey! I hope it's enough for me to pay the monthly rent

290
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:24,070
No, I mean revenge.

291
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,030
Oh

292
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,950
That does require a lot of luck.

293
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,330
He is quite tall

294
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,870
About 1.78-1.79 meters tall

295
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,380
About 76-77 kg

296
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,050
As for height, you are also tall, senior.

297
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,970
It would be great if I was the only tall person.

298
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,850
Watches, coats, shoes, perfume

299
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,930
Nothing more, nothing less, just the right amount

300
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,930
How to say it?

301
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,190
It's like turning to page 17 of the January issue of Zhizu

302
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:04,860
Oh

303
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:08,570
My father and mother are a little weird

304
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:11,070
My birthday is January 16th

305
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,870
They find it painful to choose a birthday gift for me

306
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:15,830
I was in my third year of high school then.

307
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,250
They say that every year on page 16 of the January issue of Zhizu,

308
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:21,420
Buy me something

309
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,840
Sometimes it's books, sometimes it's a coffee machine

310
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,550
Once I received a sports car.

311
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:34,260
I still don't understand why Ha Do Young is like page 17

312
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:39,100
If you turn to page 16, you will definitely see page 17.

313
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,520
Usually the stuff on that page is cooler

314
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,230
In short

315
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,740
I just changed the phrase "He's annoyingly cool"

316
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:50,950
Speaking calmly so that you won't see through me

317
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,920
Did he contact you?

318
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,130
No

319
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:08,300
I thought he would contact me once the class visit was over.

320
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,220
But he hasn't contacted yet

321
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,350
He probably doesn't like the situation where he doesn't have the initiative.

322
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,310
I can tell from the way he plays chess

323
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,350
Probably on Friday afternoon

324
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:24,110
After finishing his work at the company, he will cancel all weekend trips.

325
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,280
Once you have sorted out all the problems in your mind,

326
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,190
He will contact you

327
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,880
You don't even reply my text messages

328
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,050
Where have you been?

329
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,550
What about the art rate?

330
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:55,600
What time is it?

331
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,390
But my husband

332
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,690
Do you think I should learn Go?

333
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,190
Let me ask you a question

334
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:06,940
Hmm?

335
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,480
Ye-Sul's homeroom teacher

336
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:09,900
Are you friends?

337
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,910
The head teacher you said you don’t like is her?

338
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:20,830
Did you go to the visiting class?

339
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:22,460
I heard

340
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:26,040
I found that she had some misunderstandings about me.

341
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,380
As you can see, she is not my kind.

342
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,340
We have reconciled through dialogue.

343
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,180
What? Did she say anything?

344
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,970
It seems like she should say something

345
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,680
How did you guys talk and reconcile?

346
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:44,850
You said before

347
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,440
Ye-Sul's homeroom teacher is crazy

348
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,820
Do you mean she will hurt Ye-ryul?

349
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,400
Is this why you brought up the idea of studying abroad?

350
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,280
Husband

351
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,120
We have been dating for two years and married for ten years

352
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,750
Twelve years in total

353
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:06,580
Except for the time we were in love, you should have encouraged me in the remaining ten times, right?

354
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,630
How can you ask so hastily?

355
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,840
No matter where you heard it now or in the future

356
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,800
Don't do this, husband.

357
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,470
When you choose something

358
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,890
Always between A and B

359
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,980
Choose the one that looks more shiny.

360
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,940
That's how we got married

361
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:31,190
My body, my voice

362
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,070
My jokes, my conditions

363
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,610
You like them all

364
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,620
So don't open the box you shouldn't open.

365
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,500
I love you, husband

366
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,790
So I don't want you to find out anything.

367
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,130
What's in the box

368
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,260
I won't let it out

369
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,590
I won't let Yi-ryul get hurt.

370
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,010
So my husband

371
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:00,930
Just let me and Ye-ryul

372
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:05,020
Keep shining like you are now, okay?

373
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,560
Please

374
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,770
This box is not shiny, husband

375
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,040
I envy you so much

376
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,380
I can't drink soup

377
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,140
I want to lose 3 kg. The wizard said

378
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,140
What? Isn't it enough if the horoscopes match?

379
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,390
Damn, that's because you're thin

380
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,270
What's the point of being thin? I can't find a match

381
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,940
I envy you so much. You have such a good fortune.

382
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,940
Hey, so the uncle you are paired with

383
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,270
Will I really always be lucky?

384
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:56,530
Yeah

385
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,070
I think it should be OK.

386
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:02,370
My horoscope has more earth, but that uncle has no earth.

387
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,080
It turns out this is very important. How amazing!

388
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,160
What is my Bazi?

389
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,920
Thank you for your hard work

390
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,670
Thank you for your hard work, sister.

391
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,890
Your wound has never healed.

392
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:24,260
I think it's been a while.

393
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,720
Do you want to change the band-aid?

394
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:30,270
Forget it. Don't accept sponsorship from this brand anymore.

395
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,520
My instep is all rubbed!

396
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,780
Come out for a minute. I'm in the parking lot.

397
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,040
What are you talking about?

398
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,870
- Let's finish it. - What do you want to finish?

399
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,170
Your relationship with your husband

400
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:54,960
Please let me be Ye-sol's father

401
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,670
Take this opportunity to change your husband

402
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,470
You are crazy

403
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:03,340
So you still go to Ye-ryul's school?

404
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,050
Stop changing the subject.

405
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,680
Do you love your husband?

406
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,560
You don't even dare to tell him about Wen Dongen

407
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,480
Because you don’t know if your husband will stand by you.

408
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:15,860
Oh no

409
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:18,360
Is it because you know he won't stand by you?

410
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,780
And I know everything

411
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,740
Even though everyone knows it, I still stay where I am

412
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,620
All around you

413
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:29,830
This is love

414
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,000
Is that love?

415
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:35,630
Yes

416
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,750
The love that only you and I don't know

417
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:41,510
Isn’t it?

418
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:44,880
Yes

419
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,180
I have never thought about this question

420
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,140
I love you, husband

421
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,480
So I don't want you to find out anything.

422
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:02,110
That’s right.

423
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,820
I was sincere to him.

424
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,740
I love that person

425
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:12,750
Always in love

426
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,970
To be honest, Yeonjin

427
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,720
I'm so excited and full of anticipation

428
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,270
Sun Mingwu did not go abroad and could not be contacted

429
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,140
Is this situation equivalent to

430
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,980
Where is your confession?

431
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,490
Is it because you want to cover up an incident?

432
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,700
So a new event happened?

433
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,830
Madam, this is hydrogen peroxide for you.

434
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,670
Are you hurt?

435
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,710
Just leave it there and go do your work.

436
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,630
Oh ok

437
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,220
Maybe when you try hard to cover it

438
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:16,850
Instead, it opened Pandora's box

439
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,350
I get excited just thinking about it

440
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,860
(Director Shin Young-jun calls)

441
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,240
Hello?

442
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,700
Are you free tomorrow at noon?

443
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,660
Let me tell you about the things you asked me to do.

444
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:43,090
From the factory she entered after dropping out of school

445
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:45,210
The Shiming Primary School where I work now is all on it.

446
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,630
No record of fines

447
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,760
No medical insurance premiums have been in arrears

448
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,390
She's a model citizen.

449
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,140
Where is her mother now?

450
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,730
Jung Mi-hee?

451
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,140
Do you need that too?

452
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:01,520
Her card was very useful when I was in high school

453
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:03,610
For the poor

454
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,740
Family members are the biggest perpetrators

455
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,820
(Break)

456
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:38,930
But who is that person in the other photo?

457
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,350
After listening to your description, I can recognize the people in the photo.

458
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,770
I can't match the photo.

459
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:50,450
Is that the woman on the far left wearing a red apron?

460
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,580
It's my mom

461
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,000
Are you curious why I put her together with the perpetrators?

462
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,460
That

463
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,340
Can I change the question?

464
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,050
Do you wash your quilt often?

465
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,180
Yes

466
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,510
Oh

467
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,890
Can I ask you a question too?

468
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,850
You're finally curious about me

469
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,400
What's the problem?

470
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,610
Why is the password of your door lock 3724?

471
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:34,450
Passwords are usually someone's birthday or the date they first met.

472
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,530
Numbers that can be guessed, such as license plate numbers

473
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:39,040
But I can't guess what your password is.

474
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:47,290
Do you want to ask a different question?

475
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,810
No. 3724 has a meeting

476
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,910
Sorry ma'am

477
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,370
During my stay here

478
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:26,000
I realized how big of a mistake I had made

479
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,380
I know that even if I apologize a thousand times

480
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,840
It can't erase the sins I committed.

481
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,590
I also know that this is irreversible.

482
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,550
I never knew

483
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:38,010
What?

484
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:39,100
To date

485
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,680
You damn murderer

486
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:46,020
I'm writing letters to my son.

487
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,940
I never knew this

488
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,770
I am emotionally unstable

489
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,860
Unable to withstand social pressure

490
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:56,400
So was there a mistake?

491
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:00,950
Don't tell me shit, dozens of emails have the same content

492
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:04,160
Is it me?

493
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:09,000
My...

494
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:10,880
Not good at writing

495
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,050
Shut up!

496
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,050
You scumbag

497
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:17,050
How dare you approach my son in order to get a reduced sentence?

498
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,510
How dare you let my son go to hell?

499
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,390
You will never be forgiven.

500
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:25,520
If you write that kind of letter to him again

501
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:28,850
I will kill you with my own hands

502
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,150
You are a doctor

503
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,200
What?

504
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:45,120
Your whole family is a doctor

505
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:47,960
You can't kill people, can you?

506
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:53,920
Your husband died because of that oath.

507
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,760
My goal is not to get out of here

508
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,180
It's very comfortable here.

509
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,640
They deliver three meals a day to me and let me exercise

510
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,810
Give me treatment too

511
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,560
Then why do you

512
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,480
Want to write to him?

513
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:12,730
Because I'm bored

514
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:22,320
So he went to hell? Your son

515
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,040
You bastard!

516
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,100
(River Art Rate)

517
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,220
Hello?

518
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,140
Where?

519
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,180
Jongno Police Station?

520
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,480
Who is it?

521
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,230
Is that you? Is that you?

522
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,810
Who reported Sun Mingwu's disappearance to the police? Damn it!

523
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:39,530
Is it Yeon-jin?

524
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:42,450
Last time she asked us to call the police, maybe she did it herself?

525
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,820
How could she possibly do such a tedious task?

526
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,120
That's you. Is that you?

527
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,460
I'm his boss so they called me first.

528
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,420
The most common circumstance that an adult goes missing is that he or she has run away from home.

529
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
A 36-year-old man

530
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,750
Special forces will not deploy Sarah just because of the loss of contact

531
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,170
Is that you?

532
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,170
You are the first person to look for Sun Mingwu

533
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,680
Why me?

534
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,970
What about you? Why did you exclude yourself?

535
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,430
It's you

536
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:15,230
It's definitely you, bitch.

537
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,360
Do you want me to call the police?

538
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,780
Yes, that's me.

539
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:26,410
I called the police

540
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:27,990
But so what?

541
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:31,200
You said he might be dead.

542
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,330
What if he really died?

543
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,710
Am I abnormal? Is it abnormal to report a friend's disappearance to the police?

544
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,790
Aren't you worried that he's alone?

545
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,840
You're crazy you bitch

546
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,550
When did you start caring about Sun Mingwu so much?

547
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,720
It turns out that there is a reason why you got his confession

548
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,720
You slept with that guy too?

549
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:55,060
Hmm? Is there any?

550
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,980
Who the hell are you talking about?

551
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,230
Mingwu confessed his love to her?

552
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:00,610
Oh my god

553
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:03,030
Isn’t your crotch always public property?

554
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,740
Hey, did you do this on purpose?

555
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,320
What is your purpose?

556
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,120
I bought medicine from him

557
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,200
In recent years, prescription drugs have also been obtained in his name.

558
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,330
You know all this

559
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:16,500
Once the investigation into his disappearance begins, I will be the first one to be arrested.

560
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,540
You clearly know everything, so why did you call the police?

561
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,000
Such a huge amount of information

562
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,960
-I'm leaving-let go

563
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:24,840
Letting go

564
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,090
Let me go, damn!

565
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:30,850
If the police really contact me

566
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:35,430
I'm really going to kill you, you bitch.

567
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,600
(Delivery in the early morning)

568
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:41,520
What is this?

569
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,520
Is it spicy cabbage?

570
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:45,990
No

571
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:52,160
Korean won and US dollars should be deposited separately into the account

572
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,910
Then give me the average balance certificate.

573
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:57,200
What are these?

574
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:01,330
Have you applied for a passport for Shan Ya?

575
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,250
Hmm?

576
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:03,630
Oh

577
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,630
Here

578
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,380
But why do you need a passport?

579
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,850
These should be submitted to the study abroad agency

580
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,310
Your signature is required

581
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,770
(First-class study abroad)

582
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:20,440
I want to send Shan Ya to study abroad

583
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:24,320
Study abroad?

584
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,940
I am gradually moving forward with my original plan.

585
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,320
Your thing

586
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:31,820
It will start on the day Sun-Ah goes abroad.

587
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,410
Shanya Club in the United States

588
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,950
Hearing the news of my father's death

589
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,130
I lied

590
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:47,000
There will never be a day when you can cook soup for dinner

591
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,340
You

592
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,890
Will lose Shan Ya

593
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,310
But she'll be fine.

594
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,940
Because she was away from her abusive father

595
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:05,560
Stay away from the murderous mother

596
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:13,070
This is what we are conspiring against.

597
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:16,660
If you want to stop

598
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,290
Let's talk about it now

599
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:34,840
(Eden Apartments)

600
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,680
But is this address correct?

601
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:38,600
Is this Wen Dongen's current address?

602
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,220
That's right.

603
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:44,060
She transferred to Shiming Primary School and moved her address there not long ago. What happened?

604
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,730
Is this really the place?

605
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,230
Her current address

606
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,450
(No. 301, Eden Apartment, No. 71, Shiming Road, Shiming City)

607
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:53,950
(No.71 Shiming Road)

608
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,290
Just opposite my house

609
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,730
It's Mr.

610
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:32,860
I have some personal matters to attend to.

611
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,490
Cancel all weekend trips and keep Monday and Tuesday empty.

612
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,910
If there is an emergency, please text me

613
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,700
OK, got it.

614
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:43,500
- Anything else... - No

615
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:56,470
Where are you?

616
00:41:58,050 --> 00:41:58,890
Let's meet

617
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:28,870
How much is each item here?

618
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:36,090
You must have a lot of questions

619
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,590
Ask

620
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,510
Aren't you cold? Your clothes are too thin.

621
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:47,890
I thought, "Are you approaching me on purpose?"

622
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:49,730
This will be your first question

623
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:52,310
I must have a side that you can't guess.

624
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,610
What will you do if I don't contact you?

625
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,820
Then I should do the parent interview

626
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,700
Aren't you afraid that I will raise questions to the school?

627
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,450
I still have some influence on private schools

628
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,370
I know

629
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:08,120
That's what I want to rely on.

630
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,170
Your influence

631
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:19,550
A lawyer once taught me how to play Go

632
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:23,390
He said I was born with black spots

633
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,640
So I always have more advantages and smoother experience than others.

634
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,060
However, this game

635
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:34,320
It's too hard

636
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,330
I have many questions about Yeonjin and you

637
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:45,990
What about me?

638
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:48,750
I want to hear what you have to say first

639
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:52,370
Why?

640
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,130
You seem to be claiming that you are a victim

641
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:41,840
Are you there yet?

642
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:43,930
Yes, No. 301

643
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,260
How long does it take to open this?

644
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:58,110
But it is illegal to do so

645
00:44:58,190 --> 00:44:59,320
If it is legal

646
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:01,740
Then I won't give you the money.

647
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:05,780
However

648
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:08,160
Are you a weather anchor?

649
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:09,910
Park Yeon-jin?

650
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:11,450
If I were

651
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:14,250
Will this situation change significantly?

652
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:26,400
(Mortuary)

653
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:29,570
Open it, you wait here

654
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:31,450
What?

655
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:33,950
Oh ok

656
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,250
You and Yeon-jin are classmates

657
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:43,090
Did you approach me on purpose?

658
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:45,170
Yes

659
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:49,840
Then

660
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,810
Did you learn Go on purpose?

661
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:57,060
At the beginning

662
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:59,440
But then I fell in love with Go

663
00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:03,400
After all, Go is also about building a house.

664
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,440
Until my second year of high school, I dreamed of becoming an architect

665
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:07,440
Then I gave up

666
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:18,290
Did you post this photo too?

667
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,000
I picked out a photo of you that looked good and sent it to you.

668
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,210
It seems not.

669
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:26,260
Where do you live?

670
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:30,260
Since you approached me on purpose, you should live very close to me.

671
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:34,050
I prepared myself mentally

672
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:39,940
I've been hurt, so I know

673
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:42,190
Even if you are mentally prepared for this kind of violence

674
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:45,570
It will still be painful

675
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:05,500
I did something wrong

676
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:11,380
I shouldn't have isolated her.

677
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:17,220
She should have been killed earlier.

678
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,260
(The late Yin Suxi was 18 years old)

679
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:05,150
(The late Yin Suxi was resettled on December 15, 2004)

680
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,340
Subtitle translation: Ren Ying
