4
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,620
You're awake.

5
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:10,700
Good morning

6
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,140
How's the headache?

7
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,600
You took care of me all night?

8
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,500
It's fine.

9
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,020
I'll make you breakfast.

10
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:27,860
Take some rest.

11
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,380
Be careful. It's hot.

12
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:20,899
Good?

13
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,580
Take your time.

14
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,530
I need to tell you something when you finish it.

15
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:30,940
What is that?

16
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,540
You should eat more.

17
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,460
I'm full.

18
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:43,900
Xiao Xiu.

19
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,820
Recently, many stray cats disappeared.

20
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,580
Right?

21
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,340
Are they dead or alive now?

22
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,220
None of us knows.

23
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,620
So you may also be in danger.

24
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,060
So...

25
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,060
So...

26
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,050
So you should go home.

27
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,860
Leave here.

28
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:13,900
The sooner, the better.

29
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,580
Do you like me?

30
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,780
No.

31
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,140
I told you so.

32
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,020
How can it be?

33
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,780
You take care of me,

34
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,020
protect me, and care about me.

35
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,580
So,

36
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,340
You lied.

37
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:32,900
You are wrong.

38
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:33,820
You lied.

39
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,580
You are wrong.

40
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,370
You lied.

41
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,370
You got it wrong.

42
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:38,890
Ever since I met you,

43
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,540
I've found you troublesome.

44
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,340
I feel the same way to this day.

45
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:43,580
So taking care of you

46
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,140
is just to save me some trouble.

47
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,330
OK, then.

48
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,740
It's easy to let me go.

49
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,530
Make a wish.

50
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,170
Then I'll leave,

51
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,300
and never coming back.

52
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,060
I wish,

53
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,890
that Xiao Xiu goes back to the Meow Planet

54
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:04,820
and will never be in danger.

55
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,500
Coward. Big liar.

56
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,850
When I was in the Meow Planet,

57
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,220
my neighbor was a Maltese cat.

58
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,370
Speaking of this breed,

59
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:49,100
since the Egyptians 
regarded them as gods in ancient times,

60
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,820
they've never got out of that character.

61
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,580
It took me over ten years being their neighbor,

62
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,580
to finally receive some reaction

63
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,370
when I said hello.

64
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,900
Why are you telling me this?

65
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,700
I just wanted to say that

66
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,020
your Chi Yan

67
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,340
is much nicer than this kind of cat.

68
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,060
You are such a spoiled girl,

69
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,140
and he can bear you for so long.

70
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,020
It's really not easy.

71
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,020
What are you talking about?

72
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,860
I'm telling you he is a big liar.

73
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,500
Uncle Fu.

74
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:22,780
He obviously likes me.

75
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,540
Why didn't he admit it?

76
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,900
For human beings,

77
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,730
affection is not just staying together,

78
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,060
rubbing necks, licking fur like us cats.

79
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,220
It means that

80
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,860
you'll have to share the pain 
and sorrow of the other half,

81
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,140
and face the difficulties together.

82
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:38,730
Never leave,

83
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,700
and always help each other.

84
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,140
There is a huge responsibility

85
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,140
behind the word "like".

86
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:49,850
I think Chi Yan values ​​this very seriously,

87
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,700
so he didn't admit it easily.

88
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,260
Yo... You...

89
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,860
You'll speak for him anyway.

90
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,290
Why are you giving me this?

91
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,340
Because I think that's good with butter, too.

92
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,340
Butter it for me, please.

93
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,220
If you have nothing to do, go away.

94
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,660
Don't sigh at my place.

95
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,300
I don't have anything to do.

96
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,900
But you do.

97
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,820
I'm worried for you.

98
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,380
I didn't ask you to do that.

99
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,540
It has nothing to do with me.

100
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:30,690
Bro,

101
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,380
page 137 of that book,

102
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,460
you've been reading that for 20 minutes.

103
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,020
Can you stop being stubborn?

104
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:37,900
She told you her feelings!

105
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:39,740
And you finally get an admirer.

106
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,220
What's holding you back?

107
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,539
You two should be together!

108
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,340
This can't be solved

109
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,690
impulsively like you always do.

110
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,540
Impulsively?

111
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,020
If Qin Mingming did the same to me,

112
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,620
I would be so high.

113
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,290
She is a girl.

114
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,290
And she took action.

115
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,380
But you are so cold.

116
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,340
No matter how carefree she is,

117
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,690
she'll feel hurt. I'm telling you.

118
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,220
I...

119
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,180
You don't understand.

120
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,810
Stop. Stop.

121
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:26,980
I'm exhausted.

122
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,500
Let me find someone for you.

123
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:45,780
Chi Yan.

124
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:50,780
What are you...

125
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,770
Coach Wu was my classmate in college.

126
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,420
He told me you were practicing kendo here.

127
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,980
So I came here to play against you.

128
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,780
Don't be merciful.

129
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:16,500
fine.

130
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,010
Good coordination.

131
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,100
But too slow.

132
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:33,260
Again.

133
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,020
Did you throw the game?

134
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:46,620
Nope.

135
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:54,580
Come on.

136
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,490
Are you scared?

137
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,740
Too slow!

138
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,250
Again.

139
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:01,820
Come again.

140
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:03,900
Slow.

141
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:06,610
One more.

142
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,020
You let me win.

143
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:18,730
I didn't.

144
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,370
You are so strong.

145
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:25,650
I thought

146
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,660
it would be awkward for us to meet again.

147
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,050
Didn't see this coming.

148
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:32,930
Thank you

149
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,950
for giving me this opportunity

150
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,500
to defeat the person who rejected me.

151
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,540
Before now,

152
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,420
I used to think

153
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,580
if I told you my feelings

154
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,780
in high school,

155
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,780
would things be different for us?

156
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:57,540
Of course,

157
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,420
although it took me ten years to say it,

158
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,060
I don't feel sorry.

159
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,980
I have no regrets.

160
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,250
Have you heard of

161
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,580
the Salzburg Bough?

162
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:13,580
No.

163
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,410
What's that?

164
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,610
Something created by a writer.

165
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,540
He wrote that,

166
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,940
in the salt mines near Salzburg, Austria,

167
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,900
Miners would throw a leafless wintry bough

168
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,020
into the abandoned workings

169
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,730
When the miners pick it up in two or three months,

170
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,370
the bough will be covered with

171
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,780
a shining deposit of crystals.

172
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,180
Even the tiniest twigs become

173
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,700
scintillating and dazzling.

174
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,380
The original bough is no longer recognizable.

175
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,620
It's actually the same as being in love.

176
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,020
The man in your fantasy

177
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,570
is cast with a charming light.

178
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,380
But it's just a leafless,

179
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,780
ordinary bough.

180
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,420
Someone compares himself to a

181
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,900
tree branch to comfort me.

182
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:07,740
Mingming.

183
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,060
Rather than telling you that I'm sorry,

184
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,740
I hope you can come out of the past.

185
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,780
I also hope you don't blame me

186
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:22,020
because all I can say to you now is comfort.

187
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,500
I get to listen to Chi Yan talking so much

188
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:30,980
and so long,

189
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,500
I feel like it's a win.

190
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:34,580
OK.

191
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,140
Enough about me.

192
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:39,980
What about you?

193
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,380
What about me?

194
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,500
I can see that

195
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,420
you like Xiao Xiu, right?

196
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,500
In the game,

197
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,260
if you don't take the initiative,

198
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,260
you will never have a chance to win.

199
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,260
One more game?

200
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:06,620
Sure.

201
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:12,620
Lin Mo.

202
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,100
Are you on the day shift too?

203
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,700
It was a busy week.

204
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,650
I'm finally free.

205
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,100
♫Happy birthday to you♫

206
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,500
♫Happy birthday to you♫

207
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,460
♫Happy birthday to you♫

208
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,930
♫Happy birthday to you♫

209
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,140
Lin Mo, happy birthday.

210
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,330
Why didn't you tell me about your birthday?

211
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:46,780
How's that?

212
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,620
Surprised?

213
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:53,900
I...

214
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,980
I saw it on the employee registration form.

215
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,780
Today is your birthday.

216
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,100
Happy birthday.

217
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,900
I don't celebrate birthdays.

218
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,060
I'll blow it for him.

219
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,340
What's wrong?

220
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,980
Why don't you celebrate your birthday?

221
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,580
Today is not my birthday.

222
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,220
Then why does the form say

223
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,780
today is your birthday?

224
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:27,500
Confess.

225
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,140
What are you hiding?

226
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,700
Who are you?

227
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,330
Today is a very important day for me.

228
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,060
A very important day?

229
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,100
Isn't that your birthday?

230
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:48,780
Or date of death.

231
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,460
Date of death?

232
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,660
The girl who died.

233
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,540
That...

234
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:08,780
Do you...

235
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,100
want to talk to me?

236
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,020
Actually, I don't know

237
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,380
when my birthday is.

238
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,100
The reason why I chose today

239
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,130
is that this day

240
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,450
has a special meaning to me.

241
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,850
This is the day I met her.

242
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,860
Slow it down.

243
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:20,940
When I see you,

244
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,740
you always remind me of her.

245
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,700
But didn't you say that

246
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,780
we are not that alike?

247
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:34,090
I know.

248
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,980
You are two completely different people.

249
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,740
But sometimes when I see you

250
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:48,500
I can't help but think about her.

251
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:53,900
But I don't want to face

252
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,740
the fact that she is gone.

253
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,170
It's like a thorn in your hand.

254
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,020
It hurts if you pull it out or press it in.

255
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,130
I have a thing. Gotta go.

256
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,180
Isn't that contradictory?

257
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,340
Xiao Xiu.

258
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:16,530
Hi.

259
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:19,380
Excuse me,

260
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,740
is Xiao Xiu here?

261
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,380
She worked the day shift today,

262
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,820
and had already left with Lin Mo.

263
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:25,580
What's wrong?

264
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,260
When?

265
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,340
About

266
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,780
five or six pm.

267
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,490
What's the matter?

268
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,900
Do you have Lin Mo's number?

269
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,540
Yeah.

270
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:07,860
You called me?

271
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,570
Where is Xiao Xiu?

272
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,500
How did you have my number?

273
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,180
I'm asking you. Where is she?

274
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,380
You should know that.

275
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,860
We're having dinner together,

276
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,210
She said she got a thing and left suddenly.

277
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:37,580
I found this coat

278
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,500
in an alley.

279
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,380
Did you drink?

280
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,580
Yeah.

281
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,100
What?

282
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,300
She can't drink.

283
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:47,940
What?

284
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,100
Search together.

285
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,100
Hurry up!

286
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,780
Search different places!

287
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,100
Hello?

288
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,060
I'm here.

289
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,700
Rest assured.

290
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,460
If you find this girl

291
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,210
please call this number.

292
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:42,820
Thank you.

293
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,220
OK. Fine.

294
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:43,700
Thank you.

295
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,500
Hello?

296
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,620
Where are you?

297
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,540
I walked the dog to your house.

298
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,180
I knocked for ages, but nobody's in.

299
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,340
I can't find Xiao Xiu.

300
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,340
Her phone turned off.

301
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:55,850
What?

302
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,700
When did this happen?

303
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,810
Could it be she playing somewhere

304
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:00,620
and the phone is dead?

305
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,100
She...

306
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,220
She never does that.

307
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,060
A lot of drugged cat food

308
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,700
is placed in the green belt of the block.

309
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,100
And this photo.

310
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:08,980
Look.

311
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,620
Even in residential buildings.

312
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,940
These are places where

313
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,130
there are many stray cats.

314
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,210
But there isn't much drug.

315
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,020
If they just sprinkled it like this.,

316
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:17,900
no one will find out.

317
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:21,980
Hello?

318
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:26,100
Wait there.

319
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:27,180
I'll be right there.

320
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,970
Don't be too worried.

321
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,220
She can't go too far in a while.

322
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,300
Hello, got anything?

323
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,010
I've searched the neighborhood,

324
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,100
but nobody saw her.

325
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,260
Chi Yan.

326
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,410
Any news?

327
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,460
We can't keep searching like this.

328
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:55,020
Maybe you should go home.

329
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,100
She might have come home.

330
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:56,780
If not,

331
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,660
I will ask my friends at the radio station tomorrow

332
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,940
to send out a message of missing people, okay?

333
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:00,820
No.

334
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:02,340
If something really happened to her,

335
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,420
the later we find her,

336
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,540
the more danger she faces.

337
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,460
I must find her tonight.

338
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:06,780
But,

339
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,690
no one's in the bookstore now.

340
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:08,820
What if she comes home?

341
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,700
If so, why didn't she contact me?

342
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:12,970
Enough.

343
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:14,380
You guys worked hard tonight.

344
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:15,780
You should go home.

345
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,700
I'll keep looking.

346
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:19,420
Bro.

347
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,540
Calm down.

348
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,820
It'll be meaningless 
if you keep looking without a clue.

349
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:25,620
Think about it.

350
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,860
Does she have any friends?

351
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,900
Is there any place

352
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,900
where she might stay over?

353
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,300
There is no such place!

354
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,060
Wait a sec.

355
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,020
Xiao Xiu has a friend.

356
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,060
City...

357
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:05,190
[City Market]

358
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,020
Thanks.

359
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:33,900
I will jump when I get there.

360
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:12,740
How is it, Uncle Fu?

361
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,020
Every resident of the Meow Planet

362
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,090
has an odor as a signal.

363
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:19,620
Sig...

364
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,700
But there is no Xiu's odor

365
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,490
in this area.

366
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,180
Food stalls.

367
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,260
The community garden.

368
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:28,420
The beerhouse.

369
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,580
We've looked everywhere.

370
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,580
Where can she be?

371
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,540
I'm going to ask other people of my kind

372
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,180
to search more places.

373
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,410
Don't worry.

374
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,660
We'll find her.

375
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:48,660
Hello.

376
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,900
Where does this ship go?

377
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:52,850
To Tongye Island.

378
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,300
What island?

379
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:00,140
Hello?

380
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:00,650
Chi Yan.

381
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:01,340
Xiao Xiu.

382
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,780
What happened to you?

383
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,410
Are you okay?

384
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,580
I'm okay. I'm okay.

385
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,100
Chi Yan.

386
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,690
Where are you now?

387
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:12,210
I am on the sea.

388
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,380
The sea?

389
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,940
Why are you at sea?

390
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:17,420
I'm in a boat.

391
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,180
I don't know.

392
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,860
I got in a car,

393
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,420
and it was full of cabbage.

394
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:21,940
I thought,

395
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,820
when I get to the city, I will jump out of the car.

396
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,220
And then I fell asleep.

397
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,700
I fell asleep and then...

398
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,100
I woke up in the middle of the sea

399
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:28,820
A boat

400
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,860
took away all the vegetables.

401
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:31,780
It's fine.

402
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,460
Calm down.

403
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:34,450
You...

404
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,620
Do you know the specific location?

405
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,140
Location.

406
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:37,780
Tell us.

407
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,820
Specific...

408
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:42,370
Where am I?

409
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:44,380
We are heading to Tongye Island.

410
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,620
We are heading to Tongye Island.

411
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,300
We'll be there in about half an hour.

412
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,620
We'll be there in about half an hour.

413
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,940
We have half an hour.

414
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:51,460
Chi Yan.

415
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,100
Tongye Island is not far away.

416
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:53,930
We're going there right now.

417
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:54,460
OK. OK. OK.

418
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,660
No worries.

419
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,940
When you get ashore,

420
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,620
find somewhere safe and contact me.

421
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,700
Uncle Fu and I will pick you up by boat now.

422
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,410
Don't worry.

423
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,330
Hi.

424
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,460
To Tongye Island?

425
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,300
Can't go.

426
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,340
Hello.

427
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,140
To Tongye Island?

428
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:25,820
No, no.

429
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:30,380
Hi.

430
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:31,410
That's it.

431
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,930
I want you to meet someone.

432
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:33,400
Come.

433
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:39,930
Why are you so late?

434
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:40,900
Come and sit here.

435
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,620
Look at the menu.

436
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,340
What do you want? Are you hungry?

437
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,020
How about some tea?

438
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,180
Are you going to go fishing at night?

439
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:53,890
It's not gonna happen.

440
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,260
We were going to go to the island.

441
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,340
But there are huge waves.

442
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,020
The boat can't get out of the sea.

443
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,860
Will no one go to sea in this little rain?

444
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,460
No. No. No.

445
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,060
I...

446
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,900
A kid in my family wanted to take a ride,

447
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,700
but she somehow went to the island.

448
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,810
In the middle of the night,

449
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:15,690
it's so dangerous

450
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,380
for a girl.

451
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:20,460
I want to pick her up, but I can't.

452
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,140
You have to wait till tomorrow morning.

453
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:25,930
Master, master.

454
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,570
The girl he's talking about...

455
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:28,890
To me...

456
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:31,530
She...

457
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,220
She is very important to me.

458
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:37,250
Tonight,

459
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,690
I have to find her tonight.

460
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,330
So please,

461
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,340
help us.

462
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:48,220
So you guys are here for my boat.

463
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,210
Sorry, but yes.

464
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,460
To be honest,

465
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,660
we've been to the pier just now.

466
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,810
The weather is terrible,

467
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,770
so no one is willing to go out to the sea.

468
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,020
The girl we are talking about

469
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,050
is kind of silly

470
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:11,980
and afraid of water.

471
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,700
Now she is on the sea alone.

472
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,620
We have no choice but to ask you.

473
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:26,380
Please help us.

474
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,540
You young people

475
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,420
are always troublesome.

476
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,900
All right, let's go!

477
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:41,340
Thanks a lot.

478
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:41,850
Thank you.

479
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:42,260
Go. Go. Go.

480
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:42,700
Thank you.

481
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,820
Let's hurry up.

482
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:44,460
Uncle Fu.

483
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,300
What?

484
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:46,500
The weather is bad now.

485
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,740
You stay here.

486
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:49,380
I'll go with the master.

487
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:51,500
I know my ways around the sea.

488
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,060
It's okay.

489
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:52,700
You. You.

490
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:54,100
You stay here

491
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,100
and look after my shop for me.

492
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:57,100
They're going on a date.

493
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,340
Do you want to join them?

494
00:33:59,020 --> 00:33:59,460
Let's go.

495
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,100
Alright.

496
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,260
Wait for me, Uncle Fu.

497
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,860
Tell me when you find her.

498
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:34,060
Hello?

499
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:34,889
Hello.

500
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:35,620
Hi.

501
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:36,900
May I ask that

502
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,580
if there is a girl next to you?

503
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,060
Yeah. Yeah.

504
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,610
Please put her on the phone.

505
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:43,929
Miss.

506
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:44,780
There's a phone call.

507
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,690
It's for you.

508
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:46,780
Thanks.

509
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:49,940
Hello?

510
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:51,060
Xiao Xiu.

511
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,460
I'll be there soon.

512
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:54,659
Wait for me.

513
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:56,570
Don't go anywhere. I'm coming.

514
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:03,580
Master.

515
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,540
Is it there?

516
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:07,600

00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,600
What's this?

554
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:40,330
Ginger tea.

555
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:42,300
Drink it so that you won't catch a cold.

556
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,500
I've been looking for you all night.

557
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,810
Don't you want to tell me

558
00:37:58,810 --> 00:37:59,940
what happened tonight?

559
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:04,700
I accidentally drank Lin Mo's beer.

560
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,460
Then I felt like

561
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,220
something was wrong.

562
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:08,420
So many people there.

563
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,140
I panicked.

564
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,540
So I ran, covering my ears.

565
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,780
I didn't expect so many people 
on that street at night.

566
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,300
I thought maybe it's better to turn into a cat.

567
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,980
I went into that alley and turned into a cat

568
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:16,780
After that,

569
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,780
I want to hide my clothes.

570
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,820
Suddenly a net fell from the sky.

571
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:20,980
And then...

572
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,220
I was unconscious.

573
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,620
Take another sip.

574
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,300
What about that person's face?

575
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,100
Did you see that?

576
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:42,460
Nope.

577
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,980
He wore a mask and a hat the whole time.

578
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,020
I can't see anything.

579
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:46,900
Where did he catch you?

580
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,060
Can you recall anything?

581
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,740
Are there any landmark buildings nearby?

582
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:57,940
There seems to be a farmhouse.

583
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,380
There are a lot of instruments and cages inside.

584
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,060
And there are cats in those cages.

585
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:08,860
OK. Let's drop it now.

586
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,900
The fact that you were taken away tonight,

587
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,980
only Uncle Fu and I know about it.

588
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,820
You must remember that

589
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:19,620
when we meet Xu Zihao and others tomorrow,

590
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,340
don't mention it.

591
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,060
Because they don't know that you are...

592
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,060
Thank god I got you back.

593
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,380
Otherwise,

594
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,780
I can't forgive myself for the rest of my life.

595
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:55,660
Xiao Xiu.

596
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,460
I'm sorry.

597
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:01,540
You had to suffer this today.

598
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:06,650
I promise you,

599
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,660
every day from now on,

600
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,860
I'll be with you.

601
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,900
I will try as I may to protect you.

602
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,540
I won't let you get hurt again.

603
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:23,460
I like you.

604
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:12,860
You know that?

605
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,740
Before I met you,

606
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:19,140
I've always been a coward.

607
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:22,460
Really.

608
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:25,810
It's like I've been running away.

609
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:29,890
My time seems to have stopped in the past.

610
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,220
I ran away from the people I meet,

611
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:34,860
and things happen to me.

612
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,020
I couldn't laugh from my heart,

613
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:39,980
nor could I cry with abandon.

614
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,450
I couldn't do anything.

615
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:47,020
I feel like,

616
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:50,220
I am the only one left in this world.

617
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:53,210
Those who I loved and who loved me

618
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,100
were gone one by one.

619
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,420
So from that moment, I started thinking,

620
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:02,980
since you are all leaving someday,

621
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,300
then I won't be attached to you in the first place.

622
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,780
Then, I met you.

623
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,330
When I first saw you,

624
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,260
I thought this girl is acting like crazy.

625
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,540
Jumping up and down every day.

626
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,740
Causing new troubles every day.

627
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:25,500
Here and there, non-stop.

628
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,190
I need to pay attention to you,

629
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,820
look after you and protect you.

630
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:34,490
But as time goes by,

631
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,420
I gradually found that,

632
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:41,220
it's not you need me,

633
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:43,140
but I need you.

634
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:50,620
When we are about to be together,

635
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,940
The disappearance of stray cats

636
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,180
happened in the neighborhood.

637
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,380
I was thinking at that time,

638
00:42:58,670 --> 00:42:59,940
this is enough.

639
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:01,740
See,

640
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,740
I have the bookstore left by my grandpa,

641
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,660
stories that I want to write,

642
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:08,660
friends who treat me like a family,

643
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,540
and you by my side,

644
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:12,740
trusting and supporting me unconditionally.

645
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,380
That should be enough.

646
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,370
I shouldn't be greedy anymore.

647
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:25,330
Why?

648
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,820
Because it's useless to be greedy.

649
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:32,100
Because...

650
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,060
What if things get worse

651
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,620
because of your greed?

652
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,380
I feel like I know

653
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:47,450
what you are talking about.

654
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:49,860
It's like...

655
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,500
I used to go fishing with my sister.

656
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:52,980
We were so happy

657
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:54,900
when we caught big ones.

658
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,500
But after the happy moment,
 I started to worry.

659
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,740
What if the big fish escaped?

660
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:04,060
I feel like you are doing the same thing.

661
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,220
In the face of sudden happiness,

662
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:11,210
we can be terrified.

663
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:17,260
Maybe.

664
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,770
On the way to find you with Uncle Fu,

665
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:25,530
here was a moment I was thinking,

666
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:28,860
I was wrong.

667
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:32,540
I cannot be more wrong.

668
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:37,940
Compared to the pain of your leaving,

669
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:43,100
I'm more afraid of you disappearing.

670
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:47,860
Those fears and cowardice

671
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:49,290
that I told you before,

672
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:51,610
and my sadness and misery

673
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:52,580
since childhood,

674
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:54,660
those are all very lame

675
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:55,940
and selfish excuses.

676
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,380
I should be more courageous.

677
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:03,780
I should face the world bravely.

678
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:06,700
I should view the world with colors.

679
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:13,060
So thank you, Xiao Xiu.

680
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:15,370
You made me not afraid.

681
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:17,980
You make me brave.

682
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:25,860
I want to be with you till the end of my life.
