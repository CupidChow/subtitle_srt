00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,500
Just stay here.

00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:34,820
I will buy you some food.

6
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:45,580
Good.

7
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,300
See you next time.

8
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,780
Hello. Welcome.

9
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,380
Xiao Xiu.

10
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:58,980
Xiao Xiu.

11
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:04,700
Xiao Xiu.

12
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,380
Xiao Xiu.

13
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,260
Xiao Xiu.

14
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:10,740
Xiao Xiu.

15
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:14,980
Xiao Xiu.

16
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,140
Chi.

17
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,700
How did she go missing?

18
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,100
I went out this morning for half an hour or so.

19
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,140
She's already gone when I came back.

20
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,940
And I found this on the table.

21
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,090
Just calm down.

22
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,620
Have you noticed anything weird?

23
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,140
Where did she drop her phone?

24
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:46,570
There.

25
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,300
What is this?

26
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:01,700
The china cat.

27
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,900
Luo gave it to me as a present.

28
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,170
And I put it here.

29
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,020
It was here before I went out.

30
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:10,180
This...

31
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:11,300
The floor has just been refurbished.

32
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,180
Why would there be a crack?

33
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,580
Where is the dustbin?

34
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:17,610
Outside.

35
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,220
Nothing.

36
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,700
If Xiao Xiu broke the porcelain cat,

37
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,220
she would put the pieces in the bin.

38
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,500
But I can't find any in the bin.

39
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,220
With that crack,

40
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,260
I think she might be in danger.

41
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:38,659
I've got to find her.

42
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,380
Chi, calm down.

43
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:40,820
I'll go with you.

44
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,700
Where are you going?

45
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,420
Why are you in such a hurry?

46
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,420
Xiao Xiu might be in danger.

47
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:47,500
She's missing.

48
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:50,850
I've found something.

49
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:51,700
I was going to tell her that.

50
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,460
What?

51
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,780
I went home and asked Yu Nan to help me

52
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,780
figure out what happened years ago.

53
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:57,980
What did you find out?

54
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,260
We found that

55
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,020
every month on the 15th,

56
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,500
people would gather at the Haibin Park

57
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:03,700
with their cats

58
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:04,780
and give their cats

59
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,620
to a guy with a scar on his hand.

60
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,820
I thought that might be a clue,

61
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,210
so I followed him.

62
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,180
I followed him all the way

63
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,420
and found that there was another guy.

64
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,250
You all know him.

65
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,100
The Renai Hospital.

66
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:54,980
Luo Jiaxuan.

67
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:58,980
I've figured it all out.

68
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,260
It's him.

69
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,740
He made that abandoned ship into a lab

70
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,220
and caught stray cats back to the lab

71
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,340
and did experiments there.

72
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,330
What does it

73
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,460
have to do with Xiao Xiu?

74
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,580
Right. She has nothing to do with that.

75
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,580
Why would they kidnap her?

76
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,610
You didn't know about this.

77
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,220
When Xiao Xiu was investigating this,

78
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,540
she may have come into contact with them.

79
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,780
Let's go then.

80
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,300
Someone has to stay at the bookstore though.

81
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,460
What if Xiao Xiu comes back herself?

82
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,260
It's alright.

83
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,850
Yu Nan has told me where the lab is.

84
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,140
I will take you there. He can stay.

85
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,580
Wait.

86
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:25,930
Luo Jiaxuan.

87
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:28,890
Are you sure?

88
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,100
Yes.

89
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,220
Go.

90
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,020
Go.

91
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,740
My car's over there.

92
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:14,980
I can't imagine that

93
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,020
it was Luo Jiaxuan.

94
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,340
It's not surprising.

95
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,260
You have no idea

96
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,690
how human beings can be.

97
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,420
Let's call the police.

98
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,500
We need to hurry up.

99
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:03,580
Awake now?

100
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:05,700
Sorry.

101
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,620
I forgot that you are a cat.

102
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,180
Might have over-drugged you.

103
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,740
Don't move.

104
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,660
It will mess up your fur.

105
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,580
Someone will get hurt.

106
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,260
This is the only way.

107
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:28,980
I'll go first.

108
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,020
I am more agile.

109
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,300
Don't be afraid. I am here.

110
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,620
Who's afraid?

111
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:51,460
There.

112
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,890
This is amazing.

113
00:11:59,020 --> 00:11:59,820
I compare your blood

114
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,580
to that of other cats.

115
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,460
I found no difference.

116
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:10,300
What kind of creature are you?

117
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,020
What is your place called?

118
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,300
The Meow Kingdom?

119
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:32,330
Or the Meow Planet?

120
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,020
Take me there.

121
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,540
Then I will let you go.

122
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,540
Otherwise,

123
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,340
I can only rely on myself

124
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,140
and continue to study your body.

125
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:27,940
This way.

126
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,300
What's wrong?

127
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:54,620
What's wrong?

128
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,340
I'm fine. Just go.

129
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:03,940
Xiao Xiu.

130
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:09,900
Chi Yan.

131
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:11,660
Chi Yan.

132
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,780
Chi. Chi.

133
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,300
Chi Yan.

134
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:18,180
Chi Yan.

135
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,500
Chi. Chi.

136
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,930
I think we've fallen into a trap.

137
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,900
Let's find another way out.

138
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,100
Chi.

139
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,460
Take care of yourself.

140
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:41,940
That way.

141
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:50,860
Chi Yan.

142
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,290
Xiao Xiu.

143
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,340
Chi Yan,

144
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,820
it is people like you

145
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,820
who make me loathe this world.

146
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,540
When we were little,

147
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,660
you were so extraordinary,

148
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,300
so talented,

149
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,180
so honest, and so kind.

150
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,820
You were never willing to

151
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,850
get involved with those people.

152
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,780
But so what?

153
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,500
What can you do when you grow up?

154
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,890
You are too innocent,

155
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,420
too noble.

156
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,180
You don't want to be changed by them.

157
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:26,620
Chi Yan,

158
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,660
you and I are the same.

159
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,260
Think about that thing I helped you with

160
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,780
when you were little.

161
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:38,900
I showed you what the world is actually like

162
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,620
so that you could give up on it.

163
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,620
Don't you think that

164
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,980
you are the freest

165
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:48,820
and happiest when you are

166
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,700
trapped in that bookstore?

167
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,780
Shouldn't you thank me for that?

168
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,060
Chi Yan.

169
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,619
You killed that cat.

170
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,020
Luo Jiaxuan.

171
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,540
You alright?

172
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:23,940
Here.

173
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,340
Let me.

174
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,020
Let me.

175
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,340
I can't hear anything.

176
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:48,940
Where is Lin Mo?

177
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,180
Chi Yan.

178
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,060
You can't resurrect the dead.

179
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,900
But you can save

180
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,700
the living one,

181
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,100
and I will show you how.

182
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,140
Ask your kitty girlfriend

183
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:18,700
to take me to the Meow Planet

184
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,850
and I will let her go.

185
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,100
Don't even think about it.

186
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,940
Would you like to see her dead too?

187
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,380
What are you doing?

188
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,420
Luo Jiaxuan.

189
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,420
They look really alike.

190
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,170
Luo Jiaxuan!

191
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,700
Another one.

192
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,380
Now I've found you.

193
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,660
Just go.

194
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:49,850
Go.

195
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,100
Take Xiao Xiu with you.

196
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,740
Go!

197
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,900
Chi Yan. Chi Yan.

198
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:06,780
Open the door.

199
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,570
Chi.

200
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,540
Here.

201
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,780
Careful. Step back.

202
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:21,860
Chi Yan.

203
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:22,700
Are you alright?

204
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:24,820
What happened?

205
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,260
Here.

206
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:28,740
Careful. Careful.

207
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,250
Here.

208
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,100
He...

209
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,300
He escaped through that door.

210
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,020
Go.

211
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,420
Just go.

212
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,380
I will.

213
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:54,860
I will.

214
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,460
Take care of him.

215
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:02,220
Lin Mo.

216
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:03,940
I am calling the ambulance.

217
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,100
I'm fine.

218
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,620
Go to the other side of the deck and corner him.

219
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,730
Rest assured. We've called the police.

220
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:12,420
He can't escape.

221
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,490
There's no much time left. Just go!

222
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,180
Just wait here. We'll come back soon.

223
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:20,210
Wait for us.

224
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,090
Just wait for us.

225
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:21,940
Hang in there.

226
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,010
I'll go after him.

227
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,420
You go the other way to corner him.

228
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,460
Go.

229
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,410
Quick.

230
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:44,850
Go.

231
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,220
Lin Mo.

232
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,300
Lin Mo.

233
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:04,010
Hang in there.

234
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,140
Lin Mo.

235
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:08,900
Rest assured.

236
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:10,930
I won't die.

237
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,500
But you...

238
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,020
You can't reveal who you are.

239
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,500
I'm sorry.

240
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,180
I didn't take good care of your sister.

241
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,010
Lin Mo. Lin Mo.

242
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,980
I should say thank you to you.

243
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,300
Thank you for everything you did for my sister.

244
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,780
I will take you home when you get better.

245
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,340
Lin Mo.

246
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,380
Let's go home.

247
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,060
We don't need to hide who we are there.

248
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:48,540
Lin Mo.

249
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:52,970
Alright.

250
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,540
I know you are worried about him.

251
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,500
Go.

252
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,580
I am fine.

253
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,340
Just go.

254
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,780
I will wait here.

255
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,060
Just go.

256
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,220
Wait for me.

257
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,220
Sorry.

258
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,180
Run.

259
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,100
Run.

260
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,820
The police are coming.

261
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,300
Luo, you can't escape from this.

262
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,500
Chi Yan,

263
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,530
have you thought about

264
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,420
what the police would do to your girlfriend

265
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,300
if I tell them

266
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,100
who she really is?

267
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,900
Lots of people would want to do experiments on her.

268
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,980
What I have done is no big deal.

269
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,650
I am saying this for the last time.

270
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,540
This is the only way to settle this.

271
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,500
Take me to the Meow Planet.

272
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:08,100
Let's disappear from this world.

273
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:09,860
It's the best for us.

274
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,380
Do you know

275
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,740
what kind of punishment you will receive

276
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,250
if you go to my planet?

277
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,460
Fine.

278
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,460
I will not go then.

279
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,100
You can just wait to be cut open.

280
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,570
I'd rather let people do experiments on me

281
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,420
than taking you to my home.

282
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,020
You will get what you deserve in the end.

283
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,140
What do I deserve?

284
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,020
I've just done experiments on some animals.

285
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:38,980
What do I deserve?

286
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,620
There are so many dogs

287
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,220
being crashed by cars every day.

288
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,700
Pets get abandoned

289
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,500
as long as they get infectious diseases.

290
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,730
If karma does exist,

291
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:50,060
then everyone should be punished.

292
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,140
I didn't break the law.

293
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:57,180
I didn't kill anyone.

294
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,290
Don't you get it?

295
00:26:58,610 --> 00:26:59,860
How can you not see this?

296
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,020
I am standing in front of you.

297
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,250
You and I are the same.

298
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,380
We have feelings.

299
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,420
We fall in love and we get hurt.

300
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,650
We are living beings.

301
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,290
How could you do this to us?

302
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,660
The police are coming up.

303
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,940
I am asking you for the last time.

304
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,380
Take me to the Meow Planet.

305
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,930
Think twice.

306
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,500
This is your last chance.

307
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:08,540
Chi Yan!

308
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:18,940
Chi Yan!

309
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,420
Chi Yan!

310
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:23,780
Chi Yan.

311
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,750
[Luo got hospitalized due to serious injuries. 
He went mad after recovery.]

312
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,750
[Reports on this incident have raised public concern.]

313
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,850
He's that bad guy who hurt the stray cats.

314
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,170
He's a bully.

315
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:06,380
Take this.

316
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:11,380
Stop.

317
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,180
Bad guy.

318
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,780
Stop.

319
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,500
Bad guy.

320
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:16,610
Bad guy.

321
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,500
Bad guy.

322
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:35,820
It's ready.

323
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:36,780
Take this to him.

324
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,540
Careful. It's hot.

325
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,540
Let me try it first.

326
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,100
It's good.

327
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,340
How sweet you are.

328
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,340
Makes me sick.

329
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:03,980
Why aren't you on your bed?

330
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,180
What did you get up?

331
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,900
I've been lying there for too long.

332
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,500
I am ready to go.

333
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:10,900
Where?

334
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,300
Some place where I am not a third wheel.

335
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,300
See you.

336
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,420
Lin Mo.

337
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:26,500
Lin Mo.

338
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:28,780
Lin Mo.

339
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,380
Wait.

340
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,260
You haven't recovered yet.

341
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,460
Where can you go in the middle of the night?

342
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,100
Go. Get back and finish your soup.

343
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:41,420
Chi Yan.

344
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,090
Take care of Xiao Xiu.

345
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:47,860
Rest assured.

346
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,740
What? What are you talking about?

347
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,220
Go home with me. Go.

348
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:53,900
Alright.

349
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,500
Don't waste your time.

350
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,860
I know my own condition.

351
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,100
What are you talking about?

352
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,740
You just need to take a good rest.

353
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:04,460
Go home. It's too late.

354
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,090
Xiao Xiu,

355
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,980
since I decided to stay here and seek revenge,

356
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,820
life and death mean nothing to me.

357
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,420
Have you thought about my sister?

358
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,780
Stay here with me.

359
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:22,420
It's what she wanted.

360
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,500
Just go home with me.

361
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:26,500
Give me your bag.

362
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,970
Your sister once told me that

363
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,490
she wanted to open a restaurant with me.

364
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,460
In the morning,

365
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,420
I would take her to the market.

366
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,820
At noon, I would cook in the kitchen

367
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:42,900
and she would welcome the customers.

368
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,260
In the afternoon, we would take a walk together

369
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:46,900
and pick up our kids.

370
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,210
In the evening, we would look at the stars.

371
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:53,060
Tell me.

372
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,020
She's not here anymore.

373
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,810
What could I do

374
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,380
from morning till night?

375
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,220
Lin Mo.

376
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:10,860
I have no regrets

377
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,940
as your sister's killer has been caught.

378
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:14,940
In my last days,

379
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:18,050
I want to visit places that remind me of her.

380
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,740
If you ever treat her badly,

381
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,500
I will come back and punch you.

382
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,420
See you.

383
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:33,980
Lin Mo.

384
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,140
Thank you.

385
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,100
Just let him go.

386
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,420
What's happened here?

387
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,739
Have you had

388
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:58,700
a cat party here?

389
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,220
Cat hair everywhere.

390
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,180
You will understand when you get married.

391
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,180
Wait.

392
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,940
What does it have to do with me getting married?

393
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:12,500
Uncle,

394
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,340
try this.

395
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,500
Try this.

396
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,220
Let me get you some more.

397
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,060
Uncle.

398
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,220
It's mine.

399
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,500
It's mine.

400
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,210
Chi,

401
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,490
I've decided to, you know, with Mingming.

402
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:38,980
Seriously?

403
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:41,740
I mean...

404
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,330
I know what you mean.

405
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:44,340
That.

406
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,100
Right. Right.

407
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,170
Help me.

408
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:47,060
Sure.

409
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,100
Qin Mingming.

410
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,650
Qin Mingming,

411
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,260
Qin Mingming.

412
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,700
Today, I...

413
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,900
Even if I vomit to death here,

414
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,540
I would still like to ask you this.

415
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:40,940
Will you...

416
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,860
Stop talking!

417
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,050
Yes!

418
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:47,340
How wild.

419
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,620
Are you alright?

420
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:03,820
It's fine if you can't talk.

421
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:05,780
At least you should have that thing with you.
