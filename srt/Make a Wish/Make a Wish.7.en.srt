4
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,660
Hi, everyone.

5
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,420
Welcome to The Silent Loyalty.

6
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,210
In today's show,

7
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,700
we will take a closer look

8
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,380
at police dogs.

9
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,780
Relax, just chill.

10
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,260
It's a police dog, it won't bite me.

11
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,260
Just relax.

12
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:58,980
Nothing to be nervous about.

13
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,210
Before going on stage,

14
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:01,900
just,

15
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,140
wait here for a moment.

16
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,300
No way.

17
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,220
Just now, the journalist, Qin Mingming,

18
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,180
and Doctor Xu

19
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:12,940
have already

20
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,730
walked us through

21
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,900
things about police dogs.

22
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,420
Now it's time

23
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,780
for a quick quiz.

24
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,060
Let's take a look at the first question.

25
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:22,770
Excuse me. Sorry.

26
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,140
Sorry, coming through. Thanks.

27
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:30,940
Miss Qin,

28
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,260
it's late. You hungry?

29
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,579
Maybe the two of us can grab a bite together.

30
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,579
No thanks.

31
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,940
Is there anything that you want to say to me?

32
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,300
What could I possibly have to say to you?

33
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,020
Maybe we can just have coffee together.

34
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:51,170
Coffee in the middle of the night? Great.

35
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,770
It's dangerous for you to walk

36
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,700
in heels.

37
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,020
Take it easy, slow down!

38
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:05,540
This again?

39
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,180
No.

40
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:24,700
It hurts.

41
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,050
You really are hurt.

42
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:45,740
Slowly.

43
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,140
Did you drive here?

44
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:54,860
I didn't.

45
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,409
Now what, I call a cab for you?

46
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,980
Maybe you can give me a ride home.

47
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:32,940
Mingming, Ming...

48
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,140
Mingming, I...

49
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:35,659
You're annoying, you know that?

50
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:36,659
I...

51
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,740
I'm not the guy who you think I am.

52
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,180
I...

53
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,300
I have no idea

54
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,100
why I can't control myself

55
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,500
the moment I see you.

56
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:43,620
I...

57
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:45,659
If,

58
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,100
if I have

59
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,580
caused any trouble,

60
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,180
I can just stop

61
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,890
filming shows here.

62
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,260
I will prescribe

63
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,780
enough medicine for Bulb.

64
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,820
I will even find a better doctor for Bulb.

65
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,250
As long as you don't resent me.

66
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,380
Have a safe trip home.

67
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,020
See you.

68
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,090
Different kinds of beer

69
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,940
are categorised by techniques applied
to produce them.

70
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,860
One of the techniques is called pasteurisation.

71
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,860
Beer produced using pasteurisation

72
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,690
is called pasteurised beer.

73
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,540
You can buy this kind of beer

74
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,890
in the grocery store.

75
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,770
Voila.

76
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,850
They taste okay

77
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,500
but can be stored longer.

78
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,980
Another kind of beer

79
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,020
is produced without the help of pasteurisation,

80
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,060
the draught beer.

81
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,380
They taste better

82
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,530
but can only be stored for seven days.

83
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,380
I suppose that bar has different kinds of 
draught beer.

84
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,300
As for the five beers on the table,

85
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,020
Imperial Stout,

86
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,180
Coffee Stout,

87
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,010
Pale Ale,

88
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:35,700
Fruit Beer,

89
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,090
and my favourite, Lager.

90
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,580
This one's sweet.

91
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,980
This one's sour.

92
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,700
This one smells like wheat.

93
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,659
This one smells like fruit.

94
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,490
Hi, I'm here for the interview.

It's you?

98
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,300
Where's that female supervisor?

99
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,980
She appointed the task to me.

100
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,060
Follow me.

101
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:36,730
Take a seat.

102
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,540
Name?

103
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,460
Hugh Williams.

104
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,450
You were raised in a foreign country?

105
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,260
Kind of.

106
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,460
Age?

107
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:02,980
Two...

108
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,250
Twenty-four.

109
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,380
Unprofessional.

110
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,010
Do you know the slogan of this bar?

111
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,020
Brew freedom.

112
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,380
The fruit extracts in the fruit beer,

113
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,340
are they added before or after the fermentation?

114
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,020
After the fermentation.

115
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,780
What's the difference between the storage

116
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,890
of craft beer and regular beer?

117
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,660
Craft beers need to be laid flat.

118
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,860
and the cork needs to be at a certain temperature.

119
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,580
For regular beers, just store them vertically.

120
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,860
So unprofessional.

121
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,220
Not bad.

122
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,020
Looks like you've done your study.

123
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,300
So, do you know what it takes

124
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,420
to work here?

125
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,890
From the employment information,

126
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,100
I will be taking customers' orders

127
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,820
and making drinks for them.

128
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,460
But I will do my best

129
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,860
for any task assigned to me,

130
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,140
including future activities.

131
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,060
I will definitely do my best.

132
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,530
Even the supervisor won't be able to

133
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,970
find a weak spot.

134
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,290
Congratulations.

135
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,810
You and I are now co-workers.

136
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:17,980
Any question?

137
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,620
Just one,

138
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,460
when do I get my salary?

139
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,020
You get paid every month.

140
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,740
Is it possible to shorten that time,

141
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,580
like,

142
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,900
everyday?

143
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,700
Everyday?

144
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,860
You need money that desperately?

145
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,700
None of your business.

146
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,620
Is it possible?

147
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,460
it's okay,

148
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,620
but you won't earn a lot.

149
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,940
No problem, daily payment it is then.

150
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,180
Okay, then tomorrow is your first day.

151
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,540
I can start now.

152
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,060
Okay.

155
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,660
Why are you here?

156
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,740
I'm here to take a look at your store.

157
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,500
Sorry to show up without notice.

158

You've seen it now.

159
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,740
How's your business, good?

160
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,180
It's okay.

here?

I heard from Zhang Yi

164
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,140
that you are his best signed writer.

165
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,690
So, I'd like to read that book.

166

00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,500
Before, I...

00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,300
Don't even mention it.

171

I've forgotten about it.

If I couldn't stay at Zhang's,

178
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,540
where else could I go?

179
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,060
You haven't changed a bit,

180
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:47,970
so selfish.

181
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,700
I also care about you.

182
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,020
You are my son.

183
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:52,700
Think about it,

184
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,740
Zhang Yi can offer you a decent job.

185
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,890
You can earn a lot

186
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:57,890
and live a better life.

187
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:58,900
Why not?

188
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,260
What about my life?

189
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,020
I'm satisfied with it.

190
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,660
I sincerely hope

191
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,660
that you can have a second thought.

192
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,620
I really mean well.

193
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,620
I am working on the money.

194
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,940
Just one more month.

195
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,180
Sure.

196
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,420
One arm for one month.

197
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,420
Salary.

198
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,140
Money!

199
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,460
Lin Mo?

200
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,490
Lin Mo?

201
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:37,500
Lin Mo?

202
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,100
Lin Mo!

203
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,220
Lin Mo! What happened?

204
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,300
Why are you bleeding?

205
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,650
You're still alive, aren't you? Lin Mo!

206
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,940
Lin Mo, Lin Mo!

207
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:46,820
Thank god.

208
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,140
I'm fine. Are you alright?

209
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,220
I'm okay.

210
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,010
Stop tapping me

211
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,820
or I will die.

212
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,290
Lin Mo!

213
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,140
I've made up my mind,

214
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,940
there is nothing to discuss.

215
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:02,740
Please leave.

216
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,460
I know,

217
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,610
I did fail you.

218
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,900
I will make it up to you.

219
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,420
Just, do me this one favour, please?

220
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,900
Do me one favour, okay?

221
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,700
Don't be a part of my life anymore.

222
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,340
Stop interfering.

223
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:37,700
Hello?

224
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,060
Chi Yan!

225
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,460
A colleague of mine is hurt,

226
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,530
please come and help us.

227
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,060
What?

228
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,500
We are in the alley behind the bar.

229
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:44,900
Wait there,

230
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,700
I'm on my way.

231
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,140
Chi Yan.

232
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:54,780
Chi Yan.

233
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:57,780
The store's closed.

234
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,460
Yan, hear me out,

235
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,060
can, can you just...

236
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:08,980
Hugh!

237
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,130
Chi Yan!

238
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,300
Hurry!

239
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,530
Is he your colleague?

240
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,900
What should we do?

241
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,180
What should we do?

242
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,700
Why didn't you call an ambulance?

243
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:20,980
An ambulance,

244
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,380
what's that?

245
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:24,500
I don't want to go to the hospital.

246
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,700
If you dare make that call,

247
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,050
I will make your life miserable.

248
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,050
He's a nice guy, a good one.

249
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:31,900
Okay, no phone call.

250
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,180
What, where are you going?

251
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,180
Where do you want to go?

252
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,700
What's wrong?

253
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,300
Why did you...

254
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,460
You need to go to the hospital.

255
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,900
Please, let's go to the hospital.

256
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,180
What should we do?

257
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,330
What about

258
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,300
we take him back to the bookstore?

259
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:09,569
Lin Mo?

260
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:13,740
Lin Mo?

261
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,180
Lin Mo?

262
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:21,890
Lin Mo?

263
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:24,339
You're awake.

264
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:28,900
Don't move, stay still.

265
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:29,980
Where am I?

266
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,010
You are in the bookstore.

267
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,210
You wouldn't let us take you to the hospital.

268
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,580
So, we figured we'd take you here.

269
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:39,780
Thank you.

270
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,820
Chi Yan already cleaned your wounds.

271
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,940
He said that they are not that bad,

272
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,220
just scratches.

273
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,340
Who is Chi Yan?

274
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,780
He's the owner of the bookstore.

275
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,580
Tell me,

276
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,500
are those who beat you up today

277
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,260
the same group of people that we ran into

278
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,340
back in the fitting room?

279
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,050
Look at you.

280
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,340
They really wanted to hurt you.

281
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,500
What on earth did you do?

282
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,820
Do you regret saving me?

283
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,820
Just lie there.

284
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,940
You are Chi Yan, right?

285
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:25,820
Thanks a lot.

286
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,460
You did a good job cleaning my wounds.

287
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,260
About those wounds,

288
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,260
you really need to go to the hospital.

289
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,260
No can do,

290
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,340
a fortune-teller told me

291
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,780
not to go to the hospital for an entire year.

292
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,500
Otherwise, my life could be in danger.

293
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:52,890
It's Povidone Lodine.

294
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:57,700
Thanks.

295
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,300
Are you

296
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,700
a couple?

297
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,250
We're just friends.

298
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,180
Just friends.

299
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,050
I will see myself out.

300
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,700
Next time, drinks on me.

301
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,060
I don't drink.

302
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,580
You must be tired after your first day,

303
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,460
have some rest.

304
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:30,620
Thank you.

305
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:52,620
Boss,

306
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:54,970
if the rating of this season

307
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,460
continues to drop like this,

308
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,380
the website won't sign a new contract with us.

309
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,500
These are the best you can find?

310
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,810
The schedule is too tight.

311
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,180
It's impossible for me to find

312
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,180
someone as brilliant as Chi Yan

313
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:15,980
in such a short time.

314
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,970
Chi Yan, Chi Yan, Chi Yan!

315
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,050
I don't want to hear that name!

316
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,690
Find me someone better,

317
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,500
I don't care about the cost.

318
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,380
Clean up this mess.

319
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:38,700
Boss,

320
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,820
how about this.

321
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,610
I will contact the editor of the website right now.

322
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:44,930
I will ask him to tell the public that

323
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,380
the leaked contents

324
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,300
are just drafts

325
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,300
rather than the final versions

326
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,020
and let him...

327
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,140
You are telling me about this now?

328
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:15,580
Hello?

329
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,140
Yan,

330
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,460
are you free today?

331
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,220
I'd like to talk to you.

332
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:19,780
No.

333
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,300
Wait,

334
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,540
don't hang up.

335
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:22,700
I found

336
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,620
the pen that your dad used to use all the time,

337
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,300
remember?

338
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,380
It's a gift from you

339
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,900
when you won a writing competition

340
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,140
for the first time.

341
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,500
Chi Yan,

342
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,500
please allow me to visit,

343
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,860
I want you to have that pen.

344
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:41,050
Four o'clock this afternoon,

345
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,580
Twelve Oaks.

346
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,100
Target locked,

347
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,940
you have to come.

348
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:58,540
Right,

349
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,020
the pen.

350
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:09,980
I,

351
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,420
I was being rude the other day.

352
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,740
Wait,

353
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:22,770
could you please switch the sandwich?

354
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,300
My son is allergic to peanuts.

355
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,100
Sorry,

356
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,820
all sandwiches contain peanut butter.

357
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:27,930
But...

358
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:28,700
It's okay,

359
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,220
I will just scrape them off myself.

360
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:32,540
Let me.

361
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,250
I heard that the bookstore is not doing very well.

362
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,220
You need to be more flexible,

363
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,740
widen your product line.

364
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,580
You wanted to see me because?

365
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:58,500
You know,

366
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,610
it's not been easy for Yi.

367
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:01,660
He started the studio,

368
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,580
and it worked.

369
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,580
You also put

370
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,180
a lot of effort into it.

371
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,660
To be honest,

372
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,820
he is grateful to you.

373
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,250
Then please tell him

374
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,130
that I accept his gratitude.

375
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,140
The two of us didn't have contradictions.

376
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,780
We used to work together

377
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,260
and now we don't.

378
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,220
That's it.

379
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:33,140
Here,

380
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,410
there's 150,000 in the account,

381
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:35,540
please take it.

382
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,690
Is it a gesture from him?

383
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,770
Not important.

384
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,620
As your mom,

385
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,820
I wish for mutual benefits.

386
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,540
Yi

387
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,700
can realise his dream as a writer.

388
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,130
It's always a nice thing to have dreams.

389
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,540
You can use this money

390
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,420
to upgrade the bookstore.

391
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,860
I never considered the bookstore a business.

392
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,220
Chi Yan,

393
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,580
I know I haven't been around.

394
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,420
I'm in no place to criticise or comment on you.

395
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,210
But as your mom,

396
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,940
I have to tell you this.

397
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,100
You will eventually need to face the reality.

398
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,380
You have your own ideas,

399
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:12,810
you have dreams.

400
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:13,300
It's a good thing that you have your own pursuits.

401
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,300
It's a good thing that you have your own pursuits.

402
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:14,660
But,

403
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:14,780
But,

404
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,380
you can't just say no to money.

405
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,580
You need to be flexible to accomplish something.

406
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,260
Don't you think I've already heard about that?

407
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,300
If not,

408
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,860
why would I cooperate with him before?

409
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,530
But you also need to have boundaries.

410
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,540
I've made up my mind.

411
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,580
I won't give him my book.

412
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,340
To be honest,

413
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,340
the past few years

414
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,740
haven't been easy on me.

415
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,540
They've always considered

416
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,820
me an outsider.

417
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,060
So, could you please

418
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,050
do that as a favour for me?

419
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:02,220
You made your own choices.

420
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,340
See you next time.

421
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,060
My camera!

422
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:21,900
Chi Yan!

423
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,060
Chi Yan, are you mad at me?

424
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,420
Chi Yan, I didn't mean to come.

425
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:26,940
I,

426
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:28,970
I did mean to.

427
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,540
But, but I

428
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,740
didn't mean to eavesdrop.

429
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,700
I really didn't.

430
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,010
I really think you've made the right call.

431
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,330
Don't take that money!

432
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,940
Cut off any connection with Zhang Yi.

433
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,740
I think it's very...

434
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,290
Don't follow me.

435
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,260
But...

436
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:00,460
I saw you exhale from distance.

437
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:01,210
What happened?

438
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:02,060
Why did you want to see me?

439
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,620
What else could it be?

440
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,690
Because of him?

441
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,100
I really don't understand.

442
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,060
When he is upset,

443
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:12,860
he wouldn't talk at all.

444
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,300
When he is happy, like earlier today...

445
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:21,860
Never mind.

446
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,210
He's never happy.

447
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,140
Based on how much you care about him,

448
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,570
it's more than just gratitude.

449
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,700
That's why you are upset.

450
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,340
More than gratitude?

451
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,380
Then what is this?

452
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,180
Humans

453
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,620
call this relationship friendship.

454
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,210
So,

455
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:48,780
I think of him

456
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,180
as my boyfriend, right?

457
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,050
No, no, no.

458
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,700
It's different.

459
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,090
I really don't understand.

460
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,140
Handsome.

461
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,780
Lucky numbers.

462
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:08,330
Call me.

463
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,180
Handsome.

464
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:10,700
Your WeChat number?

465
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:11,580
Sure.

466
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:16,050
Send me a message.

467
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:17,740
That's him.

468
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,740
They are here for him.

469
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,100
Here's your receipt.

470
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:21,740
Here,

471
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:23,530
my number's on it.

472
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,930
Chi Yan and I are friends.

473
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:57,020
The two of us are friends now.

474
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:58,380
Cheers.

475
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:13,980
You're here.

476
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:16,780
You're here.

477
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,820
We are friends now, you know that?

478
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:21,780
You're drunk.

479
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:22,850
Time to go to bed.

480
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,700
Do you know we are friends now?

481
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,540
You know why?

482
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:32,020
Because I care about you.

483
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,500
Because I care about you.

484
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,580
That's why we are friends, Chi Yan.

485
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,340
You humans...

486
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,850
Do you have a ritual to celebrate friendship?

487
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,340
Nope.

488
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,740
Then use our ritual.

489
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:58,660
No.

490
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,140
Just let me hug you.

491
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,380
This is our ritual.

492
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:07,660
Do you have a better idea?

493
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,580
Your hands.

494
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,900
This is called a pinkie swear.

495
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,010
A pinkie swear?

496
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,090
We are friends after this?

497
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,850
Brilliant! Chi Yan is my friend!

498
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,940
But it's not enough.

499
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,300
You also need to make a promise.

500
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:40,780
A promise?

501
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,730
You have to promise me something.

502
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,620
You have to promise me

503
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,060
you'll never drink alone again.

504
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,210
It's too dangerous.

505
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,090
That's called a promise?

506
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,150
Then you need to make me a promise too.

507
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,780
Promise me

508
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:03,620
that you will be happy every day.

509
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,420
If something is bothering you, you tell me.

510
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,220
Don't keep it to yourself.

511
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,380
Deal?

512
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:13,940
Deal.

513
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,220
Just you?

514
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,340
Where's Hugh?

515
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:30,740
Hugh's not here.

516
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,490
What do you want?

517
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,940
It's nothing.

518
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,140
Do you have a wild animal here?

519
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,820
Or, were you so bored

520
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,340
that you did this on purpose?

521
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,810
If you have nothing to do,

522
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,380
help me carry the books.

523
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:48,060
Sorry,

524
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:49,780
that's Hugh's chore.

525
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,220
Meng Meng,

526
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,130
when I leave this place,

527
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:58,100
the one thing that I will miss the most 
is your cooking.

528
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,940
You are so good.

529
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,740
Leave?

530
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:01,970
Where are you going?

531
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:03,820
No, no, no.

532
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,260
It didn't mean anything.

533
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,180
You really scared me.

534
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:09,180
Also,

535
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,940
how are things going at the bookstore?

536
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:11,980
That place

537
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,500
was crowded not long ago.

538
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,220
But it's not anymore now.

539
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,930
It's Chi Yan.

540
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,380
He said the bookstore means a lot to him

541
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,220
and he will keep it open no matter what.

542
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:21,770
That's good.

543
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:22,500
So, I went through a lot of trouble,

544
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,540
came up with an idea,

545
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:25,220
and got many customers.

546
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,700
Then he was like, I don't want the store to be
too popular,

547
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,980
and drew those customers away.

548
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,260
From my perspective,

549
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:35,740
this is understandable.

550
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,730
It's like, when it comes to

551
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:38,540
the same question,

552
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,660
some will choose A

553
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,140
while some others choose B.

554
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,860
As for Chi Yan,

555
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,820
he chooses C,

556
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:46,500
the middle round.

557
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,850
He feels relaxed and comfortable

558
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,260
in this space

559
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,660
and he doesn't want anyone to mess

560
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,540
or destroy that space.

561
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,540
He also doesn't want anyone to step over 
his boundaries.

562
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:58,580
He can just be

563
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,060
relaxed.

564
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,260
Do you get me?

565
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,220
So, those who choose A and B

566
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,060
can do nothing

567
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,700
to enter that middle ground of his?

568
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,060
Not exactly.

569
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,900
You just need to find the right way.

570
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,340
But he never says anything.

571
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,890
He just keeps all the stuff to himself.

572
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:21,260
I don't know what to do.

573
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:25,820
Actually,

574
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,180
he may have already

575
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,820
taken one step towards you.

576
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,540
It's just,

577
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,410
for some,

578
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,540
it's just difficult to talk.

579
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:37,900
That's why

580
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,370
I love this flower shop.

581
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,570
Because

582
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:42,300
whenever I have something

583
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,900
that can't be expressed through words,

584
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,660
I can just express myself through flowers.

585
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,220
Through flowers?

586
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:48,930
You know,

587
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:50,980
different kinds of flowers

588
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,740
convey different meanings.

589
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,420
For example,

590
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,850
when it comes to yellow roses,

591
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,780
they represent friendship and blessings.

592
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,780
To him,

593
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,380
you must be someone special

594
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,460
as well as an important friend.

595
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:10,780
So.

596
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,500
Now that we've come this far, bro,

597
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,220
I've been really curious

598
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:26,100
about something.

599
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,620
Does Hugh know some secrets of yours?

600
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,380
Why do you let her stay?

601
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,340
I don't have secrets.

602
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,730
I'm not like you,

603
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,700
wearing nothing but underwear

604
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,940
when we graduated and...

605
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,570
That's enough.

606
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:39,980
You really got me.

607
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,020
We are bros.

608
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,620
Don't do that to me.

609
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:44,940
Xu Zihao,

610
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,860
just tell me why you're here.

611
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:54,740
Um,

612
00:33:56,060 --> 00:34:00,660
I really do need a favour.

613
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,540
Spit.

614
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:06,090
Um,

615
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,540
Qin Mingming and you went to the same
high school, right?

616
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:11,540
So,

617
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:16,940
is it at all possible

618
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:21,139
that you know some anecdotes or hobbies of hers?

619
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,420
You went through all this

620
00:34:25,449 --> 00:34:26,580
because of Qin Mingming?

621
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,380
Do you have the information I need?

622
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:30,219
Did we just meet?

623
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,219
Come here, come here.

624
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:32,050
Get down.

625
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:32,540
It's dangerous, dangerous.

626
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,420
Get down, you.

627
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,370
Just get down.

628
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:34,900
Come here.

629
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:35,659
Search your memory.

630
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:36,420
You two were classmates for three years.

631
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,739
You must know something about her.

632
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,300
Qin Mingming and I

633
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,820
were not even in the same class.

634
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:43,139
Also, you know damn well

635
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:43,980
about me.

636
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,900
Why would I know anything about her?

637
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,010
That classmate of yours

638
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,460
is so cold-hearted.

639
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:52,219
I'm handsome

640
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:53,020
and caring.

641
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,730
She is not moved at all.

642
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:56,699
So?

643
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:00,540
Also,

644
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,780
I find Qin Mingming

645
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,580
different from other girls

646
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:05,580
I know.

647
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,220
My first move was a mistake.

648
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:10,820
That's why

649
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,820
I have to be careful

650
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,090
with every new opportunity.

651
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,180
The reunion is the first step.

652
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,260
"Maybe next time" is my second move.

653
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,020
As for the third step,

654
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,420
that's where I need your help with.

655
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,140
Just ask her out for me.

656
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,020
So easy, right?

657
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:26,850
Easy.

658
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,820
So, you want me

659
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,980
to ask Qin Mingming out

660
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,540
and the three of us can have supper together?

661
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:35,860
Xu Zihao,

662
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:37,860
you're a pervert.

663
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,730
What did that come from?

664
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,580
I really am sincere.

665
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,940
Maybe I should just introduce

666
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,860
Xu Ziqi to Qin Mingming.

667
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,300
That way,

668
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,460
the two women with whom you have no idea
what to do

669
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,410
are in front of you at the same time.

670
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,060
Bro,

671
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,700
Xu Ziqi is the one

672
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,220
who introduced me to my last blind date.

673
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:55,860
I will never hear the end of it

674
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,220
if she finds out

675
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,300
that girl never even gave me a call.

676
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,700
Please help me out.

677
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,220
Just do me a favour.

678
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:06,340
Okay.

679
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:08,860
Beg me.

680
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:12,940
Chi,

681
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,980
I'm begging you, Chi.

682
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:15,540
Nope.

683
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,930
Bro!

684
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,210
You're back.

685
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,380
Why are you here?

686
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,340
I was just talking to him

687
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,370
about eating at the restaurant next door.

688
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:30,940
Want to join us?

689
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,980
Sure, let's go.

690
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:33,580
Let's go.

691
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,410
Come on, come on, come on.

692
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,540
You just had your meal.

693
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,930
I have perfect digestion.

694
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:46,420
Fish?

695
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:48,290
Will there be fish?

696
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:49,730
Yeah, I suppose.

697
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:50,660
I mean,

698
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,900
why do you love fish that much?

699
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,690
Are you a cat?

700
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:54,980
What are you talking about?

701
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,620
Say that again!

702
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,380
That's right, I'm a cat.

703
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,540
I'm not just a cat,

704
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:00,940
I also scratch.

705
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:01,740
Bro!

706
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,260
Don't snitch!

707
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:02,930
She is losing it again!

708
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,020
Don't.

709
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,100
Take that!

710
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,340
Have you ever seen a cat that scratches?

711
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:10,740
What?

712
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,460
I see.

713
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:18,450
What's wrong?

714
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,580
Mr.Yu just passed away.

715
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,170
The memorial service is this afternoon.

716
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,660
I need to be there.

717
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,170
Let me give you a ride.

718
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,420
You still have work to do at the hospital.

719
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,130
Don't bother.

720
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:39,620
Never mind,

721
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,980
I'm the shareholder, I can ask for the day off.

722
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,770
Just go and pack your stuff,

723
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:43,740
I'll be waiting in the car.

724
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:46,700
Take care of the store.

725
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:03,500
Sis,

726
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,210
are you leaving for a trip?

727
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:06,970
To our hometown.

728
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:07,530
To our hometown.

729
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,420
A classmate of mine is getting married,

730
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,730
I'm her bridesmaid.

731
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:11,700
I'll be back tomorrow.

732
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:12,980
Sis,

733
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,300
if you keep being someone else's bridesmaid,
you won't be able to find a husband.

734
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,650
Aren't you happy

735
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:18,970
that I will be around for you

736
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:19,850
for a couple more years?

737
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,340
You always want me to find a husband.

738
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,420
Who's he gonna be?

739
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:24,340
I don't need you to be around.

740
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:26,570
Hurry up and find me a brother-in-law.

741
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:27,660
Okay, fine.

742
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,370
I just got urged to get married

743
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:37,380
by a kid.

744
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:22,150
[Chi's Bookstore]

745
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:32,860
Is there a bank or an ATM nearby?

746
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:33,780
I need some cash.

747
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:34,820
Cash.

748
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,330
There should be an ATM

749
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:38,580
in the supermarket.

750
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:39,940
Let's go,

751
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:40,540
Okay.

752
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:21,940
What the hell?

753
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:24,300
These are so ugly.

754
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:29,860
Not this one.

755
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,180
What, what are you doing here?

756
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,100
Why did you return?

757
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,100
I, I,

758
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,180
I mean, I, we,

759
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,700
we have no idea that you are here.

760
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,060
You...

761
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,180
Stop talking and get out!

762
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,410
I'm I'm sorry.

763
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,050
Don't turn around!

764
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,340
It's so big.

765
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:14,420
I'm done.

766
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:16,620
You,

767
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,300
it's okay for you to sneak around,

768
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,940
why aren't you wearing clothes?

769
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,420
I had no time.

770
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:23,660
No time?

771
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,540
So, you mean,

772
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,020
the moment Chi and I left,

773
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,500
you got naked?

774
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:32,820
I got naked.

775
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,740
Why are you staring!

776
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,340
I'm not, I won't.

777
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:37,940
I won't look.

778
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:39,580
Pervert.

779
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,660
No, I mean,

780
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:44,100
it takes a psycho

781
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:45,970
or an alien

782
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,850
to do what you've done.

783
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:48,900
What are you talking about?

784
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,900
You definitely know something about Chi.

785
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:53,420
I don't.
