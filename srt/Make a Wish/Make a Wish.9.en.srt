4
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,900
Wanna stay a bit longer?

5
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,779
Take your time.

6
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:20,620
Let's go.

7
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,180
Where are we going for late-night snacks?

8
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,900
Wanna go to the diner last night?

9
00:04:59,020 --> 00:04:59,740
It was good.

10
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,250
I think so, too.

11
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,820
Let's treat ourselves to a barbecue

12
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,330
after the payday, shall we?

13
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,860
I love barbecue!

14
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,020
The day is finally over!

15
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,170
Finally!

16
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,740
What is that?

17
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,980
It's furry and moving.

18
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:27,980
What?

19
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:28,900
A rat.

20
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,460
A rat?

21
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,300
It's moving.

22
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,460
Get me a broom.

23
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:35,940
Okay.

24
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:45,780
What are you doing?

25
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:47,900
What are you doing?

26
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:48,860
There's a rat.

27
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,770
A rat.

28
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,620
A what?

29
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:51,620
A rat.

30
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:52,460
Really?

31
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,060
Where is it?

32
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,260
Over there.

33
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:54,940
There.

34
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,700
Allow me.

35
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,180
I'm gonna get you!

36
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,170
Lin Mo, what are you doing here?

37
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,490
I almost hit you.

38
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:09,420
Did you see any rats?

39
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,180
Rats?

40
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,860
Not really.

41
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,940
But I saw a shabby cat.

42
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,500
Go catch the rat.

43
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,620
See ya.

44
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,380
So annoying.

45
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,580
I am a white cat!

46
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,260
Is it here?

47
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,580
He kept the rat to himself.

48
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,980
Without the cat seal,

49
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,330
you'd need a potion.

50
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,340
It can help you maintain a permanent human form,

51
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,930
but it will cause a loss of smell.

52
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,540
What's wrong with you?

53
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,380
The boss won't be happy with this.

54
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:47,940
Sorry.

55
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,060
I got distracted.

56
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,900
How's filling up beer distracting?

57
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,220
You've been acting weird all day.

58
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,260
Lin Mo sells the most drinks every day.

59
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,300
He must've been distracted 'cause he's tired.

60
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,660
What are you yelling at him for?

61
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,420
Miss, I just saw him...

62
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,380
That's enough.

63
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,490
Mind your own business.

64
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:06,140
Go.

65
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:27,610
Well.

66
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,340
Have some rest.

67
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,220
Leave the beer to me.

68
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,300
As she's falling down,

69
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,820
Su Miao sees a handsome face

70
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,260
getting closer.

71
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,820
He holds her in his arms tightly.

72
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,810
She tries to resist,

73
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,300
but the man warns her,

74
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,210
"Don't move!

75
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,300
Or, I don't know what I will do to you."

76
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,020
Get lost.

77
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,420
That's not funny.

78
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,620
I've never seen you this worked up with study.

79
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,460
Mr. Big Writer,

80
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,020
I've never really

81
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,220
commented on your works.

82
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,580
But...

83
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,659
Keep it that way.

84
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,740
But I have to say,

85
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:43,299
this novel of yours

86
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,780
is such a clichÃ©!

87
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:48,930
What do you need?

88
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,100
Is this a sacred hall?

89
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,180
Can't I just hang around?

90
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,770
I was running errands

91
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:54,970
in the neighborhood,

92
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,100
so I dropped by.

93
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,380
I'm on a deadline here.

94
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,340
I don't have time for this.

95
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,930
Just get on with your errands.

96
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,660
She turned me down.

97
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:10,700
Qin Mingming?

98
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:13,860
Bro.

99
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,860
You get me!

100
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:20,460
What's wrong?

101
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,100
I confessed my love on impulse.

102
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,260
Then, she turned me down.

103
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:32,310
In that case...

104
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,490
Let's have a drink upstairs.

105
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,300
I'm here 'cause...

106
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,820
I want to...

107
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,060
I want to ask...

108
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,780
I wanna ask you something.

109
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,980
I know that

110
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,330
you two were just friends

111
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,210
in high school.

112
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,180
But perhaps...It seems that...

113
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,180
Stop right there.

114
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,380
Nothing happened

115
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,060
between us back then.

116
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,060
Nothing is happening

117
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,140
and will ever happen between us.

118
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,220
What were you thinking?

119
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,420
Well...

120
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,130
Are you...

121
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:11,660
You are...

122
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,540
Can you read my mind?

123
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,380
Who wants to read your mind?

124
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,340
You've written

125
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,420
everything on your face.

126
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,980
It's so obvious.

127
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:19,930
Is it?

128
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,700
Nothing is on my face but my handsome looks.

129
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:28,980
So?

130
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,020
What are you gonna do next?

131
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,660
I won't give up.

132
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,220
Tell you what.

133
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,300
Falling in love

134
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,700
is not something

135
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,420
that you can switch off and on as you wish.

136
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,220
You know?

137
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,130
Why am I telling you this?

138
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,010
You won't get it.

139
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:46,940
Listen to me, Chi.

140
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:47,860
You...

141
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:48,700
You...

142
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,020
You'd rather fall in love with a cat

143
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,300
than with a human being.

144
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,060
Seems that you've got everything figured out.

145
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:00,300
Then, don't come to me anymore.

146
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,540
I don't know what love is.

147
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,810
But I miss you.

148
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,820
I miss you so much, bro.

149
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,580
I want to hold you tightly in my arm.

150
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,410
Get lost.

151
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,020
Don't move.

152
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,300
Or, I don't know what I will do to you.

153
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,630
You got your paycheck.

154
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,990
Aren't you gonna treat yourself to some snacks?

155
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,110
That's a good point.

156
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,870
In fact, I can spend some of it

157
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,070
on snacks.

158
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:33,800
Such as...

159
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,000
Fish cakes, fish floss,

160
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,990
fish jerky,

161
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:40,550
and the canned anchovies I saw on TV.

162
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,800
Why don't you just buy a whole fishpond?

163
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,270
How do you know my wish?

164
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,110
That's exactly what I want!

165
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,920
Actually, I can also

166
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,910
buy something for Chi Yan, right?

167
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,440
I'll just spend some...

168
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,460
What on earth is going on between you two?

169
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,040
It's one thing that you live together.

170
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,150
But you even want to buy him stuff with your salary.

171
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,550
I work for him. That's all.

172
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,400
What does he like?

173
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,600
Picking a gift

174
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:19,830
is all about

175
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,270
knowing the recipient.

176
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,510
What do you think

177
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,640
Chi Yan is like?

178
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:25,870
He's...

179
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,350
He rarely goes out.

180
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,070
He's either at the bookstore or writing.

181
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,030
He has only one friend.

182
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,830
He hates socializing.

183
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,510
He does have a healthy daily routine, though.

184
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,190
But he's somewhat OCD.

185
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,710
He's obsessed with waste sorting.

186
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,440
Can you imagine?

187
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,670
Come on.

188
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,590
Waste sorting!

189
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,630
How could he... Right?

190
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,190
See?

191
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,790
What did I tell you?

192
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,550
OCD.

193
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,720
Do you know what causes OCD?

194
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,750
It's a disorder triggered by stress.

195
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,390
It's associated with dysregulation
 of neurotransmitters in the brain.

196
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,030
Serious OCD will lead to schizophrenia.

197
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,990
Many serial killers in history

198
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,510
suffered from OCD.

199
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,030
He's just having too much

200
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,080
free time on his hands.

201
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,550
Does he often sort waste?

202
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,350
Every day at the same time.

203
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,760
He wants me to do it for him

204
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,960
but I don't have the patience.

205
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:34,750
Look.

206
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,160
I see.

207
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:39,630
I'm going home.

208
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,710
Wanna come to the bookstore?

209
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,510
Nah, you go ahead.

210
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,440
See you tomorrow.

211
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:44,230
Bye.

212
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,160
This is...

213
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:23,990
Here.

214
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,190
Take it.

215
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:28,790
No, I won't.

216
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,230
Tell me what it is.

217
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:31,910
A surprise.

218
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,350
Is it living?

219
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,270
It's lively.

220
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:37,830
It's so big.

221
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:38,310
Not at all.

222
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,790
It's small. But it can grow bigger.

223
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:40,710
Right?

224
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,150
Unwrap it.

225
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,030
No.

226
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:44,750
Come on.

227
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,110
No.

228
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,990
I've saved for a long time to get you this.

229
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,830
A token of my gratitude.

230
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:54,350
Careful.

231
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,910
It's a grape seedling.

232
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,270
We can grow grapes at home

233
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,630
and make wine ourselves.

234
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,070
Do you like it?

235
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:25,760
Yes.

236
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:27,640
Thank you.

237
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,630
How romantic!

238
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,240
Lin Mo!

239
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:34,430
What are you doing here?

240
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,030
Revenge.

241
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,710
It's a book. Do you have it?

242
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,440
The bookstore is that way.

243
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,150
This is private property.

244
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,430
Sorry.

245
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,430
No one was there.

246
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,280
So I just came in.

247
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,190
What?

248
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,630
Am I interrupting the plant tour?

249
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,360
No.

250
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,680
It's a grape seedling.

251
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,350
It can grow fruits to make wine.

252
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,070
Have you seen it before?

253
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,350
A novella by Wang Zengqi.

254
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:02,750
Revenge.

255
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,750
Fine, I'll take it.

256
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,430
It's sold out.

257
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,910
What a pity!

258
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,910
By the way, Xiao Xiu,

259
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:12,270
on my way here, I saw

260
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,910
a nice fish hotpot place.

261
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,750
You said you wanted to have fish yesterday.

262
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,550
Let's go together.

263
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,070
Great!

264
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:17,830
Today's Friday.

265
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:19,910
Friday?

266
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,670
I need to go to the laundromat on Fridays.

267
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,430
Okay, go ahead.

268
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:32,590
I will.

269
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,110
But you need to sort the waste.

270
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,110
I...

271
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:37,910
Then...

272
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,190
I'll go to the laundromat.

273
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,310
It's fine.

274
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,190
I'll go with you.

275
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,440
It's on the way to the restaurant.

276
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:46,470
Really?

277
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:47,590
Let's go, then.

278
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,750
I'm going to the laundromat now.

279
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:53,430
Bye.

280
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,150
What are you listening to?

281
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,190
What?

282
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,430
Sorry.

283
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,440
You just reminded me of someone.

284
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,830
The girl that looks like me?

285
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,920
Yes.

286
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,830
But she's different from you.

287
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,910
Well...

288
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:55,710
Sorry...

289
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,350
For any inconvenience I've caused you.

290
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,030
Seems that you're

291
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,270
an ocean away from me.

292
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,550
Please don't apologize to me.

293
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,720
It's totally normal for one person to like someone

294
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,990
who doesn't like them back.

295
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,560
It's not your fault.

296
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,990
Let's just pretend nothing happened.

297
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,110
You can walk your dog,

298
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:18,150
do your shows, and go to the bookstore
 like you used to.

299
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,950
No need to keep your distance because of me.

300
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,390
Thank you.

301
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,470
I was not nice to you.

302
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:34,440
Sorry for that.

303
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,110
It's fine.

304
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,430
I'm quite used to the attitude.

305
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,070
That's why I can be friends

306
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:39,830
with Chi Yan.

307
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,070
That's quite convincing.

308
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,030
The hospital is not far ahead.

309
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,910
I'll get some spirulina powder for Bulb.

310
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:50,750
Don't bother.

311
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:51,990
I insist.

312
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,590
I was in charge of Bulb's examination.

313
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,750
It's my VIP client.

314
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:55,880
It's my job.

315
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,230
Well...

316
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,350
Thank you.

317
00:20:58,870 --> 00:20:59,520
You're welcome.

318
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,480
An abandoned kitten.

319
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,310
It's three months old tops.

320
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:19,950
We can't leave it here

321
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,640
in the middle of the night.

322
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,030
Come on.

323
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,600
Let's take it inside.

324
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,350
Cute, right?

325
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,350
So cute.

326
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:37,070
Let me show you how to feed it.

327
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:38,550
Alright?

328
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:40,910
Here,

329
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:41,790
kitty, kitty.

330
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,270
Grab it by the scruff.

331
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,430
Then feed it on the side.

332
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,750
Push the plunger slowly.

333
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,360
Not too fast.

334
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:51,070
Or the milk will get into its lungs.

335
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,150
It's eating.

336
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,320
It's so adorable.

337
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,110
As are you.

338
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,600
I mean...

339
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,630
In the eyes of an elephant,

340
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,910
all the humans are cute.

341
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,950
Do you know that

342
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,470
elephants think of humans

343
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,600
the same way as

344
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,630
humans do kittens?

345
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,360
So, elephants think we are cute.

346
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,710
This is the first time someone called me cute.

347
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,150
Chi Yan!

348
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,220
Let's go to the hospital.

349
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:12,910
Come.

350
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,230
Chi!

351
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,390
To what do I owe the pleasure?

352
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:21,990
Xiao Xiu got struck by a falling plant.

353
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:23,190
Her left leg is bleeding a lot.

354
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,950
Can I take her to your hospital?

355
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,430
That'll delay proper treatments.

356
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,280
Go to the emergency room.

357
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:29,670
It's complicated.

358
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:30,550
She can't go there.

359
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,470
I don't have time to explain.

360
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,710
Do you know any private doctors?

361
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:38,400
Doctor!

362
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,110
She hurt her leg.

363
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:40,990
Please wait here, thanks.

364
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:44,750
Hang in there.

365
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,710
The doctor is coming.

366
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,310
Chi Yan?

367
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,550
Luo!

368
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,320
Dr. Luo.

369
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,470
She's having allergic reactions.

370
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:03,670
Am I gonna die?

371
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,310
No, wait for me here.

372
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,070
I'll be right back.

373
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:11,590
How's she?

374
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,430
She's allergic to the anesthetic.

375
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,160
But we need to stitch her wound.

376
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,120
Can I go in there?

377
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,470
Okay.

378
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:24,790
Xiao Xiu.

379
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,350
Does it hurt?

380
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,310
Listen to me.

381
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,190
We need to stitch the wound on your leg

382
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,670
so that it can heal.

383
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:48,670
But it will hurt a bit more

384
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,310
since you're allergic to the anesthetic.

385
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,040
It already hurts so bad.

386
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,990
I know.

387
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,350
Don't worry.

388
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:56,470
I'm here with you.

389
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,030
I'm not going anywhere.

390
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,110
Okay?

391
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,600
Dr. Luo is an expert.

392
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,120
Let's trust him, okay?

393
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,550
Hold her still.

394
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:26,310
There, there.

395
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,390
Do we need to sedate her?

396
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,310
There, there.

397
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,470
Sorry about that.

398
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:30,230
Luo.

399
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,760
Could you leave us for a minute?

400
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,670
Let me talk to her.

401
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,030
Sorry.

402
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:36,830
There, there.

403
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,630
It's alright.

404
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:38,430
I'll talk to her.

405
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,270
There, there.

406
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,030
Everything is fine.

407
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,240
Breathe.

408
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:50,560
Breathe.

409
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:51,710
Come on.

410
00:25:58,950 --> 00:25:59,430
Yeah.

411
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,270
There, there.

412
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:06,430
It's alright.

413
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,030
Here.

414
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,070
Careful.

415
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:21,750
Xiao Xiu.

416
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,150
Thank you for saving me today.

417
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,110
You were very brave.

418
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,150
But you're allergic to the anesthetic.

419
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,430
If they don't stitch the wound,

420
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,630
it'll get worse.

421
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,390
It'll hurt even more.

422
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,470
You might even lose the ability to walk,

423
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,230
jump,

424
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,550
climb a tree,

425
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,350
or catch fish.

426
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,480
You don't want that, do you?

427
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:46,800
So let's do this together.

428
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:48,910
Let's cooperate with Dr. Luo

429
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,640
and get the wound stitched.

430
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,720
Dr. Luo was my senior at high school.

431
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,280
He's a nice guy.

432
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,270
He's the best doctor here.

433
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,630
He'll make sure your leg heals.

434
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,080
Let's trust him,

435
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,230
shall we?

436
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:12,710
I'll ask him in.

437
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:18,950
Don't be scared.

438
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,270
Shall I continue?

439
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,680
Come on. Start the surgery.

440
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:25,790
Don't look at it.

441
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:27,840
Hold her still.

442
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,190
It'll be over soon.

443
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,510
Breathe.

444
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:38,670
Almost done.

445
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:39,400
Hang in there.

446
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:40,630
Hang in there.

447
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:49,670
Almost.

448
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:50,230
Almost done.

449
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,510
It's alright. It's almost done.

450
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:55,800
Almost.

451
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,110
Hold her still.

452
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,040
Hang in there. It's almost done.

453
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,040
Almost done.

454
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,190
Hang in there.

455
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,880
Hold her still.

456
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,760
Hold her still.

457
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,990
Don't worry. It's almost done.

458
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,280
Almost.

459
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,070
Bandage the wound.

460
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:26,280
Xiao Xiu.

461
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:30,750
Xiao Xiu.

462
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,590
How's she?

463
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,720
A minor fracture

464
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,630
with an open wound.

465
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:13,430
It was stitched.

466
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:15,950
I brought some food.

467
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:17,120
She can have some

468
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,000
when she wakes up.

469
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:25,630
Thank you.

470
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,870
No problem.

471
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,310
Do you know Luo Jiaxuan?

472
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,190
Yeah.

473
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,830
Why else would I send you here?

474
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,270
He's a friend of a senior in college.

475
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,430
We hung out several times.

476
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,390
He was my senior in high school.

477
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,520
What are the odds?

478
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,230
It's fate!

479
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:48,430
Watch over her.

480
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:49,510
I'll pay for the bills.

481
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:49,990
Okay.

482
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:55,710
Chi Yan.

483
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:57,310
Luo.

484
00:29:59,040 --> 00:29:59,800
How's she doing?

485
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,190
Still in a coma.

486
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:04,790
She'll be fine, right?

487
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,320
Yeah.

488
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,080
She'll wake up in no time. Don't worry.

489
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,310
Thank you for today.

490
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,630
Don't mention it. It's my job.

491
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,830
I need to tell you something.

492
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,000
Go ahead.

493
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:17,080
Her temperature and heart rate

494
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,910
are higher than average.

495
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:20,400
I suggest she do a chest X-ray.

496
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:21,830
No need.

497
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,950
Her temperature has always been higher.

498
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:26,120
It's normal.

499
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,110
Besides, her leg is already injured.

500
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,280
We will wait until she recovers.

501
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:36,510
Is she your girlfriend?

502
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:37,830
No.

503
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,640
She works at my bookstore.

504
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,870
I thought she's your girlfriend,

505
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:46,020
seeing that you were so worried.

506
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:49,880
She saved my life.

507
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:53,720
It's only natural that I was worried about her.

508
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,360
It's rare

509
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,240
to see a different side of you.

510
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,640
But it seems that you haven't changed a bit.

511
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:08,040
How time flies!

512
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,550
Ten years have passed in a blink of an eye.

513
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:11,560
Yes.

514
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,960
Among all the junior schoolmates,

515
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,960
you left me with the deepest impression.

516
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,070
You were handsome

517
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:20,590
and always alone.

518
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,000
You were a good writer.

519
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,910
Quite a character.

520
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:25,990
You mean I was an outcast.

521
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:29,990
Sorry.

522
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,800
Maybe I shouldn't have brought it up.

523
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:32,190
It's okay.

524
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,190
After all, you were...

525
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:35,830
It's alright.

526
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,030
It's all in the past now.

527
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:39,550
You helped me a lot back then.

528
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,110
I remember it all.

529
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,120
How've you been?

530
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:47,790
What do you do now?

531
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,670
I own a bookstore.

532
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,310
A bookstore?

533
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:53,800
Suits you perfectly.

534
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:56,910
I'll come by when I'm free.

535
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:57,830
Welcome.

536
00:31:59,350 --> 00:31:59,910
Deal.

537
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,110
Where is Chi Yan?

538
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,360
He's paying the bills.

539
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:17,800
He'll be back soon.

540
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:21,510
Here.

541
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,080
Up.

542
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:31,120
Xu Zihao.

543
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,080
My leg...

544
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,670
Have I lost the ability to run

545
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:38,070
or jump?

546
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,270
I know the doctor who treated you, Dr. Luo.

547
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,390
He's Chi Yan's schoolmate.

548
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,440
He's a great guy.

549
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,520
Very professional.

550
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:46,960
Trust him with your injury.

551
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:48,550
You don't need to worry at all.

552
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,510
Here.

553
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:50,920
Okay.

554
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:53,680
Dr. Luo?

555
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:56,030
He is quite nice.

556
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:59,080
He even let Chi Yan stay in the operating room with me.

557
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,070
You've no idea

558
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,870
how worked up Chi Yan sounded

559
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:05,590
when he knew you were injured.

560
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:07,830
I've never seen him that nervous.

561
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,470
Xiao Xiu.

562
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,430
Good for you.

563
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,800
You haven't asked me

564
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,350
how I got injured.

565
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:18,950
I saved that damsel in distress.

566
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,150
I was admirable!

567
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,630
Damsel in distress?

568
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,510
You mean, Chi Yan?

569
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:29,000
He'd be the ice-cold damsel

570
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,270
with a stone heart.

571
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,790
Do you know the animated film

572
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,550
called Frozen?

573
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,830
I think he's Elsa.

574
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:41,270
Elsa?

575
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,840
The pretty girl

576
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,350
with a blue dress and silver hair?

577
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:46,510
Chi Yan?

578
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:48,070
With the blue dress and silver hair?

579
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:49,950
Don't you agree?

580
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,070
He is Elsa.

581
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,270
More like a ninja turtle.

582
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:18,909
Are you alright?

583
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:28,830
Thanks.

584
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,030
You haven't recovered yet.

585
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,159
Don't move around, will you?

586
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,830
I just want to exercise more.

587
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:35,870
It'll help me recover faster.

588
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,270
The doctor said I need to do...

589
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:39,650
Rehab exercises.

590
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:40,520
You need to go to the hospital for that.

591
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,840
Don't do it at home.

592
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:44,480
If you need anything,

593
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,190
just let me know.

594
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:49,120
You just lie down and focus on recovery.

595
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,199
Until then, try not to tear the house down.

596
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:55,830
You mean... I can order you around?

597
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:58,630
Chi Yan.

598
00:34:58,910 --> 00:34:59,710
I want some snacks.

599
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,590
I want a beverage.

600
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,670
Can you get me the Little Prince?

601
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,680
Get me a blanket, will you?

602
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:39,110
I want the doll in my room.

603
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,110
I wanna go to the bathroom.

604
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,590
Do you know what "enough is enough" means?

605
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:08,190
But I got injured badly for you.

606
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,950
Ungrateful humans.

607
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,200
You exhale more CO2 in two days

608
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,200
than I do in two months.

609
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,470
I am bored.

610
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:46,080
Feel anything?

611
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:47,910
It doesn't hurt, does it?

612
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:48,950
It does.

613
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:55,070
Do you want to play outside?

614
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:58,110
When you recover,

615
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,720
we can play outside every day.

616
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,430
No.

617
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:02,190
I will be rotten

618
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,800
and covered in fungus

619
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,830
by then.

620
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:07,150
You won't.

621
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:08,870
Come on. Take a good rest.

622
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,360
Mingming.

623
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,810
I heard that Xiao Xiu was injured.

624
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:17,560
I'm here to check up on her.

625
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,150
Mingming!

626
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,350
Xiao Xiu! Are you alright?

627
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:20,790
Come!

628
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,190
Xu Zihao told me that

629
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,310
someone hit you with a plant.

630
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:24,270
Who would be so despicable?

631
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:25,950
No idea.

632
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,880
Are you seriously hurt?

633
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:31,590
He says it'll take 100 days for me to recover.

634
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:32,960
I'll get you some water.

635
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:33,870
Thanks.

636
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:34,950
Don't listen to him.

637
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,710
I had a minor fracture once.

638
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:39,350
It'll take a month or so.

639
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:40,270
-Then you can walk around.
-A month?

640
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:40,790
Yeah.

641
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,200
He's such a liar!

642
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,630
Take it easy.

643
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:45,670
Liar!

644
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:47,110
Thanks.

645
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:48,830
Careful, it's hot.

646
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,950
Liar.

647
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,950
Right, Xu Zihao told me that

648
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:00,950
someone threw the pot on purpose.

649
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:01,950
What happened?

650
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:03,950
That night,

651
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:07,910
the pot was aimed at me.

652
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,600
If Xiao Xiu hadn't pushed me away,

653
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,150
I would've been...

654
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,110
Well...

655
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:17,870
Do you suspect anyone?

656
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,910
Did you cross anyone?

657
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:25,190
Zhang Yi.

658
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,880
But he wouldn't do something like this.

659
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:29,400
Zhang Yi?

660
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,630
The one who was trending on Weibo,

661
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,600
the writer-influencer, Zhang Yi?

662
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,560
He's a bastard.

663
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:37,270
But he wouldn't do things like this.

664
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,640
Still, he's a bastard.

665
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:39,870
Did you call the police?

666
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,480
We don't have evidence

667
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,030
to prove that someone did it on purpose.

668
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,070
Even if we called the police,

669
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,190
they wouldn't be able to do much.

670
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:50,670
Right.

671
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,310
Well, I'll ask Uncle Gao

672
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:53,910
and see if there's anything he can do.

673
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,870
That'd be great. Thanks.

674
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:56,630
No problem.

675
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,070
But now that you're injured,

676
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,050
is it convenient for you to live together?

677
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:03,270
You know, showers and stuff.

678
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,070
Chi Yan is a guy, after all.

679
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:06,350
Do you need me to help you?

680
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,110
It's convenient.

681
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,630
Showers...

682
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,960
It's convenient.

683
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,630
Convenient.

684
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:19,780
And the sleeping arrangement?

685
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,590
She sleeps on the couch.

686
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,150
He sleeps in the bedroom.

687
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,670
I sleep on the couch out here.

688
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:27,400
You sleep on the couch?

689
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:30,190
Chi Yan, are you a monster?

690
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,950
She's a girl and she's injured.

691
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,150
And you let her sleep on the couch?

692
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:34,670
She...

693
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:39,190
She likes the couch.

694
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:48,340
You want to live with him
 even when he treats you like this?

695
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,110
I don't want to.

696
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,950
It's just for now.

697
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,070
I'll just have to suck it up.

698
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,710
Why did you live together in the first place?

699
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:55,190
I...

700
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,390
I didn't want to...

701
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,200
But I had to...

702
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,080
There are reasons...

703
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,550
Something happened between us...

704
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:01,670
I couldn't leave...

705
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,070
So, I have to live with him.

706
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,180
There's only so much a cat...

707
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:07,350
There's only so much a person can do.

708
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:08,790
Do you understand what I mean?

709
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:13,910
Yes.

711
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,470
It's alright. I'll let myself out.

712
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,710
It's fine. I'll walk you out.

713
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:23,200
Watch out.

714
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:31,470
Your car is...

715
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,320
I parked over there.

See you.

718
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:35,630
Thank you for coming.

00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,480
On her behalf?

Who?

Never mind.

I know you're injured,

so I'm here to pick you up.

728

I have to go, right?

I can't lose my job.

735
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:47,510
Is your boss a monster,

736

It's alright.

It's a training course. I'll just sit there and listen.

739
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:55,870
Sit there?

740
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:27,350
Thanks.

741

Careful.

Here.

Put it on.

I'll do it myself.

Allow me.

746
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:39,910
Okay.

Bag.

I'll come back as soon as I finish training.

00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:50,910
Drive safe.

751
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,390
Let's go.

752
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:51,870
How's your leg?

753
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,390
Feeling better?

754
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:54,830
Much better.

755
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,150
But the fracture hasn't healed.

756
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:58,200
I was told that it'll take a month.

757
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,800
I didn't realize how serious it was.

758
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:02,910
Sorry.

759
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:04,600
What are you sorry for?

760
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,750
You are taking me out for food.

761
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:07,000
I need to thank you.

762
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:09,440
It was so strange.

763
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:12,400
The plant was just sitting there on the balcony.

764
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,520
And suddenly, it fell off.

765
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,070
Chi Yan and Qin Mingming think

766
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:16,430
someone did it on purpose to hurt us.

767
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:20,470
Even so,

768
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:22,200
Chi Yan was the target.

769
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:24,870
Why did you go all out to save him?

770
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:26,480
I didn't go all out.

771
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:27,800
It was an act of instinct.

772
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:28,870
I saw him in danger

773
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:29,750
and I just went ahead.

774
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,440
As they say in a novel,

775
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:34,750
it's was chivalry.

776
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:36,350
Chivalry

777
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:37,990
should be practiced on good people.

778
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:40,710
Appearances can be deceiving.

779
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:42,440
Do you really know

780
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:43,830
what Chi Yan is like?

781
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:45,550
Why do you always think

782
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:46,740
Chi Yan is a bad person?

783
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:49,040
I think he looks like a better person than you.

784
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:50,360
Look at yourself.

785
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,310
This, and this.

786
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,230
I am just worried about you.

787
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,430
Don't be.

788
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:57,840
Chi Yan can be dull,

789
00:44:58,030 --> 00:44:59,310
but he's a decent person.

790
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:02,990
Do you like him?

791
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:04,150
Yeah.

792
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:05,950
I mean,

793
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:07,790
do you like him in an unusual way?

794
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:09,840
What unusual way?

795
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:11,110
I just like him.

796
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:14,390
You really have no idea.

797
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,510
There are different feelings of like.

798
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:17,830
What I meant by "like"

799
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:19,830
is not the same as you liking fish.

800
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:22,510
Do you like anyone?

801
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:29,790
Yeah.

802
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:34,040
But she's dead.

803
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:38,790
Sorry.

804
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:43,750
As the saying goes, you are what you eat.

805
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:45,670
Have more pork steaks.

806
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:48,590
Are you calling me a pig?

807
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:49,800
Fine.

808
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,590
I'll take them then.

809
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:52,760
Hold on.

810
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:54,990
I won't take it out on food.

811
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:55,790
Right?

812
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:56,600
Come on.

813
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,350
Give it to me.

814
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:12,430
Chi Yan!

815
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:15,510
Let me help.

816
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:16,670
Careful.

817
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,150
I'll carry you upstairs.

818
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:18,790
Let me.

819
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:21,190
It's okay. I can do it.

820
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:24,710
Let me do it.

821
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:26,760
I can do it.

822
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:27,670
I'll do it.

823
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:28,840
I can do it.

824
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,070
I can do it.
