00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,740
His high school Chinese teacher's.

00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,260
he and Chi Yan were really close.

Chi Yan

10
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,890
communicated with him not long ago.

11
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,580
He passed away?

You never know which comes first,

14
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:15,660
My condolences.

00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:54,740
I don't want to.

19
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,060
Chi Yan,

20
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,380
some other teachers have talked to me,

21
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,860
you are not doing well in some subjects.

22
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,980
I know you are good at writing.

23
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,130
But you probably know

24
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,100
that to get into a decent university,

25
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:19,649
you need to be more well-round.

26
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:23,850
Have you thought about a future career path?

27
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:36,700
Studying in a university

28
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,140
is not a must, is it?

29
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,020
Fine.

30
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:50,980
As a teacher,

31
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,500
it's difficult for me to say this.

32
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,220
Listen carefully,

33
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,500
Chi Yan,

34
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,620
you are gifted.

35
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,260
There's something special about your articles.

36
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,820
Also, I sense that something more sophisticated

37
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,780
is hidden somewhere in those articles.

38
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,980
You still need practice to better 
express yourself.

39
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,500
But you really are gifted.

40
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,980
I can tell.

41
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:16,770
Sure,

42
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,580
a university degree is not a must.

43
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,460
But it's the easiest one compared to others.

44
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,940
If you don't choose this path,

45
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,260
you'll have to work much harder

46
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,530
and burden more risks,

47
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,500
understand?

53
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,300
Not long ago,

54
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,530
Chi Yan's mom paid him a visit.

55
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:50,140
What?

56
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,860
How dare she?

57
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:54,460
What's wrong?

58
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,620
Chi's father passed away

59
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,580
when he was still in primary school.

60
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,180
His mother remarried not long after that

61
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,220
and basically left him.

62
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,740
So, he lived by himself?

63
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,060
He lived with his grandfather.

64
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,700
But his grandfather passed when he was in college.

65
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,340
From then on, he rarely visits his hometown.

66
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,300
All he cares about is that little bookstore of his.

67
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,140
No wonder he is kind of weird.

68
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,660
He just likes to be alone

69
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,780
because of what he went through when he was a child.

70
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,740
He acts cold, but he's actually a warm guy.

71
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,380
Otherwise, the two of us

72
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,140
wouldn't be best buddies.

73
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,140
Makes sense.

74
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,659
How did you become best friends?

75
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,409
I may be handsome

76
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:48,820
and attractive now,

77
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:51,180
but when we first met,

78
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,690
I was a chubby boy.

79
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,180
Those kids in my class,

80
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,780
some of them didn't want to talk to me,

81
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,290
some others thought my family was rich

82
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,860
that I could bring snacks for them.

83
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,020
But Chi

84
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,740
was different.

85
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:08,860
Different, how?

86
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:13,540
The two of us jogged for 3,000 metres every day.

87
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,010
It was so exhausting,

88
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:17,860
I can tell you that.

89
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,460
Later, I moved abroad.

90
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,410
Chi would sometimes talk about Mr. Yu.

91
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,220
About Chi,

92
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,060
he doesn't know how to express himself 
through words.

93
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,299
But you can tell whether

94
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,140
he really cares or not

95
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,220
from what he does.

96
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,650
When other kids bullied me,

97
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,740
he was the only one there for me.

98
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:02,780
It's over?

99
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:04,980
Sorry to have kept you wait.

100
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,700
it's fine.

101
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,060
I was worried about you,

102
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,420
that's why I followed.

103
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:22,580
I promise,

104
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,580
I won't cause any trouble.

105
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,300
I promise, I...

106
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:25,620
I promise.

110
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,930
My dad bought this book.

111
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,340
He meant to

112
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,300
give it to you himself.

113
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,260
Now, allow me to give it to you.

114

if you ever need a hand,

117
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,050
just give me a call.

118
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,130
See you.

119
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,100
Your number.

120
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,540
Keep an eye on him for me.

121
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,650
He doesn't say anything,

122
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,300
but he is definitely upset.

123
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,170
If something happens, call me.

124
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,260
Got it.

125
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:45,750
Take care.

126
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,230
What's wrong?

127
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,390
Let's go.

128
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,150
No power?

129
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:34,550
It's okay,

130
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:35,310
let me.

131

Be careful.

133

You can see.

134
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:56,950
I can't.

135
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,620
My bad, I forgot.

136
00:12:59,350 --> 00:12:59,790

00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,190
Take my hand.

Follow me.

140
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,150
I used to live in this room when I was a child.

141
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,070
These are my favourite toys.

142
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,150
That's my grandpa,

00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,030
and that's my dad.

144
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,190
Okay.

145
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,550
You can spend the night here.

146
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,220
The bed is clean.

147
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,310
Just wait for the electricity.

148
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,390
You alright?

149
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,380
I'm fine.

150
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:12,790
Chi Yan?

151
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,260
What's wrong?

152
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,630
These are obsolete,

153
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:22,750
no need to keep them around.

154
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:26,390
Chi Yan!

155
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:30,870
Chi Yan!

156
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:45,550
Wait here.

157
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,830
I want to show you something.

158
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,390
Wine.

159
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,870
This one is a grapevine.

160
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:20,870
My grandpa loved wine.

161
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,070
So, he planted grapevines in the garden.

162
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,380
Each summer,

163
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,390
I would pick grapes with him

164
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,630
and make wine ourselves.

165
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,230
Once, an old vine died

166
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,030
and grandpa bought a new one.

167
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,710
I remember him joking about

168
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,830
no longer being able to drink this.

169
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,390
Who knows...

170
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,030
Tell me about your grandpa.

171
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:07,859
He

172
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:10,869
was just a normal person.

173
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,310
He was diligent

174
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:15,150
and honest.

175
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,869
He liked to drink a little

176
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,150
and was always telling anecdotes about his
military life.

177
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,030
He told those stories again and again

178
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:25,670
but somehow,

179
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,030
we didn't get bored.

180
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,110
In the end, I got bored,

181
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,700
I was like, why is he always telling me these things?

182
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,390
I didn't realise it until later.

183
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,510
He didn't mean to repeat those stories.

184
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,190
His memory got worse

185
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,790
and he couldn't remember.

186
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,660
For him, time got slower and slower

187
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:54,870
and now, it has stopped.

188
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,710
Chi Yan, you know,

189
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,870
I also have someone important to me.

190
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,790
Her time also stopped.

191
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,220
From a human's perspective,

192
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,030
she stopped

193
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,230
at 28.

194
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,510
I'm talking about my sister.

195
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,270
She was really nice to me.

196
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,550
She loved me so much.

197
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,310
She always thought about me when she had
delicious food to eat

198
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,870
and toys to play with.

199
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,190
I thought, as long as my sister's around,

200
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,310
I can always be

201
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,390
a happy cat.

202
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:39,860
For me,

203
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,150
she is the best gift from my parents.

204
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,270
But an accident happened

205
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,390
and took her life.

206
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:48,910
My parents

207
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,390
acted as if

208
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,550
nothing ever happened.

209
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,380
It's like, as long as we don't talk about her,

210
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,670
or think about her,

211
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,230
we can just forget about her,

212
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,870
like she never existed.

213
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:02,860
You know,

214
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,790
I really miss her.

215
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,820
But I have to hide my emotions,

216
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,630
I don't want my parents

217
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,390
to see something in my eyes.

218
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:20,990
You are right.

219
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,310
I mean it.

220
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,710
So, you are much braver than me,

221
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,230
and much happier.

222
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:30,870
It's true.

223
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,100
People always say

224
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,030
that death can have a huge impact on someone.

225
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:41,820
It's like a gigantic shadow

226
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,310
that follows you for the rest of your life.

227
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,340
But that's not true.

228
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,710
Those daily,

229
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,150
tiny, and mundane details

230
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,380
are the most terrifying.

231
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,750
They will always

232
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,540
make you sad and regret what you've done.

233
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,230
The holiday fireworks,

234
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,260
a song you know,

235
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,020
the food from a street vendor,

236
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,390
the scent of the air after the rain,

237
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,230
a casual, random comment

238
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,030
from your loved one.

239
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,110
You never know which moment

240
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,140
will hit you.

241
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:18,990
The only thing you know

242
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,860
is that there is now an empty corner in your heart.

243
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,390
That corner

244
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,870
can never be replaced.

245
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,310
People used to say this to me all the time.

246
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:33,510
Chi Yan,

247
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,910
everything shall pass.

248
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,630
Eventually, you will forget about it.

249
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,030
Why should I forget?

250
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,950
Why should I forget my loved ones?

251
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,990
They're truly gone

252
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,510
when I forget about them.

253
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:20,830
Hugh,

254
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,950
I make a wish to you.

255
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,030
My grandpa,

256
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,070
my dad,

257
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,380
and Mr. Yu,

258
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,830
can you bring them all back?

259
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,830
Sorry,

260
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,230
we

261
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,740
can bring wealth, power,

262
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,270
or a healthy body.

263
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,550
But life...

264
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:02,310
I'm sorry.

265
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:03,470
It's okay.

266
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,430
It's okay.

267
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,260
I'm sorry.

268
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:44,260
Master,

269
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,140
I'd like to know,

270
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,310
how can I maintain a human form forever?

271
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,950
Without a cat seal,

272
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,420
you'll need medicine.

273
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:54,550
Although the medicine can help you maintain
a human form,

274
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,510
it will cost your sense of smell.

275
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,030
You will no longer be able to sense other cats,

276
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,190
and you will lose your unique scent

277
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,670
as a cat.

278
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,310
Think it through.

279
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,750
More importantly,

280
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,230
taking the medicine will greatly reduce

281
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:16,940
your life as a cat.

282
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,140
That thing you mentioned,

283
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,270
I've asked around.

284
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:07,340
That cat

285
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,990
did die on that campus.

286
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:10,750
Many kids

287
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,740
were talking about it.

288
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,230
It was a mess.

289
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:26,470
Here.

290
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,430
I heard

291
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,150
some similar incidents happened there.

292
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,830
That's all I know.

293
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:36,990
I went through a lot

294
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,820
to get this photo.

295
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,390
One of them is the murderer.

296
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,270
Which one?

297
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,620
There are so many students.

298
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,310
There are just kids, I have to ask them one by one.

299
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,310
Besides, it's been so long,

300
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:52,150
maybe they've forgotten about it.

301
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,510
The first one on the left of the second row.

302
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,990
I heard he switched to another school

303
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,070
after the incident.

304
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,750
Are all those who died

305
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,470
buried beneath the ground?

306
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,750
The body of the dead will be cremated.

307
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,630
The ashes will be stored in an urn.

308
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,340
The urn will be buried.

309
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:54,930
[Chi Renyuan. Beloved Grandfather]

310
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,980
People bring flowers

311
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,270
to memorise the dead.

312
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,230
We do the opposite.

313
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,190
On our planet,

314
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,630
when a cat dies,

315
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,630
its body becomes lighter

316
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:07,230
and a golden aura appears around it.

317
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,990
The body just floats to the sky.

318
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,830
Little by little,

319
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,270
we can no longer see its body.

320
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,470
We can only see the aura.

321
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,430
Eventually,

322
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,590
it becomes a star.

323
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,190
The Meow Planet.

324
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,150
Sometimes, people

325
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:29,710
spread the ashes into the ocean.

326
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,470
A writer once wrote

327
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,350
that death is like water disappears in the water.

328
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,150
Compared to the Meow Planet,

329
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,350
humans are more abstract.

330
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,350
Need a ride?

331
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:01,270
Why are you here?

332
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:03,870
You...

333
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,830
Get in, I'll give you a ride.

334
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:07,350
No, thanks.

335
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,260
I'll just keep waiting.

336
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:15,870
Listen to me,

337
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:17,190
it's impossible to get a cab here.

338
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,190
Let me give you a ride.

339
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:25,150
Time?

340
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,670
Could you please take me to Taihao Hotel?

341
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:33,150
Sure.

342
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:37,030
Taihao Hotel, right?

343
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,750
I can't even be a gentleman?

344
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:47,100
Stop watching those idol dramas.

345
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,350
Is your friend getting married today?

346
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:50,990
Yes, and I'm the bridesmaid.

347
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:51,790
Hurry up.

348
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:52,550
Okay.

349
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,630
Twenty minutes, promise.

350
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,790
Watch the speed limit, slow down.

351
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,830
I won't drive too fast with you in the car.

352
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,260
Turn at the next crossing.

353
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:06,550
Hold on.

354
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,340
You think that's cool?

355
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:21,750
I do want to arrive in time.

356
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,590
But I also want you to drive carefully.

357
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:25,710
Your driver's license

358
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:27,430
will be detained someday.

359
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,350
I've been driving carefully

360
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,510
for years.

361
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,310
You can question my characters,

362
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,740
but you can't question my driving skills.

363
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:35,510
My characters

364
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,430
are fine.

365
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,190
What brought you here?

366
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:40,950
This is my hometown.

367
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,470
Also,

368
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,470
Chi Yan's Chinese teacher from high school passed.

369
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:48,910
Mr. Yu Shan?

370
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:51,510
Chi Yan loved him

371
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:52,990
back in high school.

372
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:55,540
He's very upset, isn't he?

373
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,390
There's nothing you can do about death.

374
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:00,110
I'm worried about Chi Yan.

375
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:02,700
Why aren't you with him?

376
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,430
Where is he?

377
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:04,870
He went to the graveyard.

378
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:07,100
Xiao xiu should be with him.

379
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:10,350
xiao xiu's here?

380
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,780
Are we almost there?

381
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,950
This place has changed a lot.

382
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,550
My high school.

383
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,660
Why are you still standing here?

384
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:30,860
Let's go take a look.

385
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:32,990
Come on.

386
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,510
What are you doing here?

387
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,580
We'd like to visit the school.

388
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,390
The school is closed during the holidays.

389
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,340
You can't go inside.

390
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,790
We just want to...

391
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:41,860
No can do.

392
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,300
We'll just take a quick look.

393
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:44,300
Just leave.

394
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:45,470
Okay, okay.

395
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:45,940
But we...

396
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,070
Let's go, come on.

397
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:00,790
This...

398
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,390
What?

399
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:03,070
We can climb over.

400
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,110
It's too dangerous.

401
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,230
We're already here.

402
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,230
Also, I want to take a look at your high school.

403
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:11,230
So, who goes first?

404
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,230
You or me?

405
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:14,220
Then I'll go first.

406
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,390
I'll go first.

407
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:20,750
You go first.

408
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:31,500
Be careful.

409
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:34,580
Steady.

410
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,350
I'll give you a hand.

411
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:54,820
What's that?

412
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:57,710
That one.

413
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:58,780
That's the teaching building.

414
00:30:59,220 --> 00:30:59,990
What about that one?

415
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:00,870
The cafeteria.

416
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,230
The cafeteria?

417
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,550
What's that pointy little tower?

418
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,430
That's the library.

419
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,230
Library.

420
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:16,750
What's wrong?

421
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:20,430
Eat, eat.

422
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:22,870
Hurry, eat.

423
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:23,980
It's enjoying the food.

424
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:33,110
It looks so happy.

425
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,390
So cute.

426
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,790
Its eyes are so beautiful.

427
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:36,310
Right.

428
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:36,790
They're green.

429
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:41,550
Why does it stop eating?

430
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,790
Come on, eat, hurry.

431
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,110
Hello?

432
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:48,190
You can't feed cats salty food.

433
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:51,870
Eat, hurry, don't mind him.

434
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:52,590
Come on, eat.

435
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,100
Who are you?

436
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:03,710
Who is he?

437
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:04,700
Weirdo.

438
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,230
Don't eat salty food anymore,

439
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:15,190
you hear me?

440
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:30,870
Nothing.

441
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,860
When I was a student here,

442
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,310
I used to come here and feed the cats.

443
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,350
I once met a cat

444
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,350
that looked a lot like you.

445
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,870
Is it

446
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,270
as beautiful as me?

447
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:55,950
It was just like you,

448
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,620
white.

449
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,700
But it was less fortunate.

450
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:05,870
What happened?

451
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,510
It's gone.

452
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:21,510
Why are you here?

453
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:23,060
How dare you come here?

454
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,380
Get lost, you!

455
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:25,310
Get lost!

456
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:26,630
I won't allow you to see that cat!

457
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:26,990
Get lost!

458
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:27,870
Go away, get lost!

459
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,100
Piss off!

460
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,860
How could you do this?

461
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,190
Get lost!

462
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,620
You're a monster!

463
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:33,940
You killed the cat!

464
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:34,750
Just leave!

465
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:35,910
Stop staring!

466
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,110
Get lost!

467
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,190
Get lost!

468
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:48,700
It's him!

469
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,190
Loser!

470
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,070
So cruel.

471
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,190
Psycho!

472
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:51,710
He did it.

473
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:52,630
Get out!

474
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:54,830
Get out of here!

475
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:56,430
Go away!

476
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:57,350
That's him, he did it.

477
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:51,949
What happened next?

478
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:53,110
Did you find the murderer?

479
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:59,150
Why didn't you say something?

480
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,950
Why did you let them talk to you like that?

481
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:06,150
It's not that simple.

482
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:08,470
People would only believe

483
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:09,900
what they want to believe.

484
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,950
A high school student who doesn't get along well
with others

485
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:16,390
and likes to write weird novels that nobody understands.

486
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,260
A boy from a sad family,

487
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,070
a lone wolf

488
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:22,660
who enjoys abusing animals.

489
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:27,110
It just sounds like the kind of gossip

490
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:28,550
that people keep talking about.

491
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:33,070
So, you just let them frame you like that?

492
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,540
Even if I could prove my innocence, so what?

493
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:38,150
They didn't care about the truth,

494
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:39,940
they only wanted to form sides.

495
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:41,990
Even after Mr. Yu

496
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:43,460
held a class meeting

497
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,390
and told them the truth,

498
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,030
things didn't get any better.

499
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:50,830
My grandpa suggested switching to another school.

500
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,110
I didn't say no.

501
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,900
I will keep writing,

502
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,910
but I'll never make my books public.

503
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,270
But this is not your fault.

504
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,310
You can't just

505
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,830
punish yourself.

506
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:10,860
This is no punishment.

507
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,670
When I cut out any

508
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,230
unnecessary connection with the outside world,

509
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:18,190
I find myself more relaxed,

510
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:19,870
and happier.

511
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,740
I don't need to mind what others think of me.

512
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,940
I don't need to compromise

513
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:27,790
and do what others what me to do.

514
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:32,910
Don't you feel lonely?

515
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,140
A little bit.

516
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,310
But that's how life works,

517
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:44,310
isn't it?

518
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,870
I can't fully understand.

519
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:54,390
But I believe in you.

520
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,150
You definitely are a nice guy.

521
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,630
Remember,

522
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:04,900
not everyone can be

523
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,540
someone special to a cat.

524
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,790
First, you need to

525
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:11,350
be willing to help others.

526
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:12,820
Also, you never try to do anything bad

527
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,030
with that wish you have.

528
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,070
Thank you.

529
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:31,420
Let's go.

530
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:37,950
Wait.

531
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:39,780
Wait here.

532
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,350
Please allow me to borrow one.

533
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:48,390
Thank you.

534
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:56,550
Thank you

535
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:57,670
for keeping him accompanied.

536
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:00,110
Remember to be happy

537
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,630
as a star.

538
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,350
See you.

539
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:07,390
Also, I'm Xiao Xiu

540
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:08,620
Bye.

541
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:12,750
Come on.

542
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:27,310
Hurry up.

543
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,420
Let's grab something to eat.

544
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,150
Faster.

545
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:32,030
What's wrong?

546
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:32,710
Hello?

547
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:34,580
Where are you guys?

548
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,590
We just visited the school

549
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:37,590
and are on our way out.

550
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:38,830
Did you eat?

551
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,030
Want to join me?

552
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:41,710
Right,

553
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,590
I ran into Qin Mingming today.

554
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,260
I gave her a ride.

555
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,310
I think things went well

556
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:49,100
between the two of us today.

557
00:38:58,990 --> 00:38:59,590
Xu Zihao.

558
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,150
Chi Yan!

559
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:10,270
Duck!

560
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:11,910
Duck!

561
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:49,630
Mister,

562
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,350
stop here.

563
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,870
We haven't arrived yet.

564
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:53,550
It's fine.

565
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:54,430
I'll just get down here.

566
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:02,500
It's so big.

567
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,260
You look so funny!

568
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:12,190
It was a lake last time,

569
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,830
and now bees?

570
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:15,750
I wonder

571
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,070
what comes next.

572
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:20,310
The more surprises, the merrier.

573
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,350
What are you doing here?

574
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:25,390
How did you get inside?

575
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,310
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

576
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:26,940
Get out of here!

577
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:27,430
On our way!

578
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:27,790
Sir, look,

579
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:28,700
that way, look!

580
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,390
Look!

581
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:40,870
Slow down, take it easy.

582
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:41,430
Come on.

583
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:43,950
Forget it.

584
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:44,950
Let's go, come on.

585
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,340
You can't walk fast in those.

586
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,070
Let me give you a ride.

587
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:07,950
I'm fine.

588
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:09,740
I can

589
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:10,550
take you to him.

590
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:11,150
Don't bother.

591
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:12,110
I'm going home.

592
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:15,830
You won't be able to get a cab now.

593
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,150
You'd rather walk home in those heels

594
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,070
than let me give you a ride.

595
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:25,310
I don't know what I have to do

596
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:26,580
to make you resent me less.

597
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:29,660
You would probably say

598
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:32,550
just get away from me.

599
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:34,750
I hope that's something I can do

600
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:37,070
but seeing you

601
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,430
makes me happy.

602
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:45,310
I'm sorry.

603
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,870
I didn't mean to hurt you.

604
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:51,590
Just leave me alone.

605
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,300
I'm scared of thunders.

606
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,060
I need to sleep with you.

607
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:48,590
You can't sleep here.

608
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:50,030
Go back to your room.

609
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:51,670
No,

610
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:54,180
I'm staying no matter what!

611
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:04,430
Then you can sleep here.

612
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:06,380
Don't kick.

613
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:22,900
It's okay, it's okay.

614
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:45,950
It's okay, don't be scared.
