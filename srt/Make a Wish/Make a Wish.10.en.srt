00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,540
She, on the contrary,

176
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,220
can easily blow her cover.

177
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,060
It doesn't surprise me at all

178
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:16,860
to hear she got hurt.

179
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,460
Xiao Xiu got hurt because of me.

180
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:19,740
Right.

181
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,820
I've already mastered

182
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,900
the human lifestyle.

183
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,580
If it weren't to save him, I...

184
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,500
I wouldn't have...

185
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,470
Fine.

186
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,140
Take the fish back

187
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:31,620
as supplement.

188
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,390
Thank you so much!

189
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,020
Did you buy them from the seafood market?

190
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,620
They are free.

191
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:40,460
I went offshore fishing.

192
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,290
Fishing?

193
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,620
Fishing

194
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,780
is one way for humans to catch fish.

195
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,140
I used to

196
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,940
go fishing with your grandpa.

197
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,740
He was good at it.

198
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:57,060
Almost as good as me.

199
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:58,960
Let's go

200
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,430
fishing with Uncle Fu.

201
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,460
What do you say, chap?

202
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,220
Wanna have some fun with us?

203
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,480
Are you in?

204
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,300
Of course.

205
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,100
I'm in.

206
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,340
Look.

207
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,330
Such good fish.

208
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,380
Look.

209
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,620
There are a lot of halibuts in the area.

210
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,260
They're swimming back now.

211
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,300
After casting,

212
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,300
reel in fast when you feel something taking the bait.

213
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:26,970
Xiao Xiu.

214
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,100
I'll help you if it's too heavy.

215
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,100
Okay?

216
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,140
Yes.

217
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,340
Alright.

218
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,860
I'll see who's the more talented

219
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,330
rookie today.

220
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,460
Let's go!

221
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,190
Watch how I destroy you without breaking a sweat.

222
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,500
Did I catch one?

223
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,460
It's moving!

224
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,580
Reel it in!

225
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,140
Reel it in!

226
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:51,580
How?

227
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:52,730
Hey!

228
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:53,860
Come on.

229
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:54,580
I...

230
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:58,740
Why are you laughing?

231
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,140
I'm just getting started.

232
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,170
Again!

233
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,060
It's so big.

234
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,650
Come on! Are you serious?

235
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,050
It's not fair.

236
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,370
You're not so much cat-friendly

237
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,310
as fish-friendly.

238
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,350
Be patient.

239
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,140
Well.

240
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,020
Is he using better baits than mine?

241
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:29,940
It's so big.

242
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,300
It's...

243
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,500
It's not fair.

244
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,240
Here comes a big one!

245
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,020
Uncle Fu, it's a big one, right?

246
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,300
God.

247
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:53,940
Uncle Fu.

248
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,500
I'm...I can't...

249
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,180
Your leg!

250
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:00,980
What about it?

251
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,220
How come it healed suddenly?

252
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,890
It's a miracle.

253
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,290
Actually, I have been...

254
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,500
I knew it all along.

255
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,730
Why haven't you said anything

256
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,020
and let me order you around?

257
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,340
You did save me,

258
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,300
the damsel in distress...

259
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,570
You are admirable.

260
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:43,820
Besides...

261
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,290
Never mind.

262
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:49,300
So?

263
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,420
Offshore fishing is nice, right?

264
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,160
I learned a lot.

265
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,170
You are just like your grandpa.

266
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,130
You have the personality of a cat.

267
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:02,300
So, we get along quite well.

268
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,420
We can make a big dinner tonight!

269
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,780
We've got so many fish.

270
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,210
I dropped the ball this time

271
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,970
and hurt someone else.

272
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:21,980
I think he'll be more alert from now on.

273
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:23,890
Our next attempt

274
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,690
will be trickier.

275
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:29,050
You dropped the ball

276
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:30,850
'cause you're a dumbass.

277
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,130
You went all out

278
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,540
and yet didn't hurt him even a little.

279
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:38,380
If you ask me,

280
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:41,370
you might as well try something simpler

281
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,220
but efficient.

282
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:12,890
Where did you get this?

283
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,690
It's illegal in the Meow Planet.

284
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,050
If everything can be bought legally,

285
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,170
what will I make money off of?

286
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,410
Get me a large amount of it,

287
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:24,570
money is not a problem.

288
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:25,700
The more money you have,

289
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,090
the more I can provide.

290
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:44,650
Boss.

291
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:46,890
What do you want?

292
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,020
Your new book is selling

293
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,370
way better than expected.

294
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,210
The publisher called me.

295
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,610
They want you

296
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,570
to seize the opportunity

297
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,380
and host a book launch party.

298
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:03,570
These are the potential venues

299
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:04,370
I had in mind.

300
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:05,090
Take a look.

301
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,050
How are the three venues different？

302
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:18,930
Well...

303
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,530
I don't know which one to choose.

304
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:21,050
So,

305
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:22,690
I want to ask you.

306
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,210
If I need to decide everything,

307
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,220
what do I hire you for?

308
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,100
Yes.

309
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:26,810
Okay.

310
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,180
I will go find a better one.

311
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:31,530
Wait.

312
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,890
You said the sales are good.

313
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,790
How good is it compared to the last two?

314
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,930
According to current statistics,

315
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,330
it'll sell better

316
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:41,210
than the last two.

317
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:42,850
Okay.

318
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:43,770
Don't worry about the venue.

319
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,890
I just thought of a perfect place.

320
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:48,250
Where?

321
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:28,650
Hello?

322
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:29,890
Chi Yan.

323
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,690
The draft of Summer Sweetheart is not good.

324
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,370
Besides, you're way behind the schedule.

325
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,770
I was told that

326
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,130
if you miss the deadline again,

327
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,410
they'll cut your pay in half.

328
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,050
Hao Qingsong.

329
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,840
This is the most challenging thing I've written,

330
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,440
you know?

331
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:45,090
Besides,

332
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,290
you haven't paid me for my previous works.

333
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,160
Just be grateful they still haven't canceled it.

334
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:51,570
The other writers

335
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,090
can deliver over 10 thousand words per day.

336
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,010
10 thousand...

337
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,970
Are those words even readable?

338
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,370
The lovey-dovey stuff is a no-brainer.

339
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,690
Why are you so slow?

340
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,480
I...

341
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,210
I can write.

342
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:06,490
But it takes time for me to deliver quality stuff.

343
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:09,930
Whatever.

344
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,570
You need to write faster

345
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,890
and remember to write more of the lovey-dovey stuff.

346
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:31,200
Hello?

347
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:32,490
Chi Yan.

348
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,130
Here's the thing.

349
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:34,720
I feel bad that I have to

350
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,930
call you,

351
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,330
but can you pay the past-due rent?

352
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,880
I need the money.

353
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,280
I'll pay the rent in a day or two.

354
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:46,930
Okay.

355
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:47,600
Thank you.

356
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,800
Hurry up.

357
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:05,760
Cash, right?

358
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,730
35 yuan.

359
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:11,580
The price has gone up.

360
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,290
Since when?

361
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:14,930
Since just now.

362
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,050
There are fewer good books

363
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,330
'cause you refuse to publish them.

364
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,280
Naturally, the price will go up.

365
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:20,930
It's 135 yuan now.

366
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:23,890
Fine.

367
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:26,410
I know it's harder to keep business afloat these days.

368
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:27,410
Oh, right.

369
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,010
A writer that we partner with

370
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,080
wants to host

371
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,690
a small book launch party here.

372
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:32,970
What do you think?

373
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,880
We don't do commercial events here.

374
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,290
We'll pay for the rent.

375
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,840
Just give me a number.

376
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,120
Which writer?

377
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,410
It's confidential.

378
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,450
It's just that we think the ambiance here

379
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,810
matches that in the novel.

380
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:56,730
We'll work on the publicity of the event,

381
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:57,920
which will bring

382
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,240
more customers to your bookstore.

383
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,320
It's a win-win.

384
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,490
Then let me be upfront.

385
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,640
I only provide the venue.

386
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,160
I don't cater

387
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,010
or wait on the guests.

388
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,360
We'll take care of all that.

389
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:19,850
Don't you worry!

390
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:22,760
Bye.

391
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,110
Is your leg fully recovered?

392
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,440
You can take a break if you feel tired.

393
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,130
My leg is fine.

394
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,370
It's my back that's hurting now.

395
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,610
Your back?

396
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:39,890
What's wrong with it?

397
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,890
I was moving all the bookshelves

398
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:44,000
in the bookstore today.

399
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:45,490
I also cleaned the place.

400
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,250
Between you and me,

401
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,400
a writer is throwing a book launch party there.

402
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,600
It's gonna be big.

403
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:53,040
Who is it?

404
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,650
No idea.

405
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:55,560
Quite a mystery.

406
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:57,930
But at least we're getting paid.

407
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:00,280
It'd be great if Chi Yan can have

408
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,580
a book launch party one day.

409
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:05,240
Does he write?

410
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,560
He's a great writer.

411
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,080
But he used to keep it a secret

412
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,200
'cause he doesn't want to get famous.

413
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,320
I've read his works.

414
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,400
Absolutely amazing.

415
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,690
You don't have to be good to be famous.

416
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,210
It doesn't really matter if he's a good writer.

417
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,410
It's all about marketing.

418
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:22,690
You are so cynical.

419
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,920
When is the party?

420
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:28,890
This weekend.

421
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,730
What else do you provide

422
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:33,490
other than the venue?

423
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:34,960
That's it.

424
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,400
The organizer will

425
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,400
take care of the rest.

426
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:55,930
What's so important

427
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,080
that you need to wait till we're closed?

428
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,160
Here's the thing.

429
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,970
I want to show you a business proposal, ma'am.

430
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,410
How many times have I told you

431
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,050
not to call me ma'am?

432
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:07,760
That makes me sound old.

433
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,890
Call me Xiao Yu.

434
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,680
Chi's Bookstore?

435
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,050
Isn't it the bookstore nearby?

436
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,760
A small store

437
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:30,370
with few customers...

438
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,040
Aren't we gonna lose money

439
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:34,920
if we do this?

440
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,290
That's what I had thought.

441
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,880
But then, a friend tipped me off.

442
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,570
The host of the book launch

443
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,480
is an internet influencer.

444
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,680
He's got many fans.

445
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,800
If we can cater the party,

446
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,050
we can take advantage of his popularity

447
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,810
to promote our pub.

448
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,160
Now that you put it that way,

449
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,120
it kinda makes sense.

450
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,080
Great.

451
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,810
I'll make some calls.

452
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,600
There's no hurry.

453
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,760
This proposal is too simple.

454
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,120
There are a lot of details

455
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,490
we need to discuss.

456
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:17,890
Come.

457
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:20,280
Sit with me.

458
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,440
Let's have a nice chat.

459
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,240
Okay.

460
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,440
Careful.

461
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:34,920
We...

462
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,650
What are you doing here?

463
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,320
Launching my new book.

464
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,880
I have to since it is selling so well.

465
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:51,480
My fans have been urging me to meet them.

466
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,280
Hold on.

467
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,720
The mysterious writer...

468
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:56,480
Did you do this on purpose?

469
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,490
Your bookstore is small and shabby.

470
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,270
This is free publicity.

471
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,370
Shouldn't you thank me for it?

472
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:04,010
You must've forgotten what happened last time.

473
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,240
Do you need me to remind you?

474
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:07,800
I'm warning you.

475
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,440
I paid for the venue

476
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,520
and the services today.

477
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,160
You need to behave your best.

478
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,080
Zhang Yi!

479
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,200
We're big fans.

480
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,330
Can I get an autograph?

481
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,360
I am your fan.

482
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,000
Can I get an autograph, Zhang Yi?

483
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,970
Take it easy, guys.

484
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:21,680
There's no hurry.

485
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,370
There's time for you to get your books signed.

486
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,840
Gross.

487
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,720
What's that saying again?

488
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,800
His attitude turns on what?

489
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,120
On a sixpence.

490
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,320
Yeah, that's right.

491
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,680
Here's another saying.

492
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:37,000
Revenge is a dish best served cold.

493
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:37,960
Cold?

494
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,400
Not a chance.

495
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,560
I can't wait for it to get cold.

496
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,040
I...

497
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,000
I want to...

498
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,080
Just get to work.

499
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,400
What did you feel

500
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,160
after reading the book?

501
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,000
Hello.

502
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,210
Do you know the writer well?

503
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:53,440
Yes.

504
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,920
I've been a fan for years.

505
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,840
So, you must've been looking forward

506
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,370
to the Dark Alley Mob\i0} series, right?

507
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:59,720
Of course.

508
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,520
We've got many loyal fans

509
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,360
here today.

510
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,050
Let's wait for him together.

511
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:08,490
Okay.

512
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,240
The launch party of
 Dark Alley Mob: The Gospel of Killing

513
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,240
will start soon.

514
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,770
Let's welcome Mr. Zhang Yi!

515
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,920
Zhang Yi!

516
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,280
Before we start,

517
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,920
we've arranged an interview session.

518
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,040
Dear journalist friends,

519
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,800
it's your time.

520
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:25,800
Mr. Zhang,

521
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,160
the popular opinion on the internet

522
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,870
is that the quality of your works is going downhill.

523
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:29,660
What do you think?

524
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,560
Sir,

525
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,320
we don't want to hear...

526
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,210
It's not true.

527
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,480
We've responded to it.

528
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,000
It was due to the leak of the first draft.

529
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:41,920
Now that the book is launched,

530
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,800
there's no point dwelling on it.

531
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,280
The villains in the Gospel of Killing

532
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,040
all have distinctive personalities.

533
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,090
May I ask about your process

534
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,640
when creating those characters?

535
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,040
Sorry.

536
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,440
I didn't hear you clearly.

537
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,920
It's about the villains in the book.

538
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,640
What was your process?

539
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,040
Oh, my process.

540
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,920
People always try to figure out

541
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,800
the process of a writer.

542
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,040
But for us writers, it often comes

543
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:22,770
quite naturally.

544
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:23,280
It is...

545
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,410
Perceptual.

546
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,120
A flash of inspiration.

547
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,680
Yeah, inspiration.

548
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,990
Can you tell us

549
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,440
how you get inspired?

550
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,800
Or, how did you discover your talent?

551
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,440
I think

552
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,880
Mr. Zhang might become too close

553
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,640
to the characters he created,

554
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,880
so it's become hard for him to break character.

555
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,320
I am the owner of the bookstore

556
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,040
and a big fan of Mr. Zhang's works.

557
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,760
I know him personally.

558
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,200
So, I think I can answer

559
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,030
this question for him.

560
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,800
The readers of the series

561
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,120
are most drawn to

562
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,480
the villain characters.

563
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,680
These villains

564
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,880
are outlaws

565
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,840
that challenge the boundary of humanity

566
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,040
and morality.

567
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,360
They're crazy people

568
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,520
who want to prove to the world

569
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,200
that everyone can become

570
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,560
a devil like them

571
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,790
as long as

572
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,040
there's a trigger.

573
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,800
They are dangerous and thrilling.

574
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,800
I was drawn to them from the beginning.

575
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,710
I think the same goes for all of you.

576
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,360
Yes, you're right.

577
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,670
This has always been my style.

578
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,920
Readers who know me should get it.

579
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,800
But in the Gospel of Killing...

580
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,960
I think you've all read it.

581
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,200
It doesn't have a villain like the ones I mentioned.

582
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,720
What does he mean?

583
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,160
I don't know.

584
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,200
I think

585
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,070
Mr. Zhang was trying to be more innovative

586
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:57,880
to bring something new for us.

587
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:58,710
Right?

588
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,120
What is he doing?

589
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:00,760
I know!

590
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,480
I think Mr. Zhang

591
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,800
must've mistaken this book

592
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,560
with the one he's writing now.

593
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:11,590
And he got confused.

594
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:12,790
Okay.

595
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,000
Let's move on to the next segment.

596
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,880
The book signing.

597
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,040
Come on.

598
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,070
Please sign it for me.

599
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,120
I want one, too.

600
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:20,960
Thank you.

601
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:22,760
Chi Yan.

602
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,560
Good for you.

603
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,040
I didn't wait till the dish is cold.

604
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,960
Look! I got an autograph of Zhang Yi!

605
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,070
Great! I've got one!

606
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,600
This way, please.

607
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:43,480
Looks so good.

608
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:43,880
Sir.

609
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,440
Looks great.

610
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,520
The project I told you last time

611
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,230
was great.

612
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,360
As long as you're in charge.

613
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,760
I've got one!

614
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,150
Great! Look!

615
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:57,720
Thank you.

616
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,160
Great.

617
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:58,600
Thanks.

618
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,230
Mine!

619
00:28:59,480 --> 00:28:59,920
Okay.

620
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,040
One by one.

621
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,190
One by one.

622
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:11,990
Lager.

623
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,630
Xiao Xiu said you like it

624
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:14,450
and asked me to bring you one.

625
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,320
Thank you.

626
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,320
Look!

627
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,960
Zhang Yi!

628
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,960
I've finally met you!

629
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,200
I am a big fan!

630
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,670
Can I get an autograph?

631
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:11,920
Okay, everyone!

632
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,880
Hold on a sec.

633
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,950
Mr. Zhang is a bit tired.

634
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,120
He'll take a break for now.

635
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:15,590
Okay.

636
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,120
Feel free to have a drink

637
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,760
or some snacks.

638
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,350
Here.

639
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,240
Where's Chi Yan?

640
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:29,350
No idea.

641
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,430
I'm asking you where he is.

642
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,600
Go find him yourself.

643
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,070
You're a waiter. Act like one.

644
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,240
Come on.

645
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,400
It's not my job to help you find him.

646
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,110
Why are you always picking on her?

647
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,480
What was that, Chi Yan?

648
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,280
Answer me!

649
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:53,990
Tell you what.

650
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,510
All these fans came to see me.

651
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,270
My name is on the cover of the book.

652
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,270
I don't care about your petty tricks.

653
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,960
You're nothing.

654
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,590
Zhang Yi.

655
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,280
I didn't

656
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,950
and will never think of you as my rival.

657
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,710
If I want to compete with someone,

658
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,150
he'd have to be on the same level as me.

659
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,670
I would never

660
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,030
bully the weak.

661
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,350
Think before you speak.

662
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,190
I must mean so much to you

663
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,030
that you want to spend all this money

664
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,030
and effort launching your book

665
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,430
at my bookstore.

666
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:28,670
I get it.

667
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,510
But to me,

668
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:34,910
you mean nothing.

669
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,440
Period.

670
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:37,990
Fine.

671
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,600
You've got balls.

672
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,550
Nevertheless, I paid

673
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,720
for the venue and the services,

674
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,270
right?

675
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:46,240
She's a waiter.

676
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,080
Go.

677
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,440
Get me a drink.

678
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,320
Okay.

679
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,670
Why should she get you a drink?

680
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,230
Is she your maid?

681
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,190
Let's go.

682
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:00,840
Chi Yan.

683
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:03,840
You wait!

684
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,350
Mr. Zhang spent two years

685
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,950
writing this book.

686
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,920
The outline alone took him half a year.

687
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,720
Suffice to say, he's put a lot of effort into it.

688
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:19,730
Right.

689
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:20,320
Mr. Zhang.

690
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,710
This is Mr. Li from the writer's association.

691
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,080
Nice to meet you.

692
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:24,750
Congratulations

693
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,630
on the new book.

694
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:26,600
Very inspirational.

695
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,600
We look forward to more of your works.

696
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,310
We look forward to it.

697
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:33,710
Mr. Zhang!

698
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:34,520
What's happening?

699
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:36,990
What's wrong?

700
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:37,550
Something's wrong!

701
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:40,950
Mr. Zhang! What's the matter?

702
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:41,630
Mr. Zhang!

703
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:42,560
Are you alright, Mr. Zhang?

704
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,150
It's...

705
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:44,910
Stop filming.

706
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:45,590
Call 911.

707
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,550
Call an ambulance!

708
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:47,670
Call an ambulance!

709
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,000
Luo!

710
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,870
Get his stomach pumped.

711
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:58,400
Hurry!

712
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,040
What was that?

713
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,510
Nothing.

714
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,590
Don't worry.

715
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:05,630
Zhang Yi is now back at home.

716
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,440
We'll release an official statement.

717
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:07,880
Xiao Xiu!

718
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,430
What happened?

719
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:11,750
I was watching it live

720
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,040
and Zhang Yi just fainted.

721
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:13,990
I don't know.

722
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:14,950
Chi Yan and I were just leaving

723
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,560
and he fainted here all out of the blue.

724
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:17,830
Where is Chi Yan?

725
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:18,880
In the hospital.

726
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,640
Can you take me there?

727
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,350
He asked me to watch the store

728
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,510
but I am too worried.

729
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:22,950
Okay.

730
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:23,790
I'll take you there.

731
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:24,800
-Did you drive?
-Xiao Xiu!

732
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,710
Let's call a cab.

733
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:26,800
What's going on?

734
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,190
Mingming.

735
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:28,030
Why are you here?

736
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:28,950
I was doing an interview nearby

737
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:29,910
and saw it was chaotic on the street.

738
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,350
A writer was launching

739
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,430
his book here

740
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,400
and suddenly fainted.

741
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,510
Foaming at the mouth and all.

742
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:35,710
Foaming at the mouth?

743
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,390
I don't know what happened.

744
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,510
It happened so fast.

745
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,710
Chi Yan is in the hospital.

746
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:40,510
Can you drive me there?

747
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:40,880
Okay.

748
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,550
Let's go.

749
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:42,150
I'll go with you.

750
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,400
Can you watch the store for me?

751
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,350
Chi Yan is worried.

752
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:46,310
I...

753
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,430
-I...
-There are a lot of people here.

754
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,240
Okay.

755
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:49,470
Call me

756
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,150
for updates.

757
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:51,030
Thank you.

758
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:51,910
Lin Mo.

759
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,550
Can you wrap this up?

760
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:54,640
I need to go to the hospital.

761
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,230
Okay, go.

762
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,110
Thank you.

763
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,270
Thank you.

764
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,590
Call me if you need anything.

765
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,470
Okay.

766
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,150
Listen to me.

767
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,389
Go park the car right now.

768
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:14,030
I still don't know what happened to Zhang Yi.

769
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,030
I'll call you.

770
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:15,510
Yes, ma'am.

771
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:30,630
Ma.

772
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,389
How's Zhang Yi?

773
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,120
Nurse,

774
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:36,630
What happened to Zhang Yi?

775
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:38,760
He's still in the operating room.

776
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,389
He's not out yet.

777
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:40,790
The initial diagnosis is food poisoning.

778
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:41,510
We need to pump his stomach.

779
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,949
But we haven't found out what caused it.

780
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,389
Why haven't you found it out already?

781
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,389
What's taking so long?

782
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:47,389
What happened?

783
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:48,320
You know who he is, right?

784
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,070
If anything happens to him,

785
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,389
can you deal with the consequences?

786
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:51,110
This is a hospital.

787
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:51,960
Please calm down.

788
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,989
How can I calm down?

789
00:34:56,989 --> 00:34:57,630
Chi Yan.

790
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:58,750
Zhang Yi

791
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,880
was throwing his party at your bookstore.

792
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,590
Tell me what happened.

793
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:05,470
Well...

794
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:07,990
Mr. Zhang didn't eat anything

795
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:09,240
at the bookstore.

796
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:13,110
He only had the drink that Chi Yan got him.

797
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,070
Chi Yan.

798
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,470
Why did you act on impulse?

799
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,510
If there's anything in your mind, talk to me.

800
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,230
What you did not only hurt him

801
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,000
but will also hurt yourself.

802
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,670
Do you know that?

803
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,270
Who are you?

804
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:25,550
Can you take responsibility

805
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:26,230
if anything happens?

806
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:26,870
Ma'am!

807
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:27,870
What's wrong with you?

808
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:28,710
Calm down.

809
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:29,630
How can I calm down?

810
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,150
You know what?

811
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,110
I think of Zhang Yi as my son, too.

812
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,350
We've developed a solid relationship over the years.

813
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,950
Chi Yan, just tell me.

814
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,080
Did you do it or not?

815
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,960
How could you do something

816
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,940
so cruel to Zhang Yi?

817
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:38,910
How could you!

818
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:39,670
Just admit it.

819
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:41,070
What's wrong with you?

820
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:41,460
You...

821
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,950
Chi Yan didn't even know Zhang Yi was coming.

822
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:46,470
Zhang Yi didn't tell us

823
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:47,670
he was launching his book.

824
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,030
He did it out of spite.

825
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,550
Now you're blaming us.

826
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:52,310
Ma'am, could you be more unreasonable?

827
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:53,310
Me? Unreasonable?

828
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:54,430
Go away.

829
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:56,590
Chi Yan, tell me

830
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,790
what happened.

831
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:59,190
Did you poison him?

832
00:35:59,190 --> 00:35:59,710
Tell me!

833
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,230
Who are you? Go away!

834
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:01,820
Get lost.

835
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,590
I was...

836
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:04,190
I'm asking him. Tell me!

837
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,230
Did you do it?

838
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:06,590
Did you poison him?

839
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,470
You're such a coward.

840
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,150
-You...
-It was me.

841
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,430
I brought him the drink.

842
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,380
You happy?

843
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:13,910
You...

844
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,710
You bastard!

845
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,220
You stupid fool.

846
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,310
You're so stupid!

847
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:21,790
Get out.

848
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,430
Leave!

849
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:24,590
Get out of here.

850
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:26,550
He did it.

851
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,110
It must be him.

852
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:33,110
Mingming.

853
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,030
Let's go.

854
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,550
Let's go.

855
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,510
Come on.

856
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:36,990
Let's go.

857
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:38,390
Stop looking.

858
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,830
Nothing to see here.

859
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,070
Let's just go.

860
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:43,070
Don't stare at him, just go.

861
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,230
You bastard.

862
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,870
Are you stupid?

863
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:46,470
Enough.

864
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,190
Quiet down. We're in the hospital.

865
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:50,950
If you can prove it, report it to the police.

866
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,660
Otherwise, stop acting crazy.

867
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:54,150
It demeans you.

868
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:58,150
Doctor.

869
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,470
Stop yelling. What's that all about?

870
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:00,790
Doctor.

871
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,310
What happened to my Zhang Yi?

872
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:05,550
Thanks to his friends

873
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,550
who sent here in time,

874
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:08,390
he's out of danger now.

875
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,830
The initial diagnosis is food poisoning.

876
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,550
But we need to do further examinations

877
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,790
to find out more.

878
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:16,510
You need to

879
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,950
go through the process

880
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,550
for him to be hospitalized.

881
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:20,940
Thank you, Doc.

882
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,580
Zhang Yi!

883
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,950
Forgive me for not seeing you out.

884
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,630
I'll update you

885
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:50,470
on the patient.

886
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:52,550
Sorry, Luo,

887
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,030
for causing you inconvenience all the time.

888
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:55,910
It's okay.

889
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:56,910
It's my job.

890
00:37:59,070 --> 00:37:59,750
Then we'll...

891
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,550
Chi Yan.

892
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:07,630
Don't take what happened today to heart.

893
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,950
I've trusted your integrity

894
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:11,510
and I will always do.

895
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,740
Your name will be cleared for sure.

896
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:20,580
See you.

897
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:21,630
Bye.

898
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:41,870
What's wrong?

899
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:45,070
Chi Yan.

900
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:47,630
Sorry.

901
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:52,500
It's...Have a seat.

902
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:54,310
I was just...

903
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,300
What happened in the hospital

904
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,150
brought me back to high school.

905
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:03,260
Back then, you were wronged

906
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,700
and no one stuck up to you.

907
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:08,950
I am sorry.

908
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:11,790
For what happened in the hospital?

909
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:16,140
You shouldn't be the one to apologize.

910
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,780
Back then, I behaved

911
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,540
like a coward.

912
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:21,830
I was too timid to defend you.

913
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,550
I know that

914
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:25,820
it's too late to say this to you.

915
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,230
What's done cannot be undone.

916
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,030
But I still think I should...

917
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,030
What's gotten into you today?

918
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:38,060
You know what?

919
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,390
I went to Mr. Yu's funeral that day

920
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,740
and ran into our classmates.

921
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,660
They were standing far away.

922
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,630
They greeted me with a smile

923
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,420
and came to chat with me

924
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,380
as if nothing had happened back in high school.

925
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:03,630
See?

926
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,470
Those who've truly hurt me

927
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:08,670
have willingly forgotten about it.

928
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,870
So, you should give yourself a break.

929
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,300
It seems that we did nothing wrong as bystanders.

930
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:18,710
But in fact,

931
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:21,230
we became accomplices the moment

932
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,260
we chose to keep quiet.

933
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:26,780
You know what?

934
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:28,630
It used to baffle me a lot.

935
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,230
I had nothing against those people.

936
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,310
I was always by myself.

937
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:38,710
From time to time, I'd feed the cats.

938
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,540
Why did they want to hurt me all the time?

939
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,910
They didn't even care about the truth.

940
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,310
I couldn't wrap my mind around it.

941
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,340
But I've grown up

942
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,590
and I've started to get it.

943
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,860
Back then, I was an outcast

944
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,260
to them.

945
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,900
The most effective way

946
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,340
for people to fit in is to bully the outcast.

947
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:04,540
Why didn't you

948
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,150
tell the teachers about it?

949
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,670
It was pointless.

950
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,260
The grown-ups would think

951
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,750
it was just kids messing around

952
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,310
and it'd pass in a couple days.

953
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:24,100
What are you doing?

954
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,660
I used to be selfish.

955
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:41,670
I thought if I didn't

956
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:43,780
ask anyone for help,

957
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,430
they wouldn't bother me, either.

958
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,420
I could do everything on my own

959
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:50,060
and live my life in solitude.

960
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,500
I thought maybe one day,

961
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,620
things would get better.

962
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,340
Chi Yan,

963
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,390
What Dr. Luo said to you today

964
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,580
is what I want to tell you.

965
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,470
I have always trusted you

966
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:02,710
and I will always do.

967
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:05,020
I couldn't defend you before.

968
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,260
I wasn't capable.

969
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,990
But I've tried my best to be a better person

970
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:09,340
ever since that incident.

971
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,830
I've become more courageous.

972
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:12,470
So, from now on,

973
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:14,380
I believe I am able to

974
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,460
prove your innocence.

975
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:19,950
Thank you.

976
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:22,950
I didn't get it back then.

977
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,100
But now I do.

978
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:28,340
Being able to ask for help

979
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,500
and rely on others

980
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,420
is in itself an act of courage.

981
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:38,740
So, Qin Mingming,

982
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:42,950
I hope you can help me.

983
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,540
Help me to find out the truth.

984
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:57,780
I'll help you, too.

985
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:09,500
[Chi's Bookstore]

986
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:34,940
Go upstairs.

987
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:36,060
I'll come back later.
