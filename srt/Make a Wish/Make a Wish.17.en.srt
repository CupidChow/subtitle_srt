4
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,940
One of you makes a wish,

5
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:46,700
and the other one grants it.

6
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,980
That's it, so simple.

7
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:48,650
Fine.

8
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,090
it's better for both of you.

9
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,660
When I don't care.

10
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,010
There,

11
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,530
a bunch of kids ride home from the market.

12
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,060
Every one of them is wearing a smile.

13
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,610
Some of them

14
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,740
are in their adolescence.

15
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,420
But on this road filled with azaleas,

16
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,770
they all find

17
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,460
their long-lost simplicity.

18
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:13,700
This afternoon,

19
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,170
they take a round trip in a boat.

20
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,420
That tiny,

21
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,060
tiny engine keeps making noises.

22
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,820
In Southern France,

23
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,740
sunshine is poured all over the roof.

24
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:28,700
The kids...

25
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,530
That tiny engine keeps making noises.

26
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,220
Some lie down at the front of the boat.

27
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,250
I heard that your grandpa

28
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,540
left you this bookstore.

29
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,500
Why don't you make a wish

30
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,420
to keep the store safe and sound?

31
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,180
Please don't do that!

32
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:46,940
It's dangerous!

33
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,140
Make a wish

34
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,380
or I will burn it to the ground!

35
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,930
I don't want anything!

36
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:51,660
Stop it!

37
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,340
Just make a wish!

38
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,100
Hurry!

39
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:58,940

40

No, no, no.

42
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,210
Stop there.

43
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:08,650
I...

44
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,410
Just make a wish,

45
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,140
or I will drop it.

46
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,130
Or, I could just eat them.

47

What are you doing?

54
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,780
I am really getting upset

55
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,260
Going out?

56
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,180
I have a job now.

57
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,410
A job.

58
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,100
It means working.

59
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,370
Why bother?

60
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:11,420
I can provide.

61
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,330
In this world,

62
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,420
you need money.

63

I've heard of it.

Don't drink it, or your ears would pop!

179
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,500
I was just trying to scare him.

180
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,700
I wasn't going to push him down anyway.

181
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,900
Is that what this is?

182
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,610
Do you think I would go with you

183
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,140
if he'd fallen from here?

184
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,860
What are you trying to say?

185
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,300
Is it worth it, for a human?

186
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,140
Do you have any idea how terrifying they are?

187
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,060
I've already told you,

188
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:24,980
I know there are good guys

189
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,140
and bad guys out there.

190
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,500
But I can guarantee,

191
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,900
Chi Yan is a good guy.

192
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,540
Why wouldn't you listen?

193
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,900
There is only one sure thing

194
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,340
and that is my love for you.

195
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,060
I don't want to hear that!

196
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,020
You consider pushing him down

197
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:36,980
good for me?

198
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,050
Everything you do is good for me!

199
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,250
You are always right!

200
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:40,740
Xiao Xiú!

201
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,500
Mister,

202
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,860
maybe you should return to the bookstore.

203
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,340
I'll go talk to her.

204
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:52,700
Xiao Xu !

205
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,340
Xiao Xiú!

206
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,340
Hugh.

207
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,140
Xiao Xiú?

208
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:03,780
Xiao Xu?

209
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,740
You seem very upset.

210
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,970
I know he cares about me.

211
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,620
But he shouldn't treat you like that,

212
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,290
right?

213
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:22,900
I don't want to see

214
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,300
the two of you fight.

215
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,900
Your dad and you

216
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,380
are viewing this from different angles.

217
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,580
Neither of you is wrong.

218
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,940
Sometimes,

219
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,330
contradictions are inevitable.

220
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,530
You just need to find the right way to deal with them.

221
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,620
I've tried to talk to him

222
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,140
but it didn't work.

223
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,900
Just look at him.

224
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,210
Your dad just said a lot to me.

225
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,940
But I can't agree with him on all those things.

226
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:56,340
What?

227
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,500
He said

228
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,060
that he is the only one who loves you.

229
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,380
I know,

230
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,260
sure, he loves you a lot.

231
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,170
You also love him, right?

232
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:08,930
But he is not the only one who loves you.

233
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,180
I also love you.

234
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,620
So,

235
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,890
as long as we work hard together

236
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,580
to prove it to him,

237
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,220
he'll eventually understand.

238
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,180
All right.

239
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,380
Let's go home and eat.

240
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,060
Care to join me?

241
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,980
I didn't get to talk to you the last time.

242
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,780
I know Chi Yan.

243
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,140
I also know his family.

244
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,300
From my perspective,

245
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,380
about his character,

246
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,900
there's no need to worry.

247
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,780
He may have a good character,

248
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,500
but humans and cats are not meant to be together.

249
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,340
Don't you think that at this point,

250
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:20,330
other than the love handle and age,

251
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,300
everything else is weakening,

252
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,820
especially so with our perception?

253
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,780
It's difficult for us

254
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,020
to laugh about or cry over something.

255
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,180
The younger generation,

256
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,780
they're only making decisions

257
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,420
that they will make at their age,

258
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,540
which is living in the moment.

259
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,940
They enjoy having each other's company

260
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,410
and cry over being torn apart.

261
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:50,930
But when it comes to this,

262
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,010
there won't be an ending.

263
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,140
There's no telling

264
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,620
unless you can travel through time.

265
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,170
Otherwise, you can't be sure of that.

266
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,060
Are you trying to

267
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,340
destroy your daughter's happiness

268
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,020
and pursuits just because of 
some uncertain ending?

269
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:39,700
[Chi's Bookstore]

270
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,060
I didn't bring the keys.

271
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,330
Your dad's not home yet.

272
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:48,620
It's okay.

273
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,660
Watch and learn.

274
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,740
What are you doing?

275
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:39,620
Lin Mo?

276
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,100
What is this about?

277
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:44,940
I need you to look into something for me.

278
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,330
Put this down first.

279
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,940
We are in the same boat.

280
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,050
I will never sell you out.

281
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,250
Get this away from me.

282
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:56,780
It's terrifying.

283
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,340
You came for the cat seal, didn't you?

284
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,620
I've told you everything I know,

285
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,060
that's it, no more.

286
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,780
You don't need to worry about that.

287
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,100
I came for another reason.

288
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:17,180
Another reason?

289
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,180
What is it?

290
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,420
I just found out

291
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,820
that a colleague of mine is also a cat.

292
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,060
Such a coincidence.

293
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:26,380
What's more important,

294
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:29,180
that colleague of mine resembles her

295
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:31,940
both as a human and as a cat.

296
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,580
This should be good.

297
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,810
cats from the Meow Planet

298
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,660
keep coming here.

299
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,540
Who else?

300
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,850
Her dad.

301
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:52,740
Why did he come?

302
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,740
I couldn't figure it out before.

303
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,100
But what you just said

304
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,180
put the whole story together.

305
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,020
Let's talk outside.

306
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,340
Okay.

307
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,900
Be careful.

308
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,300
Dad, I'm sorry.

309
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,570
I was being aggressive earlier.

310
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,260
I know you did what you did

311
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,820
for a reason.

312
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,860
Also, Chi Yan told me

313
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,500
that you just had different opinions.

314
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:10,780
Look.

315
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:11,370
What?

316
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,340
Fish?

317
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,860
The little fish that you like.

318
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,650
I caught them myself.

319
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:17,580
Impressive, huh?

320
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,180
Impressive.

321
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,220
Actually,

322
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,300
I am the one who should apologise.

323
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,090
I shouldn't have thrown a tantrum.

324
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,260
I don't want you to be with Chi Yan

325
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,020
because no cat has winded up being with a human.

326
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,420
Also,

327
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,860
your mom and I

328
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,660
have already lost your sister.

329
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,380
We don't want to lose you.

330
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,340
To me, being with a human

331
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,300
could bring bad luck.

332
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,060
No, no, no.

333
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,770
No, dad, it won't.

334
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:52,260
Both of us would be fine, okay?

335
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,740
It just won't.

336
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,100
Dad, do you know

337
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,340
how I got my name, xiao xu?

338
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:02,380
How did you get it?

339
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,980
When I first came to this world,

340
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,660
I once fell into the water.

341
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,250
It's okay.

342
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,010
Chi Yan gave me this name

343
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:11,420
after he rescued me.

344
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,770
He told me

345
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,340
that among all survivors

346
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,020
of three horrible tragedies at sea,

347
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,460
some of them

348
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,860
had the same name,

349
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,740
Hugh Williams.

350
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,020
That's why he calls me

351
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,700
Hugh.

352
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:31,060
So, that's a lucky name?

353
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:41,940
What I did earlier

354
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,780
is inappropriate.

355
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,900
I apologise.

356
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,580
But I also hope that you would understand.

357
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,500
Xiao xu is now the only child

358
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,580
for her mom and me.

359
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,930
We really hope that she can live

360
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:06,100
a peaceful and healthy life.

361
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:08,770
So,

362
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,300
Chi Yan,

363
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,500
my apologies.

364
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,380
I should thank you.

365
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,700
While you were pushing me

366
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,620
to the edge of the step,

367
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,050
I wasn't scared at all.

368
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,450
I was thinking,

369
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,620
if I fall,

370
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,780
my legs would be broken,

371
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,460
I would be crippled,

372
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,620
I might even die.

373
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,700
But there's one thing that I can guarantee.

374
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,340
I really do like Xiao xu.

375
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,380
I sincerely want to be with her.

376
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,420
That's all I need.

377
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,410
You asked

378
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:09,980
about my wish.

379
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,620
If I have to make a wish,

380
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,180
I'd say,

381
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,930
I want you to have faith in us.

382
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:33,780
Thank you.

383
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,660
Which one do you like?

384
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,340
I'll help you get it.

385
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,300
That one.

386
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,810
This elephant?

387
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,340
Okay, let me.

388
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,340
Please hold this for me.

389
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:50,180
Just wait.

390
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,580
Now.

391
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,180
What was that?

392
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:00,890
One more time.

393
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:01,740
Just one more time.

394
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,780
The grey elephant with pink ears.

395
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,050
Got it!

396
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,580
Got it, I got it!

397
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,010
Don't jinx it!

398
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,180
You almost had it!

399
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:14,820
You wanna try?

400
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,180
Okay, I'll try.

401
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,700
Here. Okay.

402
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,370
The left hand controls the direction

403
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,500
and the right hand grabs it, right?

404
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,010
Yep.

405
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,860
Haven't you done this before?

406
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,060
This is my first time.

407
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,300
My gosh!

408
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,690
I got it, I got it!

409
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,260
Mingming.

410
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,260
I thought I see you,

411
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,460
and it really is you.

412
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,370
Godmother.

413
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:42,180
What are you doing here?

414
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,130
Shopping.

415
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:43,740
Hi, godmother.

416
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,100
This is?

417
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,300
Xu Zihao,

418
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,020
my boyfriend.

419
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,620
This is my godmother,

420
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,780
Uncle Gao's wife, Aunt Lou.

421
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,540
Such a nice lad.

422
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,100
Uncle Gao

423
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,780
speaks highly of you.

424
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:00,740
Thank you, Aunt Lou.

425
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:03,820
Mingming,

426
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,660
don't blame me for blabbering,

427
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,100
it's time for you

428
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,860
to consider getting married.

429
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,260
Aunt Lou,

430
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,020
stop it.

431
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,860
I really want to give you

432
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,980
that red envelope.

433
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,130
Uncle Gao and I

434
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,540
have been waiting for this.

435
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,620
I'll help you book the hotel.

436
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,540
What happened?

437
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,420
Quick, go take a look.

438
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,690
What happened, you alright?

439
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,450
I'm fine.

440
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:31,700
I'm fine.

441
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,700
Dad, take a look at these.

442
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:41,940
What about this one?

443
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,020
It looks nice, right?

444
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:44,460
No, it doesn't.

445
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,170
Chi Yan would probably look good in this.

446
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,700
This one looks nice.

447
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,660
This one suits Chi Yan's style!

448
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,460
Look.

449
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:03,820
It doesn't look good.

450
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,100
What about this one?

451
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,500
Nope.

452
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,740
I think it's fine.

453
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:10,980
Thank you.

454
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,540
Thank you.

455
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,540
You promised to buy some clothes for me.

456
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,180
But what happened?

457
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,580
These are all for Chi Yan.

458
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:20,730
I thought you didn't like any of those.

459
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,610
Chi Yan, Chi Yan, Chi Yan.

460
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,690
Now I see it,

461
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,220
you don't love me anymore.

462
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,740
Where did that come from?

463
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,620
We are basically wearing matching shirts.

464
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,220
my love for you

465
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,580
is just like your love

466
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,260
for Mom and me.

467
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,060
Stop pouting.

468
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,620
What do you want? I'll buy anything for you.

469
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:43,700
Really?

470
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:46,580
That's more like it.

471
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:47,420
Come on, let's go.

472
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,580
Coming.

473
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,660
I got this recipe from the internet.

474
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,540
This porridge is good for your stomach.

475
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:05,340
Thank you.

476
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:06,540
be careful

477
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:12,780
It tastes good.

478
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,420
Mingming,

479
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,370
I'm so lucky.

480
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,300
Now, it's time

481
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,300
for the bride and groom to exchange the rings.

482
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:26,970
Any better?

483
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,620
To many, the finale of a relationship

484
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,340
is marriage.

485
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,660
But I asked Hu

486
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,970
to build a different set outside the church.

487
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:39,660
Change the channel, please?

488
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:40,500
Wait a minute,

489
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,820
I need to see this.

490
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,620
Please change the channel.

491
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,460
What? This is not bad.

492
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,490
I once read

493
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,900
that one has to

494
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,420
reject the first 37% of guys

495
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,650
to meet the right one.

496
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,660
So, for me,

497
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,700
my first love doesn't have to be my first boyfriend,

498
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,300
it should be someone that I truly love.

499
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,660
Do you remember that we once said...

500
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,650
Zihao?

501
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:13,780
You alright?

502
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,340
What's wrong?

503
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,020
I'm fine, I'm fine.

504
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,500
Xu Zihao, open the door.

505
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,820
Let me have a look.

506
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,250
You mean,

507
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:35,500
whenever you hear that word,

508
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,660
you throw up?

509
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,820
I used to be forced to, you know.

510
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,540
Now, whenever I hear that word,

511
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:52,980
I throw up.

512
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:58,780
Congratulations.

513
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,300
It's true love.

514
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,570
You've found it.

515
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,460
Chi,

516
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:16,660
what should I do?

517
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,820
Should I just tell her?

518
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:20,180
She probably would think

519
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,730
that I'm not telling the truth

520
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:22,460
if I tell her.

521
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,340
But if I do tell her,

522
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,180
I'm afraid that she would think

523
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,220
there is no future for us

524
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,420
and just end this relationship.

525
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,460
Your problem

526
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,060
is about whether you can do you know what.

527
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,610
Your problem

528
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:36,220
is that you are not honest enough.

529
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,140
What about you?

530
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,100
Have you ever thought about you know what
with Xiao Xu?

531
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,860
My situation is more complicated,

532
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,700
much more complicated than you could imagine.

533
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,380
We are here to solve your problem,

534
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,140
why did you try to talk about mine?

535
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,180
I have no idea

536
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:03,620
how to solve this.

537
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:11,860
Another?

538
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,620
Baby,

539
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,610
I still want to ask you about it.

540
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,060
What?

541
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,570
Have you really thought about it?

542
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,330
Humans and cats are not meant to be together.

543
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,060
You and Chi Yan

544
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,180
are not meant to be together.

545
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:44,500
Dad,

546
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,400
You said that we wouldn't end up together.

547
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,660
But that's only because

548
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,780
no one has ever done it before, right?

549
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,220
Yes.

550
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,700
But you've seen it yourself,

551
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,580
Chi Yan is a really nice guy, right?

552
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:56,980
He is kind, honest,

553
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,980
and he really loves me.

554
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,820
Okay, let me ask you this.

555
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:03,180
If you and Mom are facing

556
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,460
the same situation as Chi Yan and I do,

557
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,540
will you give up on Mom?

558
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,820
I only know

559
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,420
whatever happens,

560
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,300
I will never give up on her,

561
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:13,900
and you.

562
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,820
Whatever happens,

563
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,020
I will never give up on Mom, you,

564
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,100
and Chi Yan.

565
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,330
Dad, we are making the same decision.

566
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,700
Something to drink?

567
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,540
I'll go grab one for you.

568
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,460
I'm fine.

569
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,340
You go ahead.

570
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,220
Wait here.

571
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:00,500
[Today at 6, I'll see you in the pavilion. 
It's about xiu xiao's sister.]

572
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,050
Who are you?

573
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,540
My name is Lin Mo.

574
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,010
I'm also a cat.

575
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,700
You don't smell like one of us.

576
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,340
It's because I take pills

577
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:36,980
to maintain a human form.

578
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,060
If it makes you feel better,

579
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:40,330
I can transform now.

580
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:40,940
No need for that.

581
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,140
How did you know my daughter?

582
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,300
I am her lover.

583
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:49,540
Lover?

584
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,340
It's her.

585
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,580
It's my girl.

586
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,620
We met here on earth.

587
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,740
She passed before we could

588
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,660
return to our planet

589
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:32,820
and introduce each other to our families.

590
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,340
Thank you.

591
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,260
Thank you for letting me see my girl one more time.

592
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,700
I'm glad that she is loved

593
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,170
and remembered

594
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,300
by someone like you.

595
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,820
Do you know she was killed by a human?

596
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,060
That murderer is right next to you and Hugh.

597
00:31:59,060 --> 00:31:59,820
What did you say?

598
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:01,060
Chi Yan.

599
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:03,260
He is the one who killed her.

600
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:04,700
Chi Yan?

601
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,220
It can't be.

602
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:10,340
I looked into my daughter's death.

603
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,580
Many stray cats and dogs

604
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,500
were poisoned around the school.

605
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,540
You think Chi Yan was the one who killed my girl?

606
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:24,580
I did my research.

607
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,340
Everyone says it was Chi Yan.

608
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,050
He even switched to another school

609
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,900
because of this.

610
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,450
And you believe them?

611
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:34,940
Who else could it be?

612
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:37,500
I need your help with something.

613
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,380
I have to kill him.

614
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:45,980
Lin Mo,

615
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:47,860
you are blinded by hatred.

616
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:49,780
I believe

617
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,420
Chi Yan is not the murderer.

618
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:56,010
Am I being blinded,

619
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,650
or are you?

620
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,020
If it wasn't him,

621
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,540
why did they all say that it was him?

622
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:03,900
Kid,

623
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,020
sometimes,

624
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,570
gossips overshadow the truth.

625
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,500
No matter who or what you run into,

626
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,820
you feel with your heart

627
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,700
rather than just listen.

628
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,540
Chi Yan is not the murderer.

629
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,020
I've told you the truth.

630
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,170
Since you don't buy it,

631
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,100
I'll have to do it myself.

632
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,620
Lin Mo, wait!

633
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,060
Hatred is never a solution,

634
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,940
it will only make you struggle.

635
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,260
I know,

636
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:46,900
you love my daughter.

637
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,700
But what's more difficult than love

638
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:51,860
is to let go.

639
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,860
You are a good lad,

640
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:57,180
I hope that you can let go

641
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,220
and live a good life.

642
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,370
Life?

643
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,260
From the moment she died,

644
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,850
life has been a torture to me.

645
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:09,980
I've been looking for him for ten years.

646
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,219
He shall be punished for what he did.

647
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:12,940
You should go home.

648
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:14,219
I didn't expect

649
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:16,580
that you, as her dad, would think so.

650
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,260
The pain that you cannot see

651
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:20,580
hurts you the deepest.

652
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:22,380
I know what pain feels like.

653
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:47,179
I know a lot of people think that way,

654
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:48,010
but dad,

655
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:50,179
those are misconceptions.

656
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,940
We are extremely healthy there.

657
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,699
We don't feel uncomfortable at all.

658
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,340
Mr. Wingfield says

659
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:57,490
it is entirely a mistake

660
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:58,690
to suppose the place unhealthy.

661
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:00,450
And I am sure he may be depended on,

662
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:01,700
for he thoroughly understands

663
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,980
the nature of the air,

664
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:04,580
and his own brother and family

665
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,820
have been there repeatedly.

666
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,020
You should have gone to Cromer,

667
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:10,220
my dear, if you went anywhere.

668
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,580
Perry was a week

669
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,460
at Cromer once,

670
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,380
and he holds it to be

671
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,410
the best of all the sea-bathing places.

672
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,220
A fine open sea, he says,

673
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:19,660
and very pure air.

674
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:20,690
And, by what I understand,

675
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:23,060
you might have had lodgings there

676
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,100
quite away from the sea,

677
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:24,900
a quarter of a mile off.

678
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,460
Dad.

679
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,220
When did you come back?

680
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,050
I just arrived.

681
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:30,900
I thought you went fishing.

682
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:31,580
Where's the fish?

683
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,100
Fish?

684
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:35,380
I didn't catch any.

685
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,700
We will go to the grocery store,

686
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,530
wanna join us?

687
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:39,660
No, no.

688
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,380
It's fun.

689
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,140
No, I don't.

690
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,060
I’m exhausted.

691
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:44,820
Let's just call it a day.

692
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,420
Goodnight.

693
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:55,100
Don't you think that my dad's been acting weird today?

694
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,060
Dad.

695
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:03,660
Dad?

696
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,220
Come on.

697
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:05,810
What?

698
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,100
Come here.

699
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,500
Hurry.

700
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,090
I'm enjoying the scene.

701
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:10,900
I know.

702
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:11,650
Join us.

703
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,170
Chi Yan and dad.

704
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,020
Let's go.

705
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:17,810
Dad, look.

706
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,660
Hungry, aren't you?

707
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:20,580
Morning.

708
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:22,300
Here.

709
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:26,930
Dad, hurry.

710
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,220
Dad, that one is Xiaowu.

711
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,340
Xiaowu, here.

712
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,140
Enjoy.

713
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,410
Water, water.

714
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:36,660
Water.

715
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,370
Here.

716
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:43,980
Enjoy, come on. Enjoy.

717
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,220
Enjoy before they're gone.

718
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:46,970
Hurry, come on.

719
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:47,820
Come here.

720
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,700
Xiaowu, babe.

721
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,420
Why isn't Xiaowu eating?

722
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,570
Come here, come on.

723
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:53,700
Come one.

724
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,210
Enjoy, eat.

725
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,210
Come one, come here.

726
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,500
Here.

727
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,420
Come on, come on. That's enough for you.

728
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,220
You've gained some weight.

729
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:03,420
You've gotten chubby.

730
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,100
You're no longer the most handsome one.

731
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:09,900
Tissue?

732
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,370
Stay still, Xiaowu.

733
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:14,060
Don't move.

734
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,530
This should be quick, Xiaowu.

735
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:20,260
Come on, Xiaowu.

736
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:20,900
Give me a hand.

737
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,580
Xiaowu.

738
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,820
This should be quick, Xiaowu.

739
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,540
It's okay, it's okay.

740
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,900
Okay, Xiaowu, it's done.

741
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:27,890
It's okay, Xiaowu.

742
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:28,580
It's alright.

743
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,700
Don't eat anything provided by others

744
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,970
when we're not here, got it?

745
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:32,660
You hear me?

746
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:33,980
Why?

747
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:37,660
There were several poisoning incidents here.

748
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,860
Chi Yan and I sent all the stray animals

749
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,090
to the local shelter.

750
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:42,580
Did you?

751
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:43,730
What happened next?

752
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,820
Thankfully, we caught that bastard.

753
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,140
If they hadn't stopped me,

754
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,620
I would've scratched his face.

755
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:49,780
Xiaowu.

756
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,180
Right? It's okay now.

757
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,740
If they hadn't stopped us,

758
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,460
we could've scratched his face together.

759
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:54,820
Am I right?

760
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:55,700
There are many of us.

761
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:11,820
Hello.

762
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:16,970
What's your name?

763
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:21,810
Newcomer,

764
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,580
what's your name?

765
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,380
What's your name?

766
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,740
What's your name?

767
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,980
I didn't expect you to be one of us.

768
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,060
Why didn't you tell me?

769
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,140
Surprise.

770
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,500
How come I can't smell your scent?

771
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:56,250
Because I took the medicine.

772
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:58,180
Not only does it cover my scent,

773
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,820
I also lost my sense of smell.

774
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,300
That's why

775
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:03,340
I couldn't recognise you before.

776
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,660
But why didn't you tell me?

777
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,220
I could've shared my trouble

778
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,540
with you.

779
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:09,820
What's wrong?

780
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,300
Something's bothering you?

781
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,410
My dad came.

782
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,730
He doesn't like Chi Yan,

783
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:18,180
something about humans and cats are not
meant to be together.

784
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,820
He wants me to return to the Meow Planet
after I pay Chi Yan back.

785
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,060
Your dad doesn't like Chi Yan?

786
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:25,380
Unbelievable, right?

787
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,820
Chi Yan is such a nice guy,

788
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,460
why would anyone don't like him?

789
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,580
Now that I think of it,

790
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:34,940
I judged Chi Yan way too fast,

791
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,620
and I was kind of a jerk to him.

792
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:39,140
But later, I realised,

793
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,130
he is a nice guy.

794
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,700
I hope you two can be happy.

795
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,700
I visited the Meow Planet not long ago

796
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,020
and heard about something.

797
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,100
It might be helpful.

798
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:49,780
What is it?

799
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,140
Have you ever heard of the cat seal?

800
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,530
We have an old tale on the Meow Planet,

801
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,780
when a human gets approved by a cat,

802
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,340
that human gets a cat seal.

803
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:03,300
A cat seal?

804
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:07,180
The cat seal is usually attached to something.

805
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,460
Humans can pass it on to their descendants.

806
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,460
The seal allows the human who owns it

807
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,100
to make a love pact with a cat.

808
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,500
When the pact takes effect,

809
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,700
the cat can then enjoy its life

810
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,340
as a real human

811
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,290
in an eternal human form.

812
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,980
So, is there only one cat seal

813
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,460
or are there many of them?

814
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:27,860
Besides, how can I know

815
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,580
whether Chi Yan has a cat seal or not?

816
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,580
Rumour has it that there are fewer cat seals now.

817
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:35,860
I don't know the exact number.

818
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,780
As for the way to tell whether a human has the seal
or not,

819
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,300
those who have it

820
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,380
are naturally close to cats.

821
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,860
They are more likely to be favoured by cats.

822
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,290
Then Chi Yan must have a cat seal.

823
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,660
He is like a walking catnip.

824
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,130
So, what does that cat seal look like?

825
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:51,500
Also, how am I supposed to

826
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,330
make that pact with Chi Yan?

827
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:53,740
Can you tell me?

828
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,660
As far as I know,

829
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,580
you just need to give the seal to him.

830
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,500
I have no idea what it looks like,

831
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,540
only the owner knows.

832
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,060
I suppose,

833
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,500
it must be something old, like a relic.

834
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,610
Take a chill pill.

835
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,500
It's only a myth.

836
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,420
I have no idea whether it's true or not.

837
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,700
I don't care.

838
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,020
I have to try first.

839
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,620
Something old.

840
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,820
Thank you, Lin Mo.

841
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,340
You're welcome.

842
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:22,810
I wish nothing but happiness for you.

843
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,380
If you do find it,

844
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,330
remember to tell me.

845
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,700
I also want to see what it looks like.

846
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,170
Sure.

847
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:31,050
I will bring

848
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:32,180
Chi Yan along.

849
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,940
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

850
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,460
I have to leave now.

851
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,530
I've got a good feeling about this.

852
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,340
Bye!

853
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:42,380
Bye.

854
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:53,900
Chi Yan,

855
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:57,660
do you own a cat seal?

856
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,210
A what now?

857
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:00,860
A cat seal.

858
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,300
It allows a human and a cat

859
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,540
to make a love pact.

860
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:04,420
Do you have it?

861
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:09,130
I've never heard of it, how can I...

862
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:10,060
You, do you

863
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,060
carry something with you

864
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,780
that I haven't seen before?

865
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,410
Maybe a family heirloom,

866
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,140
or something shiny?

867
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:19,540
Do you?

868
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,340
This is really important.

869
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:28,140
It allows me

870
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,620
to stay with you forever.

871
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:31,380
You know, like a real human being.

872
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:35,530
I really don't have one.

873
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,700
Think harder.

874
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:42,980
Who told you about that?

875
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:44,620
Not important.

876
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:46,650
I...

877
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:47,790
I'll just look for it myself.

878
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,980
Are you sure that you wanna look for

879
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:05,130
something that I don't have?

880
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:06,620
Maybe it's hidden somewhere.

881
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:07,980
Stop looking for it.

882
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:09,780
Stop looking for it.

883
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:11,500
I have something to tell you.

884
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,140
Tomorrow

885
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,660
is the anniversary of my grandpa's death.

886
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,250
I plan to visit the old mansion.

887
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:17,780
You...

888
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:19,940
Do you want to come with me?

889
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:20,940
Of course.

890
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:25,140
Nice game, little flatfish.

891
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:26,420
Thank you, Ai Lier.

892
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,130
Look.

893
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,570
I hope you enjoy your day, your majesty.

894
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:32,530
Mister,

895
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:36,380
tomorrow,

896
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,420
I plan to take Hugh with me to the old mansion.

897
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,100
It's beautiful there.

898
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,500
You can fish.

899
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:45,900
Care to join us?

900
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:48,900
Don't mind me.

901
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:51,100
Fu and I are going fishing together.

902
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,170
Enjoy the TV then.

903
00:43:58,700 --> 00:43:59,620
You really are not coming?

904
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:00,900
Nope.
