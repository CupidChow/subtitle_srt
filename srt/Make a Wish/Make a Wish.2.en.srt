00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,580
Born in the Moonlight,

353
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:50,540
Valerie Edward II,

354
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,570
Mouse Guardian.

355
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,020
Mouse Buster.

356
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,530
Mouse Buster.

357
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,180
the Meow Planet's

358
00:27:59,100 --> 00:27:59,610
Guardian.

359
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:00,930
Again.

360
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,300
Born in the Moonlight, Valerie Edward II,

361
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,740
Mouse Buster,

362
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,260
the Meow Planet's Guardian.

363
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:13,780
You don't remember it.

364
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:14,500
I...

365
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,320
Then you must memorize it tomorrow.

366
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:19,420
OK.

367
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:20,900
Memorize it.

368
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,060
If you want to know someone's wishes,

369
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,980
you'll have to know their needs.

370
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,180
Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory

371
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,180
divides people's needs into five levels.

372
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,530
The first level of Maslow's hierarchy of needs

373
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,820
is physiological needs.

374
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,980
Second level,

375
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,940
safety needs.

376
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:09,260
Wait.

377
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,860
Beg me, beg me.

378
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,130
Help! Help!

379
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,500
Make a wish.

380
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,780
Mouse Buster.

381
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,380
Cat Planet's Gua...

382
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,810
Help me!

383
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,850
Third level,

384
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,730
Love and belonging needs.

385
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,180
In the pyramid of needs,

386
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,740
at the bottom of the needs pyramid

387
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,450
lies physiological and safety needs.

388
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,380
After those needs are met,

389
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,290
humans begin to pursue the spiritual pleasure

390
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,730
obtained in interpersonal communication.

391
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:44,140
The strongest pleasure among them

392
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:46,860
is the satisfaction brought by love.

393
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:00,100
As a foodie,

394
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,180
how can I not go to the market often?

395
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,460
Now I’m going to teach you

396
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:06,490
how to choose particularly succulent,

397
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:10,180
fresh raw prawns.

398
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,340
What is this, Uncle Fu?

399
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,940
Everyone seems to have one.

400
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,900
This is a phone.

401
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,330
In this society,

402
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:26,140
human beings cannot survive without it.

403
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:34,060
This...

404
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,090
This is a filter.

405
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,180
It's not real.

406
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,700
I don't understand.

407
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,810
We finally become human and come here.

408
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:43,460
But they want to become cats.

409
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,340
I just got a human name.

410
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,260
Listen up.

411
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:48,650
OK.

412
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,850
My name is Born in the Moonlight,

413
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:52,340
Valerie Edward II,

414
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,500
Mouse Buster, the Meow Planet's Guardian.

415
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,820
Human names are very short

416
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,460
and mainly used for addressing.

417
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,930
Most names are simple and nice

418
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,220
or mean something.

419
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,260
Yours is too long.

420
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:13,420
Had I returned his favor,

421
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,490
I wouldn't be worrying about names.

422
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:16,740
What's wrong?

423
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,940
Having trouble returning his favor?

424
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,260
He said he has no desires.

425
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,980
He's not interested in anything.

426
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,490
I can never go home with him being like this.

427
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,890
A human without any desires.

428
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:33,620
It's very rare.

429
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:36,900
Uncle Fu,

430
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,660
what is the most important need for humans

431
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,980
in interpersonal relationships?

432
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:42,450
I read it in a book.

433
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:43,420
It says it's...

434
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,090
Love.

435
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:46,020
But what's that?

436
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:52,690
Interpersonal relationships include family,

437
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,100
friends and lovers.

438
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,090
But for humans,

439
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,820
love is the most important one.

440
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:00,380
Love.

441
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,620
What's love?

442
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:05,060
For humans, love is probably

443
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:07,460
the nervous but exciting feeling

444
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,970
a single man feels

445
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,860
when he sits in front of a girl he likes.

446
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,100
He won't know where to look.

447
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:17,300
He'll also blush,

448
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,940
and his heart will race.

449
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,060
Chemistry and stuff.

450
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,460
Then how do I get him...

451
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,250
To sit in front of her?

452
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:33,220
It'll happen if they meet each other.

453
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:35,260
If they haven't met yet,

454
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,860
do everything to make sure they meet.

455
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:39,500
Hmm...

456
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:41,740
In one word,

457
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,060
it's called fate.

458
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:44,980
Fate?

How old are you?

462
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,340
I'm two years old. What about you?

463
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:40,780
Chi Yan.

464
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,250
Twenty-six.

465
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:46,860
Twenty-six?

466
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:48,890
And you're still single?

467
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,140
No wonder you're so grumpy all the time.

Hello.

May I ask if you know how to cook?

474
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,580
How to cook?

475
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:24,530
I'm from the bookstore next door.

476
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,060
Could you cook a meal for Chi Yan?

Chi Yan.

00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:28,940
And you are?

479
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:30,370
I'm a guest staying with him.

480
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,659
A guest...

481
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,340
As far as I know,

482
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,699
Chi lives by himself.

483
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,179
Would you like him to live alone?

484
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:42,340
May I ask why you're staying with him?

485
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:43,460
He saved my life.

486
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:44,420
I must follow him.

487
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,580
Sounds like he's a nice guy.

488
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:48,780
He's super nice.

489
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:50,780
So, could you cook a meal for him?

490
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:54,060
But why me? Why do I have to do it?

491
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,700
Because he just reads books all day,

492
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,740
and he doesn't cook at all.

493
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,380
He's either staring at books

494
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,580
or the other thing...

495
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,290
What thing?

496
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:03,020

The...

498
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,300
What?

499
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:08,860
The computer!

500
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,290
He owns a bookstore.

501
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,540
It's normal that he reads a lot.

502
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,130
But if he doesn't cook,

503
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:18,060
you can cook for him.

504
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,300
I don't know how to cook.

505
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,180
I wanna have some fish.

506
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,220
You haven't answered my question yet.

507
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,900
I do know how to cook, but...

508
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,900
Great. Then let's go!

509
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,370
Alright.

510
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,940
I'll teach you how to cook.

511
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,580
But will it upset him

512
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,260
if we go to his place?

513
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,580
Nah, it should be fine.

514
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,610
Chi Yan probably likes fish too.

515
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,660
Also if he gets mad at you,

516
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,860
just say you're here to teach me how to cook.

517
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,500
Alright. It's a deal.

00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,060
I'll teach you.

519
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,500
But I still haven't got your name.

00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:58,900
I'm He Meng.

527
00:35:59,220 --> 00:35:59,780
He Meng.

528
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:01,980
Can I call you Meng?

529
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:02,500
Of course.

530
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,300
Any flowers you like?

531
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:06,820
Take some.

532
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:07,740
Cool.

533
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,170
This one.

534
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,540
Alright. Take it.

535
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,540
Your bubble tea is ready.

536
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,300
Stop.

537
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,020
Stop right there.

538
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,580
Excuse me.

539
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:48,980
Where is it?

540
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,010
Where is what?

541
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:58,930
Don't move.

542
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,010
Get up.

543
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:02,980
Get up now.

544
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:05,180
Where is it?

545
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:06,660
I don't know.

546
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,220
Thank you, Journalist.

547
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:10,810
You're welcome.

548
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,010
Stand up straight.

549
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,010
Don't move!

550
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:28,410
What are you doing?

551
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:28,820
Don't move.

552
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:30,700
What are you doing?

553
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,380
Officers,

554
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:33,740
it's here.

555
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,900
What's here?

556
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:37,860
What's this?

557
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:38,540
Eh...

558
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,740
It's not mine.

559
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:40,640
I don't know why I have it.

560
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,410
Officer,

561
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:42,260
let me explain.

562
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:42,900
It's not mine.

563
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,980
I don't know why it's on me.

564
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,060
Stop making excuses.

565
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,420
You can talk later at the police station.

566
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,140
Let's go.

567
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:50,740
Gentle. You're hurting me.

568
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,380
Right.

569
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,020
You need to come with us for a statement.

570
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:53,540
Thank you.

571
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,140
Alright.

572
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,220
It wasn't me.

573
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,690
Please make a bubble tea for me.

574
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:57,900
My colleague will pay later.

575
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,220
Thanks!

576
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,580
I didn't take it.

577
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:01,020
Let's go.

578
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,060
Chi Yan.

579
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:17,820
Hello.

580
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:24,530
Anything wrong?

581
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,460
Nothing!

582
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,380
She's here to cook for us.

583
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,860
The kitchen is upstairs. I'll show you.

584
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:35,140
Don't worry!

585
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,460
Just wait and we'll cook a delicious meal.

586
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:52,810
Right,

587
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,340
do you guys eat spicy food?

588
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:55,260
You can try it later.

589
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:56,740
We do.

590
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:12,620
What's wrong?

591
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,290
Be careful.

592
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,340
Headache.

593
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,490
Sit down.

594
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:15,860
Here.

595
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:19,890
Careful.

596
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:21,820
Besides the headache,

597
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:22,900
any other discomfort?

598
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:25,820
Not really.

599
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:27,780
Any medicine in the house?

600
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,340
I'll go get it.

601
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,540
Yeah, it's in the storage room.

602
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,010
Alright.

603
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,770
That way. On the left.

604
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:32,650
Okay, wait for me.

605
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:33,260
I'll be right back.

606
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:10,820
He Meng.

607
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,500
What are you doing?

608
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:15,820
She's having a headache,

609
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,410
so I came here to get some medicine.

610
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,500
There is no medicine here.

611
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:35,930
What are you doing?

612
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,260
Open the door!

613
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,020
Now you can feel the chemistry.

614
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,140
Open the door.

615
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:49,130
You two enjoy your time there.

616
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:50,260
No need to thank me.

617
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,300
Open the door now.

618
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,260
Let us out.

619
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:52,980
Hurry.

620
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:53,940
Right.

621
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:54,850
Open the door please.

622
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:55,730
It's too crowded here.

623
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:56,940
Let us talk outside.

624
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:57,740
Meng.

625
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,100
The fish you made is amazing.

626
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:00,620
It's not funny.

627
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,700
Open the door.

628
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:05,940
Open the door!

629
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:09,220
Stop this nonsense!

630
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,370
I wanna use the bathroom.

631
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:11,100
I can't hold it.

632
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:11,900
Let me out.

633
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,540
Hold it!

634
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:18,780
Hurry up.

635
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,580
I'm not in the mood for this!

636
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,780
What are you doing?

637
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:51,410
It's dangerous! Don't...

638
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,250
Please open the door.

639
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,570
Let me out.

640
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:03,730
Open the door now.

641
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,370
I'm sorry.

642
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:07,460
I'm sorry.

643
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:08,620
What are you doing?

644
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:14,300
Eh...

645
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,180
Careful.

646
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:24,860
Be careful!

647
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,300
What's wrong with these two?

648
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,340
Stop right there!
