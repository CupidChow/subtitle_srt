There is no such thing as a coincidence.

Bye.

152

Where have you been?

153
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,100
I followed Qin Liangliang.

154
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,380
I ran into a strange guy.

155
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,700
He held my hand and wouldn't let go.

156

He...

157
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:35,980
Is the water boiling?

158
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,060
Did you leave the gas on?

159
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,100
Back in the arcade, there was a chubby one,

160
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:43,940
a slim one,

161
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,980
and a short one.

162
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,420
They are all rude.

163
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,500
They talk and act rudely.

165
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,900

We...

167
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,380
The two of you are buddies.

168
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,620
Don't you want to do something about that?

169
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,820
At his age, he has to go through these.

What can I do to help?

00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,700
want to do something about that?

176
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,020
What about me?

177
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,660
You are supposed to return to your planet.

178
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,340
This is not your home,

179
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,260
you won't stay here forever.

180
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,100
If my ears pop out

181
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:53,980
every time I drink alcohol,

182
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,930
does that mean I cannot drink alcohol anymore?

183
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,420
What about those drinks that contain alcohol?

184
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:00,940
You are allergic to alcohol,

185
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,850
that's why it happened.

186
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,020
Today, we are going to find out

187
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,900
whether you are allergic to other stuff.

188
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,060
But these drinks are just so yummy.

189
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,860
This is soy sauce.

190
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,620
This is shampoo.

191
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,060
But these two bottles are the most appealing.

192
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,780
Liangliang,

193
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,130
how can you do this?

194
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:08,300
Where's the wine?

195
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,220
Just drink these.

196
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,579
Are you kidding me?

197
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,460
Am I being too nice to you?

198
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,140
I'll tell you what to do.

199
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:24,900
Why don't you

200
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:28,220
head back to the owner of that bookstore
and take more money?

201
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,420
I thought the two of you are close.

202
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,580
That was already the last time.

203
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,060
Excuse me?

204
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,420
Do you think

205
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,660
you have a say in this?

206
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,140
Are you messing with me?

207
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,100
Brother.

208
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,060
Get out of the way.

209
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,140
Are you messing with me?

210
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:02,740
Let's go.

211
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,650
Did I say you can leave?

212
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,140
Aren't you a badass?

213
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:32,700
Go get them!

214
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,060
A knife? Are you serious?

215
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:05,780
Chi Yan, take him!

216
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,450
Run.

217
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:12,300
Run.

218
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:14,970
Run!

219
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:16,900
Come on!

220
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,140
Run, run, run!

221
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,180
Stop!

222
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,500
Hold it!

223
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:22,570
Stop!

224
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,060
Stop!

225
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,260
Stop running!

226
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,300
Stop running!

227
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:30,300
Hurry, come on!

228
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,100
Stop it!

229
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:40,660
Now what?

230
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,140
Feel free to run!

231
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,220
What are you doing?

232
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,260
Move.

233
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:21,210
Why didn't you tell me about it?

234
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,290
I didn't expect to meet you here.

235
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:26,980
I owe you big time.

236
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:27,780
If it weren't for you,

237
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,060
I probably would never know about it.

238
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,020
You...

239
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:36,380
Do you know each other?

240
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:37,700
Yep.

241
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,900
We went to the same high school.

242
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,130
It's been a long time.

243
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,260
You are?

244
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,540
I'm a... She is

245
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,740
a friend of mine who crashes at my place.

246
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,570
Thank you.

247
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,890
Sorry for the trouble.

248
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,420
This kid,

249
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,220
I'm too busy to keep an eye on him all the time.

250
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,260
You know, at his age,

251
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,500
he refuses to tell me anything.

252
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,780
I really am sorry for the trouble.

253
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,900
Come, apologise to them.

254
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:07,140
It's no trouble at all.

255
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,220
He visits my store a lot.

256
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,730
About today,

257
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,660
it was the least that we could do.

258
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,060
So,

259
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,660
I will head back to school now.

260
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,740
I will give you a ride.

261
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,540
How about this,

262
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,420
I will bring Liangliang and the four of us

263
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,020
can have dinner together. It's on me.

264
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:31,300
No problem.

265
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,410
What's your WeChat account?

266
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,170
I will call you.

267
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,580
We don't use WeChat.

268
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,940
Just your number would be fine.

269
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,340
His number is

270
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,660
189453711

271
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,740
89453711

272
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,780
See you later.

273
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:01,620
Bye.

274
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:09,780
I'm back.

275
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,060
It's your job to give it a name.

276
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,660
This really is for me?

277
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:24,900
I thought you've always wanted one.

278
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,530
Sister,

279
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,620
aren't you afraid of dogs?

280
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:31,980
It's okay.

281
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:38,620
What should I name you?

282
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,410
It can't be too tacky,

283
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,820
and it also can't be too complicated.

284
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:47,260
Liangliang,

285
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,260
about those bullies...

286
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:56,020
They're just a bunch of unemployed

287
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:59,180
who like to wander outside the school.

288
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,890
I heard that some of them

289
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:01,980
went to juvie.

290
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,940
It's very dangerous to hang out with them.

291
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,820
I didn't think it was such a big deal,

292
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:08,780
and you are always busy.

293
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,740
So, I figured that I could take care of it on my own.

294
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,260
You wouldn't refuse to tell me anything

295
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:21,690
if I paid more attention.

296
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:25,420
I'm sorry, Liangliang.

297
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,140
Still, I want you to know,

298
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,340
no matter how busy I am,

299
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,500
family always comes first,

300
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,580
especially you.

301
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:37,740
So, could you

302
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,220
forgive me this time?

303
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,610
Next time,

304
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,740
whatever happens,

305
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,220
please tell me, okay?

306
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,530
Maybe next time.

307
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,220
That's not good enough.

308
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,140
You have to tell me,

309
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:53,580
understood?

310
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:00,740
It's a deal then.

311
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:01,820
Pinky swear.

312
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,420
Let me take a look at the wound.

313
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,580
It's not a big deal,

314
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,660
just a scratch.

315
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,100
I insist.

316
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,140
Where's the wound?

317
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:22,900
Never mind.

318
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:29,460
Look.

319
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:34,500
Please, let me take a look.

320
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,340
Come.

321
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:46,140
No rush.

322
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,340
Just like this.

323
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,650
You are right about this.

324
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,850
Look, no alcohol,

325
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:34,730
no ears.

326
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,740
Next time, when Liangliang visits the store,

327
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,580
call me,

328
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,060
I'd like to apologise to him.

329
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:45,900
I shouldn't have

330
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,340
considered him as one of them.

331
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,220
I was wrong.

332
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,780
I also owe Liangliang an apology.

333
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,730
He considers me a big brother

334
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,020
and visits the store every day.

335
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,860
But I had no idea what was going on.

336
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,530
But you do care about him.

337
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,180
Chi Yan,

338
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,180
you also protected him.

339
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,980
You even fought for him today.

340
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,700
I've never seen you like that before.

341
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:11,810
Also,

342
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:14,780
last time when you see me drowning,

343
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,450
you saved me.

344
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:18,020
And there was this time back at the bar,

345
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,180
I was so scared that I hid away,

346
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,700
it was you who found and protected me.

347
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,100

350

You drank too much.

351
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,980
I thought you told me to try every one of them.

352
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,260
That's exactly what I'm doing.

353
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,610

354

356
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,690
You've never called me by my name.

357
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,690

359

That's my first human name.

361
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,810
If you don't say it right,

362
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,340
I will fry your fish.

363
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:35,770
Why do you always threaten me with the fish?

364
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:36,860

365

368
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,500
It tastes good.

369
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,020
We've only got one left.

370
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:54,780

[Story Outline]

379
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,100
That doesn't seem right.

380
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,380
She can't be the murderer.

381
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,530
Then the murderer...

382
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,140
The murderer is...

383
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:35,820
What?

384
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,780
Who is the murderer?

385
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,220
Chi Yan!

386
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,620
Chi Yan, who is the murderer?

387
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:45,660
Chi Yan, I

388
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,700
I don't understand.

389
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,860
Who is the real murderer?

390
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:51,620
What's the fun of reading

391
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,580
if you already know who is the murderer?

392
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,090
Nope, I can't wait any longer.

393
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,220
The murderer is the sister of Xu Tingyu.

394
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,020
Why?

395
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,010
There are three matchboxes, right?

396
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,820
Xu Tingyu's sister borrowed one.

397
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,380
If she did borrow the box from the reception,

398
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,900
then the box must be dry.

399
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,900
But after investigation, we notice

400
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,060
that one of the boxes was wet.

401
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:17,090
Why is that?

402
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,260
Why is that?

403
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,780
The humidifier.

404
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,620
Xu Tingyu's sister used the humidifier.

405
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,650
That's why the box that she borrowed was wet.

406
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,100
That's how the police

407
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,140
know for sure

408
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,860
that Xu Tingyu's sister was the murderer.

409
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,860
As for why did Xu Tingyu's sister

410
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,860
killed her,

411
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,130
you'll have to keep reading to find out.

412
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,940
How come I didn't think of that?

413
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,610
That's very impressive!

414
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:44,580
Let me see what's next.

The Bully in the Alley: The Scarlet Book

416

Yan Yi?

417
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,060
Who is Yan Yi?

418
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:55,780
It's me.

419
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,620
But your name is Chi Yan.

420
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,660
Why do you call yourself Yan Yi?

421
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,500
It's my pet name.

422
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,580
Why don't you use Chi Yan as your pet name?

423
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,820
I share this pen name with others.

424
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,340
But you wrote this on your own,

425
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,940
why would you share a pen name with others?

426
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,220
So many questions.

427
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,780
I needed someone to work with me.

428
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,660
Books need advertising.

429
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,250
I don't like it,

430
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,300
nor am I any good at it.

431
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,300
So, I need to share this pen name.

432
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,500
I don't quite understand.

433
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,410
You are the one

434
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:29,170
who wrote this entire book.

435
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,460
He didn't do anything,

436
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,420
and he gets to share this pen name with you.

437
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,020
To me,

438
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,700
it feels like he is stealing from you.

439
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,770
That's not stealing.

440
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,780
Without advertising,

441
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,340
few would know about this book.

442
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:42,490
It doesn't make any sense

443
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,900
to write a book without readers.

444
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,340
So,

445
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,970
more readers, more money?

446
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,460
But

447
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,180
other bookstores earn profits.

448
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:59,580
We seem to be losing money.

449
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,780
Should we just close the store for some time

450
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,260
and just...

451
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:02,780
No.

452
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:04,980
The store is important to me.

453
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,540
I will never give up the store!

454
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:10,900
It's time to go to work.

455
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,900
Why don't you read more outside

456
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,220
and try to find out why Xu Tingyu's sister

457
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,170
tried to kill Xu Tingyu?

458
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,890
"I will never give up the store!"

459
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,500
That's the first time that he talked about

460
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,540
something he wants.

461
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,500
As long as we can earn money.

462
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,180
This is called money.

463
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:37,060
Human beings use this

464
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,050
to reward those who work.

465
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:42,100
You can use money in exchange for food.

466
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,300
I sincerely pray to you

467
00:32:58,090 --> 00:32:59,850
that I, Chi Yan,

468
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:04,420
will make loads of money.

469
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:14,370
As long as we can earn money.

470
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:15,620
This must be Chi Yan's desire.

471
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,530
But how to earn money?

472
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,980

520
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:13,700
Kitten.

521
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,290
So cute.

522
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:16,580
Stop petting me! Just pay for the books.

523
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,580
I'm about to transform!

524
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,170
105?

525
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,130
45, 30...

526
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,100
It really is 105.

527
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,300
Human beings over exaggerate about everything,

528
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,380
stupid!

529
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:37,340
Never mind.

530
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:39,260
I'll just take the money.

531
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,250
The money is innocent.

532
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,100
God!

533
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:49,580
Guys, guys!

534
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,460
Big news!

535
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:54,860
Kitten.

536
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,980
Kitten, come back!

537
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,940
How come you didn't make any sound when you walk?

538
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:06,650
What's your name?

539
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:09,980
None of your business.

540
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,220
Your name?

541
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,460
Why do you care?

542
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,780
Let me ask you, what's your name?

543
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:22,460
I'm Lin Mo.

544
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:23,980
What's your name?

545
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:26,860
Where do you live?

546
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,090
You are not a native, aren't you?

547
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,500
Too many questions.

548
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,100
I only came here to do the laundry.

549
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,340
Where are you from?

550
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,130
It's none of your business!

551
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,500
One more question and I will scratch you!

552
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:39,300
Scratch?

553
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,500
Why do you use "scratch"?

554
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:42,900
Scratch.

555
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,460
Problems? Scratch!

556
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:56,980
My apologies,

557
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,250
I mistook you for someone else.

558
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,300
Weirdo.

559
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:22,740
It's for you.

560
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,660
I don't have any money.

561
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,380
For free.

562
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:28,780
Really?

563
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,900
Did you spend all your allowance?

564
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,780
I also did that last week.

565
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,300
I only bought one dress for my barbie

566
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,540
and that was it.

567
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,300
I didn't.

568
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,410
I didn't buy anything,

569
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,140
I rent this one.

570
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:51,300
Rent?

571
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,810
Do you mean this one?

572
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:54,900
Yep.

573
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:58,650
I was trying to bring more customers to the bookstore

574
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,900
and I ended up bring none.

575
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,780
Are you talking about Chi's Bookstore?

576
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,180
That's the one.

577
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:06,660
I live there.

578
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:07,700
I'm Xiao Xiu.

579
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,020
I'm Yuanzi.

580
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,170
I know the owner of that bookstore.

581
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,740
He is a big brother.

582
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,540
He is very nice.

583
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,860
He feeds those stray cats every day.

584
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,220
He feeds stray cats?

585
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,500
Here he comes!

586
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:30,700
How dare you!

587
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,940
Feed other cats behind my back!

588
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:34,780
What?

589
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:37,260
That's disloyal!

590
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,980
Do you even know what "disloyal" means?

591
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:39,980
Sure I do!

592
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,740
You already have a cat at home

593
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:42,700
and still, you feed other cats!

594
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,090
That's disloyal!

595
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:45,180
Fine,

596
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,380
from now on, I will feed you as well.

597
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,020
I have nothing to hide,

598
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,260
and I will feed all of you.

599
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:55,740
Done?

600
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:57,260
Let's go.

601
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:57,850
Hold on!

602
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,020
Put out your hand.

603
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,850
I'll allow you to pet my head

604
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:10,540
because of the fish you bought me.

605
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:12,580
Childish.

606
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,300
let's go.

607
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:16,700
What's childish about that?

608
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:20,020
I even let you pet my head

609
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:20,940
and you already...

610
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:24,460
Aren't you gonna wait for me?

611
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,260
This is it?

612
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:27,980
We would like to buy some books!

613
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:28,500
Open the store!

614
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,340
I want some books!

615
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,780
Someone open the store!

616
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,840
[Chi's Bookstore]

617
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,930
Open the store!

618
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,620
Wrong bookstore!

619
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:47,660
This is it!

620
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:48,460
What's that?

621
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:50,890
This is not the bookstore you're looking for!

622
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:51,940
This is the one!

623
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:52,580
Open the door!

624
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:53,820
We want to buy books!

625
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:00,980
Open the door!

626
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,060
The door's open! It's open!

627
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,060
Come on! Let's go!

628
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,580
Where's the cat? Where is it?

629
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:31,540
Where's the kitten?

630
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:32,490
Where's the kitten?

631
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:33,220
Where's that cat?

632
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:34,660
The kitten, where is it?

633
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:35,300
Where's the kitten?

634
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,260
Where's the cat, where?

635
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:37,540
The kitten, where is it?

636
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,180
Where's that kitten?

637
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:41,140
Can we have your kitten as the cashier?

638
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:42,700
Where's that kitten of yours?

639
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:43,620
Calm down, calm down.

640
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:46,860
What kitten?
