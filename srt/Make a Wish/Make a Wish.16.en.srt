00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:50,780
Today,

5
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,860
Mingka, one of our brave police dogs

6
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,700
will officially retire.

7
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,140
For the past ten years,

8
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,780
it's been with the drug enforcement team,

9
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,660
fought many battles,

10
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,090
and made profound contributions.

11
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:02,900
It's been a great company

12
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,340
and a great partner to fight with.

13
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,260
Why are you here?

14
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,540
I am here for Mingka's retirement ceremony.

15
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,180
How about you?

16
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,100
I am about to do an interview for the TV station.

17
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,740
They asked me to come here

18
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,100
and learn about police dogs.

19
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,090
What a coincidence.

20
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,620
I've treated Mingka before.

21
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,380
You have probably heard of it.

22
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,820
Turns out we have a connection in this regard.

23
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,140
Actually I've found someone

24
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,140
to adopt Mingka.

25
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,860
A vet at our hospital.

26
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,579
It's old

27
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,860
and had many injuries.

28
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,780
It would be really difficult for it

29
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,490
to find an adopter if it's put in the rescue center.

30
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,690
And it was with the drug enforcement.

31
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,180
That means its lifestyle

32
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,579
is totally different from other dogs'.

33
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,940
People without any training

34
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,180
are not optimal choices.

35
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,180
But this one is a vet at our hospital.

36
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,300
A suitable adopter.

37
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,060
It will be taken away tomorrow.

38
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,220
Are you free after this?

39
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:14,980
Let's have lunch together.

40
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,540
Alright. Why not?

41
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:19,779
I'll treat.

42
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,380
Here. There you are.

43
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,780
Careful. It's hot.

44
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,580
Thank you.

45
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,140
Thank you.

46
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:37,780
You burned?

47
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,900
Hello, may I have an ice bag?

48
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,650
Could you please get me one?

49
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:43,260
Thank you.

50
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,220
I'm good. There's no need.

51
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:55,780
Does it hurt?

52
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,420
No.

53
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,570
Just be careful.

54
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,300
You are a vet.

55
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,250
Put something on when you get home.

56
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,060
It's getting red.

57
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,980
None of us is driving today.

58
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,250
How about

59
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,660
ordering the Orange Bomb?

60
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,300
Alright.

61
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,820
You know what?

62
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,580
Before I met you,

63
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,130
I don't know what kind of girl I am into.

64
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,300
After I met you,

65
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,300
I finally realized that

66
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,380
you are the one I am looking for.

67
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,659
What do you like about me?

68
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,620
You climb trees.

69
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,610
You can jump from high places

70
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,420
and be all fine.

71
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,380
You have a keen sense of smell.

72
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,620
You can smell Mr. Fu

73
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,020
one mile away.

74
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,540
You stand up for the weak.

75
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,900
No one can hide anything

76
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,420
in front of you.

77
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,740
You are

78
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,140
a little white cat.

79
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,820
A little white cat.

80
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,220
If I were born in ancient times,

81
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,460
I would be the emperor.

82
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,900
What's good about that?

83
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,970
Being an emperor is awesome.

84
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,540
They have more than 3000 concubines.

85
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:51,659
Your Majesty,

86
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:54,980
can I be one of your concubines?

87
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,020
Let me have a look at you.

88
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,660
I can't see you clearly.

89
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,260
One, two, three,

90
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,500
four, five.

91
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,730
Why are there so many flowers?

92
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,620
There are a lot of them indeed.

93
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,250
I hate roses.

94
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,740
Red and green.

95
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,020
Tacky.

96
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,780
I will throw them away.

97
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:23,860
Good.

98
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,780
Now I feel better.

99
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:26,780
Thank you.

100
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:27,900
Thank you.

101
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,970
Cheers.

102
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,980
Xu Zihao!

103
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,460
Qin Mingming, you know what?

104
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,890
I've thought it through.

105
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,460
I was about to give up.

106
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,860
If you want to stay friends,

107
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,659
I can make that happen.

108
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,900
Who wants to be your friend?

109
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,220
Make friends with Bulb.

110
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:48,900
Good.

111
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:51,620
There is a bulb here.

112
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,659
Hey, bulb,

113
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,980
I want to be your friend.

114
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,659
You...you are my bro.

115
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:00,660
Call him bro.

116
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,860
I am your bro.

117
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,010
Sorry, sir.

118
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,020
-Bro.
-Please be careful.

119
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,380
Don't stop him. He's making friends.

120
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,580
I am making friends.

121
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,700
We are about to close.

122
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,420
We...

123
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,660
We go somewhere else.

124
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:15,940
Yes, somewhere else.

125
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:16,650
Let's go.

126
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,460
We will find somewhere else. Sorry.

127
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,100
Somewhere else.

128
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,020
Let's go, Mingming.

129
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,020
Let's go.

130
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,940
Let's go. Go.

131
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,980
Let's make more friends.

132
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:55,460
No! No! No!

133
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,130
You liar!

134
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:08,860
Mingming.

135
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,010
Don't speak.

136
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:11,660
I...

137
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:12,820
I didn't...I

138
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,860
"You need to make yourself dinner tonight.

139
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,210
I will come back later."

140
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,260
Sister,

141
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,500
I didn't expect that by "later",

142
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,740
you mean the next morning.

143
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,890
We had a dinner party.

144
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:57,740
I got drunk.

145
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,780
So I stayed at a female colleague's place.

146
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,260
Stop that.

147
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,540
What's that for?

148
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,250
Have you walked the dog?

149
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,620
I will go take a shower.

150
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,610
I did get drunk last night.

151
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,620
But I remember clearly that

152
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,220
we walked out of the bar together.

153
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,820
Mingming threw me a kiss.

154
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,820
Can you imagine that?

155
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,580
She threw me a kiss.

156
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,460
With a smile.

157
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,060
My heart melted.

158
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:39,020
It's nice when two people get together.

159
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,420
But how did we end up

160
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,980
in my place?

161
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,580
It was hard for her to walk with those shoes on.

162
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,660
I had to support her.

163
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,070
Did I hold her waist?

164
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,220
It would be better

165
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,730
if he's not here messing around.

166
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,780
I swear.

167
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,620
I didn't mean to take advantage of her.

168
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:02,620
And I didn't.

169
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,100
You...you.

170
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,130
Follow me.

171
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,140
Where?

172
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,060
Just follow me.

173
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:06,700
Go.

174
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,540
What should I do?

175
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,580
Go to bed?

176
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,780

00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:19,380
Good.

348
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:19,940
Twist.

349
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:20,500
Twist.

350
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,380
Twist.

351
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,580
You made it. Come on.

352
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,100
Careful.

353
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,140
Good. Good.

354
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:27,540
Take a turn.

355
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,900
Good. Good.

356
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,450
Good. Twist.

357
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,540
Twist. Twist.

358
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,210
Take a turn.

359
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:33,340
Take a turn.

360
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,410
Good. Good.

361
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,170
You made it.

362
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:36,860
Go on. Go on.

363
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:41,860
Slower.

364
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:42,940
Go on. Go on.

365
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:44,530
Here.

366
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:46,980
Here.

367
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:47,540
Careful.

368
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,300
Careful.

369
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,580
It's not as exciting as I thought it would be.

370
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,890
Not exciting?

371
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,740
No, this place is too small.

372
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,460
How about this?

373
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,820
Let's go to the street.

374
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:00,930
Alright. Are you ready?

375
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:03,450
Three, two, one, go!

376
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,420
I am.

377
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:04,890
You...

378
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,140
Just go.

379
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,020
Alright. Go.

380
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:16,380
Why is the water shining?

381
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,500
Those are jellyfish.

382
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,820
There is a substance inside them

383
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,420
that can react with seawater.

384
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:25,980
That's why it's shining.

385
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,140
Jellyfish?

386
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,940
Why haven't I seen them before?

387
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,380
The shining ones?

388
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,780
You fool.

389
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,660
There are not everywhere to be found.

390
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,180
I found this place

391
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,260
when I was at university.

392
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,140
I came here to clear my mind.

393
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,580
Want to play with the jellyfish?

394
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,420
We might scare them.

395
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,300
Thank you

396
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,810
for giving me that motorbike

397
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,700
and showing me this amazing view.

398
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,140
It's mesmerizing.

399
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,340
Team Two attacking Team One.

400
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,580
Hide yourself.

401
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:15,660
An ambush ahead.

402
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:20,740
Don't reveal yourself.

403
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:32,180
Follow me.

404
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,820
Just go. No one's inside.

405
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:46,530
Lower yourself.

406
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,580
Two, twelve o'clock.

407
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:51,180
Twelve o'clock.

408
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,100
Careful, Mingming.

409
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,340
So cool.

410
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:31,700
Up.

411
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:35,980
Here. Cheers.

412
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:36,860
Cheers. Cheers.

413
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,130
What a great day. Cheers.

414
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:38,890
Cheers.

415
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:39,770
Cheers. Cheers.

416
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,060
Here. Here.

417
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,260
Xu, have a seat.

418
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,300
I watch Mingming growing up.

419
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,860
Be nice to her.

420
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,450
Or you will have me to answer to.

421
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:52,180
You hear me?

422
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,020
Yes, I will.

423
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,020
I will treat her well.

424
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:55,820
I got your back.

425
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:56,860
Enough. Enough.

426
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,100
He can't drink that much.

427
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,620
You can just call me Hao.

428
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,340
Hao. Hao.

429
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,140
Hao.

430
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,420
We always see Mingming as our sister.

431
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,780
We are really happy that

432
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,780
she's got a boyfriend.

433
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,540
Cheers.

434
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,340
Cheers.

435
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:08,580
That's enough.

436
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,140
I'm good. All good.

437
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:09,620
Stop.

438
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,900
I will drink for him.

439
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,180
You are already defending him.

440
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:13,740
Right.

441
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:14,500
Just sit down.

442
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,020
I...

443
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,140
It's alright. Don't mind her.

444
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:17,780
Bro, let's keep drinking.

445
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,140
Good.

446
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:18,900
Here. Mingming.

447
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,140
Cheers.

448
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:23,300
Mingming.

449
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:26,700
I'm fine.

450
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,300
Why did you get him here?

451
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,170
The password.

452
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:32,340
He got it wrong and then the door was locked.

453
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,370
We went to his place first.

454
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,300
Just listen to me.

455
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,300
Alright. Stop.

456
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,140
Fine. I am telling you.

457
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,180
Mingming, I am telling you.

458
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:39,740
I want to tell you something.

459
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,460
Stop. I want to tell you something.

460
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,100
I...

461
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,500
I am telling you.

462
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,140
I...

463
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,620
He's about to throw up.

464
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,170
To the bathroom!

465
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:02,020
Gosh.

466
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:02,620
You feeling better?

467
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,500
I'm fine.

468
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:04,860
Alright. You're fine.

469
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,050
Just wash your face.

470
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,220
Careful.

471
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:11,860
Careful.

472
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,140
Here. Here.

473
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,500
Careful. Sit.

474
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,420
No. No.

475
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,490
Careful.

476
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:19,690
Get out.

477
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:20,890
Don't stay there.

478
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,580
What a man.

479
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,340
Seems that he's sleeping here tonight.

480
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,930
Xu Zihao, you can't stay here for the night.

481
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,250
Get out.

482
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,860
If no one gets drunk,

483
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:38,940
the streets will feel lonely.

484
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:39,380
Let's see

485
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,930
if I will throw you out on the street.

486
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,380
Let's sleep together.

487
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,100
No. Get out.

488
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,860
Let's sleep together.

489
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:47,970
Sleep together.

490
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,780
Careful. Careful.

491
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:50,980
Bro. Bro.

492
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:51,540
Let go.

493
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,300
Let go.

494
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:53,020
You...you...

495
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,220
You deserve this.

496
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:54,980
Sis, sis.

497
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,740
Let me out.

498
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:56,460
Sis.

499
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,140
Sis. Mingming.

500
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:58,900
Stop that.

501
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:04,660
Sis,

502
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,700
do people born after 1990

503
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,500
get so crazy after they get drunk?

504
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,340
Just go to bed.

505
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,220
Are you sure you are fine?

506
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:14,930
I'm good.

507
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,500
Mingming. Mingming.

508
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,300
What?

509
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,180
I really...

510
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:25,860
I really really like you.

511
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,060
I know.

512
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,010
Can you just get out of it?

513
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:29,860
Please.

514
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,740
I am telling you a secret.

515
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,170
What secret?

516
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:36,900
You...

517
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:43,410
There are five things I like about you?

518
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,490
Which five.

519
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:48,940
Pretty.

520
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:51,890
Generous.

521
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:54,530
Clever.

522
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,020
Kind.

523
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,540
And the most important one.

524
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:04,740
What?

525
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,850
Come closer.

526
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,740
Well,

527
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,340
you are willing to love me.

528
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:23,410
Hello.

529
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,950
I am BossNo. 357

530
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:27,730
Fu.

531
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,330
Let's do it their way.

532
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,420
Oh,

533
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,060
don't speak the cat language here.

534
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,260
You look familiar.

535
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:43,220
I was here two decades ago.

536
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,010
You picked me up.

537
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,380
Long time no see.

538
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:48,410
Long time no see.

539
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:52,300
You are the last visitor tonight.

540
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,210
Your clothes look so funny.

541
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,620
How do I look?

542
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,100
Good?

543
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,900
I bought the latest version of

544
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,100
Travel Guide to Earth.

545
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,010
It says that

546
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,180
these are really popular now.

547
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,180
So I ordered two sets.

548
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:10,660
Since I am here,

549
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,140
I'll try to blend in.

550
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,610
Are you sure it is the latest version?

551
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:17,780
I don't think it's the right era.

552
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,260
It's not?

553
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,580
That store owner lied to me.

554
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,660
What is trending now then?

555
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,690
We can talk about it later.

556
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:28,980
Let me finish the routine check.

557
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,410
What's your name?

558
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,420
Happy.

559
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,700
My name is Happy!

560
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,690
Why are you here?

561
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:39,940
To find my daughter.

562
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,740
What's her name?

563
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,380
Meowmeow.

564
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,100
Xiao Xiu?

565
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,100
What a coincidence.

566
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,130
You know my daughter?

567
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:52,660
That's great.

568
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,770
Please take me to her.

569
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:55,700
Don't rush.

570
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,820
Let me check your box.

571
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,580
Open it.

572
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,180
Look. The guide.

573
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,500
A terrible guide!

574
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,520
[Travel Guide to Earth]

575
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,620
What is this?

576
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,380
I'm afraid that I may not like the food here.

577
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,210
That's why I brought these delicacies.

578
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:17,650
Have some.

579
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,060
Just have some.

580
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:20,170
It's been 20 years.

581
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:22,020
The food here is amazing.

582
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,220
Really?

583
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:26,620
These are really tall.

584
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:28,700
The color changes.

585
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:36,660
What is this?

586
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:37,660
It smells so good.

587
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,500
It's a kind of fruit. Durian.

588
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:41,300
It's really special.

589
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,340
Would you like some?

590
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:43,060
I can buy some for you.

591
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:43,580
Please do.

592
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:44,540
You treat.

593
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:44,980
Let's go.

594
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,860
Don't you need to pay

595
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,180
for them?

596
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,420
This is called e-payment.

597
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,860
You only need to scan this

598
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,300
and the transaction is finished.

599
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,820
There have been so many changes here.

600
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:02,650
Right.

601
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:05,020
The world is changing every day.

602
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:06,730
It smells so good.

603
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,460
What is this?

604
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,900
It also smells good.

605
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:11,890
It's stinky tofu.

606
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,020
Stinky tofu?

607
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,020
It's not stinky.

608
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:18,100
Please buy me some.

609
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,020
And you said you may not like the food here.

610
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:27,410
I was always in a rush.

611
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:28,500
Didn't have time for food.

612
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,780
It smells so good.

613
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:37,940
Please,

614
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:38,500
I would like some.

615
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:40,900
You are so kind.

616
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,380
Does my daughter like this?

617
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,660
Should we get her some?

618
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:47,820
I don't think so.

619
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,610
You still remember you've got a daughter, right?

620
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,180
Go. Let's go.

621
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,180
I want to see her immediately.

622
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:55,540
Go. Let's go.

623
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:56,660
We don't want it anymore.

624
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,100
We don't want it.

625
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:57,620
See you later.

626
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,180
Did you have fun?

627
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:54,770
I can't

628
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:56,090
blow dry your hair this way.

629
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:57,530
Do this side then.

630
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:41,530
Dad?

631
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,010
Dad, what happened?

632
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,210
My dear,

633
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,139
you look prettier now.

634
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,659
Why are you here?

635
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,980
I am taking you back to our planet.

636
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,500
Why would you take me home now?

637
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,140
Anything happened?

638
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,170
Is Mom...

639
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:09,370
Is Mom with you?

640
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:09,860
Mom.

641
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:10,420
Mom.

642
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,420
Your mom's busy with her career.

643
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,060
I wouldn't have come here

644
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,940
if I hadn't heard that

645
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,180
you are with a human being.

646
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,980
What's wrong with that?

647
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,340
His name is Chi Yan.

648
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,180
I really like him.

649
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:21,900
You are too young

650
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,130
to know what it means.

651
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,940
Of course I know what it means.

652
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,580
I am not a kitty anymore.

653
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,410
I know.

654
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,170
Dear,

655
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,660
cats and human beings are different.

656
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,810
We can't be together.

657
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:33,570
Things won't end well

658
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:34,980
if you stay together.

659
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,020
Easy.

660
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,380
But Dad, you've

661
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:40,900
told me

662
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:42,380
that life is short

663
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,370
and we should do whatever we want

664
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:44,810
and meet those we want to meet

665
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:45,940
and live without regrets.

666
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:46,660
You've said that, right?

667
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,180
Right.

668
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,180
This is what I am doing. Live with no regrets.

669
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:49,900
I like him.

670
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,660
I really like him.

671
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,850
-I want to see him every day.
-But...

672
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,380
I want to share with him the most trivial things.

673
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,900
I am happy as long as I can see him.

674
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,660
What about Mom and Dad?

675
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,180
What about your friends back home?

676
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,180
I will still visit you.

677
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,660
I can't leave now anyway.

678
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,460
Chi Yan saved me.

679
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,460
I haven't returned the favor.

680
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,460
What?

681
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:10,180
Is this real?

682
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,180
Look. You can't take it off.

683
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,940
It's true. I can't take it off.

684
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,860
I can't leave.

685
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:22,420
Xiao Xiu.

686
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,140
Chi Yan.

687
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,580
He's calling me.

688
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,780
Let me introduce him to you.

689
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,300
Fine.

690
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:30,660
Xiao Xiu.

691
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:32,500
Xiao Xiu.

692
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,580
Why did you jump out of the window again?

693
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,340
Careful.

694
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:41,660
Hey, stop!

695
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:42,940
What are you doing?

696
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:44,060
Is this your place?

697
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:44,860
He's my dad.

698
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:46,940
You.

699
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,660
Tell us what your wish is.

700
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,100
He doesn't have one now.

701
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,100
I've told you.

702
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:52,780
Then let's go home.

703
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:53,860
Come back when he's got one.

704
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,660
I have already settled down here.

705
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,420
You...

706
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,140
It's pretty late now.

707
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,580
We can't go anywhere.

708
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,010
I have to return his favor.

709
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:06,860
He saved me.

710
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,740
We are showcasing our good qualities.

711
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,340
Right?

712
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,140
If we go out right now,

713
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,170
we can only sleep on the street.

714
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:16,940
Uncle,

715
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:21,940
why not

716
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:24,100
just stay here?

717
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,010
It's not as good as

718
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:30,900
our home.

719
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,090
It's also

720
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,580
rather small.

721
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,610
I guess I can bear with it.

722
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:37,900
How do we share rooms tonight?

723
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:43,020
What do you have in mind?

724
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,690
Hao, you awake?

725
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:35,740
Quiet.

726
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,340
Is she awake?

727
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:41,460
She's been taking care of you the entire night.

728
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,620
She's exhausted.

729
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:45,020
Liangliang,

730
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,300
please help me.

731
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:48,980
After she wakes up,

732
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,610
see how she is doing

733
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,620
or whether she's mad at me.

734
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,380
I need to leave now.

735
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,460
Hao, you are leaving already?

736
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,700
Xu Zihao,

737
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:08,540
you can't escape this time.

738
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,530
You can't escape.

739
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:17,260
Bro,

740
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:18,940
you need to back me up.

741
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,100
Liangliang, fetch me an egg.

742
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,250
Quick.

743
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:29,450
Alright.

744
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:32,740
Starch.

745
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:36,380
Here.

746
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,140
Pour some.

747
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,690
Stop when I tell you to.

748
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,260
More. More.

749
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,060
Alright. Stop.

750
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:47,740
What are you doing?

751
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,580
Have a seat.

752
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,540
It will be ready soon.

753
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:14,500
Is it good?

754
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:15,420
Not bad.

755
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,420
Mingming,

756
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,330
we've known each other for quite some time.

757
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:28,940
You should be aware that

758
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:32,300
I talk nonsense when I am drunk.

759
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,180
It didn't count.

760
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,060
For quite some time?

761
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,420
It hasn't been long

762
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,850
since you agreed to

763
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,420
be with me,

764
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,490
but I've been in love with you

765
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:47,020
for a really long time.

766
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,540
Liangliang, go back to your room.

767
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,210
He...

768
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:52,460
He was here last night.

769
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,660
He needs to hear this too.

770
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:58,860
What exactly did I say last night?

771
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:00,980
Didn't you just say that

772
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,860
it didn't count?

773
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:04,940
Of course it didn't.

774
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,220
You only need to trust

775
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,220
the sensible, polite,

776
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:09,860
and normal version of me.

777
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,660
That's the real me.

778
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:15,140
I think the normal version

779
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:16,900
is pretty annoying.

780
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:24,420
Just think about it yourself.

781
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,420
You are so helpless.

782
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,260
Up.

783
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,020
Up.

784
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:15,620
What happened?

785
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:16,060
Wait.

786
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:17,780
What happened?

787
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:19,140
Weren't you

788
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:20,940
staying in your room last night?

789
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:23,700
Did he seduce you?

790
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:25,580
He didn't.

791
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:26,340
He doesn't seduce me.

792
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,580
I seduce him.

793
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:28,620
How can you be so proud?

794
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:29,940
I can't stand all the hugging.

795
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:30,820
I am not proud.

796
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:31,980
Listen.

797
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:34,340
You can't stay close to her

798
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,730
without my permission.

799
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:37,980
You hear me?

800
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:42,620
I will make you some breakfast.

801
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:45,180
I'll go with you.

802
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:51,940
Up. Up. Up.

803
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:55,740
Dad.

804
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:57,460
What?

805
00:43:58,380 --> 00:43:59,170
What?

806
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:00,980
You used to love sitting next to me.

807
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:01,780
Time for breakfast.

808
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,060
Now you don't like me anymore.

809
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:05,940
Let me ask you this.

810
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:06,900
If one day,

811
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,500
Chi Yan and I fall into the water,

812
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,290
who will you save first?

813
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:11,460
Why would you two

814
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,180
fall into the water on the same day?

815
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:13,940
It doesn't matter.

816
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,180
Who will you save first?

817
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:20,850
You.

818
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:23,050
He can swim.

819
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:23,930
He's a good swimmer.

820
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:25,100
He can even save you.

821
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:25,860
I can't.

822
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,420
How about you teaching me how to swim?

823
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:29,460
Let's pick a time.

824
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:30,620
Find somewhere nice.

825
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:32,170
Back to the topic.

826
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:33,420
You are off-track.

827
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,100
You are not going to have it, right?

828
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:39,890
Help yourself.

829
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:41,210
Chi...

830
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:42,700
Chi Yan, right?

831
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:45,980
Chi Yan,

832
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:47,900
let me ask you again.

833
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:50,140
What exactly is your wish?

834
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:53,780
What do you want?

835
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:54,340
What do you crave?

836
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:55,060
Anything will do.

837
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:57,260
Didn't I tell you last night?

838
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:58,540
He doesn't have one.

839
00:44:58,540 --> 00:44:59,420
Why would he not have one?

840
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,780
Money, status, dreams.

841
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:01,700
One of those things.

842
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:07,170
He didn't tell us because he wants to trap you here.

843
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:08,100
How evil.

844
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:13,380
He...

845
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:14,060
Sir,

846
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:18,140
I am really pleased about my life now.

847
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,050
I mean it.

848
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,180
That's why I don't have a wish right now.

849
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:25,260
If I have to name one,

850
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:28,780
that would be

851
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:29,820
to be with Xiao Xiu forever.

852
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:30,700
No. No. No.

853
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:34,130
Dad.

854
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,300
You can have both.

855
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:38,940
What did I tell you last night?

856
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:40,700
Cats and human beings can't be together.

857
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,250
You make a wish.

858
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:44,020
You return his favor.

859
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:45,300
Then it all ends.

860
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:46,100
Alright.
