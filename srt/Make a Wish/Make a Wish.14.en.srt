Congratulations on Xiao Xiu's safe return!

5
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:01,140
Thank you.

6
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:01,700
And you.

Get yourself a girlfriend!

Where is your car?

10
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,810
So am I just a handy

11
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,250
tool-man for you?

12
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:09,820
You two get together.

13
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,860
Shouldn't I take the credit?

14
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,260
What credit?

15
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,020
If it weren't for you,

16
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,940
maybe we would've been dating long ago.

17
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,300
I'm just happy that

18

you came home safely.

Go.

Uncle Fu, how about dinner at our home?

22
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:23,900
Sure.

23
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,140
I can't remember clearly.

I didn't know how,

25
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:29,020
but I just got there.

26
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,060
Then I arrived at a bus stop.

27
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:32,450
And?

28
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,940
And I missed the last bus.

29
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,460
Missed the last bus...

-And then you called me.

Yeah, then my phone is dead.

Who?

46
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,370
This name is so similar to yours.

47
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,340
Xu Zihao's sister.

48

She was on a study tour in the US.

49
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,260
That's not a sister.

50

That's an ancestor!

Where are you going?

You said that

66
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,730
you saw cages, instruments,

67
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,659
and cats in the warehouse.

68
00:04:57,659 --> 00:04:58,140
Yes.

The place where the stray cats disappeared

70
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,060
is very close to the place where you were caught.

71

Is there any way?

73
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,220
We have to catch him as soon as possible.

A lawyer.

91
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:58,450

And since you said it's dangerous,

97
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,610
we must do it quietly.

waiting for you.

114
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,850
Why is the good-looking boy here?

115
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:17,660
Were you okay last night?

I heard you came back safely,

Wait a minute.

121
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,300
Did you spend all night
 looking for me yesterday too?

122
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,250
Of course.

123
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,290
You left while we were having dinner.

124
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:36,290
I chased after you

125
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,810
but saw your jacket on the ground.

126
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:38,930
Isn't that terrifying?

127
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,500
I am allergic to alcohol.

128
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:45,570
I forgot to tell you.

129
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,850
I got a headache yesterday.

130
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:50,050
My head hurt so bad.

131
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,690
So I went out to relieve my headache.

132
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:52,420
That was my plan.

133
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,250
But once I got out,

134
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,420
I fainted.

135
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,290
But you just took a sip.

136
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:00,650
A sip?

137
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,050
Yeah.

138
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,690
I just took a sip, and I got a severe headache.

139
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,380
I'm so allergic to alcohol.

140
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,010
I think,

141
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,140
I can never drink alcohol in my life.

142
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,610
So you fainted,

143
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,860
and then were taken away.

144
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:18,770
When I woke up,

145
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,850
I was on that

146
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,450
island.

147
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,290
Chi Yan took you home?

148
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:26,690
He looked for me all night.

149
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:27,930
Then he went to the island

150
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:28,930
to pick me up.

151
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,380
So you...

152
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,220
He finally accepted me.

153
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,490
You are his girlfriend now?

154
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:46,850
I am so happy

155
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,490
that I might fly into the sky.

156
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,540
I can't tell you how happy I am.

157
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,250
What's wrong?

158
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:02,370
Nothing.

159
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:03,250
Let's go to work.

160
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:04,370
Sure.

161
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,500
We're about to be late.

162
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:06,610
See ya, Yuanzi.

163
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:20,690
Miss Xiao Xiu.

164
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,570
Please don't do that.

165
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:24,850
Why are you here?

166
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:26,770
It's not easy to find you.

167
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,810
Didn't we make an appointment at six?

168
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,050
You're early.

169
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,370
It's not my working time.

170
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:35,330
It's okay. I can wait for you.

171
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:45,970
What are you reading?

172
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:46,730
Why is it taking so long?

What do you read that for?

You want to be a florist?

175
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,810
In order to approach my crush faster,

176
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,210
I have to be more theoretically prepared.

00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,770
Whatever He Meng likes,

178
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,010
I will study that.

179
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:09,770
Speaking the same language

180
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:12,250
is the foundation of an intimate relationship.

181
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,770
Theoretically.

182
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,010
What about practically?

183
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,290
Have you spoken to Mengmeng?

184
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,490
Have you been to the florist?

185
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,770
Do you know where the florist is?

186
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,530
Reading. Huh.

187
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,170
I... I.

188
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,250
How can I fight an unprepared battle?

189
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:30,970
When I finish my research,

190
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,530
I will practice.

191
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:34,840
Okay. Actually, I'm here

192
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,490
because I want to ask you a favor.

193
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,130
Miss Xiao Xiu.

194
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:39,730
I told you.

195
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,760
Now is not my working time.

196
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,570
It has something to do with your crush.

197
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:47,570
Speak.

198
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:49,890
Good.

199
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:50,890
Some time ago,

200
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,050
Mengmeng's tabby cat got lost.

201
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:53,930
We've found it.

202
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:54,760
Relax.

203
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:55,970
But bad things have happened

204
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,370
in our neighborhood recently.

205
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:58,970
Someone's stealing stray cats,

206
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,770
and poisoning them.

207
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,170
We are all scared,

208
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,690
Especially Mengmeng.

209
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,690
I am worried about her.

210
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,490
Find the culprit

211
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,330
in this thing.

212
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,720
Will you do me the favor?

213
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:11,370
Yes!

214
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,770
Tell me immediately if you have any clues.

215
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:13,970
I'm the best at finding people.

216
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:16,810
I've got some clues,

217
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:17,690
but not many.

218
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,330
First of all, it's a man.

219
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,410
He has a warehouse in the suburbs.

220
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,010
He secretly takes pictures of stray cats.

221
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,570
He usually puts sleeping pills in the cat food

222
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:29,410
of stray cats.

223
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,130
That's all.

224
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:33,770
That's it?

225
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:35,610
It's almost nothing.

226
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:36,970
If I have so many clues,

227
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:37,970
I won't need you.

228
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,530
That's right.

229
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,010
Let me think.

230
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:43,840
In this case,

231
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,490
we have to break through the SM.

232
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:48,680
What?

233
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:50,690
SM is short for social media.

234
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:51,850
Well.

235
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:54,250
There are many animal abusers

236
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,250
who have a hidden forum

237
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,890
or community

238
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,090
on the Internet.

239
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,240
They exchange their experiences there

240
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:01,610
and show off what they've done.

241
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,400
If we find these forums,

242
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,040
maybe

243
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,970
there will be many clues.

244
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:11,770
OK.

245
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,250
I'll trust you on this.

246
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,730
Whether you can fulfill her wish

247
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:16,730
is up to you.

248
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,160
I can do it.

249
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,920
You make her rest assured.

250
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,450
Alright.

251
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:21,210
I know.

252
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,090
One more thing.

253
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,090
The one I asked you before.

254
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:25,050
Which one?

255
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,450
Chi Yan's wish.

256
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:31,480
Are you kidding me?

257
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,130
Your mind

258
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,450
is really taken by your crush.

259
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,810
How could it be? I remember.

260
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,970
I'll do both things together.

261
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:39,170
OK?

262
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,210
Don't worry about that.

263
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,360
I'm not in a hurry about this now.

264
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,730
Why are women so fickle?

265
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:49,850
What?

266
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:52,160
Nothing.

267
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:54,480
Hi.

268
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,290
What are you watching?

269
00:12:58,810 --> 00:12:59,760
Do you know Zhang Yi?

270
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,080
I like his books.

271
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,960
But I couldn't go to his new book launch,

272
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,810
so I'm watching the video posted by fans.

273
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,560
Wai... Wait a second.

274
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:14,330
The drink was not for Zhang Yi that day.

275
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,770
It was for me.

276
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,090
It's just that Zhang Yi

277
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,250
got it before me.

278
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:29,480
So that drink was deliberately left for Chi Yan.

279
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,210
What did you say?

280
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,440
Here.

281
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,440
I should go.

282
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,520
Where are you going?

283
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,130
Why there are two policemen in the lobby?

284
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,210
They seem to be here for the book-signing event.

285
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,200
Then what are they doing here?

286
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,080
No idea.

287
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:49,890
Excuse me.

288
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,480
Is there someone named Lin Mo working here?

289
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:52,360
Yes.

290
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:53,730
Where is he?

291
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,290
He was here a moment ago.

292
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,610
Maybe in the kitchen.

293
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:58,610
Should I get him?

294
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,600
Mingming.

295
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,320
Uncle Gao, did you find him?

296
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,000
Not yet.

297
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:10,840
Mingming.

298
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,250
It's getting late.

299
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,720
You should go home.

300
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,680
I'll inform you

301
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,360
when we have the result, okay?

302
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:18,490
OK.

303
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,610
We have work to do.

304
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,250
See you.

305
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,200
Take care.

306
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,880
You came to pick me up.

307
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:43,840
I'm just dropping by.

308
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:44,960
Dropping by.

309
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:46,720
What's this?

310
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,000
Bubble tea.

311
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,410
You bought two cups of bubble tea when dropping by.

312
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,760
Do you want it or not?

313
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,450
I do.

314
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:06,730
Why are you laughing?

315
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:07,930
Careful.

316
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,720
Going home.

317
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:18,810
Chi Yan, Xiao Xiu.

318
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,570
Mingming.

319
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,330
I found a new video.

320
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,120
It seems that 
Lin Mo was going to give Chi Yan that drink.

321
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,640
I just went to the store for him, but he's gone.

322
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:28,290
Lin Mo.

323
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:30,280
Are you sure?

324
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:34,720
Anyway, thank you.

325
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,050
Actually, I don't think

326
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,720
Lin Mo would do that.

327
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,080
You two have no conflicts.

328
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,720
He has no reason to do that.

329
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,600
Qin Mingming said

330
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,360
there are doubts in the video,

331
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,170
but it cannot be used as direct evidence.

332
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,160
It's too complicated.

333
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,720
We have to discuss it.

334
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,330
I told you that

335
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,720
Lin Mo is not a good person.

336
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,120
He came out of nowhere,

337
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,170
and he is so suspicious.

338
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,370
Are you jealous?

339
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,010
I am serious.

340
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,840
Stay away from him.

341
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,120
You are so jealous.

342
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,600
Did you hear me?

343
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,240
I heard you.

344
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,080
King of jealousy.

345
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,330
Thanks.

346
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,320
What are you writing?

347
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,520
A novel.

348
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,400
What novel?

349
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,400
A romance novel.

350
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,400
Then why can't I read it?

351
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,090
I haven't finished it yet.

352
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,240
I've read many of your unfinished works.

353
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,640
OK. OK.

354
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,280
You can read it.

355
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,400
You can read it.

356
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,849
But promise me

357
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,319
you won't laugh after you read it.

358
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,920
I just started writing it.

359
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,600
I want to write

360
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,490
a love story based on you.

361
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,640
So I'm the heroine.

362
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:38,920
Yeah.

363
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,160
You are the heroine.

364
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,880
Then don't drink, write!

365
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,000
Write.

366
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:44,290
Write.

367
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:47,920
I am the heroine.

368
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,400
Are you going to sleep here?

369
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,120
Why?

370
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,080
I got an early morning tomorrow.

371
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,240
It's convenient to sleep here.

372
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,930
You sleep with me.

373
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,520
Cut it out.

374
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,160
Give me the pillow.

375
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,360
You sleep in that room with me.

376
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:14,800
Give me the pillow, now.

377
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,040
Come with me.

378
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,640
No.

379
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,160
Come.

380
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:17,800
No.

381
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,640
Chi Yan.

382
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,120
Xiao Xiu.

383
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:19,920
Give me the pillow.

384
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,040
Sleep together.

385
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,490
We can't sleep together tonight.

386
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,320
Yes, we can.

387
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,120
We slept together yesterday.

388
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,130
Why can't we today?

389
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:34,640
Yes, we can.

390
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,120
Give me the pillow.

391
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,400
We have things to do tomorrow.

392
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,560
We need to buy phones.

393
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,160
You.

394
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,160
You.

395
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,520
You.

396
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,080
Can't sleep with you.

397
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,160
You can!

398
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,720
Don't be shy.

399
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,280
I won't do anything to you. Don't worry.

400
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:00,920
Sorry.

401
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,800
Your pillow.

402
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,920
Good night.

403
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,120
Thanks.

404
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,000
Great.

405
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,640
We finally have his-and-hers phones!

406
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,040
And it looks pretty.

407
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,080
This phone has a GPS function.

408
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,600
It's different from your old one.

409
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,710
The thing happened before,

410
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,440
I hope it'll never happen again.

411
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:05,040
But don't you always hate social media,

412
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,950
text message bombing,

413
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,560
and things like that?

414
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,880
Why would you be willing to

415
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,760
use a smart phone with me this time?

416
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,040
I do hate those things.

417
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:19,000
But smart phones and previous ones

418
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,760
are no different.

419
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,320
I'll just use it in my way.

420
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,520
What festival is that?

421
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,840
A sales promotion.

422
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,720
Selling beer.

423
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,440
It looks fun.

424
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,950
Let's go and see it.

425
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:51,880
OK.

426
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,840
Thank you.

427
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,280
Big applause to our dancers

428
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,110
for their wonderful performance!

429
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,400
Next.

430
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,040
It's time for our

431
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,760
Beer King Challenge!

432
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,200
The rules of the game are as follows.

433
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,440
Within three minutes...

434
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,080
Why is there so much beer?

435
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,840
And why is this beer mug so big?

436
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,160
This is a drinking contest.

437
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,240
The one who drinks the fastest

438
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,190
gets the prize.

439
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,240
A prize for fast drinking.

440
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,030
Look. Look.

441
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:18,840
So that is the prize.

442
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:23,040
A fish.

443
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:23,990
Do you want it?

444
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,000
I do.

445
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,950
But I can't drink that much.

446
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,360
It's too big.

447
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,680
We can buy it in a mall.

448
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,520
Wait up.

449
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:42,550
OK.

450
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,520
Now I announce

451
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:44,670
the first round begins.

452
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,800
Ready?

453
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,200
Daddy, come on, come on.

454
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,520
Chi Yan!

455
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,790
You got it!

456
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:54,320
Chi Yan!

457
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,430
Come on!

458
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,480
Daddy!

459
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,310
Chi Yan!

460
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,480
Go get them!

461
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,510
Daddy, you're the best!

462
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:06,280
-Chi Yan! 
 -Daddy!

463
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,920
Daddy! Come on!

464
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,240
That guy

465
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,150
almost caught up with you just now.

466
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,360
But you're the best.

467
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,000
I was about to burst.

468
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,080
But you were looking at other men.

469
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,150
Didn't you look at him?

470
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:16,960
How can I?

471
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,790
Let's go back and do it again.

472
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:18,480
There are many more fish.

473
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,430
-I can't drink anymore.
-Again.

474
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:19,990
Watch out.

475
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:21,800
No more.

476
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,510
What?

477
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:23,390
Chi Yan.

478
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:25,910
The one who kidnapped me.

479
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:26,960
Which one?

480
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,110
The one in black.

481
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,480
Are you sure?

482
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,990
I remember his smell.

483
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:32,870
I'm sure.

484
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,830
Let's get him.

485
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:36,590
We can't let him run away.

486
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,150
We finally find him.

487
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,200
Wait. Wait. Wait.

488
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,320
How?

489
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,080
I'm sure. I know the smell!

490
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,160
Be careful.

491
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,360
Slowly.

492
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:43,750
Slowly.

493
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,480
You can't tell others

494
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,590
that you smell him out.

495
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:47,950
What should we do?

496
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:48,760
It's him, right?

497
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,880
-It's him. 
-We follow him.

498
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,470
We'll figure something out.

499
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,750
Hurry up.

500
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,240
Remember to remind the patient in bed 3

501
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,590
to take this medicine

502
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,710
half an hour earlier.

503
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,270
OK.

504
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,390
That's all.

505
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:00,880
OK.

506
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,520
I won't let you play with it.

507
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,550
Never.

508
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:05,790
Watch out.

509
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,040
Are you all right?

510
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,310
Pipi.

511
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,190
You are being naughty again.

512
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,320
Didn't I tell you

513
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,640
that you can't run in the hospital?

514
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,550
Go back to your ward. Good boy.

515
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,430
Sorry for that, Dr. Luo.

516
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,310
He is a naughty boy.

517
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,710
He got out of his ward when nobody's watching.

518
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:20,710
It's okay.

519
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,320
Kids are all naughty.

520
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,910
What's that?

521
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,910
[Rescue Stray Animals]

522
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,430
The leaflet delivered this morning.

523
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:31,710
Kids were playing with it.

524
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,510
Rescue Stray Animals.

525
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,270
Are you interested in this?

526
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,040
There are so many stray animals now.

527
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,630
It's a good thing to help them.

528
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,070
It is very nice of you.

529
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,000
Thank you.

530
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:44,950
OK.

531
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,640
I'll go and take a look at other wards.

532
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:47,790
-See you later.
 -OK.

533
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:13,430
Hurry up.

534
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:14,870
Excuse me.

535
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:30,560
Where is he?

536
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:32,910
We lost him.

537
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,950
Can you still smell him?

538
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:38,310
No.

539
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,870
The smell of disinfectant is so strong.

540
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:42,510
Chi Yan, Xiao Xiu.

541
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:43,760
Dr. Luo.

542
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,200
Luo.

543
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:44,990
Why are you here?

544
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,280
We are looking for someone.

545
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:50,870
Recently, many stray animals in the 
neighborhood have disappeared or been drugged.

546
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,030
We just found someone.

547
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:52,830
Very suspicious.

548
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,510
But we lost him when we followed him here.

549
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,270
He disappeared as soon as he entered this door.

550
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,390
I don't know if he is a medical staff

551
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:01,870
or a doctor here.

552
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,510
So many people come to the hospital every day.

553
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,310
Doctors and patients.

554
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,070
How do you know that he is a doctor?

555
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:10,750
Yeah.

556
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,990
That's how it is written in the novel.

557
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,360
The well-dressed doctor

558
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,750
who rescues the wounded

559
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,950
is actually the perverted murderer.

560
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,960
Xiao Xiu has read a lot of books at your place.

561
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,350
Yeah.

562
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,430
She didn't mean that.

563
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:22,790
It's okay.

564
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,390
But he is perverted.

565
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:25,590
Have you

566
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,670
seen what that person looks like?

567
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,320
Not the face.

568
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:30,520
Thirties.

569
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:32,030
Wearing a black hat

570
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,190
and black pants.

571
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,910
Black shoes and black jacket.

572
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,870
In short, an ordinary person.

573
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:39,710
OK.

574
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:40,670
I'll check it for you.

575
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:41,870
I'll let you know

576
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:42,710
if I find anything.

577
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:43,910
Thank you.

578
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:44,470
Pleasure.

579
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:45,910
Thank you.

580
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,070
Cute clownfish.

581
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:48,830
Isn't it?

582
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:49,830
He won it.

583
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:51,510
A trophy?

584
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:54,190
OK, you should go home.

585
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,230
Don't stay in the hospital.

586
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:55,750
OK. OK.

587
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:56,720
-We don't look for him anymore?
-Wait for my call.

588
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:57,510
Okay, thank you.

589
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,630
We haven't found him yet.

590
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:07,990
Can you remember anything unusual

591
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,870
in that person?

592
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,310
Think about details.

593
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:14,230
Is there anything we didn't notice?

594
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:22,110
He has a scar on his right hand.

595
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:23,950
Here.

596
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,000
Here?

597
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,030
A scar?

598
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:27,590
Yeah.

599
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,310
Right here.

600
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,110
Are you sure?

601
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:30,350
I'm sure.

602
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:32,310
Yes. Yes.

603
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:33,910
We met him.

604
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:35,070
There is a scar

605
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:38,230
on the outside of his wrist.

606
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,230
OK. OK. OK.

607
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,950
Thank you, Luo.

608
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,110
Call me if you got anything.

609
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,190
Goodbye.

610
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:52,630
How's it?

611
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,390
I told Luo about that.

612
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,030
With this clue,

613
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,030
it should be easier to catch him.

614
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,310
Let's go to the hospital again.

615
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,270
Don't rush.

616
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:01,790
This man is cunning.

617
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,060
We should think of a way.

618
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,110
What way?

619
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:07,860
The person who kidnapped you

620
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,220
appeared in the street park today.

621
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,510
Then it's almost sure

622
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,860
that he is the same person

623
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,790
who drugged stray cats.

624
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,350
There are many stray cats in the park.

625
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,910
So he can only catch cats

626
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:17,870
in the park.

627
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,430
People in our neighborhood

628
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:20,990
have all heard about the drugged cats.

629
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,310
So I believe,

630
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,590
he went to the park today

631
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,500
to see what's going on.

632
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,470
When people are less alarmed,

633
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,630
he will do it again.

634
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,900
So we should try to

635
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,100
spread the news that the park is safe.

636
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:34,860
We can go to the park and feed the cats,

637
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,270
and then hide somewhere.

638
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,870
When the culprit does it again,

639
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,150
we can catch him.

640
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,750
And we have Ke Bei.

641
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,340
If Ke Bei can help us

642
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,780
find out where that person has been to,

643
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:45,540
we'll have a better chance of catching him.

644
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,420
That's great, Chi Yan.

645
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:47,790
Let's go to Ke Bei's now.

646
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:48,910
Let's go.

647
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,310
It's not that simple.

648
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,950
You finish your work today.

649
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,030
Leave everything else to me.

650
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:57,950
Go.

651
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,910
Go straight home after work tonight.

652
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:02,790
OK.

653
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,830
Don't run around 
 if you see something curious on the road.

654
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:06,590
Don't look.

655
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,310
Just come home.

656
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:08,710
OK.

657
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,550
Oh, your phone.

658
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:15,510
If the phone is dying,

659
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:16,590
charge it ASAP.

660
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,510
OK, grandpa.

661
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,070
I'll leave it to you to protect it.

662
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,230
Hold it yourself.

663
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,340
You can feed stray cats,

664
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,270
but not take them home.

665
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,940
[POLICE]

666
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:43,950
Uncle Gao.

667
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:45,740
Mingming.

668
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:53,270
According to the copy of the ID card 
provided by the beer house,

669
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,300
we checked Lin Mo's household registration file.

670
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:57,870
There is no such person.

671
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,510
Obviously, this ID is fake.

672
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,510
We also reviewed

673
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:05,710
the inter-city traffic data in the past few days.

674
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:09,150
No travel records related to this ID were found.

675
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:12,260
We even went to the house he lives in.

676
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:12,870
It's empty.

677
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,900
His landlord said he hadn't been home for days.

678
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:19,180
It seems that the situation 
is much more complicated than we expected.

679
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:22,230
The test results of the victim's poisoning

680
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:23,950
have not come out yet.

681
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,900
How come?

682
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:28,660
Logically,

683
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,910
If Zhang Yi was indeed poisoned

684
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:32,590
after having Chi Yan's drink.

685
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:33,790
This Lin Mo

686
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:36,510
is the only and the last person

687
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:37,540
who has touched the drink

688
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,830
before Chi Yan.

689
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:41,500
He disappeared after the case.

690
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,380
He is one of the major suspects.

691
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,020
Right.

692
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:48,750
Did you remind your old classmates?

693
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:49,830
Yes.

694
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,740
But Xiao Xiu works with this guy.

695
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,380
She can't keep secrets.

696
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,940
I don't want to alarm him.

697
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,750
So I told them

698
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,310
to let me know if they have any news.

699
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,310
You are always so considerate.

700
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,830
You should think about yourself.

701
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:05,990
Uncle Gao.

702
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,110
Don't worry.

703
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,230
The next one,

704
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,100
I won't let go of him easily.

705
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:14,620
Like father, like daughter.

706
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:16,740
You can rest assured.

707
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:20,110
I will always get your back.

708
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,020
Let's go to my office.

709
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:23,510
Shall we?

710
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,700
Medium well fried eggs

711
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,710
with separate sauce.

712
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,310
Coffee without ice and sugar.

713
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:33,330
Don't put it on the table if it's not what I ordered.

714
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,510
Everything is prepared the way you like.

715
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,030
Do I need to wait tables?

716
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,620
That's not necessary.

717
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,820
I lost my appetite at the sight of you.

718
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,340
Hello?

719
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,750
Are you really so mean

720
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,540
to your little brother?

721
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,830
What's a brother for?

722
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:49,830
Otherwise, why did I

723
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,180
let our mother give birth to you?

724
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,580
OK. You win.

725
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:56,100
I want to ask if you are free this weekend?

726
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,270
It depends.

727
00:32:59,030 --> 00:32:59,950
Your brother is going to

728
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:02,110
volunteer at a stray animal rescue station.

729
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,670
Do you have any spare time

730
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:04,820
to go with me?

731
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,820
Well, you know me.

732
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:08,660
I have no interest in stray animals.

733
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,030
I'm only interested in people.

734
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,300
Are there any cute guys?

735
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:13,470
Sure.

736
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,820
Where?

737
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,310
Where?

738
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:20,980
OK.

739
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:21,980
I don't count.

740
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,060
But Chi Yan counts.

741
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,980
That was your crush

742
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,300
in puberty.

743
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,310
Knock it off.

744
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:28,900
I was just young

745
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,990
and ignorant.

746
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,070
Look,

747
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,500
If you come tomorrow,

748
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,700
you can meet Chi Yan's girlfriend.

749
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:38,620
What?

750
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,780
Can a solitary man like Chi Yan

751
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,190
have a girlfriend?

752
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,220
Didn't expect that, huh?

753
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,300
Surprised?

754
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:48,820
Wanna come?

755
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,310
What...

756
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:52,990
What kind of person

757
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,300
can fall in love with Chi Yan?

758
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,740
Not an ordinary person.

759
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,590
How much is your fish?

760
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:35,820
It's not for sale.

761
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,630
I give you all these.

762
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:40,219
You sell me that fish.

763
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:41,540
Kid.

764
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:42,830
I don't sell this.

765
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:45,300
This is for my girlfriend.

766
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,179
Fishes are her favorite.

767
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:48,380
This is my girlfriend's.

768
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:49,750
And I won it.

769
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,270
Didn't Lin Mo come today?

770
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,180
Didn't Lin Mo come today?

771
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,700
He seems to have taken a long vacation 
to go out of town.

772
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,300
Why are you shouting?

773
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,470
Didn't you say that boss is not here?

774
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:20,300
I don't know that.

775
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,500
Are you two working

776
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,780
or chatting?

777
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,460
Work.

778
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:24,630
Work.

779
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,360
Boss.

780
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,420
Where is Lin Mo?

781
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:30,790
Do your job.

782
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,260
Mind your own business.

783
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:46,750
Have you gone out of town?

784
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,020
When are you coming back?

785
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,150
I have something important to tell you.

786
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:52,940
Right, that is it.

787
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,940
What a good lad.

788
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:58,460
Pity.

789
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,180
Come. Eat.

790
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,060
Yellow.

791
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,620
Come, Yellow.

792
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,790
Come, eat more.

793
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,060
Yellow.

794
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,180
Come. Yellow.

795
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:12,980
Have some.

796
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,780
Flower has gained weight.

797
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,260
Has she?

798
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,430
I saw Flower and Yellow fight today.

799
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,950
Yellow was beaten so hard on the ground.

800
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,060
Is he?

801
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,420
Who gave you this hairpin?

802
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:27,780
This one?

803
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:30,940
So cute.

804
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,060
It suits you well.

805
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,460
Yan.

806
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,390
You seem different from before.

807
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,180
Join me.

808
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:40,670
Let me ask you a question.

809
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,460
Have you seen

810
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,940
any strangers recently?

811
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:45,900
Feeding cats here?

812
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:49,020
Strangers feed the cat?

813
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,030
Nope.

814
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,540
No.

815
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,500
Promise me something, okay?

816
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,500
If you see a strange man

817
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,420
with a scar on his hand

818
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,660
come here to feed the cats someday,

819
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,260
you'll go to the bookstore and tell me, OK?

820
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,060
OK?

821
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,020
Scars on hand.

822
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:06,700
The back of the hand.

823
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,220
I got it.

824
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,660
A man with scars on the back of his hands.

825
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,100
A pinky swear.

826
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,220
They should make a pinky swear, too.

827
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,540
So they won't fight over food.

828
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,380
Make a pinky swear.

829
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:29,900
Mengmeng.

830
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:31,740
Hurry up.

831
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:32,780
Quiet.

832
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,260
What?

833
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,540
Someone is following me.

834
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,980
In the daytime?

835
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:40,620
I will give him a lesson.

836
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,140
It's too dangerous.

837
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,260
Try something else.

838
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:44,980
This way.

839
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,740
Sneaky!

840
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,500
Bad guy!

841
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,700
Stop. Stop.

842
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:01,260
Me.

843
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:02,380
It's me.

844
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,100
What me?

845
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:03,700
Who are you?

846
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,140
Don't hit me. It's me.

847
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,620
Ke Bei.

848
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:12,980
Does it hurt?

849
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,380
It's OK.

850
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,610
It'll be done in a bit.

851
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,860
Stop looking.

852
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,380
Why are you following us

853
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,340
like a pervert?

854
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,100
You asked me to investigate.

855
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,980
And I found that the neighborhood

856
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,620
is indeed a bit problematic recently.

857
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,660
I don't want you to be in danger.

858
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,300
So I wanted to protect...

859
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,260
I wanted to check on you girls.

860
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,740
Thank you for your kindness.

861
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,890
But the method you used

862
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:46,330
is really misleading.

863
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:48,340
Did I scare you?

864
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:51,580
Did you find that guy?

865
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,370
What did you get?

866
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:53,930
I found him.

867
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:54,690
Wait.

868
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:55,620
Who are you looking for?

869
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,380
What investigation?

870
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:58,330
Recently, Chi Yan and I found that

871
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:00,740
stray cats in the neighborhood 
were drugged and missing.

872
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:01,850
We are so worried.

873
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:03,580
So we asked Ke Bei to investigate that.

874
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:06,570
Look.

875
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:07,780
Is that the person?

876
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:12,020
Yes.

877
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,050
That's him.

878
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:16,580
After you told me that day,

879
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:19,300
I checked various forums, blogging sites,

880
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,180
and social media platforms.

881
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:21,900
And,

882
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,410
I found a show-off post.

883
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:26,140
Do you remember

884
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:28,100
you told me about his characteristics

885
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:29,540
and the details of the warehouse?

886
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,330
Yes.

887
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:33,260
The video he posted 
is very similar to what you described.

888
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:36,780
And he did post videos of

889
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,810
doing experiments with cats.

890
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:39,660
Right.

891
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,340
There is a scar on the back of his hand.

892
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,220
Yes, a scar.

893
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,780
You really are professional.

894
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,500
-Thanks.
-Professional?

895
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,660
He is a lawyer I hired.

896
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,500
Can we call the police about this?

897
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:55,530
I don't think we should call the police

898
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,940
unless we find the evidence

899
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,410
that he drugged the cats.

900
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,490
Even if we call the police,

901
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,340
the police cannot convict him.

902
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:05,180
And he didn't live broadcast

903
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,020
the process of cruelty to animals.

904
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,700
Even if the video is real,

905
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,700
we can't do anything to him.

906
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,340
We can only expose him on the internet.

907
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,860
Don't you have to be punished

908
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,300
for hurting cats here?

909
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,170
I can't wait to tear his face to pieces now.

910
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:23,660
I'll print out 100 copies of his photo 
and post them everywhere tomorrow.

911
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,370
I want everyone to see

912
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:25,540
what this pervert looks like.

913
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:26,620
Calm down.

914
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,380
Don't alarm him.

915
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:30,300
I think he will do it again recently.

916
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,780
We need to figure out a way.

917
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,780
I think He Meng is right.

918
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,540
Thank you.

919
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:41,010
We have to implement Chi Yan's plan soon.

920
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,250
What?

921
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:51,820
What's the big deal

922
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,180
that you need me in such a hurry?

923
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:55,580
And we have to meet?

924
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,660
You won't let me play for two more days?

925
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:04,260
I want to know

926
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:06,650
Are there humans that can't be killed?

927
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:08,780
What?

928
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,180
What I gave you last time doesn't work?

929
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:13,420
I didn't use it.

930
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:15,140
I used a knife.

931
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:16,850
A knife?

932
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,570
You are something.

933
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:24,660
Bro.

934
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:26,570
Then what happened?

935
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:27,770
How is that human?

936
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:28,820
Died?

937
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:30,380
No.

938
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:32,580
I stabbed him with the knife.

939
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,250
But it's like stabbing the air.

940
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,450
The knife went straight through his body.

941
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,610
He wasn't hurt a little bit.

942
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,850
Not even a drop of blood.

943
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:47,540
Interesting.

944
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,140
Have you heard of anything like that?

945
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,420
You stabbed him with a knife.

946
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,980
The knife went through the body.

947
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:02,140
And the person is fine.

948
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,170
I have to say,

949
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:05,810
I've heard about

950
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:07,170
what you described.

951
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:09,100
But I always thought

952
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:09,930
it was not real.

953
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:11,890
What is it?

954
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:18,930
Have you heard of

955
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,210
cat seals?
