Some of them were drugged.

I don't dare to take my baby out

00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,180
and let it play now.

00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,290
Right.

It's a lot safer now.

00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,250
I heard that the guy has been caught.

10
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,780
I heard so.

11
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,380
I noticed that

12
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,020
the dogs and cats nearby 
have been hanging out again.

13

I saw the guy you mentioned.

19
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:17,660
Where did you see him?

20
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,780
Near the park.

21
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,540

How about the kitties?

26
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:29,370

to get the latest news.

How about this?

39

you start filming him

and I will catch him.

52

53
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,940
eat the poisoned cat food?

It's okay.

We do it in a different way.

00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,420
Luo.

179
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,260
Hello.

180
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,490
Why are you here?

181
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,220
I saw your fliers.

182
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,060
I am available this weekend.

183
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,060
So I came to help.

184
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,260
How nice of you.

185
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,490
Well, let me disinfect the place.

186
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,370
What happened to you?

187
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:21,860
You injured?

188
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,660
It's called Bubble.

189
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,700
It's been rescued for a while.

190
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,900
No one's willing to adopt it

191
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,170
because of its broken leg.

192
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,100
Poor thing.

193
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,940
It's alright, Bubble.

194
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:35,660
It's going to be fine.

195
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,380
There.

196
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,420
Hold it tight.

197
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,380
Here, Yuanbao.

198
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,290
Feeling good?

199
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,300
You...

200
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,660
Why are you looking at me?

201
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:05,780
It seems that

202
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,780
you are not so afraid of dogs now.

203
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,380
You bet.

204
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,580
I have done so many shows about police dogs.

205
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,460
I've got Bulb.

206
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,540
Of course, I am not afraid of dogs now.

207
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,620
There's nothing I can do for you now.

208
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:37,610
Chi Yan.

209
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,460
Luo.

210
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,420
Thank you so much for coming.

211
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,020
No problem.

212
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,820
Xiao Xiu is really cute.

213
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,540
Just like a cat.

214
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,700
A crazy one.

215
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,060
Now I know

216
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,460
why you would fall for her.

217
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,300
You've changed a lot

218
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,580
since you met her.

219
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,010
Have I?

220
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,820
It's obvious to all.

221
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,980
You are still as popular with cats

222
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,540
as you used to be.

223
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,330
After all those things,

224
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,650
I thought you would avoid them.

225
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:22,780
I used to.

226
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,220
Not anymore.

227
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,940
Because of her, I guess.

228
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,130
I didn't mean to do that.

229
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,900
Take that!

230
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,380
Stop!

231
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,460
Have a bath!

232
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,090
Is it good?

233
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,140
I know we are not doing so well now,

234
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:30,180
but I thought 
Chi is at least capable of buying food.

235
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:37,890
It's not what you think.

236
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,620
I just wanted to smell it.

237
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,530
I just...

238
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:42,780
I just wanted to...

239
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,340
You two smell the same.

240
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,300
Right.

241
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:52,660
It's the same.

242
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,220
Qin has been getting better

243
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,420
at feeding dogs.

244
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,810
At least I've overcome my fear.

245
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,130
Unlike you.

246
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,940
What? What are you afraid of?

247
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,090
I am a vet.

248
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,180
I am afraid of nothing.

249
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:05,940
He's scared of frogs.

250
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,820
Frogs?

251
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,250
Frogs?

252
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,260
They are so tiny. Why are you afraid of them?

253
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,100
They are so tiny.

254
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:12,890
Just this big.

255
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:13,650
You are huge.

256
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:14,940
Why are you afraid of them?

257
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,730
Have you got a problem with that?

258
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,660
They are amphibians.

259
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,340
They have legs like ours.

260
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,740
Don't you find it odd?

261
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,780
They also hop.

262
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,460
I...I just can't.

263
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,700
I can't stand breaststroke.

264
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,290
Morning, my lady.

265
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,900
You are so early.

266
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,180
We are almost finished.

267
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,860
I have brought my card.

268
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,220
You can buy people dinner

269
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,620
and donate the rest to the rescue center.

270
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:52,290
Mingming.

271
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,260
Ziqi, why are you here?

272
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,300
To join you guys.

273
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,260
This is...

274
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,770
I've talked about her.

275
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:00,940
The one who is meant to be alone.

276
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,290
Xiao Xiu.

277
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,050
This is my sister, Xu Ziqi.

278
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,180
Hello, I am Xiao Xiu.

279
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:05,780
Hello.

280
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,780
You are really cute.

281
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,980
Chi Yan is a lucky man.

282
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:11,380
Wait,

283
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,260
why does your sister

284
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,820
look so much better than you?

285
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,740
Look.

286
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:21,770
She can't even tell

287
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:22,860
we are siblings.

288
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,620
Because you've said good things about her.

289
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,460
Where is Chi Yan?

290
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,140
Over there.

291
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:29,860
Yiyi.

292
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,060
Yiyi.

293
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:33,980
Thank you so much.

294
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,500
You've been of great help.

295
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,660
Safe ride home.

296
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,500
Take a rest.

297
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:38,460
Thank you so much.

298
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,540
See you.

299
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,060
Let's go home.

300
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,060
Would you like to have a look around?

301
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:44,980
I'll go that way.

302
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:45,500
Alright.

303
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,060
Take me here again.

304
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,140
I haven't seen so many cats

305
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,060
for such a long time.

306
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:49,540
Alright.

307
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,930
But you can't bath them.

308
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:51,860
Why?

309
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,540
-Doesn't matter.
-Chi Yan.

310
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:54,450
Hello.

311
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,010
Ziqi.

312
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,380
Long time no see.

313
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,530
Xu Ziqi?

314
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,540
It's been almost three years.

315
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,020
Long time no see.

316
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,010
Have you got nothing to say to me?

317
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:05,620
Ziqi,

318
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,460
is this the first time you meet him?

319
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,660
Is that your friend?

320
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,370
Sort of.

321
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:15,860
His name is Luo Jiaxuan.

322
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,980
He was my senior at high school.

323
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,650
Why don't you introduce us?

324
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:20,530
Go.

325
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:24,860
Luo,

326
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,300
this is my sister, Xu Ziqi.

327
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,260
Hello.

328
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,060
Hello.

329
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,540
I am his sister, Xu Ziqi.

330
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,180
Hello, I am Luo Jiaxuan.

331
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,540
Are you adopting a pet?

332
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,020
Right.

333
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,780
Bubble.

334
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:36,740
Right. Bubble.

335
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,060
It's got a broken leg.

336
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,130
I want to take it home and take good care of it.

337
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,180
How nice of you.

338
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:42,900
Luo,

339
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,500
Bubble has got a home now.

340
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,140
Luo, are you a doctor?

341
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:46,780
Right.

342
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,540
I am buying everyone dinner tonight.

343
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,180
Luo,

344
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,250
please join us.

345
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,300
Alright.

346
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,530
Cheers!

347
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,660
Let's get started.

348
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,420
Luo,

349
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,860
where do you work?

350
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,260
Renai Hospital.

351
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,060
I am familiar with that one.

352
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:07,780
How?

353
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:11,180
It's one of the best in treating

354
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,460
cardiovascular diseases.

355
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,220
Right.

356
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,060
You do know us well.

357
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,300
I'm afraid it would be inappropriate for me

358
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,410
to say welcome to visit us,

359
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,290
but if there's

360
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,609
anything I could help with,

361
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:22,460
feel free to come to me.

362
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,540
Can't I come to you

363
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,540
if I am all fine?

364
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:26,940
Of course, you can.

365
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,980
Don't drink this.

366
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,610
We are all here.

367
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,980
Let's get some alcohol.

368
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,460
She's allergic.

369
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,250
Have you forgotten?

370
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,180
You can drink for her.

371
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,500
Alright.

372
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,260
You can't.

373
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:40,380
Sorry,

374
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:41,530
I can't drink either.

375
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:42,020
I may have to

376
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,500
go back to the hospital later.

377
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,620
-I drove here.
-In that case...

378
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,460
You also drove here.

379
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,980
What are you thinking?

380
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,140
Now it's getting boring.

381
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:53,780
I will drink.

382
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,300
Good. Very nice.

383
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:57,900
I came here by taxi.

384
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,420
I can drive your car back for you.

385
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,180
Thanks a lot.

386
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,380
Waiter,

387
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,020
two dozens of beers.

388
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:03,620
Alright.

389
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:10,460
-Help yourself.
-Sorry.

390
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,060
I have to take this.

391
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:12,540
Help yourself.

392
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,020
Hello.

393
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,260
Yes.

394
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,460
Alright.

395
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,220
Alright. I will be back at once.

396
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,380
Sorry.

397
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,380
Something urgent happened at the hospital.

398
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,380
I have to go back now.

399
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,540
I just realize that

400
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,260
I have a virtual meeting tonight.

401
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,780
I have to hand in a draft tomorrow.

402
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,060
How about this? Luo.

403
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,380
I can drive you there.

404
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:35,980
Is it too much trouble?

405
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:36,900
Not at all.

406
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:37,940
How about my car?

407
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,300
What's more important,

408
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,980
your car or my happiness?

409
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:45,940
Just go then.

410
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,020
Let's go, Luo.

411
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,420
Then we will leave now. Bye.

412
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,380
We have to go now.

413
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,180
Alright. Bye.

414
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,460
Bye.

415
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,420
I am going to the restroom.

416
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,620
Are you alright?

417
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:28,900
I am fine.

418
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,130
Just want some fresh air.

419
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,660
I didn't expect

420
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,140
you would come today.

421
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,220
After all, Chi and Xiao Xiu were there.

422
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,580
It's all over now.

423
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,850
We are friends.

424
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,260
No need to avoid them.

425
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,140
I might still have hope

426
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:55,700
if it were another time,

427
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,530
but now I've thought it through.

428
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,260
Chi Yan

429
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,930
is nothing but a memory

430
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:06,770
of my lost youth and guilt.

431
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,260
It's all over.

432
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,130
You can still stay as friends

433
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,450
for a really long time.

434
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,260
I am really happy that I can make friends with you.

435
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,020
Although you

436
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,900
seem unreliable from time to time,

437
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:30,770
you are a good man.

438
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,180
And you are a friend

439
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,180
worth making.

440
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,570
Are you rejecting me again?

441
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,260
You don't want that?

442
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,620
Give my rejection back then.

443
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,130
When you first took Bulb to the hospital

444
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,820
for a body check...

445
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,060
Don't look. Just don't.

446
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,300
Here you are.

447
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,220
Thank you.

448
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:44,300
Well,

449
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,890
you can buy me dinner for this.

450
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,140
Alright. You decide when.

451
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:48,970
Brunch tomorrow.

452
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:50,180
Tomorrow?

453
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,740
You are a woman of action.

454
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:53,860
Others would

455
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,860
suggest dinner during the weekend.

456
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:56,860
Weekend?

457
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,260
How long do I have to wait till the weekend?

458
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,780
We may be living on Mars then.

459
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,170
The weekend is miles away.

460
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,220
Alright, see you tomorrow then.

461
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:07,100
Luo, I am just kidding.

462
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,300
You have to work overtime today.

463
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:09,940
I don't want to

464
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,860
deprive you of any rest.

465
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,340
Go see your patients.

466
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,300
Some other time then.

467
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,340
I have to go now.

468
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,060
Alright.

469
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:18,820
Safe ride home.

470
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:19,700
Take care.

471
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,580
Why are you wearing so little?

472
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,220
It's really hot.

473
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:55,620
Hot?

474
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,620
Are you having a fever again?

475
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:12,220
Don't you feel hot?

476
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,460
You...

477
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,140
What are you trying to do?

478
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,140
What are you trying to do?

479
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:21,700
Chi Yan.

480
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:24,740
Chi Yan.

481
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,180
Open the door.

482
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,500
Chi Yan.

483
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,210
I...

484
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:32,660
One.

485
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,820
Use your belly muscle to balance your body

486
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,980
instead of sitting on your butt.

487
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:38,460
Four.

488
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,460
During the...

489
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:42,530
Five.

490
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,850
Hey, Chi. What's up?

491
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:48,620
Let me ask you something.

492
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,180
The female cats in heat at your clinic.

493
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:56,460
How do you deal with them?

494
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,060
You call me in the middle of the night

495
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,980
to ask me this?

496
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,770
Let me in.

497
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:05,740
Chi Yan, let me in.

498
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,100
Just cut the nonsense.

499
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:07,940
Tell me what to do.

500
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,340
What's that banging sound?

501
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:11,900
Nothing.

502
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,100
Just cut the nonsense. What should I do?

503
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,420
We sterilize them.

504
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,210
Common sense.

505
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,490
I can't.

506
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,020
You can't?

507
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,820
You want her to have kitties?

508
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,060
How about the dad?

509
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,020
We've got British Shorthairs, Garfields,

510
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,170
Ragdolls, and motley ones.

511
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,820
Just name one.

512
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,690
Don't be afraid of us.

513
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:35,860
No breeding.

514
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,020
No breeding?

515
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,820
Nothing works for you.

516
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,060
You are so hard to please.

517
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,020
Wait, Chi,

518
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,460
when do you start to care about this?

519
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:46,810
Open the door.

520
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:47,660
You...

521
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,940
Tell me how long it would last.

522
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,180
Well,

523
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,060
from two or three days

524
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,500
to half a month.

525
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,050
Half a month?

526
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,420
Chi Yan.

527
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,740
I have to go now.

528
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:08,900
Xiao Xiu.

529
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,180
Why are you avoiding me?

530
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:45,570
Stop. Stop. Stop.

531
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,020
This is the time I need you the most.

532
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,740
Stop. Just stop.

533
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,860
I need you. I really need you.

534
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,660
I know what I can do.

535
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,740
I've figured it out.

536
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:00,620
Has it happened to you

537
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,900
when you were in the Meow Planet?

538
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:04,700
No.

539
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,450
What you are experiencing

540
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:09,580
is a special condition

541
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,140
caused by irregular hormone

542
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:12,970
and growth.

543
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,260
I know.

544
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,490
You know?

545
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,740
I can solve this right away.

546
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:19,500
How?

547
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,380
I was not talking about this.

548
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,410
This is the only way.

549
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,730
Why don't you give it a try?

550
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:25,380
Xiao Xiu. Xiao Xiu.

551
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,140
Listen to me.

552
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,810
Things are different here

553
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,620
on Earth.

554
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,660
How?

555
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,620
My teacher has said that 
we can do it with people we like.

556
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,820
We like each other.

557
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,580
Why not?

558
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,140
We can do this.

559
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,780
-We can.
-Alright.

560
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,260
You should go to bed.

561
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,770
Join me.

562
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:44,740
Just go to bed.

563
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,500
Sleep with me.

564
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:46,660
Join me.

565
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:47,820
Fine.

566
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,140
I will.

567
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:24,170
Don't go.

568
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:35,540
Xiao Xiu.

569
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:38,740
I am going to make you breakfast.

570
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,740
And find you some movies.

571
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:45,220
You can have breakfast while watching them.

572
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:46,820
Let me get prepared.

573
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:58,610
Just go back to sleep.

574
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,020
Thank you.

575
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:45,460
I used to come here many years ago.

576
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:46,980
It was a punk club.

577
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:48,940
You are welcome.

578
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:55,780
Thank you.

579
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,940
I used to come here many years ago.

580
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,770
It was a punk club.

581
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,180
The stage was...

582
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,340
Everything was...

583
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,100
Xu Zihao.

584
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,260
Coming.

585
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,580
Coming.

586
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,780
Can I stay here for one night?

587
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,380
Why all of a sudden?

588
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,540
Not convenient for you?

589
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:01,930
Fine.

590
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:03,580
You can stay.

591
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:04,940
I am all single and everything.

592
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,300
What can be inconvenient?

593
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,580
Anything happened at the bookstore?

594
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,170
My bed broke.

595
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,260
I will have it fixed tomorrow.

596
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,660
Did it break while you were sleeping?

597
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:17,060
Wish me something better, will you?

598
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,860
I am just worried about you.

599
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,170
Xiao Xiu is there alone?

600
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:25,860
Her bed's fine.

601
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,580
Why don't you two squeeze up a little 
and share the bed?

602
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,340
That's not proper.

603
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:35,580
Well, Chi.

604
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:37,810
After all these years,

605
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,620
has there been a proper time for you?

606
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:41,820
Shut up.

607
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,420
You are not a teenager.

608
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,540
You've never done it.

609
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,940
Are you...

610
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:52,770
Chi. Sorry!

611
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,060
It's not proper!

612
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:54,740
Will you shut up?

613
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,410
I will.

614
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:56,260
It's not proper!

615
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,250
Listen to me.

616
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,420
It was the perfect time.

617
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,940
Mingming and I

618
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,410
were meant to have our first kiss then.

619
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,260
If it weren't for that dinner,

620
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,930
if we hadn't had that dinner at that place,

621
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,900
if they didn't keep frogs there,

622
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,180
if Xiao Xiu hadn't scared me with that frog,

623
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,620
Mingming and I would not

624
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,780
have our first kiss there.

625
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,940
It was perfection.

626
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:21,740
You and her.

627
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,250
Just that?

628
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:25,540
It was nothing.

629
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,620
It was barely a kiss.

630
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:29,620
Of course it was a kiss.

631
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:30,940
How was it not a kiss?

632
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:31,420
Here. Here.

633
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,260
Get up. Get up. Get up.

634
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,180
Let's recreate the scene.

635
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:33,660
Here. Here.

636
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,220
What are you doing?

637
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,820
Here. Just spit it out. Spit it out.

638
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,740
Bend lower. Lower.

639
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,500
Lower.

640
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,140
Just pretend you are Mingming. Lower.

641
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,020
Fine. Lower.

642
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,170
Qin Liangliang,

643
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,250
What's this?

644
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,100
What are you so nervous about?

645
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,140
I haven't opened it yet.

646
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,140
I...I don't know her very well.

647
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,620
I've rejected her.

648
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,700
She's left you

649
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,140
a kiss here.

650
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,380
How can you be so indifferent?

651
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,860
The Gen-Zers are just like that.

652
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,860
Let me ask you this then.

653
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:05,860
When was the last time you kissed?

654
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,340
Well,

655
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:10,889
last week.

656
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:12,260
Really?

657
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,300
With whom?

658
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,260
None of your business.

659
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:22,219
My sister has left.

660
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:25,139
We have to take care of the dishes.

661
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,460
Don't say that.

662
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,820
She cares about you.

663
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,780
That's why she's brought you food.

664
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,100
You call that care?

665
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,570
She was keeping an eye on me,

666
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:33,940
following my mom's order.

667
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,139
However,

668
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:36,940
I think things have been going really well

669
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,260
with Mingming and me.

670
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,699
I can smell victory.

671
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:43,780
Nietzsche.

672
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:44,690
Nietzsche.

673
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:47,420
What's wrong, Nietzsche?

674
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,380
I almost forgot about you.

675
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,139
Wait here.

676
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:51,139
What are you doing?

677
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,260
Just grab something.

678
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:54,940
What's this?

679
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,130
A massager for pets.

680
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,330
Let me show you.

681
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:59,210
Come here, Nietzsche.

682
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,460
What?

683
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:05,940
Interested?

684
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,100
We can use it on people. It should feel good.

685
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:09,890
Let me try using it on you.

686
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:14,730
Can you lend it to me

687
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:16,930
for a day or two?

688
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,450
You can.

689
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,100
How will you thank me?

690
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:32,770
Well,

691
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,290
are cats afraid of rainy days?

692
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,340
They are.

693
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,340
They are really sensitive to sound.

694
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,060
How can we help?

695
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,380
Just comfort them. Pat them.

696
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:47,060
Give them food.

697
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:54,860
At least

698
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:58,060
they can find a small space to hide.

699
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:07,020
I have to go now.

700
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,060
Where? In the middle of the night?

701
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:09,740
Home.

702
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,980

744
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:53,660
Liangliang.

745
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,460

746
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,340

750
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:30,860
Liangliang,

751
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,780
I am still very curious.

752
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,700
Why would you help me chase your sister?

753
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:38,900
Well,

754
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,330
you are no longer

755
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:44,700
in your early 20s, right?

756
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,700
Last time, when you were running with my sister,

757
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:50,580
I don't think you could hang on

758
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,740
if you don't take this seriously.

759
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,420
I think you are a reliable man.

760
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:57,340
And you genuinely like my sister.

761
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,500
Moreover,

762
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,220
I know my sister well.

763
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,740
Even if you don't end up together,

764
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:05,780
she will be taken advantage of.

765
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:10,730
You are really wise

766
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,170
for someone at your age.

767
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,660
This feels so good.

769
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,050
Why don't we close the store today?

770
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,810
You were scared last night.

771
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,500
Let me take you out and have fun.

772
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:28,820

775
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,380
That requires a license.

776
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,980
You don't have one. How can you drive?

777
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,940

778
