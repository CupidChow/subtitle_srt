4
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,580
You scared me to death!

5
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:03,850
Writer's block?

6
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,420
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

7
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,390
Aren't we going to have dinner with Mingming?

8
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,490
She needs to take Bulb and Liangliang home

9
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,700
before going to the bearhouse.

10
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,730
I was free anyway,

11
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,690
so I came to see you first.

12
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:22,980
You and Qin Mingming.

13
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,050
You're meant to be.

14
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,890
That's exactly how I feel.

15
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,740
I was thinking about it on my way here.

16
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,900
It so happened that

17
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,820
I ran into her chasing a thief.

18
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,300
Not only that,

19
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,540
but she's also your classmate from high school.

20
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,180
Also, her dog Bulb.

21
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,090
Bulb got sick this time.

22
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,820
But there are so many dogs in the world,

23
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,170
and so many vet clinics.

24
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,370
Why did she just come to

25
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:56,060
my clinic and meet me?

26
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,090
This is fate.

27
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,610
Think about it.

28
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,490
Our next encounter

29
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,620
must be something sensational.

30
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,250
Are you listening to me?

31
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,620
I am.

32
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,090
Why are you looking at me like this?

33
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,060
Xu Zihao.

34
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,380
Since when you've become one of those guys?

35
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,580
You cannot lead two girls on.

36
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,060
I...

37
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,460
I would never do that.

38
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:54,830
Stop playing with it.

39
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,060
Let me ask you something.

40
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:11,460
Have you ever met a girl

41
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,810
that feels so familiar

42
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,180
but also like a stranger?

43
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:19,380
What?

44
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,540
An ex-girlfriend?

45
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,300
Nah.

46
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,860
It's someone I just met recently.

47
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,410
She feels so familiar.

48
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,580
But that's not true

49
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,490
because I did just meet her.

50
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,300
I don't know much about her,

51
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,690
she doesn't know much about me.

52
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,770
But the thing is,

53
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,020
she is definitely not a stranger either.

54
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,100
Because when I look at her,

55
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:49,620
I feel like I know her and trust her.

56
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,409
Sometimes I even think of her,

57
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:55,050
when I go to bed or just wake up.

58
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:55,540
This...

59
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,340
This is such a strange feeling.

60
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:02,970
Mr. Chi.

61
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,260
Congratulations on finding love!

62
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,490
Tell me who this girl is.

63
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:08,610
It must be that Xiao Xiu!

64
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:12,420
Isn't it?

65
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:13,770
It's not her.

66
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:14,260
I'm telling you.

67
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,580
She's gathered all the intel there is on you

68
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,490
in order to pursue you.

69
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:18,980
She even asked me to give you a message.

70
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,100
You know?

71
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,020
It must be her.

72
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,820
I'm asking you a serious question.

73
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,740
Fine, forget about it.

74
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,020
I'm serious about it too.

75
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:28,900
You should date her.

76
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,610
Let me give you an analysis.

77
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,330
A serious analysis.

78
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,330
Let's analyze the girls around you.

79
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:36,970
The first one,

80
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,260
Qin Mingming.

81
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,700
She's not your type.

82
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,860
Then He Meng from the florist.

83
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:47,010
I don't know

84
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,700
if she's interested in you.

85
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,730
But I know that you're definitely

86
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,610
not interested in her.

87
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,220
Then, there's only my sister left.

88
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,540
Xu Ziqi.

89
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,770
That's a no,
 unless you wanna get abused like me.

90
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:00,900
Right?

91
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,410
Xiao Xiu is your best option.

92
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:14,900
We're late.

93
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,740
Mr. Chi!

94
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,130
My dear Mr. Chi!

95
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:21,740
I think,

96
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,180
that fact that you told me about her

97
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,050
means she's different from the others.

98
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,290
You should admit how you feel!

99
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,860
Is Bulb alright now?

100
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,130
It is.

101
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,300
Thanks to Dr. Xu,

102
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,650
Bulb is recovering well.

103
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,090
My brother is taking care of it.

104
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,210
We're all friends.

105
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:34,940
No need to say that.

106
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,020
From now on, call me Zihao.

107
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,610
It's you guys!

108
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:41,570
What do you wanna eat?

109
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,500
You work here?

110
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,900
She says she's Chi Yan's girlfriend.

111
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:49,810
See if there's anything you like.

112
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,220
My treat today.

113
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,250
No. No. No.

114
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,490
We can pay our own bills.

115
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,530
Don't want her to pay?

116
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:58,610
What's your name?

117
00:07:58,730 --> 00:07:59,610
I'm Hugh.

118
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,410
Like Hugh Williams.

119
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,010
Your name is quite special.

120
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,500
We just met,

121
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,570
so we can't let you pay for us.

122
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,480
But you should buy Chi a meal next time.

123
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:10,380
No problem.

124
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,260
Let's order.

125
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,340
Hurry.

126
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:13,570
What do you want?

127
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:14,250
Anything.

128
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:15,810
Any recommendations?

129
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,010
Our Mushroom Risotto

130
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,290
and Tuna No.1 are very popular.

131
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,010
For snacks,

132
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,210
I recommend shrimps and chicken popcorn.

133
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,290
How about we get one each?

134
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,860
You guys take a look.

135
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,420
No need. You decide.

136
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,500
What about drinks?

137
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,530
Three craft beers.

138
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:31,380
We'll order more later.

139
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,610
Okay. Wait a sec.

140
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:35,460
Thank you.

141
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,610
You're welcome.

142
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,620
Stop staring.

143
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:44,290
Don't stare!

144
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,060
Kendo.

145
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,130
Do you still practice Kendo?

146
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:55,290
I do.

147
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,020
But...

148
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,490
But I'm a bit busy lately.

149
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:59,040
So I don't practice as often as I used to.

150
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,690
We shall compete again sometime.

151
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:01,330
I...

152
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,810
You also practice Kendo?

153
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,170
No wonder you overpowered 
the thief so easily the other day.

154
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:07,770
You're flattering me.

155
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,090
My parents always say

156
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,370
I'm not a proper lady.

157
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,540
They don't get what proper ladies are like.

158
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:12,930
I...

159
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,450
I think you looked so cool

160
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,450
when you caught the bad guy.

161
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,170
I think so too.

162
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,770
There's a guy I met on a blind date.

163
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:19,810
You know what he said to me?

164
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:23,130
He said I don't have the tender beauty that women are supposed to have.

165
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:23,740
I was like,

166
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,890
I could easily beat you up, you know?

167
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,820
I think you're absolutely right.

168
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,290
All girls should be like you.

169
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,490
Tough but pretty.

170
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:31,370
Here.

171
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:32,930
Here's the food.

172
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,100
There's one dish left.

173
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,130
I'll bring it in a minute.

174
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:36,210
Thank you.

175
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:36,770
Wait a bit.

176
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:37,330
Thanks.

177
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:43,460
Hugh.

178
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:44,290
Here you are.

179
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,430
Bring these beers to table three.

180
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,570
They're getting impatient.

181
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:47,890
Alright.

182
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,010
Bring the snacks over too.

183
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:49,740
Okay. Okay.

184
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,450
Hurry.

185
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:00,970
Zhang Yi?

186
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:03,380
A fan of yours?

187
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,580
Mr. Zhang, I didn't know

188
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,340
you have fans this pretty.

189
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,050
You're really popular.

190
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,180
It's all because of your support, Mr. Wang.

191
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,060
That's why

192
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,210
we need to work harder on your new book.

193
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,090
You're right.

194
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,930
We'll try to publish a great novel this year.

195
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:17,650
A best-seller.

196
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,450
So that your fans won't get disappointed.

197
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:21,690
Right?

198
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,180
What's wrong with you?

199
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:24,850
What's wrong with you!

200
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:25,890
Why did you touch me?

201
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,290
You touched me first.

202
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,050
You deserve it.

203
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:28,410
Are you crazy?

204
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,530
Waitress, watch your tone.

205
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:31,660
Chi Yan.

206
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,250
What are you doing here?

207
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,740
Zhang, is there anything you wouldn't do?

208
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,250
Let go of me.

209
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,410
Let go of me!

210
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,860
Drop it if you don't wanna embarrass yourself.

211
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,130
Let's go.

212
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:44,250
Let's go.

213
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:45,890
What?

214
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,010
Are you leaving like that?

215
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,700
You slapped me and now you're leaving?

216
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,330
Apologize to me.

217
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:50,900
What are you whining about?

218
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,370
You grabbed me first.

219
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,330
You slapped him?

220
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,060
No matter why she slapped you,

221
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,850
I apologize on her behalf.

222
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:01,460
Why are you apologizing?

223
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,410
Who are you?

224
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,050
Stay out of it.

225
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,660
I want her to apologize, not you.

226
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,010
I want her to apologize.

227
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,450
He touched me first.

228
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,410
What's the matter?

229
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:09,810
Are you the manager here?

230
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,940
Look. Look at my face.

231
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:11,700
Did you see it?

232
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,930
Your waitress slapped me.

233
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,930
Because he grabbed me first!

234
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:16,980
Stop it.

235
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,740
I'm sorry.

236
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,170
She's new here.

237
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,050
She doesn't know the rules.

238
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,010
Please calm down.

239
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,430
I'll ask her to apologize to you.

240
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,130
Hugh, apologize!

241
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,370
Why should I apologize?

242
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:27,660
Ma'am.

243
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,450
Do you wanna keep your job?

244
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,490
Ma'am. Ma'am!

245
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,370
Are the surveillance cameras working?

246
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,130
Yeah.

247
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:35,580
You wanna...

248
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,290
I wanna check the footage.

249
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:36,580
And call the police.

250
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,340
It's fine.

251
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:38,730
Guess we're unlucky.

252
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,490
Let's not get angry because of a waitress.

253
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:42,450
Let's go somewhere else.

254
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,050
Since you've said so, then alright.

255
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,580
I'm sorry.

256
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,780
Your dinner is on the house.

257
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,210
Let me know when you wanna come here again.

258
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,930
I'll reserve the best table for you.

259
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,940
Guests are always right.

260
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:56,990
Why are you making

261
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:57,970
these newbie mistakes?

262
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:58,850
Yes.

263
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,130
Sometimes guys grab your ass

264
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:01,970
when they are drunk.

265
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,690
But they wouldn't do anything serious.

266
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:04,970
But you.

267
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,210
You just slapped him.

268
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,820
Every guest saw that.

269
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,290
Who dare come here anymore?

270
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,210
Am I supposed to let him get away with it?

271
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,400
It's not like he would really assault you.

272
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,420
Tolerance is the best solution. Alright?

273
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,090
Fine.

274
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,940
Not more waitressing for you.

275
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,210
Go take out the trash.

276
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:48,650
Chi Yan.

277
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:53,970
Chi Yan.

278
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,570
You...

279
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,560
I'm taking the trash out.

280
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:13,720
Why are you here?

281
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:26,170
Are... Are you alright?

282
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:28,530
I'm alright.

283
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,170
I'm just taking the trash out.

284
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,130
Why wouldn't I be alright?

285
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:36,050
Sorry, I couldn't help you

286
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,570
Zhang Yi get what he deserves.

287
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:40,850
Thank you.

288
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,090
Are you okay?

289
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:49,920
I'm fine.

290
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:51,450
You...

291
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:53,900
What's wrong?

292
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:55,850
I know that

293
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,410
you had some unpleasant

294
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:58,450
past experiences with Zhang.

295
00:13:58,890 --> 00:13:59,890
He slandered you.

296
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:02,130
And your mom took his side instead of yours.

297
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,250
It must have been horrible for you

298
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,130
when you saw him just now.

299
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,690
You know all these?

300
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:11,570
That guy...

301
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,450
I'm fuming every time I see his face.

302
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,850
How could someone be this shameless?

303
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:16,770
Without you,

304
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:17,930
he would be nothing.

305
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:18,810
You're his ghostwriter.

306
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,330
You got him everything he has now.

307
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:21,490
Why does he keep slandering you?

308
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:22,600
And your mom.

309
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:23,970
I can't imagine it.

310
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:24,730
Why would there be

311
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,730
such horrible moms on Earth?

312
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,490
She doesn't even trust her own son.

313
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:29,370
It's fine.

314
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:33,930
I've made peace with all that.

315
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:36,770
People like Zhang Yi

316
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:39,290
are not worthy of our energy.

317
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,050
As for my mom,

318
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:43,370
I've figured it out too.

319
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,200
There's no use resenting her.

320
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,270
It would only cause more pain for me.

321
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:52,890
Thank you.

322
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:56,850
For sticking up for me just now.

323
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:01,050
I should be the one thanking you.

324
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:04,330
Then...

325
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:06,770
You are not angry at me?

326
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:08,890
Why would I be angry at you?

327
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:12,530
Then...

328
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,760
Can we go back to how we used to be?

329
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:16,930
No. No. No.

330
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:17,730
I mean.

331
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,850
Let's forget about all these unpleasant things,

332
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,370
and make new memories together.

333
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,440
Happy and fun memories.

334
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,130
You, me,

335
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,490
Xu Zihao and Qin Mingming.

336
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:29,530
Let's do the things we used to do.

337
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,410
Go to the supermarket,

338
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,330
go on walks,

339
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,040
have dinner together,

340
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,920
and go explore many, many new places.

341
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:40,610
Tomorrow...

342
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,580
What are you doing tomorrow?

343
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,440
It's my day off tomorrow,

344
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,810
and I think I'll be free all day.

345
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:56,920
I'm going to practice Kendo.

346
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:58,850
Kendo.

347
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:00,130
Kendo.

348
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:02,890
Are you interested?

349
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:22,000
I'll see you tomorrow.

350
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:24,640
See you tomorrow.

351
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,820
You're doing it wrong.

352
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,410
This line here,

353
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,210
is like the back of your sword.

354
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,680
So it has to be upright.

355
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:55,530
Facing up.

356
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:58,960
Also, put your hand

357
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,770
a bit lower.

358
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:04,770
Right.

359
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,130
Hold it.

360
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:10,640
Right.

361
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:11,960
Remember it.

362
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:22,079
Let's try it.

363
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,400
Try again.

364
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,890
If we were on a TV show,

365
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,890
you would have lost catastrophically.

366
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:49,920
It's okay. Let's do it again.

367
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:51,410
Let's do it.

368
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,640
Watch your steps.

369
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:06,810
You've learned a lot.

370
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:07,890
Let's try again.

371
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,690
Again.

372
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:12,850
Hey.

373
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:13,610
Chi Yan.

374
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,320
The publisher decided to publish your new novel.

375
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,160
If you can,

376
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,130
come to the publisher now.

377
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,160
Alright, I'm on my way.

378
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,130
Wait for me there.

379
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:20,720
See you in a bit.

380
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,210
Alright.

381
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,560
Hao Qingsong?

382
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:25,690
Yeah.

383
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,640
I knew you could do it!

384
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,330
Chi Yan!

385
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,330
Sorry. I'm afraid

386
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:32,010
I can't have dinner with you tonight.

387
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,880
How about I tag along?

388
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,640
The two of us can grab a bite

389
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,810
when you're finished.

390
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,840
You need food to survive.

391
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:43,450
I promise,

392
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:44,970
I will be a good girl

393
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,210
and behave myself.

394
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,080
Go change your clothes.

395
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:11,840
Chi Yan?

396
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,640
What are you doing here?

397
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,250
For a job.

398
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,090
The waitress.

399
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:22,490
The bartender.

400
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,250
What are you doing here,

401
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,050
bring people their drinks?

402
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,530
A new book?

403
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,120
Let me have a look.

404
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,290
What bad could it be?

405
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,000
Without marketing and advertising,

406
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,930
those old bastards would never publish this.

407
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,920
Chi Yan's novel is about to be published

408
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,650
without marketing and advertising.

409
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,050
Keep up the good work.

410
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:11,960
Oops, sorry.

411
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,920
My bad.

412
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,730
Come to me when you fail, okay?

413
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:40,850
Hugh,

414
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:41,850
just don't.

415
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,440
You worked hard on these.

416
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,520
I can't let them just be like this.

417
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,210
It's fine.

418
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,440
We'll just print out another copy.

419
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:54,610
Xiao Xiu, Xiao Xiu!

420
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,250
It's dangerous, stop!

421
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,360
Watch out!

422
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:11,680
U wanna die?

423
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:21,840
You okay?

424
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,730
Did you just remember something?

425
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,330
You,

426
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,120
that car?

427
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:03,880
What?

428
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,120
Hugh?

429
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,400
Xiao Xiu!

430
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:10,200
Xiao Xiu!

431
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,360
It's me,

432
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,120
Hugh Williams.

433
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,280
You are the one who gave me this name.

434
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:56,880
A cat's reward?

435
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,240
Have you heard of it?

436
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,930
Of course I have.

437
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:01,960
Right.

438
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,010
Grandpa, grandpa's wine,

439
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,680
and the grapevines that we planted.

440
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:07,240
You know about my grandpa?

441
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,920
I know you are allergic to peanuts.

442
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,360
Did you just remember something?

443
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:34,680
I consider it a plot in those

444
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,600
fairy tales.

445
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,880
I didn't expect it to be real.

446
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,330
Where have you been?

447
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,760
Do you still want this job or not?

448
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,480
What do I need to do

449
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,880
to help you transform into a human?

450
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,960
Purr if you

451
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,690
understand.

452
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,800
That's helpful.

453
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,240
Are you hungry?

454
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,480
Do you want to hang out?

455
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,280
Go.

456
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:42,720
Easy.

457
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,720
What? A three-day off?

458
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,000
Why don't you just resign?

459
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,400
Who sends text messages to call a day off like that?

460
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:56,840
I warn you,

461
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,560
you can't just do that.

462
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,200
Busted, my god.

463
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,270
I'm screwed,

464
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:00,960
so screwed.

465
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,400
Screwed.

466
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:05,400
How should I put this?

467
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,640
I, I'm sick?

468
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,600
No, no, wrong.

469
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,240
I,

470
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:10,560
I broke my leg?

471
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,320
Yes, I broke my leg!

472
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:12,710
I...

473
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,720
-Should I...
 -Sorry.

474
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,560
Should I...

475
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,640
I don't know when will you transform into a human.

476
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,680
Your boss was impatient.

477
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,080
So, I asked for a three-day off.

478
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,110
I shouldn't have messed with your stuff.

479
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,120
It's okay,

480
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,880
it's okay as long as

481
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,360
I'm not fired.

482
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,240
Was I like this before?

483
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,120
You were!

484
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:37,910
I was?

485
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,520
You used to buy me pretty dresses,

486
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,960
cook me delicious food

487
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,280
and take me outside to have fun.

488
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,720
You also used to take me to enjoy the sunset.

489
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:47,840
That's me?

490
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:48,560
That's you!

491
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,160
Can we go right now?

492
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,550
I...

493
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,150
You know,

494
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,280
I once watched a film.

495
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,040
They say,

496
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,240
when the sun is almost down

497
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,840
but it's not completely dark,

498
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,910
that's a magical moment.

499
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,400
At that moment, the sun

500
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,840
is breathtakingly beautiful.

501
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,440
But it will only last for a couple of minutes.

502
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,160
Think about it,

503
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,200
I always need to be prepared

504
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,630
and patient

505
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:31,040
in real life,

506
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:33,840
does that mean

507
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,110
a miracle would come

508
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,960
with the next magical moment?

509
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,440
I don't know about that.

510
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,200
But for magical moments,

511
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,840
I suppose,

512
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,910
even though we have no idea 
what tomorrow's gonna be like,

513
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:57,640
as long as we can watch the sunset,

514
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,360
we kind of know

515
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,160
that tomorrow would eventually arrive.

516
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,070
You've got a point.

517
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,960
Like those characters have said,

518
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,840
if you have already missed today's magical moment,

519
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,310
just wait for the next one.

520
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,750
What?

521
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,910
Is this a special date for you?

522
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:42,880
It's the tenth anniversary of this bookstore.

523
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:47,960
Uncle Han.

524
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,510
About what I've told you before on the phone,

525
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:50,800
they've authorised

526
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,030
to tear this place down.

527
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,840
Since your grandpa, your family has been my tenant

528
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,200
for ten years.

529
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,750
To be honest,

530
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,390
if they don't tear this place down,

531
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,920
I would keep renting this place to you.

532
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,280
I understand.

533
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:19,200
The files are about to be signed.

534
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,750
You should find another place.

535
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,440
Take care, Uncle Han.

536
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,390
Thanks a lot.

537
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,600
Come on.

538
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,080
About the tenth anniversary of the bookstore,

539
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
how about we have

540
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,550
a small celebration?

541
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,720
This way,

542
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,630
we have something

543
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,440
to remember grandpa and the bookstore by.

544
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,030
Shall we?

545
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:18,840
Okay.

546
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,680
But how should we do it?

547
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:21,920
Leave it to me.

548
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,030
But let's see,

549
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:27,600
let's do the math,

550
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,750
helping you organise the celebration,

551
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,760
yesterday, I helped you pick up the draft,

552
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,800
about the price...

553
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:35,880
I'll give you a discount.

554
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:37,520
How about you buy me a nice meal?

555
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,230
I'll buy you two nice meals.

556
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,590
But

557
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,880
about the raffle that we are going to have,

558
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,760
you are the one who has a final say

559
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,640
on the prizes.

560
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,550
It's your call.

561
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:52,430
Other than that, leave it to me.

562
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:53,720
We will have that celebration.

563
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,120
But I want to keep it small.

564
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,000
I'll post the registration link on my website

565
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,230
and set a maximum of 40 guests.

566
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,310
Sure.

567
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,550
We have one week left.

568
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:06,630
I'm on it now.

569
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:07,440
We still have one...

570
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:18,190
Mengmeng.

571
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:22,590
We'll have a celebration
 at the bookstore next week,

572
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,310
please help me with the flowers.

573
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,280
Okay,

574
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,550
what do you have in mind?

575
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,680
As long as they are elegant,

576
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,640
it's up to you.

577
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,030
Remember to give me a discount.

578
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,230
What's wrong?

579
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:41,030
Uncle Fu,

580
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:43,350
how come I can't maintain a human form?

581
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,880
Because you used to

582
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,720
have a pact.

583
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:51,120
Also, Chi Yan was blessed by the cat seal.

584
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,120
Now that you've already granted a wish,

585
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,430
and Chi Yan is no longer blessed by the cat seal,

586
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:03,510
it becomes more difficult

587
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:05,070
for you to maintain a human form

588
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,000
here on Earth.

589
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,430
I'm okay,

590
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,120
just felt a little dizzy.

591
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,270
Don't mind me.

592
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:15,070
Back to work.

593
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,120
Bye-bye.

594
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:32,520
I'm back.

595
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,600
I only took two days off.

596
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,830
Only two days?

597
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,350
You didn't ask for leave,

598
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,270
you were absent.

599
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,710
Don't be upset.

600
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:43,910
Here, have a lollipop.

601
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,870
I'm on a diet.

602
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,710
The bar is also about to be torn down?

603
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:53,790
Right.

604
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,750
This whole block is about to be torn down.

605
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,830
Where would the bar move to?

606
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,070
I don't know yet.

607
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:04,880
But

608
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,790
it shouldn't be too far from here.

609
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,360
After all,

610
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,150
we've been doing business here for several years.

611
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,190
Boss,

612
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,270
I heard that Chi's Bookstore

613
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,469
is having a celebration next week

614
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:17,199
for its tenth anniversary.

615
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:19,429
We can collaborate with the bookstore.

616
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,920
Not only can we pay tribute

617
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,150
to our usual customers,

618
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,080
we can also spread news 
about the new spot for the bar.

619
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:27,670
What do you say?

620
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,159
It sounds

621
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:33,949
pretty good.

622
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,239
I'll go talk to Chi Yan then.

623
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:36,630
Don't bother.

624
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:37,760
You can just talk to me.

625
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,040
Which side are you on anyway?

626
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:46,389
I'm just a middleman that doesn't pocket the difference.

627
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,150
Here, take this.

628
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:49,550
Here's the thing,

629
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,750
the celebration for the tenth anniversary 
of Chi's Bookstore

630
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:54,040
still needs a host who can lighten the mood.

631
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,510
Who should it be?

632
00:34:55,989 --> 00:34:57,360
Your name is the first one that popped out.

633
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,120
You made the right call.

634
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,910
When it comes to

635
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,150
lightening the mood,

636
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,510
I am definitely the best.

637
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,190
Right?

638
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:06,390
Then it's settled.

639
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,070
Next Thursday, mark your calendar.

640
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,390
You got it.

641
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,560
Deal.

642
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:17,390
I have other arrangements

643
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:18,510
to make.

644
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,430
See you next Thursday.

645
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,560
Remember our deal.

646
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:23,470
Mingming.

647
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,230
Bye-bye.

648
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,190
Hello.

649
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,430
You took Bulb here for the therapy

650
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,190
Miss. Man,

651
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:34,350
please take Bulb to the physical.

652
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:34,880
Got it.

653
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:45,950
Cai, Lucy,

654
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:46,470
keep up the good work.

655
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:47,230
Hi, Lulu.

656
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:53,550
Why did she come to you?

657
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:53,920
I was about to ask.

658
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,190
What do you think...

659
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,070
Nervous?

660
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:06,190
Nervous?

661
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:10,430
Things must have been pretty good at the hospital.

662
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,680
Look at the food you prepared for customers.

663
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:14,790
She...

664
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:15,630
Please take a seat.

665
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:16,990
It's not...

666
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,270
She, this is Qin Mingming.

667
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:19,760
Her dog is my patient.

668
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,320
Hi.

669
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,150
The name is Bulb.

670
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:22,150
Nice to meet you.

671
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,280
Bulb?

672
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:27,750
A perfect name for a third wheel.

673
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,270
Maybe I should take a look at Bulb.

674
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:38,670
It's upstairs.

675
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,800
Is Bulb seriously sick?

676
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,630
Why such nice food?

677
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,200
You must be a VIP.

678
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,910
Is there still hope for Bulb?

679
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,190
If you keep coming here frequently,

680
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,470
it's just unfair

681
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:48,430
to let other customers know that.

682
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,360
It's fine.

683
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:51,190
It was just bitten.

684
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,680
Some dogs just don't know manners.

685
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:54,440
It was bitten because

686
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,470
it stole food from others.

687
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:57,520
Lulu, she is just a customer.

688
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,670
What's that about?

689
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,550
Xu Zihao, am I stupid to you?

690
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,360
Look at you.

691
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,750
I know you too well.

692
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:05,350
Dr. Xu,

693
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:06,670
Bulb is okay to leave.

694
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:07,470
Thank you.

695
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:08,710
Bulb, let's go.

696
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,480
Sorry about that.

697
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:13,190
Sorry about what?

698
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:14,830
What are you apologising for?

699
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,590
Why did you apologise to her?

700
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:17,990
Let's just talk about this inside.

701
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:18,910
Don't touch me!

702
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,470
You must think I'm being unreasonable.

703
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,670
Don't you know why?

704
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:24,360
There are so many people,

705
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,750
please, let's talk inside.

706
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,000
Get off me!

707
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:29,110
You know exactly why I did that.

708
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:29,990
I wasn't...

709
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,590
That's because of you!

710
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,070
Please, can we talk inside?

711
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,630
Why should I be reasonable?

712
00:37:56,060 --> 00:38:02,260
[Chi's Bookstore
Farewell Party]

713
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,040
Bro,

714
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:22,030
have you found a new spot?

715
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:23,590
Not yet.

716
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,870
I'll come to help when you move.

717
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:30,390
Okay.

718
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:32,630
This is the last one.

719
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:33,950
When people arrive,

720
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:35,510
give each of them one of these.

721
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,110
Welcome. This way, please.

722
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:38,230
Welcome.

723
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,910
This is your token for the raffle.

724
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:40,510
Okay, thanks.

725
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,510
This is a souvenir for you.

726
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:42,350
Please take it.

727
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:42,750
Thanks.

728
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:43,350
Here.

729
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:44,470
Okay.

730
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:47,550
Welcome. Please sign up here.

731
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:48,910
Sign up here, please.

732
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:50,080
Welcome.

733
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,470
This is your token for the raffle.

734
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:52,110
Thanks.

735
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:57,990
Okay, without further ado,

736
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,590
let's give the floor

737
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,950
to the most handsome guy in this block,

738
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:01,790
Boss Chi!

739
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:09,670
Don't listen to the host, everyone.

740
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:11,300
He only said that

741
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,640
because we didn't pay him.

742
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:22,670
First...

743
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,830
Thank you.

744
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:31,470
Thank you for

745
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:34,270
coming to this party organised by

746
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,430
Chi's Bookstore and the bar.

747
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:40,020
A while back,

748
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,750
when I was preparing for this speech,

749
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:45,420
the thought of giving a speech

750
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,230
just made me nervous.

751
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:49,550
But when I got on the stage

752
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:53,070
and saw you guys, my usual customers,

753
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,310
I felt much more relaxed.

754
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,870
I see Mr. Plaid-shirt.

755
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,030
You still love to sit

756
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,350
at a distinctive spot.

757
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,110
I also see

758
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:07,190
the lady who loves Jean-Paul Sartre.

759
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,270
I heard you talk about

760
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:10,230
existentialism with your friend.

761
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:11,350
There's something you probably don't know.

762
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,140
That gentleman sitting next to you

763
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,510
is the biggest fan of Albert Camus.

764
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:15,510
I hope

765
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:16,950
that the two of you

766
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:17,870
wouldn't end up like those two.

767
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:19,740
See,

768
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:22,870
all you bookworms feel comfortable

769
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:23,750
at this event.

770
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:26,150
I suppose nobody cares

771
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:27,910
what a boring owner of a bookstore

772
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:28,990
would talk about.

773
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:30,710
We do care.

774
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:31,740
We'd like to know

775
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,500
whether you've finished reading Ulysses.

776
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:35,310
You've been reading that for a month.

777
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:36,870
I finished it the day before yesterday,

778
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,630
feels like finishing a game to me.

779
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,070
I feel good.

780
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:43,910
Talking to you like this

781
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:47,030
feels like having a conversation

782
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,430
with some old friends.

783
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:51,830
This reminds me of ten years ago,

784
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:54,350
when my grandpa first opened this bookstore.

785
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,310
Back then, I was

786
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:57,550
just an ignorant student.

787
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,260
I was sensitive, fragile,

788
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:02,110
and loved to seek comfort from books.

789
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:04,710
But I've changed.

790
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,710
I've changed because of you.

791
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:10,550
I've also been through a lot.

792
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,150
Although this block is about to be torn down,

793
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:14,750
Chi's Bookstore

794
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:15,630
will always be there for you.

795
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:17,350
We'll always

796
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,030
provide you with a quiet

797
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:23,190
and comfortable place to read, and think.

798
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:26,750
I hope that when it's the twentieth,

799
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:27,910
the thirtieth,

800
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:30,310
or even the fortieth and the fiftieth anniversary,

801
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:31,590
I'll still be with you.

802
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,110
Thank you.

803
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:47,510
This one is for you, take it.

804
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,310
Where's Mingming?

805
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,020
You didn't invite her?

806
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:12,070
She said she is too busy to come.

807
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:14,070
She sent flowers.

808
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,350
You didn't see those?

809
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,070
We have so many guests,

810
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:24,590
but you only care about Qin Mingming.

811
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:26,500
It's just a casual question.

812
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:30,870
You want to see her, right?

813
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:33,100
I don't want this one.

814
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:35,190
Go get one yourself.

815
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:39,500
This one's fine.

816
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:42,580
Here.

817
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,220
When the new store is ready,

818
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,310
I'll send you the address.

819
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:46,070
Okay.

820
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:47,030
Don't forget to send the new address.

821
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,230
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

822
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:49,790
Chi Yan!

823
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:50,820
Mingming.

824
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:52,510
Sorry, I was too busy.

825
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:53,190
I couldn't make it.

826
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:54,550
Liangliang.

827
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:55,830
Never mind.

828
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:56,900
Liangliang helped a lot.

829
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:57,660
Really?

830
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:58,540
He helped?

831
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:00,910
Anything I can do to help now?

832
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:01,710
I guess no.

833
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:02,380
We are almost done here.

834
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,750
We do need help here, Mingming.

835
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:04,580
Mingming.

836
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:05,310
What are you doing?

837
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:05,900
I'm helping you.

838
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:08,190
Xu Zihao didn't drive here

839
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:09,270
because he has to drink.

840
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:10,710
Never mind,

841
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:11,830
I'll just call a cab, Hugh.

842
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:12,910
What cab?

843
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:14,030
They are all leaving.

844
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:14,670
There must be

845
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:16,190
a long queue for a cab.

846
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,580
It's not safe when it's dark outside.

847
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:18,710
So, Mingming?

848
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,390
Okay.

849
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:24,550
I'll give you a ride.

850
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:26,350
Thanks.

851
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:27,580
So,

852
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:28,750
go.

853
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:29,780
Thank you, guys.

854
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:30,900
I still have work to do.

855
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:33,180
Chi Yan, bye-bye.

856
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:33,860
Bye.

857
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:01,580
What are you reading?

858
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,660
A collection of the wishes 
that the customers wrote.

859
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:07,100
Thank you for today,

860
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:09,860
you made it possible.

861
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:10,700
You must be exhausted.

862
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,390
Actually,

863
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:21,910
I also have a wish.

864
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,350
Why do you have this?

865
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:24,870
I remember that...

866
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:26,750
He gave it to me.

867
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:29,510
I asked him for it.
