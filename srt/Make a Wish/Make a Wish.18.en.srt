00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,740
I need to talk to you.

00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,620
Two more kilometres.

7
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,130
Keep up.

8
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,100
I really need to talk to you.

9
00:02:59,100 --> 00:02:59,980
After this.

10
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,820
I really need to talk to you right now.

11
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:06,980
Fine, go ahead.

12
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,140
I...

13
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,140
I have a phobia

14
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,050
and it got worse recently.

15
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:23,340
Whenever I hear the word, you know,

16
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,260
I throw up.

Marriage?

21
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,660
When I was little,

22
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,570
my parents got divorced.

23
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,980
I know my mom and sister love me.

24
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,020
But I witnessed a lot of fights

25
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,780
between my parents.

26
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,500
After they got divorced,

27
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,690
my mom didn't forgive my dad.

28
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,540
She is regretful.

29
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,220
So, I am scared of marriage

30
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,290
since I was a kid.

31
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,660
Later, I went to college,

32
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,380
there was this girl who liked me.

33
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,019
I said yes without much thinking.

34
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:21,779
I was young

35
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,020
and I never really thought about

36
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,020
the future.

37
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,890
But she thought

38
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,340
I don't want to... You know what.

39
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,380
So, she tried to commit suicide.

40
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,980
From then on, I became even more scared

41
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,260
about that word.

42
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,050
Have you ever visited a therapist about this?

43
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,250
The doctor said

44
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,060
this is because of my psychological issue,

45
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,180
medicines won't help.

46
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,570
It got worse recently

47
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,860
and I think the reason is that

48
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,260
you are the girl that I love the most.

49
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:11,740
I care about you too much.

50
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,300
You must be thinking

51
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,420
that I am a jerk,

52
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,100
or I am trying to

53
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:18,980
find an excuse for myself.

54
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,100
But the truth is...

55
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,340
I believe in you.

56
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,210
But to be honest,

57
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,850
I am not the kind of girl who doesn't want a marriage.

58
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,740
My parents passed when Liangliang and I

59
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,740
were little.

60
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,500
We were raised by

61
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,340
Uncle Gao and Aunt Lou.

62
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,580
They are very nice to us

and I am really grateful.

I always feel

66
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:51,380
I always feel

67
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,260
there's an empty space in my heart.

68
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:57,540
So, I always

69
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,659
want a small family

70
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,330
of my own.

71
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,740
We can spend a lot of time

72
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,700
happily together.

73
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,250
Many claim that piece of certificate unimportant.

74
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,740
But I actually care about it.

75
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:16,820
However,

76
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,860
what's more important is that

77
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,450
you're being honest with me,

78
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,650
and you're willing to share it with me.

79

So, relax,

Sure, let's go.

87
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,610
Haven't found it yet.

88
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,220
We'll search for it in the old mansion tomorrow.

00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,740
Don't come upstairs.

94
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,370
You cover the ground floor.

95
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,460
I'll look for it on the first floor.

96
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,610
Why did you come up here?

97
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,100
We have no idea what a cat seal looks like.

98
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,860
How can we find it?

99
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,540
But we have to try.

100
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,220
That seal

101
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:05,820
allows a human and a cat

102
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,300
to make a love pact,

103
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,180
it's important.

104
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:10,660
Stop looking for it

105
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,220
and follow me.

106
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,340
Nature is so amazing.

107
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,420
Being with you is amazing.

108
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,900
A lot of amazing things happened

109
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,730
since then.

110
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,780
So, rest assured,

111
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,620
we can be together forever

112
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,500
even without the cat seal.

113
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:19,820
What,

114
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,980
you are willing to let go now?

115
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:25,540
My girl has grown up.

116
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,620
She doesn't need me as she used to now.

117
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,220
As a parent,

118
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,060
you only get to be with them for part of the journey.

119
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,620
They need to be self-dependent

120
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,330
for the rest of that journey.

121
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,220
I know,

122
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,180
but I still can't let go.

123
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,450
If there is someone out there

124
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,500
who can protect and take care of her for you,

125
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,220
you should be happy.

126
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,100
Now,

127
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,740
I can only wish for the best

128
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,700
for them.

129

and work hard towards the best.

135

136
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,100
We didn't find the cat seal today.

137
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,420
We will keep on looking for it tomorrow.

138
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,420
As long as I take the cat seal away,

139
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,460
I can hurt him, right?

140
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,140
Xu Zihao?

141
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,260
He used to be a chubby little boy.

142
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,780
Yep, that's it.

143
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,020
Right, right, right, he told me about that.

144
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:03,540
He said,

145
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,780
he was trying to lose some weight

146
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,260
and you used to jog with him,

147
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:07,860
right?

148
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,180
He forced me to jog with him.

149
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,660
Your friendship hasn't changed a bit.

150
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,260
These books

151
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,860
were my favourite when I was a child.

152
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,340
How about I read to you?

153
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,220
Sure.

154
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,540
Two tiny, free bubbles

155
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,220
Rise from the depth of dreams

156
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,420
A vague haze, a silvery mist

157
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,860
Lifts in a soft breeze.

158
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,820
Like a little child

159
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,620
I cling to you, as you fade away.

160
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,620
And dream of the soft look

161
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,820
your eyes once had,

162
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,980
and of their

163
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,930
shadows deep.

164
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,770
This one sounds romantic.

165
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,700
It reminds me of happiness.

166
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,460
That's how we'll be.

167
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,260
Happy.

168
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:24,890
We will be.

169
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,060
I remember you once told me

170
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,500
about something that a writer said.

171
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,460
Love is

172
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,250
wanting to touch something

173
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,420
but too afraid to do so.

174
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,620
I always find it difficult to understand.

175
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,820
That's not the case for me.

176
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,580
For me, love is

177
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,460
all those moments

178
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,340
when I want to hold you tight,

179
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,140
like this.

180
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,180
I won't let go.

181
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,540
I want to show you something.

182
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,530
This book

183
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,690
was my grandpa's favourite.

184
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:19,980
It's so beautiful.

185
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,420
Can I keep this?

186
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:23,420
Sure you can.

187
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,050
Never mind.

188
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,490
This book belongs to your grandpa.

189
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:30,660
He wanted you to have

190
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,940
whatever is inside this book.

191
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,740
You should keep it.

192
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,620
This bookmark is important to my grandpa.

193
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,170
But you are also important to me.

194
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,980
If he gets to meet you,

195
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,690
he would like you a lot.

196
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,140
So,

197
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,380
I give it to you on behalf of my grandpa.

198
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,220
Thank you.

199
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,740
It's a little cat.

200
00:13:59,300 --> 00:13:59,900
it's a...

201
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,500
Revenge?

202
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,970
I heard that a cat

203
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,820
was asking about the cat seal.

204
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,180
He even returned to the Meow Planet

205
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,220
to ask those senior cats.

206
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,850
Nobody takes the cat seal seriously,

207
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,860
they all consider it just a tale.

208
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,780
Also, there are rumours about that cat.

209
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,940
Something about revenge

210
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,220
for his dead lover.

211
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,580
It can't be the one you ran into, can it?

212
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,420
What does the cat seal have to do with revenge?

213
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,540
You don't know?

214
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:06,780
Rumour has it

215
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,900
that we can't kill a human

216
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,170
with the cat seal.

217
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,860
So, that cat is trying to find a way

218
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,130
to destroy that cat seal.

219
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:15,980
Oops.

220
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:16,820
What's wrong?

221
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,780
Xiao Xu has been looking for the cat seal.

222
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:19,780
I was wondering,

223
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,780
she used to doze off in history classes,

224
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,580
how come

225
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,660
she suddenly got interested in history?

226
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,900
I think Chi Yan is in danger.

227
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,260
Is it far from the city here?

228
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,020
Nope.

229
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,900
Let's go now, immediately.

230
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:33,860
I'll explain it to you on the way.

231
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,810
Hurry up, hurry.

232
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:22,940
Calm down and listen to me.

233
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,339
The one who murdered your sister is right next-door.

234
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,380
I won't let him harm you.

235
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:29,580
Sorry.

236
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:30,980
Wait here.

237
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,500
It will be all over soon.

238
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,370
Lin Mo!

239
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,460
Lin Mo, stop! Listen to me!

240
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:14,980
Lin Mo!

241
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,500
Hugh!

242
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:18,220
Stay away!

243
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,540
Lin Mo!

244
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,020
Lin Mo, listen to me!

245
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,420
Chi Yan can't be the one who murdered my sister!

246
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:23,980
Lin Mo!

247
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,420
Lin Mo, are you out of your mind?

248
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,340
What are you doing?

249
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,820
The white cat that you killed back in high school

250
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,580
was Hugh's sister

251
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,340
and my lover!

252
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:42,940
Careful!

253
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:51,900
Get lost!

254
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:53,860
Get lost!

255
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,020
Chi Yan?

256
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,420
Chi Yan, Chi Yan, Chi Yan.

257
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:12,770
Chi Yan.

258
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,420
Chi Yan, we are at the hospital.

259
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,130
Chi Yan?

260
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,300
Chi Yan!

261
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,090
Excuse me,

262
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,140
you'll have to wait outside.

263
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:00,780
Xiao Xu!

264
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:01,980
Xiao Xu!

265
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,700
Dad.

266
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:04,780
Xiao Xu?

267
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,100
Hugh.

268
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,740
Are you all right, Xiao Xu?

269
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,340
Xiao Xu, it's okay.

270
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,020
Chi Yan will be fine.

271
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,300
Chi Yan will be fine.

272
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,220
There there.

273
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,850
There there.

274
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,300
Dad.

275
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,660
There there.

276
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,420
Chi Yan will be fine.

277
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:52,820
Don't worry.

278
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:08,940
It's okay.

279
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,580
It won't hurt.

280
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,060
Hugh,

281
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,820
I have something to tell you.

282
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,900
Hugh, Hugh?

283
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,300
Let's get out of here.

284
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:26,700
Here.

285
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,380
Chi Yan gave the cat seal to you

286
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,220
and lost the Meow Planet's protection.

287
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,340
That's why Lin Mo could hurt him.

288
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,450
The cat seal.

289
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,260
How did my sister die?

290
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,820
Your mom and I want nothing but happiness for you.

291
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:03,900
Are you relatives of the patient?

292
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,020
He's awake.

293
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,020
Relatives may visit him now.

294
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,500
Chi Yan!

295
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,420
How are you?

296
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:16,500
Uncle Fu.

297
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:17,540
Mister.

298
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:18,930
The doctor said,

299
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,860
it may hurt a little.

300
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,260
Dad and Uncle Fu are here.

301
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,660
I'm sorry.

302
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,700
Why?

303
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,330
Now that I think of it,

304
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,100
Lin Mo only approached me

305
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,540
because of you.

306
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,210
Chi Yan, I'm sorry.

307
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,620
Don't be. I feel much better now.

308
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,380
Look.

309
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,300
Hugh.

310
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,300
Uncle Fu.

311
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,780
I'd like some time alone with Xiao Xu's dad.

312
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,540
Don't move.

313
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:21,580
Stay still. Don't move.

314
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,100
I'm sorry.

315
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,620
I couldn't protect her.

316
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,580
But I guarantee you,

317
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,660
I will find the murderer.

318
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,380
Don't be too hard on yourself.

319
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,660
You are not the one to blame.

320
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,940
All these years,

321
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,020
we've been trying to avoid talking about it.

322
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,420
But I think of Hugh's sister every day.

323
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,570
I can tell,

324
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,650
Hugh's mom does the same thing.

325
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,780
But she won't be back

326
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,340
even if we have revenge.

327
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:02,860
So,

328
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:04,900
I hope that you can

329
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,060
live a happy life.

330
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,740
Don't be like us,

331
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,290
carrying so much burden

332
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:12,050
and couldn't let go.

333
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,620
Hatred is never a solution.

334
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,700
Now I know

335
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,900
why you hated me.

336
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,460
I misjudged you.

337
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:25,620
There, you see,

338
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,340
hatred is never a good thing.

339
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,140
Mister, be assured,

340
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:36,540
I will take good care of Hugh.

341
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:37,810
I won't let you

342
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:39,100
lose another daughter.

343
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,540
I won't let myself lose her.

344
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:47,900
Lin, Lin Mo,

345
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,780
how is he?

346
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,420
Fu and I will go find him

347
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,970
and bring him here.

348
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,170
You need to solve this face to face,

349
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,810
the misunderstanding must be solved.

350
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:24,620
Lin Mo,

351
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,100
you listen to me.

352
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,450
Lin Mo,

353
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,380
your body won't be able to handle it

354
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,700
for long.

355
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,850
It's time to go home.

356
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,370
I don't care.

357
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,570
You still think Chi Yan is the murderer?

358
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,300
Fu told me.

359
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,420
Chi Yan and his grandpa

360
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,100
were nice to stray cats.

361
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,020
They used to feed those cats.

362
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,930
Chi Yan loves Hugh so much,

363
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,900
there's no way he killed her sister.

364
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,660
After all these years,

365
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,540
I've always wanted to go home.

366
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,980
This planet is so filthy and hypocritical.

367
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,620
But whenever I close my eyes,

368
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:19,340
I see her dying body

369
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,770
and there's nothing I can do.

370
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,370
I know you love her.

371
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:33,180
But what's more difficult than love

372
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:34,940
is to let go.

373
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,410
Lin Mo,

374
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,660
come visit Chi Yan with us.

375
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,100
Hugh.

376
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:56,860
Xiao Xiu!

377
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:57,500
Hugh, Hugh!

378
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,380
Xiao Xiu, calm down!

379
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,530
Xiao Xiu. Xiao Xiu!

380
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,170
Hugh, calm down!

381
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:05,500
I asked to see him.

382
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,940
I have something to tell him.

383
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,100
Then I also want to hear it.

384
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,380
What did the doctor say?

385
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:21,900
It's not a big deal.

386
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,180
Just need to stay here for a couple more days.

387
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,620
I stabbed you

388
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:27,900
while you were trying to save me.

389
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,450
I'm sorry.

390
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,900
You still think I did that,

391
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,420
right?

392
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,380
Back then, everyone believed

393
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,170
that I was the one who killed Hugh's sister.

394
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,860
Nobody tried to find out the truth,

395
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,580
or nobody cared

396
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,060
about the truth.

397
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,260
Now that I'm with Hugh,

398
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,940
believe it or not,

399
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,740
I want you to know,

400
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,700
I know how you feel.

401
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,900
I was just trying to protect Xiao Xui.

402
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,220
I didn't know...

403
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,370
Uncle Fu kept trying to help me let go.

404
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,500
He told me

405
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,860
that revenge would solve nothing.

406
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,820
But I just couldn't let go.

407
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,540
I have to find the murderer.

408
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,900
Then, even without doing anything,

409
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,420
I must have closure.

410
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,250
We'll help you find the murderer.

411
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:57,620
I'm sorry.

412
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,900
I used you for the cat seal.

413
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,020
The first time we met,

414
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:06,140
you reminded me of your sister a lot.

415
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,020
I didn't know

416
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,660
the two of you were sisters.

417
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:13,980
I will never forgive you

418
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,180
for what you did to Chi Yan.

419
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:20,740
But I know

420
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,380
what you did is  for my sister.

421
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:56,940
My sister's death is unfortunate.

422
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,460
But she was fortunate to meet you.

423
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:04,820
Thank you for loving her,

424
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,810
remembering her,

425
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:08,980
and trying to seek revenge for her.

426
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,460
But you don't have to be like this.

427
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,580
You can't stay here in human form

428
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,020
for a long time.

429
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:24,290
So, even if you return to the Meow Planet

430
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:25,060
and start a new life,

431
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,260
my sister would understand.

432
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,180
My sister is family,

433
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,050
I am obliged

434
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:41,380
to find that murderer.

435
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,700
Can you and your dad really let go?

436
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,020
How can we let go?

437
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,060
My mom and dad never talk about it.

438
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,940
But I can tell,

439
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,850
it's impossible for them to let go.

440
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,900
That's my sister.

441
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,580
But do you know

442
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,580
what's the biggest difference between you and us?

443
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,570
We try to live in the moment

444
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:16,860
and cherish everything we have.

445
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,500
We always try to protect our kind

446
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,290
from suffering like that.

447
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,690
When we die,

448
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,980
we turn into a star and fly up into the sky.

449
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,410
I

450
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,420
always believe

451
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,930
that the earth shares the same sky with
the Meow Planet.

452
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,540
That's why my sister

453
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,290
must be looking at us right now

454
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,610
somewhere in the sky.

455
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:14,980
Hugh,

456
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,060
take care of yourself.

457
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,780
What are you doing?

458
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:10,699
Did I wake you?

459
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:12,300
Stay here, let me.

460
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:14,380
What if your wound hurts?

461
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,739
I wanted to make you breakfast.

462
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:20,380
You don't know how to cook.

463
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:22,540
You can teach me.

464
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,300
Let me teach you.

465
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,290
I should just put it in, right?

466
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,300
Yes, also, break this egg.

467
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,020
Stir.

468
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:33,380
Silly,

469
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,460
nobody stirs like that.

470
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:34,940
Here, hold the chopsticks

471
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,730
like this.

472
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,540
Right, now stir.

473
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:42,900
I don't see the difference.

474
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:43,860
Yes, there is a difference.

475
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,179
Now, some salt.

476
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:49,219
Dad.

477
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:56,980
Mister.

478
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:57,580
What is it?

479
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,500
You told me that you don't want a third wheel.

480
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,260
So, I'm leaving.

481
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:04,370
Where are you heading?

482
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:05,820
Mister,

483
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,780
do you feel uncomfortable

484
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,300
living here?

485
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,530
I can find you another place.

486
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,020
Never mind.

487
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:12,900
I have things to do on the Meow Planet.

488
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:14,370
I can't stay here for too long.

489
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:17,300
Don't you want to spend more time with me?

490
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,540
You have no idea,

491
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:20,540
we have rules on our planet.

492
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,580
A cat should pay its benefactor on its own.

493
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,540
If I continue staying here,

494
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:26,020
my baby daughter

495
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,810
would never return home.

496
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:30,980
You,

497
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,580
you just want to go home

498
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,060
and eat those dried fish.

499
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:34,580
Nonsense,

500
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,060
these

501
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,340
are for your mom and our neighbours.

502
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,580
You just want to eat them yourself.

503
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:56,580
Bye.

504
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,100
Honey.

505
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,780
Darling.

506
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,700
I made it!

507
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,900
I, I made it.

508
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,330
Chi,

509
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:51,940
it's an emergency.

510
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,540
How many times did you throw up?

511
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,380
You know that I

512
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,980
have a problem with that thing.

513
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,860
But I really do like Mingming a lot.

514
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:11,500
I've thought this through.

515
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,460
It's time to get rid of it

516
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,410
once and for all.

517
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:16,060
Wait a second.

518
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,700
Which problem?

519
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,060
He has

520
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,890
a phobia about you know what.

521
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,060
He throws up

522
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,060

It's nothing to be worried about.

So, we were trying to figure out

631

how to find

632

Sounds like a plan.
