The car before me suddenly stopped.
 Not my fault!

we meet a lot of people every day.

119
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,620
Maybe he's a patient

120

or a family member of a patient.

121

How did you know that!

122
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,140

Scarface's grandma

124
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,220
was a patient of his.

125

That's why they know each other.

If you run into Scarface again,

136
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,770
don't take any risks.

137
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,900

00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,220
Got it?

Do you understand me?

141
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:51,460
Yes, I do.

Tell you what, Xiao Xiu.

145
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,100
Don't be too careless

146
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,130
before

147
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:10,900
the leg heals.

148
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,100
Or, it'll be broken again.

149
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,020
Don't worry, I'm fine.

150
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,060
Just go to the market.

151
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,460
The fresh fish will be sold out soon.

152
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,940
Look at her!

153
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,980
See how she's ordering me around like I'm a maid?

156

You're putting gals before pals!

157

I...

158
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,140
I was your first love!

159
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,420
Now that you've got someone new...

160
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,140
You said you wanted to go to the market.

162

Just go.

00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,620
This is Ke Bei and He Meng.

179
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,450
Xu Zihao.

180
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:11,100
Qin Mingming.

181
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:11,580
Hello.

182
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,380
-Hello.
-Hi.

183
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,220
Make yourself at home.

184
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:14,260
Come sit.

185
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,380
The last one!

186
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:15,860
Sit down.

187
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,420
Dig in!

188
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,340
Braised fish.

189
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,500
Salmon.

190
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,020
Fried yellow croakers.

191
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,620
Is there any main course that doesn't have fish in it?

192
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:27,460
What's wrong?

193
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,180
Xiao Xiu likes to eat fish.

194
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,460
You can have this.

195
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,100
Fish tofu?

196
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:34,980
It's...

197
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,020
My lady,

198
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,140
were you a cat in your previous life?

199
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,460
Eat it or leave it.

200
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,180
Dig in!

201
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,820
Cats love fish.

202
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:46,700
I'm having fish here.

203
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,580
I wonder if those cats

204
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,180
can even have a hot meal.

205
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,130
Xiao Xiu.

206
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,060
We're going to take action tonight.

207
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,180
Don't worry.

208
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:58,620
We have faith.

209
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,580
We'll save all the cats for you.

210
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,660
Yeah, Xiao Xiu.

211
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,620
We'll save all of them.

212
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,450
Come on.

213
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,410
Try the fish soup He Meng made.

214
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,380
Try the dishes He Meng made.

215
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,810
She's a wonderful cook.

216
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,220
Have some.

217
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,420
It's hot.

218
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,620
Try this.

219
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:24,730
Here.

220
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,140
You two...

221
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,940
Stop with the PDA, okay?

222
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,140
There are people here.

223
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:32,860
Have some.

224
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,780
Here, have some fish, babe.

225
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:35,730
Who's your babe?

226
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:36,610
No. Go away.

227
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:37,700
Okay.

228
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:38,980
Seriously,

229
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,300
what's the plan for tonight?

230
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,700
Ke Bei pretended to be a new client

231
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,580
and texted with the cat smugglers.

232
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,940
They've arranged a meeting

233
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,260
at the riverside park at midnight.

234
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,660
Here's the thing.

235
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,980
I pretended to be a first-timer

236
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,860
that's engaged in illegal cat trading.

237
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,380
They've agreed to take me on a test run.

238
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,820
Here's our chat history.

239
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,460
He's told me the location

240
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,260
and time.

241
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:05,220
Riverside Park, midnight.

242
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,500
They're experienced.

243
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,780
You'll raise suspicion if you go there alone.

244
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,940
Maybe I should go. I'm a girl.

245
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,460
They won't suspect me.

246
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,250
No.

247
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,690
It's too dangerous for you.

248
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,700
I am a journalist.

249
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,500
I go undercover all the time.

250
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,820
Maybe it's too dangerous for you.

251
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:20,820
So what?

252
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,900
What if you are in danger?

253
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,380
At least let me go with you.

254
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:24,180
It's decided.

255
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,020
Mingming.

256
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:26,620
Xu Zihao is right.

257
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,420
Think about it.

258
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,740
We don't know

259
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,140
who's gonna be there.

260
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,660
You two can pretend to be a couple.

261
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,820
It'll be safer for you.

262
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,100
Ke Bei and I

263
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,220
will photograph the evidence from afar.

264
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:38,660
It's decided.

265
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,700
I'll wait at the intersection.

266
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,380
I'll catch them if they try to run away.

267
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,380
You can't go.

268
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:45,420
You stay at home.

269
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,020
No, I've gotta go.

270
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,180
I can be useful.

271
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,130
You're not going.

272
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,060
You've barely recovered.

273
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,500
I'm fine now. Don't worry.

274
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,540
I can go with you guys.

275
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,740
Xiao Xiu, don't worry.

276
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,780
Zihao and I

277
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,980
will meet those guys.

278
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,020
Chi Yan and Ke Bei will photograph the evidence.

279
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,180
You just

280
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,260
stay at home with He Meng.

281
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,540
If anything happens to us,

282
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,620
you need to call the police.

283
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:06,460
Okay.

284
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,380
They're making great sense.

285
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:08,780
Xiao Xiu.

286
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,740
If we both come with,

287
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,860
they'll be alerted.

288
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,100
Seriously, I can help you guys.

289
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,620
You know how I can help.

290
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,580
Xiao Xiu, listen to me.

291
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,300
I know you're worried about our safety.

292
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,900
But you need to trust us.

293
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,100
We can do this.

294
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,020
Don't worry.

295
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,540
Promise me

296
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,740
that you'll return safely

297
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,260
and bring everyone home safe and sound.

298
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,580
I promise.

299
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,900
I will leave no man behind.

300
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,460
We'll be back safely.

301
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,140
Let's enjoy dinner.

302
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:37,620
Dinner!

303
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,330
Come on.

304
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,060
Eat before the soup gets cold.

305
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:13,700
Are you Blackie?

306
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,730
It's a girl.

307
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,050
Mr. Blackie.

308
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,460
What's he doing here?

309
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,020
He's my boyfriend.

310
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,020
We're both first-timers.

311
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,020
We wanna have fun together.

312
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,020
Alright.

313
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,540
Boyfriend, huh?

314
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,500
Let's have fun, then.

315
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,530
You got it with you?

316
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,500
Yes, here it is.

317
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:28,580
It's a feeding station here.

318
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,940
Those overly sympathetic people

319
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,740
like to feed stray cats here.

320
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,090
There are many cats here.

321
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,940
I'll teach you how to catch them later.

322
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:37,730
Okay.

323
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:42,980
Blackie.

324
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,650
There are so many cats.

325
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,660
Will people buy them?

326
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,220
Nobody wants to buy strays.

327
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,020
These cats are destroying

328
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,020
the ecological balance in the city.

329
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,980
We're doing a good deed

330
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,210
by kindly killing a few.

331
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,730
But if you want to make money...

332
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,420
Girl,

333
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,300
I know a way.

334
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,170
So many.

335
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,140
Yeah.

336
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,460
Are these all stray cats?

337
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,500
Have you ever seen any strays
 of such expensive breeds?

338
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,020
Right, have you?

339
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:22,730
Of course, they aren't strays.

340
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,050
Of course not.

341
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,820
I know all about who raise the most expensive cats

342
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,940
in the neighborhood.

343
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,500
Cats are smart.

344
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:36,490
It must be

345
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,250
hard to catch them.

346
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,020
See this?

347
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,140
Poisoned cat food.

348
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,340
Those cats will be sedated

349
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,690
after eating it.

350
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,260
It's good stuff.

351
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,210
Let me show you.

352
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,020
We just caught this one.

353
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,020
I'll show you later.

354
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,260
Okay, may I?

355
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,820
It's so cute!

356
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,500
Right?

357
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,380
I've got a call.

358
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,220
I should take this.

359
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,180
Who are you guys exactly?

360
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:41,940
Stop!

361
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,460
Stop!

362
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,260
Chi Yan!

363
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:36,890
Xiao Xiu!

364
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,300
Let's go!

365
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:39,850
Xiao Xiu!

366
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,420
Xiao Xiu!

367
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,180
Xiao Xiu.

368
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,330
-Xiao Xiu!
-Xiao Xiu!

369
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,260
I'll call...

370
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,460
Let's go to the hospital.

371
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,900
Hello, 911?

372
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,100
I'll get the car.

373
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,100
Xiao Xiu!

374
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,420
She's unconscious. Her pupils are dilated.

375
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,450
and not responding to light.

376
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:23,770
Heart rate, 190 BPM.

377
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:24,580
Temperature, 39 °C.

378
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,740
Blood oxygen level is decreasing.

379
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,580
Prepare oxygen.

380
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,220
The initial diagnosis is closed-head injury.

381
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,570
The detailed report suggests

382
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:33,220
a head injury.

383
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,140
We need to perform surgery now.

384
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,090
The blood test shows

385
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,620
irregularities of WBC, RBC,

386
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,290
and other components.

387
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,580
I don't recognize her blood type.

388
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,300
Surgery, now!

389
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:41,660
Dr. Gao, ask her family to sign

390
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,740
the notice of critical illness.

391
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:43,570
Okay.

392
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:47,500
Xiao Xiu.

393
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,220
She's suffering from hemorrhage of the brain.

394
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,860
Blood transfusion is needed for surgery.

395
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,330
But her blood type is rare.

396
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,780
We must ask her family members to crossmatch.

397
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,290
Call her family.

398
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,900
This is her blood test report.

399
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,540
A rare blood type.

400
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,380
Call her family now.

401
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,330
Her family...

402
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,090
How is she?

403
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:09,830
She has a rare blood type.

404
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,460
Only family members can donate blood.

405
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:13,690
Chi Yan.

406
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,540
Do you know her family members?

407
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:16,740
Do you have

408
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,020
her medical record?

409
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:18,820
I'll go get it.

410
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:25,540
Chi Yan.

411
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,780
If you can't find her family,

412
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,020
give me info on her ID.

413
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,290
I can look it up in the database.

414
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,930
Chi Yan, calm down.

415
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,810
Think.

416
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,100
Whether it's to save Xiao Xiu's life,

417
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,460
or to catch the criminals,

418
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,150
[Blood test]

419
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,090
we need to get her personal information.

420
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,980
You know her the best.

421
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,220
You're the only one who can save her.

422
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,300
Something’s wrong with her blood type.

423
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,820
It's not human blood.

424
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,300
Xiao Xiu.

425
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,580
Chi Yan.

426
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:56,900
Uncle Fu.

427
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,340
Chi Yan.

428
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:02,570
None of these can save Xiao Xiu.

429
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,260
I'm a family member of her.

430
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,220
Can I go see her?

431
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,780
You should do the crossmatching first.

432
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,130
That's the only way to save her.

433
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,020
I know her blood type.

434
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,460
I'm not a match.

435
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:18,850
Just let us in.

436
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:19,420
Dr. Gao.

437
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,460
Let them in.

438
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,250
There's not much we can do.

439
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:27,820

I've never wished for anything.

But this time, I sincerely wish

522

for Xiao Xiu to wake up.

523
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:14,740

525
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:31,580
Chi Yan!

526
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,860
Here, kitty kitty.

527
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,060
Drink it.

528
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,540
Don't feed it, Yuanzi.

529
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,060
Don't!

530
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,300
Stop it.

531
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,410
Most cats are lactose-intolerant.

532
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:23,100
They'll have diarrhea if you feed them milk.

533
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,340
How do you know my name?

534
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,100
What?

535
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,660
It's like you've never met me before.

536
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,900
I have never met you before.

537
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,410
What are you talking about?

538
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:33,620
We're friends!

539
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,820
Friends.

540
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,220
What's wrong?

541
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,620
Well.

542
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,100
I need to go back to the bookstore.

543
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,380
I'll give you some money to...

544
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:43,940
To buy cat food!

545
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,980
Where are you going, Yuanzi!

546
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,020
What's wrong with her?

547
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,100
It's like she doesn't know me at all.

548
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:58,980
He Meng!

549
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,420
He Meng!

550
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,620
How was the mission last night?

551
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,100
I don't know how

552
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,650
but I fell asleep on the grass.

553
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,100
Are Chi Yan and the others back?

554
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:08,610
Excuse me.

555
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,300
Are you mistaking me for someone else?

556
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,570
How could I?

557
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,180
You are He Meng.

558
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,460
How could I mistake you?

559
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,580
Xiao Xiu.

560
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,260
I'm Xiao Xiu.

561
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:19,380
Sorry.

562
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,290
I really don't know you.

563
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,380
How may I help you?

564
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:23,100
What are you talking about?

565
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:25,570
How was last night?

566
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,210
Is everyone alright?

567
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,260
Why are you acting as if you don't know me?

568
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,100
What's wrong, He Meng?

569
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,610
I don't know what you mean by everyone.

570
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:32,740
Are you lost?

571
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,860
Do you need me to call the police?

572
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,620
What are you talking about?

573
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,460
We had dinner together

574
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,100
last night, He Meng!

575
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,450
Sorry, I don't know you.

576
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:37,940
Sorry.

577
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:38,500
He Meng!

578
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,980
Who are you taking pictures of?

579
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:07,900
Chi Yan, of course.

580
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,060
Chi Yan?

581
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:09,940
Yeah.

582
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:11,010
Why?

583
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:12,060
Do you know him?

584
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,020
Of course.

585
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,900
Many students in our college love him!

586
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,100
Are you here to see him?

587
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:18,610
No, I am not.

588
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:19,620
I'm here to talk to him.

589
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,860
Talk to him?

590
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,940
I am his girlfriend.

591
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,090
Hi, I am Xiao Xiu.

592
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,380
That's impossible.

593
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,580
Chi Yan doesn't have a girlfriend.

594
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:29,300
He does.

595
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,219
It's me.

596
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,540
Are you crazy?

597
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:54,620
This one, right?

598
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,420
Yes, thanks.

599
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:56,980
Your turn.

600
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,770
I'm so relieved you're alright.

601
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:00,900
You...

602
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:02,020
Were you hurt?

603
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,100
Stop it. What are you doing?

604
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,490
Were you injured?

605
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,220
Hold on.

606
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,100
I was on my way back here

607
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,380
and they said they don't know me.

608
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:08,940
Are you alright?

609
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,770
Stop it.

610
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:11,460
If you want to buy books,

611
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,620
the checkout counter is here.

612
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,420
Chi Yan.

613
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:16,580
What's wrong with you?

614
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:18,940
I'm Xiao Xiu.

615
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,620
What Xiao Xiu?

616
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,780
I don't know who you are.

617
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,620
How is that possible?

618
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,820
I am your girlfriend.

619
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,020
We're together every day.

620
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,260
I don't have a girlfriend.

621
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:33,420
Is she

622
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,020
delusional?

623
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:38,300
She doesn't seem sane to me.

624
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,490
Did she get dumped by him?

625
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:42,460
I don't know you.

626
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,100
How can you not know me?

627
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,740
We are together every day.

628
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,740
I'm here organizing the books for you every day.

629
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,500
And you're here...

630
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,460
We do this every day.

631
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,580
What's wrong with you, lady?

632
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,100
I don't know you. What are you talking about?

633
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,340
I've got customers here.

634
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,820
I'm not lying.

635
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:57,500
I...

636
00:35:58,530 --> 00:35:59,940
Hugh Williams.

637
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,050
You gave me this name.

638
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:02,860
I...

639
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:06,380
Think!

640
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,820
I went to pay tribute to your grandpa,

641
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,060
your dad, and Mr. Yu with you.

642
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:12,820
Mr. Yu?

643
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:15,620
Are you one of his students?

644
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,060
No, I am not.

645
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,460
She seems to be mental.

646
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,380
Crazy.

647
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:25,100
I am not crazy.

648
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,980
Either buy some books

649
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,780
or get out of here, okay?

650
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,620
I am not crazy.

651
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,090
I can prove it to you.

652
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,730
Where are you going?

653
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,460
Nietzsche.

654
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,900
Come here.

655
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:40,620
Here.

656
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,620
Let's go.

657
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,610
Let's go.

658
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:50,620
Xu Zihao!

659
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,890
Nietzsche!

660
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:53,940
Nietzsche!

661
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:54,420
Hello.

662
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,340
-Nietzsche.
-Hello.

663
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,380
How do you know

664
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,940
me and my dog?

665
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,620
I am Xiao Xiu.

666
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:03,860
Xiao Xiu?

667
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:04,940
Xiao Xiu.

668
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,740
It doesn't ring a bell.

669
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,500
How could you?

670
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,020
I am Xiao Xiu.

671
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,860
Chi Yan's girlfriend.

672
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,500
We went to the market and had dinner

673
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,420
just days ago.

674
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,860
Chi Yan's girlfriend?

675
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,020
If Chi Yan has a girlfriend,

676
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,060
I would know for sure.

677
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,420
You're one of his fans, right?

678
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,300
I...

679
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:23,780
I know.

680
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,100
No...

681
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,620
Many fans love to call

682
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,380
their idol honey

683
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,140
or hubby.

684
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,420
-Miss.
-What...

685
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,620
Try to be a sensible fangirl.

686
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,540
What?

687
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,930
No...I'm not...

688
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:35,370
I am his girlfriend.

689
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,340
A couple days ago...

690
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,860
Days ago, remember?

691
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,020
You visited me in the hospital.

692
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,780
I was in the room to the left on the second floor.

693
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:45,460
I was in the hospital and you came to visit me.

694
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:48,100
You need to be sensible.

695
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,620
Stop!

696
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,460
Don't run!

697
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:01,740
Mingming!

698
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,540
Nietzsche, go after him!

699
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:05,940
Nietzsche!

700
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:09,100
Stop there!

701
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:10,370
Go away!

702
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:16,970
Okay.

703
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:17,940
Let me have a shot, guys.

704
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,100
Don't you move!

705
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:38,900
Impressive!

706
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,420
Give me a hand.

707
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,250
Don't move.

708
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:45,900
You!

709
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,860
Are you gonna ask the kid to help me?

710
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,500
Right.

711
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,020
Get his shoelaces.

712
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,100
Don't play tricks.

713
00:38:58,570 --> 00:38:59,100
Nietzsche!

714
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,100
Don't move.

715
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,620
What's it to you?

716
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:12,500
Hold it.

717
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,090
I'll make a call.

718
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,660
This will teach you to steal! You deserve it!

719
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,860
Mind your own business.

720
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,460
Don't move!

721
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:22,620
Thanks.

722
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:25,620
Hello, Uncle Gao.

723
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,100
I'm at the bilingual school.

724
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:28,980
I caught a thief.

725
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,620
No, I'm fine.

726
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,540
He tried to steal from me.

727
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,620
What else should I do?

728
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:36,620
I'm fine.

729
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,500
Come over.

730
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,310
No more tricks.

731
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:46,380
Nietzsche!

732
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:53,370
Mingming.

733
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:54,900
Don't pull.

734
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:55,820
Careful.

735
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:57,010
Try this.

736
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,180
Hold on. Stay still.

737
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:01,100
Do you have anything sharp in your purse?

738
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:05,340
Don't move. Careful.

739
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:05,900
No!

740
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,620
Let me do it.

741
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,260
Allow me.

742
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:07,980
Hand it to me.

743
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:08,620
You can't see.

744
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,300
Just cut the wisp of hair.

745
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,100
Don't move.

746
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,100
Give me a sec.

747
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:24,730
Here.

748
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,500
You cut your shirt...

749
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,500
It's just a shirt.

750
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,210
It's alright.

751
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,530
I'd hate to cut off your hair.

752
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,220
Thanks.

753
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,250
No problem.

754
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,410
Mingming.

755
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,260
Uncle Gao!

756
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:48,980
Where is he?

757
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,100
Here you are.

758
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,220
Get up.

759
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,600
Bring him back to the station.

760
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:56,210
Go.

761
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:57,900
Are you alright?

762
00:40:57,970 --> 00:40:58,540
Yes, I am.

763
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,730
Really? Let me see.

764
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,340
Did you catch the thief?

765
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,100
See? I can do it on my own.

766
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:07,620
Don't be a hero.

767
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,900
It's dangerous.

768
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:12,820
What if something happens to you?

769
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,900
How should I face your father?

770
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:18,270
Stop messing around.

771
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,460
Be more careful in the future.

772
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:21,820
Your safety comes first.

773
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:23,340
Okay, I got it.

774
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:24,580
Safety comes first.

775
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:26,060
I'm going back to the station.

776
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,010
Drive safe.

777
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:36,050
Mingming, are you alright?

778
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,770
How do you  know my name?

779
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,420
Of course, I know your name.

780
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,530
I know that you're Qin Mingming

781
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:44,460
and he's Xu Zihao.

782
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,100
She knows my name, too.

783
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:48,980
So, you're Qin Mingming, right?

784
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,570
Hello. I am Xu Zihao.

785
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,300
Hello.

786
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,060
Don't go!

787
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:06,380
What is it between you and Chi Yan?

788
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:07,380
Chi Yan?

789
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,460
The one who went to Qing Xi No.1 High School?

790
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:11,900
Yeah.

791
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,100
He was my classmate.

792
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:14,740
Really?

793
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,060
Chi Yan is my best friend.

794
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:17,860
My best bud.

795
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:18,460
Really?

796
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:19,780
Then...

797
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,580
If you are his friend,

798
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,620
that makes me your half-friend.

799
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:28,090
What a small world!

800
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,380
It's not spoiled.

801
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,450
It's just how seafood smells.

802
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:38,420
See?

803
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,650
They're all living.

804
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:41,090
Others may not be able to smell it,

805
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:42,540
but I can tell for sure.

806
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:43,940
Fresh clams

807
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:46,420
will close up upon a gentle tap.

808
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,250
These

809
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:48,820
are at least day-old.

810
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,300
Wanna bet with me?

811
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,300
I don't have time for a bet.

812
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:53,260
Buy some

813
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:53,730
or

814
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:54,460
walk away!
