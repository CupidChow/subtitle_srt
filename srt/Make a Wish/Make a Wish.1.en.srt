the Big Bang

6
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,560
created two planets on each side of the black hole,

00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,470

8

However, the dominant species on these two planets are vastly different.

177
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,240
Sorry to interrupt.

178
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,800
Go on, you guys.

179
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,390
Xu Zihao!

180
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:06,440
Xu Zihao!

181
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,440
Chi.

182
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,400
Not a word.

183
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,720
I won't join you.

184
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,950
Nietzsche, come back here!

185
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,240
Nietzsche!

186
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,230
He took advantage of you.

187
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,600
What did you slap me for?

188
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,190
Get the dog inside.

189
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:35,680
Come on.

190
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,040
The most dangerous creature

191
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,070
in this room is her!

192
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,560
Then get her out of here!

193
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:44,550
Come on.

194
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,080
Nietzsche.

195
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:45,720
Come!

196
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,480
Come, Nietzsche!

197
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:47,550
Good dog!

198
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,510
Let's go stay in that room.

199
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:49,880
Here.

200
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,350
This way.

201
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,040
Who is she?

202
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,070
Is she crazy?

203
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:24,880
I don't know her.

204
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:28,760
Chi.

205
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,520
I know you're not good

206
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,670
with relationships.

207
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,870
But you didn't have to go to extremes.

208
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,920
I said I don't know her.

209
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,390
She showed up at my house this morning

210
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,350
and refused to talk.

211
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,750
Look at her!

212
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,570
She's either retarded or mute.

213
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,190
What now?

214
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,760
Do me a favor.

215
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,030
Get her out of here.

216
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,560
I've got nothing to do with her.

217
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,320
She's your girl.

218
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,070
What girl?

219
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,120
I told you I don't know her.

220
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,200
Wait.

221
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,440
I think

222
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,280
there's more to it between you two.

223
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,480
Bear with me.

224
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,600
She's lost her memory

225
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,270
and doesn't know who she is

226
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,120
or where she lives.

227
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,960
Then you two can stay together every day

228
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,550
and develop a relationship.

229
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,190
One day, she'll be...

230
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,110
You can't eat that!

231
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,150
What do you say I make you some noodles?

232
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:33,240
Eat.

233
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,160
Use chopsticks!

234
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:50,870
Never mind.

235
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,120
You can use this.

236
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:05,160
Don't choke on it.

237
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:07,319
Are you training a pet?

238
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,589
I've got to review my articles.

239
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,640
Get her out of here after she's done.

240
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:15,359
Show some sympathy, will you?

241
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,510
One step at a time, got it?

242
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,880
Be patient!

243
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:20,790
Hey.

244
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:22,349
What's your name?

245
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,200
Where do you live?

246
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,190
Is there anyone we can call?

247
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,390
Be patient!

248
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,320
I thought you saved a cat yesterday.

249
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:34,990
Where is it?

250
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:38,390
The cat...

251
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,000
Gosh!

252
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,710
How did you hurt yourself so badly?

253
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:45,470
Come on.

254
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,760
I'll take you to the hospital.

255
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,630
The hospital.

256
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,760
It's a place

257
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,720
that has great food like this.

258
00:17:58,670 --> 00:17:59,600
Hospital. Food.

259
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:07,960
Hold on.

260
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,240
Nietzsche.

261
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:18,840
Put this on her.

262
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,920
How am I supposed to do that?

263
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,680
Don't you have female nurses in the hospital?

264
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:28,880
Cold-blooded.

265
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,030
And you are not?

266
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,280
You even forgot that your dog was in my bedroom.

267
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,030
I won't look.

268
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,870
Tell me when you're done.

269
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,480
Still not done?

270
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:32,600
I'm turning around.

271
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,510
What are you doing?

272
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,150
These are pants.

273
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,760
Don't put them on your head.

274
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,070
They won't let me in seeing you dressed like this.

275
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,160
I've got surgery later.

276
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,600
Come on. Do it yourself.

277
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,590
See? Watch me.

278
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,070
Pull the pants up.

279
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,150
Put the pants on your legs and pull up.

280
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,670
Up!

281
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,710
Pull them up!

282
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,790
Chi.

283
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,520
Come on.

284
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:04,790
I'll help you.

285
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:07,870
Legs.

286
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,360
Put the pants on your legs.

287
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:10,630
Here.

288
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,830
Stick your legs out

289
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,320
into this big hole. Come on!

290
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,800
Do as I say, please.

291
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:18,600
Put them on.

292
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,880
Come on.

293
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,950
There you go.

294
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,320
Another leg.

295
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,110
Hurry.

296
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:26,670
Yes, just like that.

297
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:27,750
Yeah!

298
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:28,920
Pull the pants up!

299
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,870
Raise your hips and pull up the pants.

300
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,390
Up!

301
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,950
I'm performing surgery later.

302
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:34,880
Hurry up.

303
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,550
Up!

304
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,150
So, you don't like dogs.

305
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,080
You're a cat person.

306
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:00,870
Sit here.

307
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:04,160
But this is a feline surgery table.

308
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,240
You'll have to make do.

309
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,320
Don't touch it, okay?

310
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:19,760
Sit over here.

311
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,760
Put your leg here, alright?

312
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,230
So that

313
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,550
I can clean your wound for you.

314
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,430
Like this.

315
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,760
Do you remember how you got hurt?

316
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,200
Do you remember how you got hurt?

317
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,310
I was just asking.

318
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,600
You don't have to tell me

319
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,550
if you don't want to, okay?

320
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,000
Don't fall off.

321
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,880
I'll rinse your wound first.

322
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:08,550
Don't be scared.

323
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:09,790
It might sting a bit.

324
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:12,830
It hurts!

325
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,000
So, you can speak.

326
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,000
It hurts!

327
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,310
There, there.

328
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:22,840
It hurts!

329
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,800
I know you can speak.

330
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,680
I'll bandage your wound up.

331
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,680
Stay still.

332
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:39,830
Done.

333
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,400
I missed my surgery.

334
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,920
I need to make some work arrangements.

335
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,120
Stay here.

336
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,880
Don't touch anything. I'll be right back.

337
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,760
I'll save you.

338
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,590
I'll get you out.

339
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:20,800
I told you

340
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,510
not to disturb me today.

341
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,320
Something bad happened!

342
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,670
Come to the hospital now!

343
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,520
What is it?

344
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,990
Come today, and I'll leave you alone tomorrow, okay?

345
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:29,510
No.

346
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:31,800
It's a top-level crisis.

347
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,470
Top-level!

348
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,080
That girl has released all the pets

349
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,440
in the hospital.

350
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:37,750
What?

351
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:39,920
Chi.

352
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,120
There.

353
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,120
Go on.

354
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:43,480
You're so close.

355
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,720
Come on, Chi.

356
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,560
Go get it.

357
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,190
It's fine.

358
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,390
It might be fine. But I am not!

359
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,280
Welcome!

360
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,800
Try some of our latest pastries.

361
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,760
Hello.

362
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:54,640
Hi everyone.

363
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,670
Today, I will challenge you

364
00:26:56,670 --> 00:27:00,150
to eat 50 butter croissants in a row.

365
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:20,830
Miss.

366
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:21,600
The counter is over there.

367
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,590
Please pay first.

368
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,240
What are you doing?

369
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,950
Friends who are watching me live...

370
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:25,470
Miss.

371
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:27,280
I'll call the police if you keep doing it.

372
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:27,840
If...

373
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:29,520
Call security.

374
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,040
What are you doing?

375
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,040
Down.

376
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,070
Get down.

377
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:35,190
Miss.

378
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:35,590
Thank you.

379
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,470
The counter is over there.

380
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,030
Pay first.

381
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:37,350
What are you doing?

382
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:37,830
Excuse me.

383
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,670
The internet connection is unstable.

384
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,160
I'll stop streaming for now.

385
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:43,430
Call security.

386
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:44,480
What are you doing?

387
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:46,710
What do you want?

388
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:47,880
What's happening?

389
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:48,760
Mr. Fu.

390
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,280
She ate our pastries and refused to pay for them.

391
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,160
How much did she owe?

392
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:53,840
I'll pay.

393
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,280
It's alright.

394
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:56,440
Get down.

395
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:57,390
Get down.

396
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,520
Easy.

397
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,880
Come with me.

398
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:01,880
Over here.

399
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,280
Come.

400
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,430
Sit here.

401
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,400
It must be your first time here.

402
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,160
There are humans everywhere.

403
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,190
You can't speak cat language here.

404
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,630
You need to speak like a human.

405
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,710
Talk slowly.

406
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,080
You can do this.

407
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:34,560
Slowly.

408
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,470
I...

409
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:38,550
I...

410
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,920
Before you came here,

411
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,390
didn't the leader of the Meow Planet

412
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,760
tell you the rules about the transition?

413
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:50,870
It's alright.

414
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,390
I'll tell you.

415
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,880
Let's go.

416
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:02,630
That fair lady of yours is really something.

417
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,270
She wouldn't answer my questions.

418
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,750
I thought she couldn't speak.

419
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,230
But she's truly a badass.

420
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,470
She went all Prison Break on the animals.

421
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,230
Tell you what.

422
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,990
I am now convinced

423
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,630
that she's mental.

424
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,150
Such a beautiful girl.

425
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:21,640
What a pity!

426
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,870
During the transition, we will

427
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,160
be able to change into human forms.

428
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,160
But the skill comes and goes.

429
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,190
It only works once in a while

430
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,190
and it's transitory.

431
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,270
But there's an exception,

432
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:33,280
which is when you need to repay the favor of a human

433
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,920
so that you can go back to the Meow Planet.

434
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:36,670
See?

435
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,630
That bracelet of yours

436
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:41,350
means you need to repay a favor.

437
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,070
I get it.

438
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,200
You need to repay his favor

439
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,400
by granting him a wish.

440
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,470
Then, the bracelet will disappear

441
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:01,160
and you can open the door that leads you back home.

442
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,200
This is your only option.

443
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,630
After all, we never owe any favors to humans.

444
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,840
How long

445
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:20,200
have you been here?

446
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,510
So long.

447
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,070
And you're not coming back?

448
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,270
There are so many great foods here.

449
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,200
I can't seem to say goodbye.

450
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,040
This world is dominated by humans.

451
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,510
It's different than the Meow Planet.

452
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:41,230
Don't turn into a cat unless you have to.

453
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,470
Don't expose your true identity.

454
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,160
Protect yourself.

455
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,630
Don't speak cat language.

456
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:47,950
Talk like a human.

457
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,080
Remember it.

458
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,470
Don't turn into a cat.

459
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:54,990
Act like a human.

460
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,190
Good luck.

461
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,990
There are many complicated rules in the human world.

462
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,480
It's very different than our world.

463
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,200
But you're a smart girl.

464
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,080
You will learn them pretty fast.

465
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,270
I am actually

466
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:35,070
an envoy to the human world from the Meow Planet.

467
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:37,270
Therefore, I can keep a permanent human form.

468
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,440
But you can't.

469
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,630
If you run into any trouble that you can't solve,

470
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,720
come find me.

471
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:55,630
It's you again.

472
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:56,800
Make a wish.

473
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,000
I...

474
00:31:59,200 --> 00:31:59,910
Make a wish.

475
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,720
Please just let go of me.

476
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,960
I am busy right now.

477
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:05,720
Make a wish.

478
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,190
A wish.

479
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,480
A wish!

480
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,270
Wish?

481
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,680
Make a wish?

482
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,590
What wish?

483
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,200
I don't understand you.

484
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,590
Wish...

485
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,280
A wish?

486
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:30,310
Seriously, I don't understand 
what you're talking about.

487
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,790
Home.

488
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:35,880
Go home?

489
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,630
Make a wish.

490
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:39,550
Go home.

491
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:42,630
I can send you home.

492
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,000
But you need to tell me

493
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,120
where you live, right?

494
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:46,550
What about this?

495
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,960
Call your family

496
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,870
and ask them to send you the address.

497
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:51,950
Then you can tell me.

498
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,040
Then I will send you home.

499
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:53,950
No problem.

500
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,680
Just think about where you live.

501
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,230
Okay?

502
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,480
It's all fine.

503
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,510
There, there.

504
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:20,550
Yeah.

505
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:31,880
Be careful!

506
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,320
Stay there. It's dangerous.

507
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:34,520
It's dangerous.

508
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,270
What do you want?

509
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,680
You...

510
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,150
Me...What about me?

511
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,440
You catch...

512
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,550
I wasn't gonna catch it.

513
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,550
-Scared...
-I was going to save it.

514
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,360
I want to take it to the hospital.

515
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,310
It's scared.

516
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,480
Careful.

517
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,120
-You...
-I...

518
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,270
I wasn't gonna catch it.

519
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,350
The cage...

520
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,030
-The cage...
-I...

521
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:54,840
The cage.

522
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,910
I need the cage to save the cat.

523
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:56,550
You...

524
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:57,310
You...

525
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,190
Don't you even know what a hospital is?

526
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,600
The cage...You don't know...

527
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,560
Cats don't like being kept in a cage.

528
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:10,840
Miss.

529
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,710
Listen to me.

530
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,350
That young man...

531
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:16,440
Xu Zihao,

532
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,840
the one who drove you to the hospital,

533
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,790
is a doctor.

534
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,110
Do you know what a doctor is?

535
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,719
Doctors save cats.

536
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,800
The cage is good for the cat.

537
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,909
Nobody wants to stay in the hospital, right?

538
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:29,670
When the cat feels better, we'll send it back home.

539
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,030
This cat is ill?

540
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:33,400
Yeah, it's ill.

541
00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:42,719
Put it down and let me have it, okay?

542
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:58,750
Give me the cat.

543
00:34:58,750 --> 00:34:59,880
I'll take it to the hospital.

544
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:07,230
You...

545
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,120
Find out your home address.

546
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,280
You saved me yesterday.

547
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,510
You have to make a wish

548
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,800
to get me back to the Meow Planet.

549
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:23,950
Where?

550
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:24,910
The Meow Planet.

551
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:25,910
I am a cat.

552
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:29,670
You are a cat.

553
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,720
You want to return to the Meow Planet.

554
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,760
Forget about the Meow Planet.

555
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,400
Check yourself into a hospital.

556
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,630
Stop there.

557
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,960
Emergency weather alert
 from the city weather station.

558
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,600
Due to unknown causes,

559
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,800
we're announcing a red alert for a thunderstorm.

560
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,270
Sir.

561
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:43,440
Turn down the radio.

562
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:46,990
Hello?

563
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:48,910
Is this the police station?

564
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:50,190
I want to report a case.

565
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:51,720
Yes.

566
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:53,630
I was in the park

567
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:54,710
and I saw a girl

568
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,710
turning into

569
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:57,840
a cat.

570
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,400
Stupid.

571
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,680
A human turned into a cat.

572
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:04,190
I...

573
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,320
Hello?

574
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:11,920
What a pity!

575
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,080
Hello?

576
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:30,710
Sorry.

577
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:31,670
We're looking for it.

578
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:32,720
-In a minute...
-What happened?

579
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,390
Finally, you found it!

580
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,390
Thank you!

581
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,200
Thanks!

582
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,000
Is Xu Zihao here?

583
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,760
Dr. Xu went out to search for the animals.

584
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:46,630
Have him call me

585
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,920
when he comes back, okay?

586
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:48,390
Thank you.

587
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:48,950
Chi Yan.

588
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,680
This is for you.

589
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,000
Can I have your phone number?

590
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,040
Your mobile number.

591
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:58,840
Sorry.

592
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,700
[Chi's Bookstore]

593
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,360
I must've been too stressed

594
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,270
to see it clearly.

595
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,230
Thank you.

596
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:45,990
You're welcome.

597
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,030
If that's all...

598
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,560
The door is over there.

599
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:52,760
You can leave.

600
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,350
Okay.

601
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,600
Make a wish, then.

602
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:56,190
You saved me.

603
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:56,990
See?

604
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,630
I need to make one of your wishes come true.

605
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,830
Will you leave

606
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,150
if I make a wish?

607
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:06,720
Do it.

608
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:10,270
It has to be your heart's desire.

609
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,080
To get rich overnight.

610
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:19,990
Okay.
