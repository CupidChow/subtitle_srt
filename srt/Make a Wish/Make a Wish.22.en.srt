But my best guess,

135

Come on!

"Man,

153

So stupid."

159

"That's right, I know.

and other ridiculous things.

165
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,980
Why do humans like these videos?

166

00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,650
It's shaking.

178
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,020
It's a little bit shaky.

179
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,900
How about we go to the centre of the lake?

180
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,660
Let's catch up with that fishing boat.

181
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,380
There?

182
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,300
That's it, let's go,

183
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:29,860
Chi Yan.

184
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,220
Steady.

185
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,660
Let's catch up with that boat.

186
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,260
See?

187
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,060
We made it, right?

188
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:15,900
What?

189
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,540
What do you mean?

190
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,460
We managed to switch your bad memory.

191
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,580
The next time you are here,

192
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,740
you will be thinking about

193
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,380
the fun we had here.

194
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,020
Hugh,

195
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:51,700
look.

196
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,020
Xiao Xiu?

197
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,060
Hugh?

198
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,020
Hugh?

199
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,260
Xiao Xiu?

200
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:09,890
Hugh?

201
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,180
Xiao Xiu!

202
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,980
I'm too old for this.

203
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:31,780
Chi Yan,

204
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,890
I don't know what do you

205
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,820
remember about Hugh now.

206
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,900
But we don't have much time. So, I'll cut to the chase.

207
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,300
The longer Hugh stays here,

208
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,570
the more dangerous it is for her.

209
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,020
According to the rules of our world,

210
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,220
she has completed her task

211
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,610
and is no longer under protection.

212
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,050
It's impossible for her

213
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,020
to maintain a human form

214
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:56,060
for a long time.

215
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,980
What if she doesn't leave?

216
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:05,860
She would die.

217
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,020
She has to leave.

218
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,300
She's awake.

219
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:22,780
Hugh!

220
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,610
Hugh!

221
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,220
How do you feel now?

222
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,900
We have to leave.

223
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,140
Uncle Fu,

224
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:36,740
I'm fine.

225
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,180
Your body won't be

226
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,450
able to take this.

227
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:42,980
I can't leave him like this,

228
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,060
I just can't.

229
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,660
He almost remembers now.

230
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,580
We'll figure something out.

231
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:53,540
Let's go.

232
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,460
I'm fine!

233
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:58,820
Look at me, I'm absolutely fine!

234
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,540
I can't leave.

235
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,060
Hugh!

236
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,780
Do you remember that bookmark?

237
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,300
The bookmark.

238
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,300
Could you please give me that bookmark?

239
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,500
I want to keep it.

240
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:18,700
The bookmark.

241
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,340
The bookmark?

242
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:20,780
The bookmark!

243
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,580
Here, you keep

244
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,180
this bookmark.

245
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,580
Chi Yan?

246
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,580
Chi Yan?

247
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,490
Chi Yan?

248
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,010
You saved me.

249
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:11,770
You see,

250
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,420
I will grant a wish of yours.

251
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,020
If you want to live here,

252
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,460
you're gonna need a human name.

253
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,860
How about I call you xiao xiu?

254
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,250
Hugh?

255
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,010
Hugh.

256
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,540
You are not okay!

257
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,900
I'm not scared.

258
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,100
I've never been scared!

259
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,140
I just want to tell you,

260
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,050
you are not alone, Chi Yan.

261
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,980
I'm here with you.

262
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,820
I can be your armour.

263
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,820
I won't let anyone or anything harm you.

264
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,660
I like you.

265
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,210
Chi Yan!

266
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,020
You remember.

267
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:21,970
I'm sorry.

268
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,660
I forgot about you.

269
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,740
I'm sorry.

270
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,740
Great, great!

271
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,100
Now I finally witness

272
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,020
the wonder of the cat seal.

273
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,450
Moses?

274
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,180
Are you Moses?

275
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:42,500
I am.

276
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,930
It's really Moses!

277
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,500
I've only seen you on the cards.

278
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,260
I didn't expect to meet

279
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,780
the legendary Moses in my time.

280
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,980
Now I've seen everything.

281
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,700
Is, is she the Moses

282
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,540
printed on every deck of cards on our planet?

283
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:01,700
As advertised.

284
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:02,540
It's me.

285
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,900
I always thought you were just a legend.

286
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,290
I didn't know that you really exist.

287
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,460
But I thought you were a dude.

288
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,500
That's the wrong thing to focus on now.

289
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,460
Sorry.

290
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,420
I didn't expect to come back to this world

291
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,980
in the form of a shadow.

292
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,300
It must be the bookmark

293
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,020
and the renewed cat seal.

294
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:31,140
Moses is the first cat on our planet

295
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,340
that made a cat seal.

296
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,300
So, she is the first one to...

297
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,330
That's right.

298
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,970
Legend has it that her story

299
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,380
resembles the story of you two a lot.

300
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,220
Hello.

301
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,340
You,

302
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,220
you're a descendant of the Chi family?

303
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,650
You know me?

304
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,410
I fell in love with your ancestor.

305
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,380
It was forbidden.

306
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,660
So, I was taken back to the Meow Planet.

307
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,060
I lost the love of my life

308
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,540
and regretted that for the rest of my life.

309
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,660
My only dying wish

310
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,730
was to see him one more time.

311
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,060
So, I sneaked back here

312
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:09,740
and gave him this bookmark before I left.

313
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,700
At that time, I made a wish

314
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,540
that if a human falls in love with a cat,

315
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,060
they can be together forever.

316
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,890
Also, that my lover can avoid harm

317
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:23,260
from the Meow Planet after I died.

318
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,300
So, I stored some power of my kind

319
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,340
into that bookmark,

320
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,330
which later became the so-called cat seal.

321
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,420
Not only does the cat seal protects the Chi family,

322
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:42,130
it also allows cats around the Chi family

323
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:45,740
to maintain a human form and stays in this world.

324
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,900
Now, my wish

325
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:53,500
has finally come true.

326
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,540
I'm really glad.

327
00:20:59,260 --> 00:20:59,850
Hugh,

328
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,580
the cat seal is now renewed.

329
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,660
From now on, you can maintain a human form

330
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,770
without disruptions.

331
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:12,900
I hope that the two of you can break

332
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,130
the dimension between the two worlds

333
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:17,890
and live happily ever after.

334
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,020
We will!

335
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:27,890
It's time for me to leave.

336
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,900
Carry my blessing

337
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,970
and be happy.

338
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,700
This is our deal.

339
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,690
Don't forget about it.

340
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,450
Farewell.

341
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:06,900
Uncle Fu, does that mean

342
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,260
I don't have to return to the Meow Planet with you?

343
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,220
Why do you want to go back there?

344
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,820
To fight your dad for dried fish?

345
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,540
I never said that!

346
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:17,260
Although,

347
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,290
I do need to visit the Meow Planet.

348
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,340
Lin Mo is still missing.

349
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,690
I will look into that.

350
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,620
Also, I can tell your parents

351
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,180
about your story here,

352
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,700
don't want them to be worried.

353
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,580
Thank you, Uncle Fu.

354
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,180
Don't be.

355
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,130
I'm friends with

356
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,220
your dad and your grandpa.

357
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,340
I consider you my own children.

358
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:41,780
I'm happy

359
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,340
if you are happy.

360
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,780
Thank you, Uncle Fu.

361
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,060
Take care.

362
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,020
Okay.

363
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,170
I'll see you around.

364
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,660
Bye bye.

365
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,300
Chi Yan,

366
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:27,860
you really do remember, right?

367
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:34,020
♫ The sound of the rain outside the window♫

368
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,300
I remember.

369
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,420
Pinch me.

370
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,180
Pinch you?

371
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,380
♫ The vision becomes clearer♫

372
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:46,200
♫ The feelings disturbed by the wind♫

373
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,300
I remember.

374
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,040
♫ are now awakened in the sleep♫

375
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,860
Do you want to make a video?

376
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:57,030
♫ Images keep moving♫

377
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:53,660
In case

378
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,500
I forget...

379
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,500
You'll never forget it again.

380
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:02,920
♫ They leave a mark in the brain♫

381
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,090
That won't

382
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,180
happen again.

383
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,420
There is no "in case".

384
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:08,730
♫ The silent affection♫

385
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:08,420
So,

386
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,380
do you remember the time

387
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:15,110
♫ does not leave a trace♫

388
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,220
we drank on the balcony?

389
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:15,370
I do.

390
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:23,120
♫ Your sparkling eyes♫

391
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,500
This is it.

392
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,380
I remember

393
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,020
that I rescued you from the bar.

394
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,870
♫ are my compass♫

395
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,580
Your ears popped out

396
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,540
because you drank.

397
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:34,510
♫ showing me the meaning of existence♫

398
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,450
After we returned home,

399
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,420
we did an experiment

400
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,060
to see whether you are allergic to alcohol

401
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:40,370
♫ I grab all the hopes in my hand ♫

402
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,660
or chocolates.

403
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,500
What about that other time?

404
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:45,600
♫ but the night is about to fall♫

405
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,090
You bought me a mobile phone

406
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,180
and I kept calling you.

407
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,500
You remember that?

408
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:51,540
♫ No reflections in the water♫

409
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,100
I do.

410
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,300
I bought you a mobile phone.

411
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,130
You'd never used a mobile phone before

412
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,500
and you were so curious about it.

413
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:56,820
♫ We really should be thankful♫

414
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,180
You kept calling me

415
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,090
and I had to answer all your calls.

416
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:00,120
♫ that our minds are crystal clear♫

417
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,700
What about that incident with Qin Liangliang?

418
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:05,660
♫ We move on alone♫

419
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:08,620
Run!

420
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,420
After them!

421
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,180
The important thing is I do remember now.

422
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:22,250
♫ The images keep moving by♫

423
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:27,180
♫ and leave a trace in mind♫

424
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:33,250
♫ The silent affection♫

425
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:39,280
♫ does not leave a trace♫

426
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,140
You don't have to stare at me like that.

427
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,220
I won't be lost.

428
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,610
I have to stare at you like that,

429
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:45,020
or you'll be missing.

430
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:47,980
I won't.

431
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,980
We've got a dimension wall to tear down.

432
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:52,780
Chi Yan,

433
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,340
the time is set.

434
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,140
They'll tear this place down in a fortnight.

435
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,780
You need to find a new place.

436
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,620
There are some places to rent

437
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,020
on the other side of the street.

438
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,540
Take a look when you have time.

439
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,420
Thank you.

440
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,140
Thank you, that's really helpful.

441
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,900
That's all I can do.

442
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,820
I return this month's rent

443
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,060
as well as

444
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,060
the deposit to you.

445
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,180
- You don't need to.
- Thank you.

446
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,380
We can't take that money.

447
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,900
You've been here for ten years.

448
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,340
You've taken care of the house

449
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,180
and hardly caused any trouble.

450
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,060
I consider you a friend.

451
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:26,300
So, don't be.

452
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:27,820
I'll see you around.

453
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,420
Thank you for coming here.

454
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,940
We only have fourteen days left.

455
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,340
Is it possible for us to find a new place?

456
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,980
We have to try.

457
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,220
How about

458
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,570
we start looking now?

459
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,090
The house that you asked about

460
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,060
is right around that corner.

461
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:50,730
This one, right?

462
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,140
We, we'd like to take a look at this one.

463
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:52,660
Right.

464
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,460
This house

465
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,500
is right there.

466
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,500
That's it, right?

467
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,260
Yeah, yeah.

468
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:56,940
Come on, let's go.

469
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,500
That one looks great.

470
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:57,890
Let's go.

471
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,060
It resembles the bookstore.

472
00:26:59,060 --> 00:26:59,460
Yep.

473
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,410
You can take a look at his house.

474
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,010
It's okay if you don't like this one,

475
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:08,700
carry on.

476
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:09,620
- Great.
- Let's go.

477
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:11,500
After you.

478
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,140
We've been here for half an hour,

479
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,140
when will you arrive?

480
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,130
Okay then.

481
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,860
I'm really sorry,

482
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,020
the landlord is too busy to come here.

483
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:25,380
How about...

484
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,340
I'm really sorry,

485
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,060
maybe next time.

486
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,060
Take care.

487
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:33,780
Bye-bye.

488
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,290
Are these mine?

489
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:58,700
Yep.

490
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:01,220
Thank you.

491
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:02,100
You're welcome.

492
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:13,980
Tired?

493
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,740
It's fine.

494
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,700
We still have plenty of time.

495
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,340
We will find the perfect place.

496
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:33,940
Chi Yan, look!

497
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,860
Chi Yan, come here, Chi Yan!

498
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:44,900
Come here.

499
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,620
Be careful.

500
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:51,260
Careful.

501
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,740
Stay there!

502
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,380
Are you tired?

503
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:16,380
You need to get some rest.

504
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,660
What are you doing there?

505
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,060
Ke Bei!

506
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:37,460
What are you doing?

507
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:38,900
Ke Bei!

508
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,340
You...

509
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,260
How do you know my name?

510
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,010
We know that your name is Ke Bei.

511
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:48,100
We also know that you are a lawyer.

512
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,100
I, I wasn't stalking you.

513
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,050
I just,

514
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,420
I saw you there, having fun.

515
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:56,740
I thought that image looks great.

516
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,820
I couldn't resist and took some photos.

517
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,340
You followed us

518
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,580
all the way from that beach?

519
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,260
How much fun were we having?

520
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,220
I...

521
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,420
It's not like that.

522
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:10,980
I saw you holding hands.

523
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:12,900
I think,

524
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,580
that's love, as good as it can be.

525
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,930
I mean it.

526
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,940
I, I'm quite envious of you,

527
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,010
I really am.

528
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,580
You haven't changed a bit.

529
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,340
Come here.

530
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,580
Let me see the camera.

531
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,820
These are some really nice photos.

532
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:38,930
How about this,

533
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,020
you

534
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,900
help us print these photos

535
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:43,980
and send us a copy.

536
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:45,420
That way,

537
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,500
we won't fixate on the fact

538
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,340
that you stalked on and took pictures of us.

539
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,660
Sure, no problem.

540
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,570
Do you have a pen and paper?

541
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:54,740
Sure.

542
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,580
Don't mail us the photos.

543
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,820
I'm afraid that they might lose the photos.

544
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:11,780
So, I would rather

545
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,930
you deliver them to us.

546
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,100
Okay, I got it.

547
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:16,570
Here.

548
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,100
I will deliver the photos myself.

549
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,700
So, I can leave now?

550
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,220
Off you go.

551
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,620
You gave him He Meng's address, right?

552
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,700
I'm hungry. Let's grab something to eat.

553
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,100
Here.

554
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,060
You tired?

555
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,370
Tastes good?

556
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:49,860
Here, have a try.

557
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,180
This is called "seaweed".

558
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,700
It's very delicious.

559
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:56,460
Grass from the sea?

560
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,300
Yes, grass from the sea.

561
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,540
You like it?

562
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,820
Not as good as regular grass.

563
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,580
You don't like it?

564
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:06,700
Try this.

565
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,220
It's pickled cucumber.

566
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,340
Try it.

567
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:16,580
Finally.

568
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,850
It smells good!

569
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,020
What is this?

570
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,050
This is called a scallop.

571
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:22,100
A big scallop.

572
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,250
I want this one.

573
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:25,130
Shrimp.

574
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,380
Careful, it's hot!

575
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,740
It's very hot.

576
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,940
Be careful.

577
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,260
Let me help.

578
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:48,820
Why are you laughing?

579
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:49,900
It's nothing.

580
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:50,970
I just feel

581
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,660
so delighted to be with you.

582
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:53,940
You see,

583
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,140
when I'm with you,

584
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,700
I feel delighted

585
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,980
even when I'm scalded by the porridge.

586
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,060
When we were walking on that beach,

587
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:00,980
things felt more interesting

588
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,260
even when we got wet.

589
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:03,970
Back then, you called my name,

590
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,020
and I yelled yours.

591
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,700
You turned your head and I got even more delighted.

592
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,700
So many flies.

593
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,420
What should we do?

594
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,090
Now, even the flies

595
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,900
are less disturbing than usual.

596
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,300
What's wrong with you today?

597
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,940
You keep saying stuff like that.

598
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,180
You are embarrassed.

599
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,260
I am not.

600
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,060
You are embarrassed.

601
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,090
I am not.

602
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,140
You are embarrassed.

603
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,860
Why are you repeating yourself?

604
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,260
You are embarrassed, Chi Yan.

605
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:30,780
No, I'm not.

606
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,740
The porridge is cooled down.

607
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,220
Try it.

608
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,820
A blushing Chi.

609
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:15,980
To your northeast, eight o'clock.

610
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:16,900
Don't be late.

611
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,620
What do you want for dinner?

612
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,500
How about steak?

613
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,860
We can also take a look

614
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,500
at the mall.

615
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:32,940
Okay.

616
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:37,780
Let's go.

617
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,179
This is my boyfriend.

618
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:46,020
Hi.

619
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:51,780
Are these for me?

620
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:54,580
Thank you.

621
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:56,020
But no thanks.

622
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,900
I've already

623
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,340
received the best birthday present.

624
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,180
Maybe I should give you two some time alone.

625
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,300
No, you don't.

626
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,900
I have nothing to say to him.

627
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:08,660
Let's go.

628
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,220
Lulu.

629
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,020
Have I ever wronged you?

630
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,140
But you couldn't give me an answer.

631
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,540
Does that make any sense?

632
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:06,780
Hop on.

633
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:10,980
Twenty seconds.

634
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:13,300
What?

635
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:24,890
Today is Lulu's birthday.

636
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,900
Do you have any idea

637
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:27,740
how much this costs?

638
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,050
50 grand.

639
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,980
Those guys were so unreliable.

640
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,660
I literally had to measure it step by step

641
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,140
to find this perfect spot for the fireworks.

642
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,340
So that Lulu can see it from her balcony.

643
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:42,300
I repeated it five times

644
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,940
to help them memorise it.

645
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:51,730
You must consider me a complete idiot

646
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:55,300
and a total loser.

647
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,620
You guys all look so tired

648
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,970
and serious at work.

649
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:04,900
I just want to bring joy to you.

650
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,100
Being happy is good.

651
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,170
Never mind.

652
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,980
That guy

653
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:18,420
looks more successful

654
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,380
and mature than me.

655
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,820
She should be with him.

656
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,380
Xu Zihao,

657
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,620
I do think that you are funny.

658
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,540
You know why?

659
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:32,010
You are standing here torturing yourself.

660
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,340
If you love her, go get her!

661
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:35,700
The fireworks,

662
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:36,730
the tears,

663
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:37,660
she'll never see these.

664
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,220
Why are you trying to move yourself?

665
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:48,820
I don't get it.

666
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:51,100
Why punish yourself for someone

667
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,060
who has given up on you?

668
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,860
It's totally her loss,

669
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,420
breaking up with you.

670
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,140
You are a great guy.

671
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,740
You are kind, you have a good sense of humour.

672
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:03,380
And, you love animals, right?

673
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,060
The first time we met,

674
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,300
you helped me stop the thief.

675
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,580
Who would do that?

676
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,650
Also, for Bulb,

677
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:09,620
you even dressed up as a...

678
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,020
You know, you're great.

679
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:20,530
Right.

680
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,580
You deserve someone better.

681
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:48,010
Be a good girl,

682
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,700
and I will bring you ice cream.

683
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:03,540
Ke Bei is here.

684
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,500
I can't let him find out

685
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,820
that it's He Meng's address that I gave him.

686
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:08,860
Good,

687
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,100
this way he'll never notice us.

688
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:10,890
Come on.

689
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,210
Where have I seen her before?

690
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:29,420
Hello.

691
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,420
How can I help you?

692
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:32,890
I...

693
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,100
I almost forgot.

694
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,140
Are you looking for some flowers?

695
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,540
For your girlfriend or your family?

696
