4
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,890
What happened today 
was totally out of the blue.

5
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,260
Some words just came out of my mouth,

6
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,290
and I hurt your feelings.

7
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:57,740
Chi Yan.

8
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:01,460
After we met again at the mall,

9
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,730
things have got extremely complicated.

10
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,540
Zhang YI's life and my life

11
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,980
have become a total mess.

12
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,020
He is still in the hospital,

13
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,060
and in a bad mood.

14
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:13,940
I really hope

15
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,540
that everything ends here.

16
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,900
And in the future,

17
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,010
I hope you'll leave him alone.

18
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,900
You mean to leave you alone.

19
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,220
You know, Chi Yan.

20
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,100
You have been gifted from a young age.

21
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,700
Not every child is like you.

22
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,650
Judging from that,

23
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,500
you are lucky.

24
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,490
Zhang Yi is not as lucky.

25
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,570
But doesn't he have the right to pursue his dream?

26
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,010
His dream is to be a writer,

27
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,290
and he is now only one step away from that.

28
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,860
If you don't want to help,
 at least don't hinder him.

29
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,090
So you still feel that

30
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,460
I ruined your life

31
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,100
and Zhang Yi’s dream.

32
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,370
Chi Yan.

33
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,130
Could you please let things go?

34
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,060
I know that,

35
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,220
over these years,

36
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,100
I...

37
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:26,900
I did not fulfill

38
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,250
my responsibility as a mother.

39
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,060
For that,

40
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,530
I am sorry.

41
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,540
As long as you don't 
make things difficult for Zhang Yi,

42
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,010
I can make it up to you for everything.

43
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,130
Give me a number.

44
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,300
How much money do you want?

45
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,300
Five million.

46
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,290
Five million.

47
00:04:59,250 --> 00:04:59,900
What?

48
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,060
Is Zhang's dream not worth so much?

49
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,250
OK.

50
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,100
Five million it is.

51
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,650
I will pay you tomorrow.

52
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:33,930
Chi Yan.

53
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:36,420
Chi Yan!

54
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,090
It's about to rain. Where are you going?

55
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,450
What are you doing?

56
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,380
You want to bathe in the rain?

57
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,850
I'll do it with you!

58
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,380
I know you don't want to talk right now.

59
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:18,690
I'll be quiet.

60
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,570
But don't do this to yourself.

61
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:21,570
You'll catch a cold.

62
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,540
I'm fine.

63
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,860
You are not fine at all!

64
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:25,820
I'm fine, really.

65
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,780
My instinct tells me that you are not.

66
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:28,900
I am not afraid.

67
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,900
I haven't been afraid for years.

68
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,570
You are scared, I can tell.

69
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,450
Stop pretending!

70
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,210
I'm used to it, okay?

71
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,409
I'm used to it.

72
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,409
Used to what?

73
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:40,490
To being alone.

74
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:44,740
I am used to the fact that
 not all mothers love their children.

75
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,500
I am used to not expecting anything,

76
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,380
so I won't get disappointed.

77
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,090
Do you remember that raincoat?

78
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:00,770
The day I hid in that alley,

79
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,730
the rain was as heavy as today.

80
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,490
You know what?

81
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,050
The moment you put that raincoat on me,

82
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,300
I started to feel like

83
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,530
I have a set of armor.

84
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,790
I am no longer afraid of 
others seeing my ears and tail.

85
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,780
No one can ever grab my ears and tail

86
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,610
and force me to stay.

87
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:21,330
I also know that

88
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,380
you don't want to open your heart.

89
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,250
You just want to keep it inside.

90
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,490
So what I want to tell you is that

91
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,980
Chi Yan, you are not alone.

92
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,530
I am here with you.

93
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:38,050
I will be your armor.

94
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:42,620
It's okay.

95
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:45,820
It's okay.

96
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,290
It's alright, Chi Yan.

97
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:35,850
Today's filming is not bad.

98
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:37,169
Is it?

99
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:42,450
Please take a look.

100
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,850
This is the content for our next episode.

101
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,290
We want to hear your opinions.

102
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:46,690
Here.

103
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,530
So Dr. Xu will introduce police dogs next week

104
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,810
about detecting explosives and search and rescue.

105
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:57,460
Yes.

106
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,980
I'll just cooperate with him.

107
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:00,290
I have to say,

108
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,180
you guys are really bonding.

109
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:04,170
And our show is getting better.

110
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:04,940
Right.

111
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,610
I have two tickets for the aquarium.

112
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,810
They are a gift from the crew.

113
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:10,930
Thanks.

114
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,530
I'll be leaving, then.

115
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,050
Let's go together.

116
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,900
I have an interview this weekend.

117
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,170
You can take my ticket,

118
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:21,170
and go with your friend.

119
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,370
Or you take mine,

120
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,970
and go with your brother someday.

121
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,410
Actually, I have met Monica,
 the dog in today's show,

122
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,370
three years ago.

123
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,570
At the training base,

124
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,730
it went hiding under the car every time we shot.

125
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:40,770
You couldn't even pull it out.

126
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,130
Now it's a service dog hero.

127
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,490
I guess you can't judge a dog by its looks.

128
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:49,890
Are you alright?

129
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,050
Yeah, I'm OK.

130
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,210
Can you drive steadily?

131
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,050
Sure.

132
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:01,250
Pull over.

133
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:02,130
What?

134
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,690
My stomach is upset. I feel sick.

135
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,300
It's in the middle of nowhere. I'll come with you.

136
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,490
Do you need some help?

137
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:27,610
No.

138
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,890
I... I won't get too close.

139
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,050
Leave me alone!

140
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:47,570
Are you alright?

141
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,250
What's wrong, Mingming?

142
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:53,980
I'm fine.

143
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:01,490
Stay where you are!

144
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:10,930
I'm coming, Mingming.

145
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,010
I'm coming.

146
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,400
I'm so sorry today.

147
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,250
I let you eat the cold bento.

148
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,250
Now is not a good time for that.

149
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:23,240
Stop! Stop! Stop!

150
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,570
There is one on your right.

151
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,370
One step left.

152
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:30,600
OK, we passed it.

153
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:31,600
Is there more?

154
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,240
Take a step forward to your right.

155
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,050
Forward right.

156
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:39,210
Go. Go. Go.

157
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:40,450
OK! Stop. Stop.

158
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,410
There is a pit.

159
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:43,370
Move forward.

160
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:44,360
Go straight?

161
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,210
Yeah.

162
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,880
Forward, forward.

163
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,490
Three, two.

164
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:51,770
One more step.

165
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:52,570
Stop.

166
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,570
Use your right foot,

167
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,610
and take a big step forward.

168
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:59,690
Three, two, one. Go.

169
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,200
OK, all clear.

170
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,170
No more.

171
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,680
Are your feet still hurting?

172
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,770
A well-known local entrepreneur's wife

173
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,370
recently donated five million yuan

174
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:13,170
to the Hope Bird-nest Single Dad Foundation

175
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:16,650
to support single dads who raise their children alone.

176
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,360
This move has caused heated discussions,

177
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,010
and opinions on the Internet are divergent.

178
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:23,250
People are discussing why she chose to sponsor single fathers

179
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,570
when she has a husband and a son.

180
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,490
What is Single Dad Foundation?

181
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,040
Eat.

182
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:30,650
Let me look it up.

183
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,970
She's helping her adopted son's career.

184
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,880
She cares about single parents.

185
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,930
Single Dad Foundation.

186
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,760
Entrepreneur's wife supports single dads.

187
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:49,050
The motivation behind it is unclear.

188
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,040
This is actually her second marriage.

189
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,050
Is she doing this to mourn her ex-husband?

190
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:54,880
Is she...

191
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,250
Stop scrolling.

192
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:58,640
Eat.

193
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,770
Is that photo...

194
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,840
Yes, I donated it in her name.

195
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,240
Where did you get that much money?

196
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,130
She wants to make it up for me,

197
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,610
but I get to decide in what way.

198
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,040
Five million.

199
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,770
You didn't take a penny.

200
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,730
Look at the house.

201
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,250
Eat!

202
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,610
This move is truly impressive.

203
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:50,040
You make her mouthless.

204
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:54,880
You mean speechless.

205
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,010
Is it?

206
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:03,760
Speechless.

207
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,890
You don't like guys who like you.

208
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,010
Aren't you helpless?

209
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,040
I see him all the time.

210
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,970
A cold shoulder would be mean.

211
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,760
But he might take it wrong if I am too nice.

212
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:21,770
So hard.

213
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:23,770
See?

214
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,760
A dog will never have such problems.

215
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,200
Right?

216
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,210
Bulb does not have the problem.

217
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,210
But what's the point of telling him?

218
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,730
How long have you been here?

219
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,130
Why are you eavesdropping on me?

220
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:42,400
Sis,

221
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,770
you have hundreds of admirers.

222
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:48,120
I've never seen you so torn on someone.

223
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,250
Who said it was me?

224
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,200
It's a friend of mine.

225
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,250
I, I am worried for her.

226
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:54,960
Fine.

227
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,330
Your friend.

228
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,730
So now your good friend

229
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:06,720
has an admirer she doesn't like,

230
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,680
and she doesn't know what to do, right?

231
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,360
Kind of.

232
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,530
Then keep her distance

233
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:15,450
and don't give him any hope.

234
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,770
So, I was right.

235
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:26,050
Actually my good friend likes someone else,

236
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,040
what should she do?

237
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,480
Take the initiative.

238
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,930
And...

239
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,930
Spend time with him alone.

240
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:38,760
Cater to his likes.

241
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,090
Lastly,

242
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:47,410
gradually improve your presence in his life.

243
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,480
Qin Liangliang.

244
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:54,450
Are you seeing someone?

245
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:56,970
I might have no experience,

246
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,240
but I have seen a lot.

247
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:04,360
Right.

248
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:05,530
Well,

249
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:08,240
I got two tickets for the aquarium from the crew.

250
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,050
Take your classmate this weekend.

251
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,600
Are you sure you don't want them?

252
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,600
It's not me!

253
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,120
OK?

254
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:40,770
Xiu.

255
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,320
Xiu.

256
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,569
Xiu.

257
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,560
Xiu.

258
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,890
Listen,

259
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,680
we can't sleep in the same bed anymore.

260
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,920
I will clean up a room for you,

261
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,880
and then you can sleep in that room.

262
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,930
OK?

263
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:43,880
Chi Yan, I...

264
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,600
I didn't mean to bother you yesterday.

265
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,720
There was thunder

266
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,650
and pouring rain last night.

267
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,360
I...

268
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,120
I gotta go.

269
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,720
Sorry...

270
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:15,490
Zihao.

271
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,050
Liangliang.

272
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,320
Bulb.

273
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:18,920
Take these.

274
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,770
Go there with my sister.

275
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,560
They came back to me after all.

276
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:48,640
Chi Yan.

277
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:50,680
Qin Mingming.

278
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,990
Are you free this weekend?

279
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,400
My friend gave me two tickets for a book fair.

280
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,160
I think there will be

281
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,400
some painter’s manuscripts on display.

282
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,680
I thought you'd be interested.

283
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,360
Join me?

284
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,360
I have plans for this weekend.

285
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:12,640
It's fine.

286
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,840
I'll ask my friend.

287
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,600
Xu Zihao is available.

288
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,330
Sure, I'll ask him.

289
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,240
See you around.

290
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,840
I'm off to work.

291
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:33,480
What's up?

292
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,840
Can you make some sound when you walk?

293
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,130
Your mind was wandering.

294
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,400
I can help you.

295
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,360
Take that away.

296
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,720
What is that?

297
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,240
Stop.

298
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,120
What happened?

299
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,520
Here.

300
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,720
You like fish so much.

301
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:51,890
You'll like it there.

302
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,480
Aquarium?

303
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:56,640
For me?

304
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:57,560
Bye now.

305
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,360
Bye-bye.

306
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:09,840
Chi Yan.

307
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,320
Look!

308
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,480
Xu gave me two tickets to the aquarium.

309
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,760
We can see the underwater world

310
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,560
in The Mermaid.

311
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,800
I'm not free.

312
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,840
Then when will you be free?

313
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,320
I'm not interested.

314
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,920
Not interested?

315
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,360
You play with it.

316
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,240
Sis,

317
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,480
what happened?

318
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,040
You look dead.

319
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,320
I was rejected.

320
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,520
Xu Zihao dare refuse you?

321
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,190
How come?

322
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,150
I thought Xu Zihao has those tickets.

323
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,800
Who said it was him?

324
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,670
Oh, that's awkward.

325
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,120
Here, here.

326
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,840
Come.

327
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,390
Hurry!

328
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,280
What are you doing?

329
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:30,550
Look,

330
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:31,720
Miss.

331
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,560
I am a lawyer,

332
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,800
not a drug dealer.

333
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,880
You, you don't have to hide in here.

334
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,160
We are good people.

335
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,520
Forget all that.

336
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,990
Take this money.

337
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,480
I can't pay you in full.

338
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,630
So here is the down payment,

339
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,560
like what you guys do in shopping.

340
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,760
Start the investigation tomorrow.

341
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,230
I want the result in a week.

342
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:52,670
Come on.

343
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:53,600
Look.

344
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,190
With so little money...

345
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,920
Miss, are you kidding me?

346
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,710
An urgent service on credit,

347
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:02,960
with so little down payment.

348
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,670
I don't...

349
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,070
Actually, I think...

350
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,080
Xiu.

351
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:28,400
Mengmeng.

352
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,720
Xiu, what are you...

353
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,520
We are...

354
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:34,910
Looking for a cat.

355
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:36,990
Aren't we?

356
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:37,840
Yeah.

357
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,160
This is Ke Bei, a lawyer.

358
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,430
This is Mengmeng.

359
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:40,750
My friend.

360
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,510
Hi.

361
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,470
I have something to do, gotta go.

362
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,470
You take care.

363
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,120
I'll be okay.

364
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,320
Go, go home.

365
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:48,790
Bye-bye.

366
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,670
I'm serious, one week!

367
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,960
It has to be done.

368
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,480
Are you friends with her?

369
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:08,880
What?

370
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,110
What's that face?

371
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,160
How about this?

372
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,360
We make a deal.

373
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,560
You help me ask her out.

374
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,230
I will not charge you

375
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,870
for the investigation, deal?

376
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,560
Please.

377
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:29,510
Deal!

378
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:35,110
What is this place?

379
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,040
So wonderful!

380
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,310
Why can fish swim around

381
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,950
over my head?

382
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,960
I need to buy an annual pass

383
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,550
and come here every day!

384
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,800
My name is Hugh Williams.

385
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,310
I need to live here.

386
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,120
I am Xiu.

387
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,470
Why doesn't the Meow Planet have such a place?

388
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,110
Where?

389
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:02,510
Mongolia.

390
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,440
I said Mongolia.

391
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,440
There is no sea in Mongolia.

392
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,760
Oh, my god!

393
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,470
It looks like that, but...

394
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:19,280
Jump!

395
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,000
Oh god!

396
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,390
I went to the aquarium with Lin Mo.

397
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:03,990
Hello?

398
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:05,310
Hello?

399
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,600
What's up, bro?

400
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:10,560
What’s wrong with you?

401
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,350
What's wrong with me?

402
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,350
I've got terribly mixed feelings.

403
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:19,160
I feel my life is hopeless.

404
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,670
I think...

405
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:20,390
Are you free now?

406
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,310
Yeah.

407
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,190
See you in a bit.

408
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,470
Why do you like fish so much?

409
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,470
No reason.

410
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:38,590
Lions like meat.

411
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,280
Rabbits like grass.

412
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,790
Why can't I like fish?

413
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:43,310
That is to say,

414
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,390
you are a cat.

415
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,070
I am not.

416
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:48,710
I see you've had a lot of fish,

417
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:49,710
are you a cat too?

418
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,040
Excuse me,

419
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:54,480
do you work in a bar?

420
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:55,550
Yes.

421
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,240
I am one of your regulars.

422
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,710
Your craft beer is great.

423
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,110
If I may,

424
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,710
can I add you on WeChat?

425
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,040
Can she?

426
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:05,950
Are you asking me?

427
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,240
It's your call.

428
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:09,830
Why me?

429
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:10,880
It's none of my business.

430
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,590
This is...

431
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:13,590
Your girlfriend?

432
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:14,190
No, I'm not.

433
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:14,670
Yes, she is.

434
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:17,830
No, I'm not.

435
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:18,630
I'm sorry.

436
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:19,830
Excuse me.

437
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,390
You used me.

438
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,190
I did not.

439
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,310
I mean it.

440
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:28,870
Are you kidding me?

441
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,560
I am serious.

442
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,950
Could you think about it?

443
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,670
Of course not!

444
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:36,990
It's because of Chi Yan, isn't it?

445
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:43,030
You said you don't know what love is,

446
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,470
but I can feel that

447
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,270
Chi Yan is special to you.

448
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:54,350
We've been through something together.

449
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,470
Something you didn't know.

450
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,430
No matter what you've been through,

451
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:59,230
what I want to tell you is that

452
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,350
I don't think he is as good as you imagined.

453
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:03,800
He carries many secrets.

454
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,560
He might hurt you one day.

455
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,270
You don't actually know him.

456
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:08,870
He is indeed always sour-faced

457
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:09,670
and bad-tempered,

458
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:10,750
sometimes even weird

459
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,990
and very annoying.

460
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,830
But he is also very gentle and kind,

461
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,070
which you didn't know.

462
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,870
What if he is pretending?

463
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,510
What's wrong with you today?

464
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,950
First, you want me to be your girlfriend,

465
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,590
and now you are speaking ill of my friend.

466
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,150
Just a friend?

467
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,740
I'll leave if you say that again.

468
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,470
OK, fine, I'll stop.

469
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,230
Where do you want to go next?

470
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,470
Xiao Xiu.

471
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,720
I don't know what is it with you today,

472
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,430
but Lin Mo,

473
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,950
I don't like you being like this.

474
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:02,830
Xi...

475
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:46,830
What happened today?

476
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,150
Why so aggressive?

477
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:48,830
Go on.

478
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:04,430
What's wrong?

479
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:15,990
Tell me,

480
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,790
what happened between you two?

481
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:32,910
Something's bothering you.

482
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,150
You can hide it,

483
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,030
but the sword can't.

484
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,030
I'm fine.

485
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,110
I am not a fool.

486
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,750
When Xiu got hurt and went to the hospital,

487
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,790
I saw everything.

488
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:48,550
I've known you for ages,

489
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,110
but I've never seen you

490
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,910
so emotional for another person.

491
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,670
After Xiao Xiu appeared,

492
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,390
all your emotions were controlled by her.

493
00:30:59,110 --> 00:30:59,710
Are they?

494
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:04,580
I can tell,

495
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,150
she is just like you.

496
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:09,230
Maybe she cares about you even more

497
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:10,710
than I think.

498
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,220
Caring about someone

499
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,980
or having someone who cares about you

500
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,820
is a heavy burden.

501
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:27,830
You...

502
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,510
What should I do about you?

503
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:31,270
It's not a burden.

504
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,180
It's reciprocated affection.

505
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,830
You guys like each other.

506
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,750
I would kill to have that.

507
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,790
As a man,

508
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,750
you should take the initiative.

509
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:42,350
She's such a good girl.

510
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:44,030
Don't let her get away.

511
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:58,870
Chi Yan.

512
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,070
Chi Yan.

513
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,710
Xu Zihao?

514
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,620
What happened?

515
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,030
Careful.

516
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,380
Slowly.

517
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,350
Here, here.

518
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:33,870
Careful, Xu.

519
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:34,550
Slowly.

520
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,580
Put him down slowly.

521
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,510
We had a few drinks.

522
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,420
I'll leave now.

523
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,300
Get home safe.

524
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:47,020
Xiu,

525
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:53,300
Chi Yan is not as cold as he seems.

526
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:55,790
I'm off.

527
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:16,380
Chi Yan.

528
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,180
Let's get you changed, alright?

529
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,020
You'll catch a cold if you sleep like this.

530
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:20,700
Come here.

531
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:26,830
Get up.

532
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,030
Good boy.

533
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:33,510
Here.

534
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:43,780
Slowly. Slowly.

535
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:06,990
Chi Yan.

536
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:08,219
I'll take your pants off for you.

537
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,900
I'll take your shoes off first.

538
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,030
Chi Yan.

539
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:45,909
You...

540
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:48,230
You gotta relax.

541
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:57,710
I'm sorry.

542
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,470
Sorry. I'll get you back up.

543
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,350
Back to the bed.

544
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,030
Sit up, Chi Yan.

545
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:52,510
After you've had some water,

546
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,100
I have something to tell you.

547
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,860
Today, I felt so happy

548
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:02,980
at the aquarium.

549
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,270
I saw so many fish swimming

550
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:06,590
over my head.

551
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,260
You know?

552
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,020
There are glasses above me,

553
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,530
and water above the glasses,

554
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:12,860
Many fish swim in the water.

555
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,020
I haven't seen so many fish

556
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:14,660
in a long time.

557
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,590
I haven't felt so happy in a while too.

558
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,500
It was magical.

559
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,260
But I kept thinking,

560
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,900
if...

561
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,030
If you were there with me,

562
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,260
I would be even happier.

563
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:38,740
I don't know what's happening to me.

564
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,860
It's such a strange feeling.

565
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,580
When I see delicious food,

566
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,300
I wanna share it with you.

567
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,340
When I see something fun, I wanna do it with you.

568
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,510
Even if it's just a weird cloud,

569
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:48,510
I wanna take a picture and send it to you.

570
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,900
Even if it's just a bizarre flower,

571
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,260
I wanna call you right away.

572
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,230
"Chi Yan, come and check it out.

573
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,620
There's a bizarre flower here."

574
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,140
Like, I wanna share everything with you,

575
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,140
and do everything with you.

576
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,700
Being with you just makes me happy.

577
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:02,910
Chi Yan, I think...

578
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,180
I think I'm falling...

579
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:16,740
Chi Yan!

580
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,020
Chi Yan!

581
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,900
Xiu, thank you.

582
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,180
Thank you.

583
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:53,980
Last night...

584
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,340
I... I...

585
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,020
You go first.

586
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,020
Do you remember anything from last night?

587
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,220
I tucked you in.

588
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,500
We were on the bed, and you...

589
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:21,500
You...

590
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,570
I remember it.

591
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:32,740
Thank you.

592
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,060
What about the things I told you?

593
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,620
Remember them?

594
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,460
I only remember Zihao carried me home

595
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,740
and put me on the bed.

596
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:55,900
I have no clue

597
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,380
what happened after that.

598
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,330
I need to use the bathroom.

599
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,250
If you didn't hear my speech,

600
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:15,980
I'll...

601
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:18,860
I'll say it again.

602
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:21,820
Someone's at the door.

603
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:27,100
Who is it!

604
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:30,700
Thank you.

605
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,340
Thank you for your concern.

606
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,740
The culprit hasn't been found yet.

607
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:41,300
After all, the reality is not like

608
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,420
the stories I write.

609
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:46,820
There aren't many heroes 
running around and serving justice.

610
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,780
The doctors said,

611
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,460
I might have a serious sequela.

612
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,260
But I firmly believe that

613
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,650
the police will bring the culprit to justice.

614
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,050
Thank you, guys.

615
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:12,010
I'll keep working on my novel.

616
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,700
But I might release new chapters slowly.

617
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:16,420
Didn't Dr. Luo say he's fine?

618
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,140
Why is he playing the victim here?

619
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:19,850
This incident

620
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:21,610
has drawn a lot of public attention.

621
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:24,690
And his fans have been pressuring the police.

622
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:26,300
Even his dad came down to the station

623
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,210
with a lawyer.

624
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:33,810
Any forensic result?

625
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,500
Not yet.

626
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,250
Actually,

627
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:42,340
the drink wasn't meant for him the other day.

628
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,130
It was meant for me.

629
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:50,410
It's just Zhang Yi drank it

630
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,580
before I did.

631
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,290
So if there's really someone

632
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:54,540
trying to cause harm,

633
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,460
the target is not Zhang.

634
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,300
It's...

635
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:00,650
You?

636
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:01,940
It's just a theory.

637
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,290
Now that you've mentioned it,

638
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,370
the flower pot...

639
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,300
Is there really someone out there to get you?

640
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,700
As I said last time,

641
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:15,060
Zhang Yi and I do have our problems,

642
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,860
but he wouldn't kill me for that.

643
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:20,810
Right.

644
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,010
He wouldn't do that to himself.

645
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:25,020
Whatever the truth is,

646
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,660
he insists that you're the one who did it now.

647
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,340
So our priority is

648
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,660
to help you clean your name.

649
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:30,170
Right.

650
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:32,220
We need to prove his innocence first.

651
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,100
That's what matters.

652
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,220
Thank you, guys.

653
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:44,600
Didn't you say there's no surveillance camera?

654
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,770
What's that red light?

655
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:31,620
It's such a coincidence.

656
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:33,900
But who did it?

657
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,490
It might be the culprit

658
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:39,340
or Zhang Yi himself.

659
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,570
But at least this could prove

660
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:45,330
Chi Yan didn't spike the drink.

661
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:46,730
It can prove his innocence.

662
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:47,580
But why is there

663
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:48,900
a camera inside my shop?

664
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:51,250
As for that,

665
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:54,940
we need to ask the person who placed it there.
