153
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,180
Nothing.

Just stay

157

Jiajia had her eyes on a bag.

158
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,010
Pay for it, will you?

159
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,300
Alright. Alright.

160
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,530

We will spend some more time here.

164
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,700
You can take your stuff there.

165
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:58,900
See you on the opposite side.

166
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:02,780
Chi Yan,

167
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,570
I don't want to leave you.

168

But you will understand someday.

I promise you.

170
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,300
I'll come back to visit you soon.

171
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,810
Just go.

172
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:18,940
Don't wake Grandpa up.

173

Hello.

174
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,140
There was a girl here.

175
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,780
In a sweater and shorts.

176
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,340
Really cute.

177
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,300
Have you seen her?

178
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,220
No.

We are broadcasting a notice.

180
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,980
Wang Yifan's parents, please come to

181
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,660
the broadcasting room on the first floor.

182
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,220
Hello.

183
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,660
Hello. Hi.

184
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,130
Hello.

185
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,740
Where does this sound come from?

186
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:41,900
The first floor.

187
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:42,620
First floor?

188
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,220
Right. The first floor.

189
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:43,780
Then could you please...

190
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,980
Could you please wait for me?

191
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,660
Just wait for me.

192
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,260
Mr. Chi Yan,

193
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,540
please come to the waiting area

194
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,220
after hearing this broadcast.

195
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,900
Chi Yan. Chi Yan.

196
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,020
Chi Yan. It's me.

197
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,340
Xiao Xiu is waiting for you.

198
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,380
Chi Yan. Chi Yan.

199
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:01,940
Chi Yan.

200
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,020
Chi Yan.

201
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:20,930
Chi Yan. Let me tell you.

202
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:21,980
There is a black thing

203
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,130
in that room.

204
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,420
They call it a mic.

205
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:25,580
I was talking to it.

206
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,090
Then the whole mall could hear me.

207
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,090
It was amazing.

208
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:30,700
Is this for me?

209
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,340
We didn't bring your ID there today,

210
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,940
so we couldn't get you a sim card.

211
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,660
But other features are fine.

212
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,140
Why is the screen dark?

213
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:39,900
Right.

214
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,180
There.

215
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,050
Press it.

216
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:47,740
It's lightened up!

217
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:51,300
Then what?

218
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,500
Put your finger here.

219
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,610
Here.

220
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,260
A press conference will be held

221
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,650
[Dark Alley Mob by Zhang Yi, the genius writer]

222
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,380
at Rushi Bookstore

223
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,780
for a popular novel

224
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,369
on the internet.

225
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,250
I am sure

226
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,740
you must be familiar with it.

227
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,420
It's Dark Alley Mob.

228
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,819
The mysterious writer

229
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:23,569
[Ferocious fights between gangsters]

230
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:25,940
will also be meeting you today.

231
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,460
[Such a great book! He is indeed a genius!]

232
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:27,980
Now please join the conference

233
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,460
with our journalist.

234
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,570
Hello, everyone.

235
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,740
I am sure you are all fans of

236
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,780
Dark Alley Mob.

237
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,500
Since its publication,

238
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,620
it has received much attention

239
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:44,270
[A best-seller: Dark Alley Mob]

240
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,820
and has been on top of the list of suspense novels.

241
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:45,860
Soon.

242
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,970
its sequel will be published.

243
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,460
And its mysterious writer

244
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,700
will reveal himself.

245
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,660
Now let's welcome the genius behind the book, 
Zhang Yi.

246
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:56,980
Hello.

247
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,900
Many people say that you are a genius writer.

248
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,490
Could you please share with us

249
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:04,980
what has inspired you

250
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,940
to write this book?

251
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,260
I won't say I am a genius.

252
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,180
I believe many of you

253
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,140
have heard of that saying.

254
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,420
Genius is 1% inspiration

255
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,140
and 99% perspiration.

256
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,100
Writing does rely on inspiration.

257
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,620
But inspiration is the result of

258
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,460
continuous hard work.

259
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,220
It will only occur in my mind

260
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,420
with hours of

261
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,300
fieldwork, surveys

262
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,140
and investigation.

263
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,260
What I need to do

264
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,620
is to catch it.

265
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,260
You are indeed a genius.

266
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,260
That was really inspiring.

267
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,380
You can't use it without a sim card.

268
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,620
I will get you one.

269
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,940
I really love it.

270
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:48,900
What's this?

271
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,020
A letter?

272
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,580
It was

273
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,340
in that treasure box.

274
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,420
I won't read it.

275
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,340
Uncle Fu said we should respect others' privacy.

276
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,980
Is that from Yu Shan?

277
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,340
Is he important to you?

278
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:13,500
Yes.

279
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,420
He was my class teacher at high school.

280
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:17,900
We've been in contact through letters.

281
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:21,020
Can I write to him?

282
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,020
Why would you?

283
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,250
Just to talk about you.

284
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,500
It may be helpful for returning the favor.

285
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,020
No.

286
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:28,820
Yes.

287
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:29,860
Watch TV.

288
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,060
Petty.

289
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,930
A press conference will be held

290
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:47,060
at Rushi Bookstore

291
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,460
for a popular novel

292
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,060
on the internet.

293
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:50,940
I am sure

294
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,770
you must be familiar with it.

295
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:52,740
Isn't that your book?

296
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,140
It's Dark Alley Mob.

297
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,500
The mysterious writer

298
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,930
will also be meeting you today.

299
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,900
I won't say I am a genius.

300
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,010
He's not Yan Yi.

301
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:01,940
Why is he called

302
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:03,700
Zhang Yi?

303
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,140
Genius is 1% inspiration

304
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:05,700
Who's Zhang Yi?

305
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,170
and 99% perspiration.

306
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,860
Writing does rely on inspiration.

307
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,340
But inspiration is the result of

308
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,140
continuous hard work.

309
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,460
It will only occur in my mind

310
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,780
with hours of...

311
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:17,540
Hello.

312
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,940
Have you seen the news?

313
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:19,980
Yes.

314
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,020
I don't know what's happened.

315
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,380
I don't understand why he would say that

316
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,090
he's the writer of that novel.

317
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,140
I can't get in touch with his team, either.

318
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,700
I didn't receive anything from them.

319
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,370
But rest assured.

320
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,820
I will sort things out.

321
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,060
Alright.

322
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,900
Chi Yan wrote all that.

323
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,180
You liar!

324
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,660
He's evil!

325
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,620
Cheers.

326
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,210
Congratulations!

327
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:49,650
Congratulations!

328
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,060
Congratulations!

329
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,140
All because of you!

330
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,980
All because of you!

331
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,620
Cheers.

332
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,460
Let us create better works!

333
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,140
Shall we?

334
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,460
Let's do this!

335
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,930
Alright. Keep up the good work.

336
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,140
Keep that momentum. Let's start working now.

337
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,060
Let's get started.

338
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:08,740
Let's do this.

339
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,820
Thank you, Boss.

340
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,260
Go. Let's go.

341
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,060
Let's do this.

342
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:12,820
Hello.

343
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:15,820
Sorry,

344
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,980
he's pretty busy right now.

345
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,810
I will let him know later.

346
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,820
Let me note down your message.

347
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,380
Get the interview script done.

348
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,140
Boss needs to prepare for it.

349
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:23,860
Alright.

350
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,170
This is what Boss will wear tomorrow.

351
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:26,940
Get them done.

352
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:27,580
Oh,

353
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,740
prepare a pair of glasses.

354
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,380
Is the interview tomorrow

355
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,100
or the day after?

356
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,770
Boss prefer the day after tomorrow.

357
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,180
Then I will draft a plan based on that.

358
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:35,580
Good.

359
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:49,900
Boss,

360
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:51,860
are we still

361
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,340
paying Chi Yan

362
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,620
as we promised?

363
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,260
The book is pretty hyped up.

364
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,530
I'm afraid that won't be enough.

365
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,380
How much do you want to pay him?

366
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,300
How much do you think he's worth?

367
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,140
Not much.

368
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,540
Please.

369
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,620
Dark Alley Mob

370
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,940
because of what Boss did.

371
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,940
Without him,

372
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,490
Chi Yan is just an average writer.

373
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:15,980
He couldn't have made it.

374
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,540
Then pay him as we promised.

375
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,020
People will step up

376
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,140
if you take a step back.

377
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:24,540
I can convince him.

378
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:25,620
Go.

379
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:41,980
Miss,

380
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,730
do you know the way to Chi's Bookstore?

381
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,020
Are you going to the bookstore?

382
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,490
Chi Yan.

383
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:03,660
I avenged you today.

384
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,380
Guess who I came across.

385
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:07,340
I don't have time for that.

386
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,460
I am busy right now.

387
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,140
Let me tell you.

388
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,340
I met Zhang Yi.

389
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,210
You met Zhang Yi?

390
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,460
Do you know the way to Chi's Bookstore?

391
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,900
Are you Zhang Yi?

392
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,770
You are a fan.

393
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,700
Hello.

394
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:29,940
I've read every one of your novels.

395
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,860
Especially Dark Alley Mob.

396
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,180
That's my favorite.

397
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,580
It's a shame that

398
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,780
I can only read it online.

399
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,010
Didn't expect that

400
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,100
someone as pretty as you would be my fan.

401
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,210
Thank you.

402
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,100
The new book has been published.

403
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,730
I put my heart and soul into it.

404
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:45,180
In the future,

405
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,660
I will bring to you better works.

406
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,900
I am looking forward to it.

407
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,660
Are you going to the bookstore?

408
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,210
Yes.

409
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,940
It's over there.

410
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:55,260
Go straight, and then turn left.

411
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,980
You will see a dump.

412
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,540
Then turn left and go straight.

413
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,570
Pass four intersections.

414
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,940
Turn left and go straight, and you are there.

415
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,540
Such a long way.

416
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,610
I just pointed him in all the wrong directions

417
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:08,340
and led him to the back alley.

418
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,810
He must be stuck there now.

419
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:10,660
How about that?

420
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,820
Does that make you feel better?

421
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:13,500
Think.

422
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,900
People are broiling in the sun now.

423
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:15,900
It's really hot.

424
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,540
And he's lost.

425
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,700
I sent him on the wrong way.

426
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,620
He's stuck there.

427
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,130
Hot, thirsty and tired.

428
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,780
The exact opposite of what he was on TV.

429
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,620
Super hilarious.

430
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,420
What a jerk.

431
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,380
Interesting.

432
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,130
And I pointed him to the dump.

433
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,890
Lots of flies there.

434
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:34,620
You know that?

435
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,420
He's wearing an expensive suit today.

436
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,820
Lots of flies.

437
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,140
Must have driven him crazy.

438
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,580
Not like what he is on TV at all.

439
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,900
All classy and elegant.

440
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:43,900
You...

441
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,860
Do you feel better now?

442
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,650
Any better?

443
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:51,820
Good?

444
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,540
Are you feeling better?

445
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,090
A little bit?

446
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,700
You smiled.

447
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:03,860
Good?

448
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,260
I just walked past here.

449
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,010
Turn left.

450
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,420
Turn left.

451
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:28,980
Then I told him

452
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,420
to turn left and go straight.

453
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,060
Then he will see a dump.

454
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:34,340
Then turn left and go straight again.

455
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,170
Then pass four intersections.

456
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:36,780
Then...

457
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,180
Hello, Chi Yan.

458
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,420
Buying books?

459
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,530
Just grab them here.

460
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,140
I am here to explain.

461
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:20,410
Explain what?

462
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:21,900
Chi Yan,

463
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,100
I really admire your talent.

464
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,540
To be honest,

465
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,300
I hope our collaboration can continue.

466
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:29,620
I don't need that.

467
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:31,900
Just leave.

468
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,420
Running a bookstore like this

469
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,260
must cost a lot.

470
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,860
None of your business.

471
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,260
If you continue to work on

472
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,380
the Dark Alley Mob series,

473
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,340
I can pay you more.

474
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,660
You decide the number.

475
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,380
You do the writing.

476
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:51,770
I do the marketing.

477
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,060
It's a win-win.

478
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,180
After the publisher pays me,

479
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:01,420
I will not work on

480
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,420
the Gangsters series anymore.

481
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,420
I admit that

482
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,900
its success has a lot

483
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,100
to do with you.

484
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,900
But starting from today, we don't owe each other

485
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:13,700
any more.

486
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,420
Did you meet

487
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,650
my stepmother at the cafe?

488
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,340
After she went home,

489
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,700
she started to worry about your career.

490
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,130
She asked me to take care of you.

491
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,140
Zhang Yi.

492
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,540
What?

493
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,610
I have nothing to do with

494
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,370
what's between you and her.

495
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:45,900
You hear me?

496
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,660
She abandoned you and married my dad,

497
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,860
doing all the household chores,

498
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,820
making compromises,

499
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,290
just to have a better life.

500
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,420
Don't you want to make her proud?

501
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,900
I won't work with you.

502
00:27:58,570 --> 00:27:59,420
Think twice.

503
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,180
Without my campaign and marketing,

504
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,580
no one will read your stuff.

505
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,140
Once you figure it out,

506
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,300
call me any time.

507
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,380
You all clear?

508
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,900
Just do as I said.

509
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,620
No need to hold back.

510
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,220
Just do as I said.

511
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,100
Hey, babe.

512
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,610
Alright. It's done.

513
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,740
A piece of cake.

514
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,420
Just waiting for the cab. I am fine.

515
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,180
The driver's so slow.

516
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,100
Alright.

517
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,970
Whatever you want to eat.

518
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:01,820
Good.

519
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,100
See you later.

520
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:04,500
Bye.

521
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,380
Go.

522
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,610
What? Go!

523
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:15,460
Go. Go.

524
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,820
Go! Go! Go!

525
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:41,140
Turns out the genius writer is scared of cats.

526
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:41,770
Why are you scared?

527
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:42,650
They are so adorable.

528
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:42,900

Can I ask you a question?

550
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,340
Why did you write for him?

551
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,780
Why didn't you publish the book yourself?

552

I think that would be better.

Nothing.

556
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:14,140
If you publish the book yourself,

557
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,700
you can make more money.

558
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,900
It's better for the bookstore.

559

But you didn't.

Good.

566

Don't ever work with him again.

567
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:37,210
He doesn't deserve the book you wrote for him.

Actually,

569
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:45,380

570
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,850

00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,540
Say that after you get out.

703
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:42,940
Get out!

704
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,820
What on earth have you done?

705
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,020
Being chased by people like that.

706
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,540
Nothing major. Don't worry.

707
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:08,740
I am not worried about you.

708
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:11,100
I really am not.

709
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,140
Thank you

710
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,420
for that.

711
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,500
No problem.

712
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,860
You helped me the other day.

713
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,020
Now I don't owe you.

714
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,420
You do care about those things.

715
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:24,740
How about this?

716
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,100
Do you like that dress?

717
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:28,420
I can buy that for you.

718
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:29,140
I am telling you.

719
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,650
You can't tell anyone about what happened today.

720
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,420
If you do, I will...

721
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,970
Are you afraid that people would laugh at you?

722
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,420
You look good in that dress.

723
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,340
I said don't tell anyone.

724
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,100
Stop saying that.

725
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:41,770
Don't tell anyone.

726
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,890
Have you named it?

727
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,180
It's called Bulb.

728
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:57,260
What an odd name.

729
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,100
Why odd.

730
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,250
We've got Mingming,

731
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:00,980
Liangliang,

732
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:01,860
and Bulb.

733
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,980
We are family.

734
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,420
Fine. Bulb.

735
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:05,940
Here.

736
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,060
Bulb's fine.

737
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,260
It's just having a cold.

738
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:11,900
Remember to keep its bed dry.

739
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,540
Make sure it stays hydrated.

740
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,420
Hello,

741
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,330
have you seen my brother?

742
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,580
He's in that room.

743
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:17,580
Thank you.

744
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,100
Question.

745
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:26,220
How come you look prettier

746
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,330
each time I meet you?

747
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:29,780
All done?

748
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:30,660
All done.

749
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:31,380
Let's go home.

750
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,420
Bulb.

751
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,300
Run. Run. Run.

752
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:45,620
What a weirdo.

753
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,900
Nice to animals though.

754
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:52,850
Sister,

755
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,660
I think the vet seems nice.

756
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,060
Professional too.

757
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,330
Don't you think he's too talkative?

758
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:01,140
Annoying.

759
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,700
I think that

760
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:09,060
he's exceptionally interested in you.

761
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,780
Exceptionally interested.

762
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,380
I am telling you.

763
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,700
It's called pestering.

764
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:14,970
Don't you ever do that!

765
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,660
He must treat every girl that way.

766
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,100
Chi Yan,

767
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,020
just think twice about that.

768
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:22,420
You've been working on

769
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,620
Gangsters for such a long time.

770
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:24,770
It would be a great pity

771
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:25,940
if it ends now.

772
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,260
I understand where you are coming from,

773
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,580
but Zhang Yi has crossed the line.

774
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,130
He's willing to pay you extra

775
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:34,180
to make up for that.

776
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,740
In a way,

777
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:37,180
it's a good thing.

778
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,340
He also said that

779
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,100
you can decide on the number.

780
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,020
I don't want that.

781
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,300
We men should be more flexible.

782
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:51,100
I always handed in my drafts in advance.

783
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,980
And I paid every penny I should.

784
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:55,220
Can we just let this go?

785
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,820
Fine. You are right.

786
00:42:58,460 --> 00:42:59,300
But I am thinking that

787
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:00,500
if we stop collaborating

788
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,580
with Zhang Yi,

789
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,780
what would happen to you?

790
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:05,740
Look at your bookstore.

791
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:06,820
You are the only one here.

792
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,380
Don't you need money?

793
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:14,900
That romance novel you mentioned,

794
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:22,740
I will take it.

795
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:24,340
Really?

796
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:25,820
Let me get this straight.

797
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:27,140
You can't regret it.

798
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,940
I will draft the contract at once.

799
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:30,220
Fine. Fine.

800
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:31,540
Just stop that.

801
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:33,060
He's just some writer.

802
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:34,300
He can quit if he wants to.

803
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:35,660
Find the best novelist

804
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:36,940
out there in the market.

805
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,340
We can definitely

806
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:39,900
find someone to be my ghostwriter.

807
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:42,660
Here.

808
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:47,980
Here.

809
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:49,050
Yi,

810
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:51,100
are you stressed about work?

811
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:54,260
I made this ganoderma soup especially for you.

812
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:56,140
Have some.

813
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:58,940
Here, have some.

814
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:02,220
What are you laughing for?

815
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:04,980
Am I a laughing stock now?

816
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,500
Am I a clown?

817
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:12,100
Say something.

818
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:17,220
No, my son.

819
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,820
I think you are too tired, son.

820
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,340
Stop calling me son

821
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:22,260
and behave like my mom.

822
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:22,940
Tell me.

823
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,250
Have you been seeing your real son?

824
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:33,980
Yi,

825
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:36,740
I know you and Chi Yan don't see eye to eye.

826
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:38,740
There must be some misunderstandings.

827
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:40,010
He's not a bad kid.

828
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:41,500
Do you want me

829
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,140
to persuade him?

830
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:45,260
Persuade him?

831
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:47,740
Are you helping him or me?

832
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,340
Yi, listen to me.

833
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:54,850
Stop that.

834
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:03,820
Uncle Fu.

835
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:05,380
Are there easy jobs

836
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,220
that pay a lot?

837
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:08,340
Can you recommend some to me?

838
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,100
Doesn't he give you a place to live and food?

839
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,100
Why would you want to work?

840
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:14,450
I want to return his favor as soon as possible.

841
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:17,060
That's why I found a lawyer.

842
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:17,900
A lawyer?

843
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:18,980
A lawyer.

844
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:20,300
He can help me.

845
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,300
He can help me find out

846
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,340
Chi Yan's wishes.

847
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:23,860
That way I can return his favor.

848
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:24,660
But...

849
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:27,020
But he's a bit expensive.

850
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,900
That's why I need to find a job

851
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,380
to pay him.

852
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,980
It makes sense.

853
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:37,140
If you want to find a job,

854
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:40,290
you can try those apps.

855
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:41,460
You can find them on your phone.

856
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:42,500
On my phone?

857
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:44,370
Here.

858
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:47,780
You can search if there are

859
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:49,260
well-paid part-time jobs nearby.

860
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:52,460
This one.

861
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,020
I want to find one closer to the bookstore.

862
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:02,300
This one.

863
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:06,620
This beer place is still hiring?

864
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:07,540
I tried this place

865
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:08,900
the last time, but failed.

866
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,700
Maybe they haven't

867
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:13,700
taken it down.

868
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:15,380
Let me call them.

869
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:16,730
I can do that.

870
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:17,140
I can do that.

871
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:18,490
I know how to make calls now.

872
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:23,500
When it's in pale yellow...

873
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,530
There's so much to learn.

874
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:28,610
Litre.

875
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:34,420
When the liquid gets muddy,

876
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:40,370
there will be sediments.

877
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:48,220
There is too much.

878
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:53,060
I can't remember.

879
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:55,180
It's a good thing that you start learning.

880
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:56,180
But do be careful.

881
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,260
Don't ever drink again.

882
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:58,580
Every time you do...

883
00:46:59,020 --> 00:46:59,530
I won't.

884
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:00,410
I am there to work.

885
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:01,980
And I am preparing for it.

886
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:05,620
What are these?

887
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:16,100
Beer Brand Stories.

888
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:18,130
Brewer 101.

889
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:20,740
Brewing Masters.

890
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:23,410
For me?

891
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:24,980
Happened to see them.

892
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,140
Happened to see them?

893
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,700
Then Mr. Chi,

894
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:35,500
do you mind telling me more about beer?

895
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,370
You are so annoying.

896
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:40,780
Just for a while.
