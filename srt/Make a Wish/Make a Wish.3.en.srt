Xu Zihao,

180
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,790
why are you here in the middle of the night?

181
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,230
I...

182
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:26,620
Chi,

183
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,070
I made a huge mistake.

184
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,230
She seemed so nice.

185
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,390
I didn't do anything wrong.

186
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,390
How could she just

187
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,630
drop me here and leave?

188
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,990
You must have pestered her.

189
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,310
How could you think of me that way?

190
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,630
She's amazing.

191
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,230
So amazing.

192
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,750
Could you be faster?

193
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,070
Wait,

194
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,910
why are you still with her?

195
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,150
Have you got feelings for her?

196
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,030
I am not you.

197
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,390
That's your bias against me.

198
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,510
Don't play with the steering wheel.

199
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,150
It has stopped.

200
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,430
It stopped.

201
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,550
Fine.

202
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:39,910
Be careful with the steering wheel.

203
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,350
I'm so gonna complain about this.

204
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,710
Please push as hard as you can. It's really late now.

205
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,200
Push.

206
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:18,630
Chi.

207
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,110
Chi.

208
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,030
What now?

209
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:22,840
I quit.

210
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:23,550
What?

211
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,310
I am doing this all on my own.

212
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,630
She's not making any effort.

213
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,310
You weigh 75 kg, and with the car.

214
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,240
I am gonna die.

215
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,950
We are here to help you.

216
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,430
We are here to help you, right?

217
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,430
I asked Chi to come here.

218
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,670
Not you.

219
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:34,670
You deserve it.

220
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,310
You got yourself in trouble for that girl.

221
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,360
Wait, Chi...

222
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,310
You deserve it.

223
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,470
You deserve it.

224
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:46,830
I am talking about you.

225
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,270
Fine, let's push this thing.

226
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,590
Telling on me, huh?

227
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,110
Xu Zihao.

228
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,110
Xu Zihao. Xu Zihao. Xu Zihao.

229
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:08,630
What?

230
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,920
What's that?

231
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,750
Over there.

232
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:15,830
That one.

233
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,030
What's that?

234
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:17,990
What?

235
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,190
Look, over there.

236
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,870
What? What? What?

237
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,430
Look, over there.

238
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:23,390
Look.

239
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:23,950
What?

240
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:25,240
What?

241
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,390
Chi.

242
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,320
Ghost!

243
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,790
Chi, a ghost! Help!

244
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,790
There's no ghost!

245
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:31,550
There is!

246
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:32,670
Chi, a ghost!

247
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,070
Such a coward.

248
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,270
This is the last resort.

249
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,320
Go!

250
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,910
Go!

251
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:57,270
Go!

252
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:57,220
♫Let me kiss this puff of wind♫

253
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,780
♫Then I'll give you a hug♫

254
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,230
Go! Quick!

255
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:01,510
Quick!

256
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,700
♫What's happening between you and me♫

257
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,550
Go! Quick!

258
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,980
♫Let's look at the starry sky♫

259
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,540
♫Then I'll bring you a romantic encounter♫

260
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,640
♫Maybe we will have the same dream♫

261
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,410
♫Maybe we will wander in the city together♫

262
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:19,440
♫I'll walk slowly to slow time down♫

263
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,320
♫I'll wait for you to find me in the crowd♫

264
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,800
♫I want to fill the void in life with you♫

265
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,520
♫My dream about the future♫

266
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,680
♫Just follow the traces on the ground♫

267
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,890
♫And you'll be able to find me♫

268
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,510
I really admire you.

269
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,270
I mean,

270
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:02,160
How could you make someone like Chi

271
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:02,910
fall for you?

272
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,230
You even move in his place.

273
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,869
Fall for me? No.

274
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:07,310
I just live in his box

275
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:08,680
for the moment.

276
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,760
Sit. Take a seat.

277
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,230
What do you need me for?

278
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,160
I want to ask you something.

279
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:16,869
Go ahead.

280
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:20,319
You are Chi's best friend, right?

281
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,520
You should know if he's got any wishes.

282
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,790
Or does he want anything?

283
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,160
Why would you want to know that?

284
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:31,680
It seems to me that

285
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,110
he's always unhappy.

286
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,280
I want to help him.

287
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,840
You can't.

288
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,510
If I can, I would have helped him.

289
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,590
The problem is that he's got no wishes

290
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:43,390
No way.

291
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,000
Human beings have all got wishes.

292
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,950
I don't know if it counts,

293
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,120
but he always wants him and those around him

294
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,200
to be healthy.

295
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,280
Makes sense.

296
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,640
Those around him.

297
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,120
Probably not him.

298
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,560
Then who else?

299
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:37,560
[Ten o'clock today. East gate of the park]

300
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,590
Ten o'clock today.

301
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,720
East gate of the park.

302
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:33,750
If you don't come,

303
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,600
say goodbye to your fish.

304
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,000
Valerie Edward the second,

305
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Enemy of rats, protector of cats.

306
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,080
Stop! I haven't had food yet.

307
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,560
What do you want now?

308
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,550
Make your wish come true.

309
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,550
I've told you that

310
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,550
I don't have any wishes now.

311
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,800
You must have got some.

312
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,720
Just close your eyes.

313
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:22,630
Stop messing around.

314
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:23,390
I have to go back to my store.

315
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,150
I don't have time for this.

316
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:24,800
Wait, no!

317
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,320
I am going to send it back to nature.

318
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,670
No! No!

319
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:29,550
What do you want?

320
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,190
Just close your eyes.

321
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,270
Just close your eyes.

322
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,320
Be careful.

323
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,560
Are you done yet?

324
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:54,550
Chi Yan!

325
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,630
Chi Yan, help!

326
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,000
Chi Yan!

327
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:57,830
Chi Yan!

328
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:58,880
Chi Yan!

329
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,030
Chi Yan!

330
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:00,760
Chi Yan!

331
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:02,760
Chi Yan!

332
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:03,840
Chi Yan!

333
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,360
Chi Yan!

334
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,310
Chi Yan, help!

335
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,160
Chi Yan!

336
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,520
Chi Yan, help!

337
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,360
Wait for me.

338
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,510
Chi Yan.

339
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,750
I just want you to make a wish.

340
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,200
I don't know what else I can do.

341
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:19,880
Chi Yan.

342
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,080
Wait for me.

343
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,400
Wait for me.

344
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,960
What do you want?

345
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,470
Make your wish come true.

346
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,360
Stop that nonsense.

347
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,000
This world

348
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,600
is a lot more dangerous than you think.

349
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,880
You can come to me if you've got questions.

350
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,710
I can help you with that.

351
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:54,910
I can explain things.

352
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,520

528
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:45,690
Just as cats like to hide things,

529
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:46,540
human beings

530
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:50,060
hide their secrets in their diaries,

531
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,290
so that others would not find them out.

532
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:55,690
Chi Yan always talks about privacy.

533
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:58,860
What exactly is privacy.

534
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:01,890
Privacy is just like

535
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,490
a cat's belly.

536
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,780
It's a part of your body.

537
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:11,180
It's okay if you show it to others yourself.

538
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,700
If someone else touches it,

539
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,610
you would get mad.

540
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,370
What about him?

541
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:20,690
When will he

542
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:23,620
show his cat belly to me?

543
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:26,290
He gave you a name.

544
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:27,580
Xiao Xiu.

545
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:28,850
A good one.

546
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,220
After I return the favor,

547
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,610
I can use my own name.

548
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:32,930
My original name is so much better.

549
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,180
He can't even pronounce it.

550
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,410
I don't like Xiu.

551
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,410
One thing special about names.

552
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,170
Once someone calls you by a certain name,

553
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:42,130
that name belongs to you.

554
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,890
It won't disappear even if you don't use it.

555
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,420
They are all abandoned by their owners.

556
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,130
Try to spend more time with him.

557
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:55,740
Pat his head.

558
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,940
Talk to him.

559
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,850
Anything else I need to pay attention to?

560
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,219
He needs to be vaccinated.

561
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:16,420
There's a nice hospital on the east side.

562
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:17,780
I can send you the address.

563
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,620
Good, thank you.

564
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:19,770
It's alright.

565
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:23,969
Very good.

566
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:25,489
Next one.

567
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:37,170
Doctor Xu,

568
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,420
a golden retriever.

569
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,179
You may go now and help with the reception.

570
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:45,940
Alright.

571
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:50,810
Get him on the table.

572
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:54,940
Get him on the table.

573
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:05,300
There, there.

574
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:06,740
Don't bite me.

575
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,820
I am going to hug you.

576
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:15,420
Lift his chest.

577
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,170
The part behind his front legs.

578
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:28,700
There.

579
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,060
Behind his front legs.

580
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,580
Just do it.

581
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,500
I'm scared of dogs.

582
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,380
Can you help me?

583
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,700
Why would you keep it as a pet then?

584
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:41,970
My brother,

585
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:43,530
he really likes golden retrievers.

586
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,700
You do care about your brothers a lot.

587
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,180
How about that?

588
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,330
Hold his back legs.

589
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,020
Just do it.

590
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,180
Hold them tight.

591
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:02,580
Just hold them.

592
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:04,090
Hold them tight.

593
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:06,610
There we go.

594
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:15,940
Good boy, stay still.

595
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,100
There you go.

596
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:22,540
You...

597
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:28,180
It's you.

598
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:30,610
It's you!

599
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,610
You were so timid.

600
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:33,300
No wonder I didn't recognize you.

601
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,980
Your foot seems fine.

602
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:36,940
Thanks to you.

603
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,060
It works perfectly.

604
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,820
How come you are scared of dogs?

605
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,810
Have you got a problem with that?

606
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,690
Better than you pestering girls.

607
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,330
Right. That one was on me.

608
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,580
Thank you for teaching me a lesson.

609
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,180
Now I am more careful with my behaviors.

610
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,050
Is that done?

611
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,340
Let's go.

612
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:58,860
Go.

613
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,340
Hope to see you again.

614
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,140
No shower in seven days.

615
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,140
If the wound gets swollen, 
cover it with a warm towel.

616
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,660
Feel free to drop by if he's got any problems.

617
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:29,700
Alright, thanks a lot.

618
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,180
No problem.

619
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:34,330
See you.

620
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,060
Bye.

621
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,620
Human beings

622
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,500
can be really complicated.

623
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,420
They may look innocent on the outside

624
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,460
but evil on the inside.

625
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,180
Cold on the outside,

626
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:07,140
warm on the inside.

627
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,300
They've also got a saying.

628
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,980
There is no coincidence.

629
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,420
It's all meant to be.

630
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:18,010
Just like one meeting the other.

631
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,500
So there's no need to rush.

632
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,300
Take your time.

633
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:26,540
Alright.

634
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,540
I guess I should apologize.

635
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,100
Just say sorry. No big deal.

636
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:58,900
Long time no see.

637
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,380
Here.

638
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,740
We are waiting for you.

639
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,660
It tastes so good. What's this?

640
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,300
Human beings

641
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,740
have got such nice drinks.

642
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,740
I want one more.

643
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,020
Let's take a picture together.

644
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:32,550
Here.

645
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:36,460
You are so pretty.

646
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,150
Here.

647
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:44,380
Can we take a picture together?

648
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:44,990
Let's do this.

649
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:45,940
Come on.

650
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:55,550
What's this?

651
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:56,300
Come on?

652
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:00,950
I know what it is.

653
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:02,070
What's this?

654
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,390
It's the kitty camera.

655
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,180
Kitty camera?

656
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:06,350
What's that?

657
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:09,990
Stay, kitty.

658
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:10,460
Why are you leaving?

659
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:12,780
Where are you going?

660
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:14,510
Come back and dance, kitty.

661
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:20,700
Where's she?

662
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,100
There, quick!

663
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:23,780
There, find her.

664
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,020
Don't go, kitty.

665
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:32,750
Come back and dance.

666
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:33,310
Don't go.

667
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,140
Kitty.

668
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:44,460
Show yourself, kitty.

669
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,020
Kitty.

670
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:46,900
Where has she gone?

671
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:48,390
Where is she?

672
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:50,540
That way. There.

673
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:51,060
Alright.

674
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:51,790
Let's go there.

675
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:52,260
Alright, alright.

676
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:53,180
Go.

677
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:53,870
Kitty.

678
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,820
Why would you go?

679
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:11,070
Is that her?

680
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:12,390
Yes.

681
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:12,860
Let's go.

682
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:23,150
She's there.
