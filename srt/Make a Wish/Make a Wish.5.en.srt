00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,820
This is for the plate.

176
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,620
Please contact me if you need any help.

177
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:47,780
Alright.

178
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,330
Thanks a lot.

179
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:02,860
Miss.

180
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,460
Have you considered being a model?

181
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06,380
A model?

182
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,460
What is that?

183
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,210
They just do the catwalk.

184
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,220
And shoot some movies.

185
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,700
You've got the look.

186
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,050
I'm sure you can earn a lot.

187
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,660
A lot?

188
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,060
I...I can do this.

189
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,500
I am great at catwalk.

190
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:22,180
Let me show you.

191
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,380
Right. That's right.

192
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,330
That's the way to go.

193
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,340
How about this.

194
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,820
Write down your number and other information.

195
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,660
Our company will draft a training plan for you.

196
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,740
I don't have a number.

197
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,260
No number?

198
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,090
Where do you live then?

199
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,980
I live in a bookstore.

200
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,340
Chi's Bookstore.

201
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,740
Chi's Bookstore.

202
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,810
I know that place.

203
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,010
Fine.

204
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,500
Then pay the signing up fee.

205
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,420
Fee?

206
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,140
How much?

207
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:48,860
Five hundred.

208
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:50,980
Five hundred.

209
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:51,780
Well,

210
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,500
this is all I have.

211
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,100
This much?

212
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,140
Fine.

213
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,260
We can deal with the rest during training.

214
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,780
Right. We will call you.

215
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,650
Thank you.

216
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,300
What are you doing?

217
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:41,940
Thank you.

218
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,900
Thanks a lot.

219
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,260
I don't want the one with beef stew.

220
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,180
I want the one with seafood.

221
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,780
Then forget about dinner.

222
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,290
Fine. I will eat this.

223
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,100
Today...

224
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,020
You go first.

225
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,220
I shouldn't have yelled at you.

226
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,370
You didn't mean to make yourself

227
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,380
famous on the internet.

228
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,300
It's not your fault.

229
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:27,900
Actually,

230
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,140
I did something wrong, too.

231
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,220
I shouldn't have made that decision on my own.

232
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,460
We've all done something wrong.

233
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,580
I didn't say I've done something wrong.

234
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,660
I said I shouldn't have blamed you.

235
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:45,370
No.

236
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,980
I've admitted my mistake.

237
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,890
You should do the same.

238
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,540
My bad.

239
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,340
When will I have enough money?

240
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,340
Chi Yan.

241
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,100
Can people

242
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,780
make money by catching mice

243
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,980
in the human world?

244
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,700
I am so much better than Tom.

245
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,610
Do you think Tom fails to catch Jerry

246
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:29,700
because he's not capable?

247
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,570
Is he not?

248
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,530
Maybe the two

249
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:36,940
of them are in need of each other.

250
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,740
But cats and mice are enemies.

251
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,090
Tom never catches Jerry.

252
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,060
That way, the story will never end.

253
00:14:59,180 --> 00:14:59,970
I don't understand.

254
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,580
I will never

255
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,780
be friends with a mouse.

256
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,540
This one, please.

257
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,740
Can you let your cat

258
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,570
do the check-out for us?

259
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:32,780
Your dresses.

260
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,730
It's Lolita style.

261
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:36,490
Pretty, isn't it?

262
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,460
Loli...

263
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,140
Is that a spell?

264
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,650
If I do the spell, I can have a dress like yours.

265
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,380
We are here to buy books.

266
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,260
Miss,

267
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,260
where is your cat?

268
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,370
We've given it away.

269
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,660
It's so cute. How could you do that?

270
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:54,460
Right.

271
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,380
You are such

272
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,060
a weirdo.

273
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:58,660
Let's go.

274
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,100
What a weirdo.

275
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,210
If they want to see the cat,

276
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,500
I can do that for them.

277
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:07,900
That way, they will buy the book.

278
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,780
This is a bookstore.

279
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,140
Not a tourist attraction.

280
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,780
If you want to be a famous cat,

281
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,820
there is a cat cafe on the right.

282
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:15,980
I don't.

283
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,660
I really don't.

284
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,900
I just want to make money for you.

285
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,380
Don't look at me like that.

286
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,490
Back at home, I am an aristocrat.

287
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:24,980
I am not just a random white cat.

288
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:25,780
You...

289
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,540
If you have a problem with that,

290
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,650
just tell them that

291
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:30,740
the white cat here

292
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,540
has already gone.

293
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:33,660
You caused the trouble.

294
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,140
You should fix it.

295
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,540
I should fix it.

296
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,870
[The cat has gone back to its home]

297

00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,330
What a waste of time.

299
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:50,700
Let's go.

00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,420
Let's go.

00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:51,980
Go.

How old are you?

00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:06,820
I think that Lin Mo

351
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,180
is more suitable for this job.

352
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,660
As for you,

353
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,020
find another job somewhere else.

354
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,450
Sorry.

355
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,940
I didn't mean to compete with you.

356
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,220
You always depend on your looks.

357
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,540
No big deal.

358
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,220
Well, busted.

359
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,740
You...superficial!

360
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,860
What are you doing?

361
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:34,740
Stay still.

362
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,420
What?

363
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:40,970
It's fine.

364
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:41,970
I can take care of that myself.

365
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,220
I mean it.

366
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,220
I...

367
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,690
No glass pieces.

368
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,690
You should be fine.

369
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,650
Remember to clean your wound when you get home.

370
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,180
All done.

371
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,380
I owe you one.

372
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,900
If you need any help,

373
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,810
just come to me.

374
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,090
Stop faking it.

375
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,850
I won't.

376
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,620
Nice. Good.

377
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,820
Alright. Looking good.

378
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,500
Good. Good.

379
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,300
That's right. Good.

380
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,370
Right. That's right.

381
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,500
Good.

382
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:22,820
Another one.

383
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,100
Alright.

384
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:25,980
Another one.

385
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,580
When will the training begin?

386
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:30,930
Who are you?

387
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,060
I...

388
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,820
You said I could be a model over there 
the other day.

389
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,260
I paid you.

390
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,820
The training fee.

391
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:41,820
Look at her.

392
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,380
Not qualified but eager to be a star.

393
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,100
You are so much better,

394
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,460
so seize your chance.

395
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,420
What are you talking about?

396
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,300
It's just a matter of time.

397
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:50,580
Over there. Yesterday.

398
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,140
You...He...

399
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:52,930
What?

400
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,340
Just take a look at yourself.

401
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,380
I...

402
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:58,660
What should I do?

403
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,330
Just wait till we come to you.

404
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,500
What's wrong with me?

405
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,610
Hey! Come back!

406
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,340
Stop scratching.

407
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,140
We can't afford a new table.

408
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:20,660
I don't feel well?

409
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,060
What's wrong?

410
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,940
I was deceived.

411
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,340
I...

412
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,610
A guy said I could be a model.

413
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,420
He said I could make a lot of money.

414
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,180
Do you know catwalk?

415
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,700
I am great at catwalk.

416
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:32,580
Then,

417
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,740
he saw me today.

418
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,180
He pretended he didn't know me.

419
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,380
I even paid him.

420
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,140
If I ever see him again,

421
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:38,580
Chi Yan,

422
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,740
I will scratch his face.

423
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,740
Are you secretly looking for jobs?

424
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,090
I thought I could make some money.

425
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,610
You don't have an ID or a degree certificate.

426
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,930
How can you make money?

427
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,250
Those on the street

428
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,260
who tell you you can make money

429
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,500
are all liars.

430
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,940
How would I know

431
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,340
there are so many liars among you?

432
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,220
You human beings...

433
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:02,540
I gave him

434
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,220
all the money I earned these days.

435
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,700
Now I've only got coins.

436
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,540
Coins...

437
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:10,020
Now the coins are also gone.

438
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,300
I lost them.

439
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,220
A full moon.

440
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,740
I have never seen a full moon
on our planet.

441
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,620
We can only see it in the crescent shape.

442
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,700
Here on Earth,

443
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,610
we get to see a full moon every month.

444
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,340
Every year, there is a day

445
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,250
when the moon is the brightest and fullest.

446
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,700
People gather together with their family

447
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,060
and those they care the most about on that day.

448
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,460
With their family.

449
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,860
I miss my mom and dad.

450
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:55,340
I don't know if they are doing well on our planet.

451
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,170
I can't go back.

452
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,380
What about you?

453
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,780
Will you get together

454
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,940
with your family on that day?

455
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,020
I don't have a family.

456
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,060
I can't go back now.

457
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,700
I don't have my family with me, either.

458
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,620
The moon is full today.

459
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,500
And we are here.

460
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,370
Let's celebrate.

461
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,580
Let me teach you something new.

462
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,020
Do you want to learn

463
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,220
different ways of celebration here?

464

you can't even make a step forward.

00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:00,410
♫ You will hear the echo♫

522
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:04,100
♫ Run towards the beach♫

523
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,690
Here. Here.

524
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:04,010
Pass it to me.

525
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:04,980
Catch it if you can.

526
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,550
♫ Look at the blue sky♫

527
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:12,490
Sis,

528
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:13,340
come join us.

529
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,620
I have to find a job later.

530
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,860
Just a while. Come.

531
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,260
Five minutes.

532
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,170
Alright. Come.

533
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,580
Give her.

534
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,420
Goal!

535
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:48,940
Come here.

536
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,340
High five.

537
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:50,980
Quick.

538
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:52,210
Another one.

539
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:52,330
Another one.

540
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,140
Here. Another one.

541
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:53,820
Another one.

542
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,220
We won't let you.

543
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,460
No. No.

544
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:57,700
No. No.

545
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:58,860
The ball. The ball.

546
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,140
Here. Here.

547
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,260
Hey, time's up.

548
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,420
Go. Let's go.

549
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,420
Come back.

550
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:13,260
Come back.

551
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,300
Go.

552
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,340
The kids came here first.

553
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,730
Why should they go?

554
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:32,180
Are you looking for trouble?

555
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:32,740
Run.

556
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:35,420
You...

557
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,700
Are you looking for trouble?

558
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:43,900
Get her.

559
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,810
Quick, stop her.

560
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,300
Stop her.

561
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,540
You can't escape.

562
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,140
Stop.

563
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,020
Go.

564
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:55,300
You can't escape.

565
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:57,860
Stop.

566
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,780
You were pretty fierce.

567
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,780
Run.

568
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,060
Let go.

569
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,540
Let go.

570
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,020
What are you staring at?

571
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:40,930
Get him.

572
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,060
Quick, let's go.

573
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,100
Bunch of cowards.

574
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,170
Careful when making friends.

575
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:51,380
Bro. Bro.

576
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:52,490
I am really sorry.

577
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,060
I am truly really sorry.

578
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,620
Why are you here?

579
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,780
Looking for a job?

580
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,130
Looking for a job here?

581
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,700
Do you know it's really dangerous here?

582
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,580
Now I do.

583
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,810
Go home. Take care.

584
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,650
Thank you.

585
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,130
Thank you.

586
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:41,820
There you are.

587
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,500
Sorry.

588
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,500
Sorry about that.

589
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,420
I am really sorry.

590
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,540
Here we go again.

591
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:10,940
Hello.

592
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,300
Take your time.

593
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,130
Don't bump into others again.

594
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,020
We visit our clients regularly.

595
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,420
It's one of our special services.

596
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,980
My pet is fine.

597
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,060
Save that for yourself.

598
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,300
Are you following me?

599
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:43,220
Following you?

600
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,490
I am just heading this direction.

601
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:46,740
I was wondering

602
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,180
why you've been walking ahead of me.

603
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:48,980
Pervert.

604
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,450
I'm telling you. Stop following me.

605
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:52,090
Otherwise, you will be in big trouble.

606
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:53,300
Pervert.

607
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,220
Why am I a per...

608
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:18,940
Taking pictures?

609
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,420
Do another one showing my face.

610
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,540
I am telling you.

611
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,820
I've already sent it to my friend.

612
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,940
In case anything happens.

613
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,060
Mind your behaviors.

614
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:28,900
What did you say

615
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,420
about me to your friend?

616
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,540
You can add the picture

617
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,220
to my contact information.

618
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,450
I...

619
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,650
I don't have your number.

620
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,220
Stop following me.

621
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,220
I am not.

622
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:44,620
Fine.

623
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,010
You go first.

624
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,900
Now you are following me.

625
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,710
[Chi's Bookstore]

626
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:14,940
Are you going to the bookstore?

627
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,930
Why are you here?

628
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,780
Why can't I be here?

629
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,100
What are you here for?

630
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:22,900
I am looking for someone.

631
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:24,850
What a coincidence.

632
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:26,850
What are you doing here?

633
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:28,460
Xiao Xiu.

634
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,100
Miss Qin.

635
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,860
Wait. Why would you...

636
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,220
Why are you still here?

637
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,090
What do you mean by that?

638
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:37,380
I am here because I can.

639
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,220
I am surprised that

640
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,220
he would let you stay here

641
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,340
for such a long time.

642
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,420
You are wearing his clothes.

643
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:44,620
I borrowed it from him.

644
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,860
When I have money, I can buy some myself.

645
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:49,540
Are you here

646
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,540
together?

647
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,540
No.

648
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,130
Do you two know each other?

649
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,460
What? You got a problem?

650
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:57,980
Right.

651
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:02,660
We don't.

652
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,140
We do.

653
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:03,900
We don't.

654
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:04,580
We do.

655
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,020
We don't.

656
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:05,860
So you do know each other.

657
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,260
Look who's here.

658
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,139
Do you know each other?

659
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:19,139
-We do.
-We don't.

660
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,900
When did you know each other?

661
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:25,139
We went to the same high school.

662
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:27,250
Chi.

663
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,500
Why didn't you

664
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,620
tell me about that?

665
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:31,650
I am telling you.

666
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,850
She's the one who left me in the tunnel.

667
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,020
I remember that.

668
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,659
You are the one to talk.

669
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,380
You asked me to send you to a hospital.

670
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,540
I fixed your foot.

671
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,340
What a coincidence.

672
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,500
Yes. Yes. Yes.

673
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:46,900
It's the 14th time.

674
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,300
Don't you think

675
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,250
that it's all

676
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,900
meant to be?

677
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,330
I can't imagine this.

678
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,900
I haven't met Chi Yan since we graduated.

679
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,780
And we happened to come across the other day.

680
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:58,340
We are best buddies.

681
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,610
You two are alumni.

682
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:00,810
That makes us friends.

683
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,940
How about this?

684
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,020
Let's forget what happened the other day.

685
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,420
This is to you.

686
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,660
No problem.

687
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,500
It means that this is all meant to be.

688
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,610
If it didn't happen that night,

689
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,250
we wouldn't be sitting together now.

690
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,420
This is yours.

691
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,100
Thank you.

692
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,060
This one is alcohol-free.

693
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,060
You can't tell.

694
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,380
Your nose is not as good as cats'.

695
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:56,490
I am going to take this.

696
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:57,370
Don't mind me.

697
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,580
I will be out for a sec.

698
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:26,780
What's wrong?

699
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,180
It's pretty stuffy here.

700
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,580
It's not a big problem.

701
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:37,970
Just take it to the hospital tomorrow.

702
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,100
Xiao Xiu.

703
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:40,380
The restroom is here.

704
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:44,300
Do you remember that?

705
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,060
When we were in high school,

706
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,900
you were always studying on your own.

707
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,700
Once I asked

708
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,970
if I could join you.

709
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:54,140
You took your bag and left.

710
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,540
Sorry about that.

711
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:00,260
Wait. No.

712
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,580
I didn't ask for an apology.

713
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,500
I also remember something else.

714
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,770
And I should be apologizing for that.

715
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:13,020
There were a bunch of

716
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,220
naughty kids in our class.

717
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,420
They found an

718
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,580
anonymous love letter in your bag.

719
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:18,740
They said

720
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:21,180
you wrote it for some girl.

721
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,860
Actually,

722
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,540
it was...

723
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,180
I am terribly sorry.

724
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,420
I gave you the wrong drink.

725
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,180
This one is alcohol-free.

726
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,340
Sorry. One moment.

727
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,580
Alright. Bye.

728
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,020
Where is Xiao Xiu?

729
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:39,810
Have you seen her?

730
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,100
She went there.

731
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:44,060
Why are you all in such a hurry?

732
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:40,700
She's not feeling well.

733
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,620
I have to take her back.

734
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,940
Say sorry to Mingming for me.

735
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:45,900
She left

736
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:46,940
after you left.

737
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,810
And she didn't want me to send her home.

738
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:49,980
This is not right. Chi.

739
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,010
I have to tell you this.

740
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,300
Another time. Bye.

741
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,460
Hello.

742
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:57,980
Any you got any sober-up tea?

743
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:00,370
Everything we have is on the shelf.

744
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,420
I am Xiao Xiu!

745
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:41,460
Let's go.

746
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:57,300
It's already 2020.

747
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,340
Why does arranged marriage still exist?

748
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:00,380
Uncle.

749
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:02,460
I really don't want to go on a blind date.

750
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,780
Blind dates are for my own good?

751
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,300
Sis,

752
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:07,010
stop that nonsense.

753
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:09,500
It's not about whether he's good enough or not.

754
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,060
It has nothing to do with his job.

755
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,500
I know what you are thinking.

756
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:14,540
If I don't go,

757
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,860
mom would force you to go.

758
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,340
It doesn't matter how kind he is.

759
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,700
What age are we in?

760
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,380
Take a rose as our sign?

761
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,140
How tacky.

762
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,140
Miss.

763
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:00,100
You are early.

764
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,820
-It's you.
 -It's you.

765
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:15,540
Sorry.

766
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:21,730
You...

767
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,260
Let's order some drinks.

768
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:28,890
I'm glad that it's you.

769
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:30,580
That way,

770
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,380
we can tell our family that

771
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:35,380
we don't like each other.

772
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,220
I...I...

773
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:37,900
Would you

774
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,260
like to drink anything? My treat.

775
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,330
I am just gonna...

776
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:41,860
Wait. Hold on a sec.

777
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:42,860
I think we can make a great match.

778
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,290
We are sitting here, no arguing,

779
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:44,730
no fighting.

780
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:45,730
How nice is this?

781
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,930
The police can be nice 
when they interrogate criminals.

782
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:50,380
Role-play.

783
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,500
Fine. I can do that.

784
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,580
Say, I am the criminal. Interrogate me.

785
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:59,180
Fine.

786
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:00,620
Well,

787
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:05,500
first question.

788
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:08,260
When will you realize

789
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:12,250
I am not interested in you?

790
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:16,700
Okay?

791
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:22,220
Bye.

792
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:29,060
Wait. Wait.

793
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:30,060
Just wait a second.

794
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:38,500
Get in the car.

795
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:40,740
Nope.

796
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,860
You can't just walk home.

797
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:44,100
The blind date failed.

798
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,130
But we can still be friends.

799
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,300
Just go.

800
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,500
You are making the traffic worse.

801
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:49,980
Rest assured.

802
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:52,180
I won't drop you off

803
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,460
at those isolated places.

804
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:54,340
Just get in.

805
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:09,020
You need to walk forever to get home.

806
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,020
Give me that.

807
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:17,980
I am not taking away your purse.

808
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,100
-Let go.
 -I just want to send you home.

809
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:19,620
I am so gonna hit you.

810
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:20,740
-I just want to send you home.
-Let go.

811
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:24,340
Sorry. Sorry about that.

812
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:25,740
Sorry.

813
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:26,940
It's okay.

814
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:34,860
Quick. Let's go.

815
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:36,500
It's so windy.

816
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:37,700
Let me send you home.

817
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:41,180
You will get cold.

818
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:53,500
Take care.

819
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,180
Don't mind him. Just go.

820
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,300
Anywhere.
