4
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,940
Once upon a time,

5
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:46,890
a girl from the Meow Planet

6
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,650
was born to be the future ruler.

7
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,970
But something happened 
during her transition on Earth.

8
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,940
She was saved by a young man.

9
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,420
She had to repay his kindness

10
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,780
before she could go back to her planet.

11
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,060
As she tried to repay her debt of gratitude,

12
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,530
she and the young man fell in love.

13
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,460
In order to stay together,

14
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,660
none of them would mention the wish.

15
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,220
Then, the Elderly went to Earth to see them.

16
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,500
He threatened the young man to make a wish.

17
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,890
A friend of the young man knew about this.

18
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,210
He went to the Elderly in secret

19
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,060
and told him what the young man wished for,

20
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,540
which was for the village to prosper

21
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,370
and for the people to have a better life.

22
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,860
His wish came true.

23
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,890
The girl was brought back to the Meow Planet.

24
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,740
Then, she refused

25
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,090
to take the reigns of her planet.

26
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,260
So, she was grounded.

27
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,100
She couldn't forget the love of her life.

28
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,180
She was so depressed that she fell ill.

29
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,820
In the end, knowing that her days were numbered,

30
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,140
she turned into her human form secretly

31
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,140
to give the young man a token of her love

32
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,540
and to see him one last time.

33
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,780
After that, she went back to the Meow Planet

34
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,300
and passed away in sorrow.

35
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:50,100
You were seriously hurt.

36
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,420
To save you,

37
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,770
Chi Yan made a wish
 and cleared your debt of gratitude

38
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,460
at the cost

39
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,020
of losing all the memories about you.

40
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,020
As for others,

41
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,020
they were connected

42
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,540
because of you.

43
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,130
Now that you're gone,

44
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,660
their lives have changed accordingly.

45
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:44,780
So,

46
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,540
Chi Yan made a wish

47
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,420
after I got attacked.

48
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,850
No wonder.

49
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,700
No wonder I woke up on the grass.

50
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,940
Your life was hanging by a thread.

51
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,620
Chi Yan said that he could give up everything

52
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,500
as long as you come back to life.

53
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,290
The silver lining is that

54
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,740
everyone's safe and sound now.

55
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,570
You've now repaid his kindness,

56
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,260
which means you've completed the transition.

57
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,140
You can finally go back home!

58
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,180
I understand all that.

59
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,620
But how could he

60
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,620
just forget everything about me?

61
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:29,860
This is

62
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,100
the rule of Earth

63
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,500
and the Meow Planet.

64
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,570
The almighty rule

65
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,180
will not change,

66
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,180
no matter what happens.

67
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,340
Otherwise, the two worlds will be in chaos.

68
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,820
He may have forgotten you,

69
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,740
but you still remember him.

70
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,700
I believe this memory

71
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,340
will become the most precious thing

72
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,940
in your life after the transition.

73
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,659
That only makes me more upset.

74
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,900
Chi Yan and I are different.

75
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,970
He can't just forget me like that.

76
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:07,660
Uncle Fu!

77
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,900
There must be something you can do.

78
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,060
You've been here for so long.

79
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,060
You know everything.

80
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:11,820
Tell me.

81
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,900
I'm willing to try anything.

82
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:17,900
Xiao Xiu.

83
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,540
I know how you feel.

84
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,260
But their memories about you

85
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,180
are gone.

86
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,140
I don't think they can be restored.

87
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,700
I've never heard of

88
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,980
anyone who can do this.

89
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,860
You haven't heard of it

90
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,060
because no cats have ever done it, right?

91
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:33,980
I'll be the first one to do it.

92
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,770
Just tell me what I can do

93
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,620
and I will do it.

94
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,580
I'll try anything.

95
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,100
Just tell me.

96
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,380
I will do it.

97
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,930
Rules are rules.

98
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:45,420
Since you've repaid your debt of gratitude,

99
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,740
you must go back.

100
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,140
Think of your parents.

101
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,460
Don't keep them worried.

102
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,540
Besides, the pact cannot be broken.

103
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,180
It is my job

104
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,180
to make sure the rules are followed.

105
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,490
Chi Yan?

106
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,140
It's really you!

107
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,310
Qin Mingming.

108
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,260
Qin Mingming.

109
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:21,460
What are the odds!

110
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:21,770
Tell you what.

111
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,500
I met a guy when I was catching a thief

112
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,380
the other day.

113
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,500
He said he's your friend

114
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,260
and told me you are here.

115
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,020
Who'd have thought?

116
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,020
Xu Zihao?

117
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:30,900
Yeah.

118
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,820
What a small world!

119
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,650
We've...

120
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,580
It's been ten years

121
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,500
since we last met.

122
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:38,700
Wow.

123
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,580
Catching a thief?

124
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,810
Are you a police officer?

125
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,250
No.

126
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:41,940
A journalist.

127
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:42,780
A journalist?

128
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,220
Yeah.

129
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,820
You own this bookstore?

130
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:45,500
Yes.

131
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,020
My grandpa left it

132
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:47,700
to me.

133
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,340
Suits you well.

134
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,250
Let me add you on WeChat.

135
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:53,380
Okay.

136
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,220
Bring your friend and let's have dinner someday.

137
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,490
Let's go.

138
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:06,820
Hello.

139
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,300
May I ask

140
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,100
if you're still hiring?

141
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:13,820
No.

142
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,620
I just want to help.

143
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,020
I won't cause any trouble.

144
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,260
We're not hiring.

145
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,820
I won't cause any trouble. I promise.

146
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,660
Tell me what you want.

147
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,330
Yesterday, you lied and said

148
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,820
you are my girlfriend.

149
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,540
And now, you're asking me for a job.

150
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:42,980
I...

151
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,490
I wasn't lying.

152
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,250
It's just that something happened

153
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,220
and made you forget me.

154
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,770
I can prove it to you.

155
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,620
I know this bell.

156
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:53,660
Don't.

157
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,540
You don't like to

158
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,220
engage with the customers,

159
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,860
so you got this bell.

160
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,220
You only show up

161
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,060
when you're needed.

162
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,180
The books on the top shelf

163
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,460
are your favorite.

164
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:06,740
If customers

165
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,930
disrespect those books,

166
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,340
you won't sell them.

167
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,620
I also know that

168
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,330
you don't like to follow the trend

169
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,620
and focus only on marketing.

170
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,700
You just want good books to be bought by worthy people.

171
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,620
So, I am not lying.

172
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,500
Just let me work for you

173
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:23,580
for a day.

174
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,410
Half a day?

175
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,300
An hour?

176
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:33,380
Hello.

177
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,260
Do you have Look Homeward, Angel

178
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,420
by Thomas Wolfe?

179
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,220
Yes.

180
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,260
I'll get it for you.

181
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:39,980
One moment, please.

182
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:41,660
Don't...

183
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:48,620
Here.

184
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:49,660
That's it.

185
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,340
35 yuan.

186
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,900
Can you pay in cash?

187
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,340
Okay.

188
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,140
35, right?

189
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,100
Thanks.

190
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,140
See? I know everything about the store.

191
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,740
So you...

192
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,620
I don't care how you knew all that.

193
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,180
You're scaring me.

194
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,730
Leave, or I'll call the police.

195
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,340
Can you tell me

196
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,980
if the cat smugglers have been arrested?

197
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,180
Yeah, we got them all.

198
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,220
Then, I will

199
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,210
leave you to it.

200
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,540
I'm sorry

201
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,500
for scaring you.

202
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,250
♫I like to talk♫

203
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:34,560
♫But I feel lonely all day♫

204
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,550
♫Until you show up♫

205
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,540
Alright.

206
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,020
I want to write a love story

207
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,770
♫Our story began a long time ago♫

208
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,980
based on you.

209
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,140
That'll make me the heroine.

210
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:45,380
♫When you were occasionally nice to me♫

211
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:50,270
♫Sometimes it is exciting, sometimes not so much♫

212
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,780
For your wound.

213
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,470
♫All my memories♫

214
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:56,690
♫Are about you♫

215
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,990
♫Then I finally realize♫

216
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,220
This is a pinkie swear.

217
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,420
A pinkie swear?

218
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:03,860
♫If you're not by my side♫

219
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,450
We'll be friends after this.

220
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:09,670
♫The whole world means nothing to me♫

221
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:10,780
Let's sleep.

222
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,160
♫I've never been to that place♫

223
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,600
♫Where you said the stars fall♫

224
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,540
♫But I've fallen into♫

225
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,000
♫The splashes of blue of the melting glacier♫

226
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:26,430
♫The coastline disappears before my eyes♫

227
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,770
♫In this hustle-bustle world♫

228
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,830
♫You are not with me♫

229
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,420
You must go back.

230
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:34,000
♫I miss you♫

231
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,050
Otherwise, your life will be in danger.

232
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,260
♫I told you I miss you♫

233
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,180
But... Chi Yan...

234
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,420
I can't bear the idea of leaving you.

235
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:43,370
♫Will you show up♫

236
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,300
It's a new day!

237
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,340
Do you remember me?

238
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,250
No.

239
00:13:58,570 --> 00:13:59,260
No?

240
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,300
It's alright. We've got time.

241
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,500
Get out.

242
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,500
Or, I'll call the police.

243
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,020
I am a customer.

244
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,620
I'm here to read. You can't throw me out.

245
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,770
[Closed]

246
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:19,660
What...

247
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:20,660
I did it.

248
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:21,620
I know that

249
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,020
you read this one first every day,

250
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,900
then this one.

251
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,300
What are you doing?

252
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:26,980
Take it.

253
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:27,540
No.

254
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,100
Take it.

255
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:28,980
No.

256
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,980
I can recommend you three books.

257
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:51,800
The Catcher in the Rye,

258
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,450
Home Letters by Fulei,

259
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,780
and The Alchemist.

260
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:58,780
I'll go get them.

261
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,089
It'd be...

262
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,460
100...

263
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:20,540
It'd be...

264
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,140
105 yuan.

265
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:28,780
Thanks.

266
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,300
Stop!

267
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,060
Sir.

268
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,530
Stop!

269
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,580
Stop running.

270
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,060
Hold on.

271
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:07,980
Your wallet.

272
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:09,660
Take your wallet.

273
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,970
[Thank you. Let me treat you to lunch.]

274
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,810
It's alright, sir.

275
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:31,250
It's fine.

276
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,340
It's alright.

277
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:32,860
It's...

278
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:35,500
Let's go.

279
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,060
Lunch together.

280
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:37,500
I...

281
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,940
Chi Yan, let's have lunch together.

282
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:39,980
Lunch together.

283
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:40,740
Thank you, sir.

284
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,410
Delicious.

285
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:49,730
Thank you.

286
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,380
Hold on.

287
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,220
Wait a sec.

288
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,660
How do you know...

289
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,940
I know you're allergic to peanuts.

290
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,300
Listen.

291
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,100
I don't care if you knew me

292
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,860
or just want something from me.

293
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,500
Or maybe you were asked to investigate me.

294
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,500
I don't think you're a bad person.

295
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,820
So, just tell me

296
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,660
what you need.

297
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,570
Okay?

298
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,740
I am busy at the bookstore.

299
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,900
I don't have time for this nonsense.

300
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,900
I've told you many times.

301
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,610
I was your girlfriend.

302
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:36,540
You just forgot about it.

303
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,690
But I remember everything about you.

304
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,010
For now, I can't

305
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,980
believe anything you've said.

306
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,940
No one will.

307
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,580
Right?

308
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:47,940
It's alright.

309
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,540
However, you did great today.

310
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:52,020
I want to thank you on behalf of the customer.

311
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,090
You're still the same. A good judge of character.

312
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:03,980
Thank you.

313
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,620
You remembered something, right?

314
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,100
No, I didn't.

315
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,090
You did, didn't you?

316
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,580
I was... We...

317
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,100
We just met.

318
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,740
I don't know if you...

319
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,100
I don't know if you drink beer.

320
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,300
Do you?

321
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:43,820
No.

322
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,540
I'm as allergic to alcohol

323
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,100
as you are to peanuts.

324
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:49,980
So, no beer for you.

325
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,090
It's alright.

326
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,580
It's fine. One step at a time.

327
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,340
Nothing. Dig in.

328
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:00,540
Okay.

329
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:22,820
Wait a sec.

330
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,330
Come on.

331
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:24,980
Hold on.

332
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:29,580
How do you know this place?

333
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,340
You brought me here.

334
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,100
Here we go again.

335
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,060
I've never brought you here.

336
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:33,940
You have.

337
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:36,260
I've never told anyone about this place.

338
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,060
Were you stalking me?

339
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,580
Investigating me?

340
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,220
I didn't stalk you.

341
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,260
Nor did I investigate you.

342
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,810
You did bring me here.

343
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,100
The blue ocean.

344
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,170
I've never written about it in my books.

345
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,220
Wait!

346
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,570
Let me tell you a story.

347
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,780
I live far away from here.

348
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:23,610

520
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:20,380
How did you meet?

521
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,700
I don't know her!

522
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,250
Come on.

523
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,100
Are you done?

524
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,010
Let's call it a day.

525
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,770
You're paying for lunch.

526
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,340
You asked me to jog with you

527
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,730
and I need to buy you lunch?

528
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:57,980
He Meng.

529
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:01,060
Lilies! They just arrived.

530
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:03,450
It's...

531
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,660
Are you available tomorrow afternoon?

532
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:08,860
Why?

533
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,010
The community is organizing a flea market.

534
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,540
Would you like to join me in it?

535
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,340
I'll pass. There will be too many people.

536
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,300
But every store in the community

537
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,780
is participating.

538
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,620
You do want your books

539
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,260
to be noticed by more people, right?

540
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,100
Chi Yan! He Meng!

541
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,620
Xiao Xiu?

542
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,090
Chi Yan.

543
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,380
Do you know her well?

544
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,050
I don't know her at all.

545
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,250
She came to me the other day

546
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:10,700
and said the weirdest stuff.

547
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,820
She said she had known me earlier.

548
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:15,220
But I think I've never met her before.

549
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,420
Are you sure you don't know her?

550
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:18,900
Yes, I'm sure.

551
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,740
Just ignore her.

552
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,450
She might be...

553
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,810
It's alright.

554
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:31,810
-I'm fine.
-Here.

555
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:32,460
I'll wipe this off.

556
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:32,940
Here.

557
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:33,700
Thank you.

558
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,100
I...

559
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:34,940
I...

560
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:35,900
I'll leave it here.

561
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:37,020
Thank you.

562
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:37,780
Thank you so much.

563
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,500
How much is it?

564
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:41,980
Anything from the PEP?

565
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:42,860
Yes.

566
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,340
I'll go over there.

567
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:44,740
Okay.

568
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:45,860
Thank you.

569
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,650
Thank you.

570
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,330
Here.

571
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,580
I want to buy a book.

572
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:28,179
What book?

573
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,460
A romantic novel.

574
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,300
What's it about?

575
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:35,730
It's about

576
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:39,300
a woman who loves a man her whole life

577
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,130
but he doesn't love her back.

578
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,020
I don't want this one.

579
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:44,420
I want something

580
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,030
about a girl who seeks revenge

581
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,040
after she was dumped by the guy.

582
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:48,900
Or something about

583
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,420
a man who didn't value his girlfriend,

584
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,340
found a new lover,

585
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,820
and started to regret it.

586
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:53,820
Or maybe

587
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:54,940
his girlfriend lost her memory

588
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,020
and became super successful

589
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:56,820
in life.

590
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,410
Do you have anything like that?

591
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,140
Let me check.

592
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,250
No need.

593
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,940
I'll write one if you don't have it.

594
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,060
You run such a big bookstore

595
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,460
and yet you can't find a book like this.

596
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,380
-Xiao Xiu!
-This book...

597
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,540
-Let's go.
-What the hell is it about?

598
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,820
There are a lot of people over there.

599
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:11,980
What if the manager comes?

600
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:12,930
You'll lose your job.

601
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,220
Let's go.

602
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,060
Liangliang.

603
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,020
Hello, sis.

604
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:18,980
Where are you?

605
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,170
Bulb was bitten.

606
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:21,980
What happened?

607
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,900
I was walking Bulb on the street

608
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,300
and the chihuahua in the neighborhood

609
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,980
started to fight with it for the swing.

610
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,660
Bulb was bitten by it.

611
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,020
Bulb is a big dog.

612
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,780
How come it was bitten by a chihuahua?

613
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,420
That...

614
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,740
Is the chihuahua alright?

615
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,660
Did Bulb bite it back?

616
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,770
The chihuahua is small

617
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,530
but fierce.

618
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,820
It got furious because Bulb took the swing.

619
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,340
The chihuahua is fine.

620
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,460
But Bulb's leg is bleeding.

621
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,570
Don't worry.

622
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:49,260
Go to Hong Qi Rd.

623
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,500
There's a pet hospital there.

624
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:50,970
You go ahead

625
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:51,900
and I'll find you later.

626
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:52,460
Remember.

627
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:52,820
Hello.

628
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,940
My dog was bitten.

629
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:54,660
Can you examine it?

630
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,780
It's bleeding.

631
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:57,460
I'll handle this.

632
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,180
Let's go.

633
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,180
Let's go inside.

634
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:07,580
Sorry.

635
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:10,660
My dog is not used to male vets.

636
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:12,580
I'm sorry.

637
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,580
Bulb had some bad experiences with male vets.

638
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,660
So we always ask female vets to treat it.

639
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:19,660
But we don't have any female vets here today.

640
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,140
How about this?

641
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:23,180
Hold the leash.

642
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:24,260
Wait for me.

643
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,180
Be right back.

644
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,580
Bulb.

645
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,420
Nice to meet you.

646
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,300
How did our precious Bulb

647
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,340
hurt itself so badly?

648
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,180
Good boy.

649
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,420
I'll just shave a little bit of your hair very gently.

650
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:59,970
Good boy.

651
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,170
Don't be scared.

652
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:04,020
Such an open wound.

653
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:05,540
Bulb.

654
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,770
Why were you so careless?

655
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:11,580
I'll just rinse your wound for you.

656
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,140
Be a good boy.

657
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,570
It's easy and fun.

658
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,420
See?

659
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:23,940
Bulb.

660
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,020
How come you're bleeding?

661
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,860
Naughty boy.

662
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:30,770
However,

663
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:32,090
you're being so good now.

664
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,100
So behaving.

665
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,180
I'll apply some medicine first

666
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,660
and then bandage the wound. That's it!

667
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,620
Bulb, you're so brave.

668
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,180
You're so behaving.

669
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,060
Good for you, Bulb!

670
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,620
We did it!

671
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,420
I've applied medicine.

672
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,860
Your wound will heal soon.

673
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,860
Don't be so naughty next time.

674
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:03,660
Thank you, Doc.

675
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:06,940
You're welcome.

676
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,380
What is this?

677
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,180
How come it's still wet?

678
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,180
I can't!

679
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,500
Wait for me.

680
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:32,380
Welcome.

681
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:48,620
Don't sit there.

682
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:49,780
Wet paint.

683
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:50,450
Thanks.

684
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,060
Wet paint.

685
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:53,940
Thanks.

686
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:58,660
Wet paint.

687
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,460
Thanks.

688
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:11,500
Ma'am.

689
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:12,660
Ma'am!

690
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,650
The paint is wet.

691
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:16,180
Don't sit here.

692
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:16,940
What?

693
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,300
Wet paint! Don't sit here!

694
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:20,370
What?

695
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,980
Wet paint! Don't sit here!

696
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:26,500
Ma'am!

697
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:27,500
Don't sit here, ma'am!

698
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,460
You can't sit here.

699
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,380
What?

700
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,420
Don't sit here.

701
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:31,460
Don't...

702
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,580
Ma'am, look!

703
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,420
Wet paint.

704
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,220
[DO NOT TOUCH
 WET PAINT]

705
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,130
Why didn't you say so?

706
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,780
Why didn't you bring out the sign sooner?

707
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:03,540
Chi Yan!

708
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,420
Chi Yan!

709
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,060
I've got something for you.

710
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:13,380
A bookmark.

711
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,900
I know you love reading,

712
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,460
so I picked this bookmark for you.

713
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:17,790
Don't take it the wrong way.

714
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:18,780
I've got no ulterior motive.

715
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,660
I just think I was too rude in the past few days.

716
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:22,980
So...

717
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:26,410
I don't use bookmarks.

718
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,580
I just dog-ear the page instead.

719
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,660
Dog-ear?

720
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:35,900
You can't do it.

721
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,540
It'll damage the book.

722
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,340
See?

723
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:39,780
A bookmark is better.

724
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:40,860
It won't damage the book at all.

725
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:41,580
Start to use bookmarks.

726
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,420
I'll buy you more.

727
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,180
A lot of book lovers

728
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:45,770
dog-ear their books.

729
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:46,820
How is it damaging books?

730
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,660
Of course, it is.

731
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,100
You...

732
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,860
You sell second-hand books, right?

733
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,060
All customers want their books to be clean

734
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,100
and neat.

735
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,650
So, a bookmark is your best choice.

736
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,660
Creases are normal for used books.

737
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,290
Many customers of my bookstore

738
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:02,780
don't really care about the notes

739
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:03,220
and stuff

740
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:03,810
on the books.

741
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:04,420
But I...

742
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,180
Why am I arguing with you about dog-ears?

743
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:11,410
This is me being nice to you.

744
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:12,900
It's just a bookmark.

745
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,660
Just take it.

746
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:14,660
I...

747
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:15,860
Take it.

748
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,090
Thank you for giving me this.

749
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,500
But I can't take it.

750
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,540
You should give it to those who need it.

751
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,490
I accept

752
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:28,180
your apology.

753
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:30,330
Go wash your pants.

754
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:35,500
But you're the one who needs it the most.

755
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:41,450
After you go home,

756
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:42,650
check if Bulb's leg

757
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:44,970
begins to spasm or cramp.

758
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:47,220
It needs to take medicine after surgery.

759
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,810
I've entered the info into the PC on the front desk.

760
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,620
Type its name and you'll see.

761
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,100
Thank you.

762
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,180
No problem.

763
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:54,580
Thank you, Ms. Zihao.

764
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,620
Go get the medicine.

765
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:00,420
Bye, Ms. Zihao.

766
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:10,140
Well.

767
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,940
How come you have all this in your office?

768
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,440
I've seen similar cases

769
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,620
online.

770
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,020
My colleagues have also mentioned that

771
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:18,940
some dogs

772
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,660
only allow female vets to give shots.

773
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:21,660
Male vets can't do it.

774
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:22,860
So, I bought this stuff.

775
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,820
Do I look

776
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,860
funny?

777
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:28,980
No.

778
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:30,660
I think

779
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:32,500
you look professional.

780
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:34,490
Very manly.

781
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:37,540
Say,

782
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:40,180
we've run into each other twice already.

783
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:41,660
How about

784
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,860
we have dinner together tonight?

785
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:44,900
Chi Yan can come, too.

786
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:45,620
Great.

787
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:46,140
Great.

788
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:47,660
How about this?

789
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,660
I'll add you on WeChat,

790
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,090
so that we can get in touch

791
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:53,180
more easily.

792
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:57,660
Okay.

793
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:05,780
I'll leave now.

794
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:06,660
Okay.

795
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:07,300
See you tonight.

796
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:09,180
See you.
