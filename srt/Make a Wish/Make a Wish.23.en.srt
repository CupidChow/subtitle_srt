4
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,460
Let's start packing.

5
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,940
You've got so many things here.

6
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,860
Why didn't you ask me for help?

7
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,810
How long did you plan to spend on this?

8
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:57,890
I thought

9
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,820
you were preparing for Lulu's birthday surprise.

10
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,140
You wouldn't have time for us.

11
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,860
We are meant to meet someone

12
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,140
and lose someone.

13
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,500
It's all meant to be.

14
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,100
Not necessarily.

15
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,090
Sometimes people try too hard.

16
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,220
Xu Zihao, I...

17
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:15,730
Just be quick.

18
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,660
Tell us.

19
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,579
How did the birthday go?

20
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,140
Nothing happened.

21
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,660
Nothing happened?

22
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:21,940
What did you do then?

23
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:22,650
I broke up with her.

24
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,140
This time, for real.

25
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:28,740
I was such a coward.

26
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,460
I shouldn't have ended it.

27
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,890
Did Mingming say that to you?

28
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,970
Don't look at me like that.

29
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,340
It sounds like something Mingming would say.

30
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,300
You are my friends.

31
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,340
I know you too well.

32
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,300
Moreover,

33
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,690
only Qin Mingming will say those things to you.

34
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:46,460
You've got your own problem,

35
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,820
but what has happened

36
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,100
was not caused by you only.

37
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,460
Don't get too upset.

38
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,660
I think that

39
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,740
Lulu may not be the best for you.

40
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,580
Don't dwell on that.

41
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,780
There is no right or wrong in relationships.

42
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:02,930
You've missed this.

43
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,940
Seize the next one.

44
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,460
Just work hard and get distracted.

45
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,820
You just want me

46
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,100
to help with packing.

47
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,170
Xu Zihao,

48
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,100
sadness can be your power.

49
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,339
I have faith in you.

50
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,060
Work.

51
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,540
Sadness can be your power.

52
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,140
You've changed.

53
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:22,900
What about me?

54
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,340
Has something happened between you two?

55
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,180
You seemed alright two days ago.

56
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:28,860
What?

57
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,820
One day later and you two are together now?

58
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,940
Xiao Xiu and I,

59
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,850
we are dating.

60
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,260
A while ago,

61
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,780
something was wrong with my family.

62
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,570
It's hard to explain.

63
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,700
More importantly,

64
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,540
I can remember everything now.

65
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,340
That's impossible.

66
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,700
We always hang out with each other.

67
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,340
How did you hide that from me?

68
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,180
Chi,

69
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,460
it's okay if it's for your novel.

70
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,220
Don't go too deep into this.

71
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,210
Don't get yourself crazy.

72
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,500
Do you want me to take you to the hospital?

73
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,060
Let me put it this way.

74
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,220
I feel that Xiao Xiu and I

75
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:03,980
have known each other for a really long time.

76
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,420
We know each other very well.

77
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,930
So that's what you mean.

78
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:12,740
I have been having

79
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,380
the same feeling recently.

80
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:18,970
Get back to work.

81
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,860
Chi Yan, Xiao Xiu.

82
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,540
I just got off work.

83
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,180
Is there anything I can help with?

84
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,260
Xu Zihao just left.

85
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,260
Now you are here.

86
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,690
We've almost finished.

87
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,010
We don't have much

88
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,340
left to be done.

89
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,260
We will move out in two days.

90
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,340
And we might need your help then.

91
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,540
Please come and help us

92
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,220
if you are available then.

93
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,340
Xu Zihao would be here too.

94
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,330
Did he say anything to you?

95
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:52,820
No.

96
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,500
Not much.

97
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,220
Absolutely nothing.

98
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:54,820
No.

99
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,170
I mean,

100
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,500
he and I have known each other since we were kids.

101
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,010
I know him very well.

102
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,100
It seems that he's always fooling around.

103
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:03,770
But at the bottom of his heart,

104
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,340
he's a very sincere guy.

105
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,780
We have our obstacles

106
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,900
to overcome.

107
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,820
He has his too.

108
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,820
He definitely said something to you.

109
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:17,460
It's fine.

110
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,700
See you in two days.

111
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,380
I need to get going now. Bye.

112
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,500
Mingming, wait.

113
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:24,740
I want to tell you something.

114
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,500
How was your business trip?

115
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:30,580
Fun?

116
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,340
It was fine.

117
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,300
Why do you look so upset?

118
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,060
Trouble at work?

119
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,420
Not really.

120
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,980
It's Mom.

121
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,100
You've got a girlfriend.

122
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,780
So she's targeting me now.

123
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,220
I just got off the plane.

124
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,740
She's already set up a blind date for me tonight.

125
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,340
She said that if I don't go,

126
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,940
it would break her heart.

127
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,100
This is so hard.

128
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,740
Because you are free now.

129
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,130
Who's the guy?

130
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,620
Have you heard about him?

131
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,740
You know him.

132
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,530
It's the doctor you introduced to Mom.

133
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,220
Doctor Luo.

134
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,930
Now I remember.

135
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,660
No wonder she called me to tell me off the other day.

136
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:11,980
She said that

137
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,530
if I know someone like that,

138
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:14,940
I should have introduced him to you.

139
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,490
It's a pity

140
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,370
that she's not a salesperson.

141
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,820
But Doctor Luo is indeed a decent guy.

142
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,940
He should meet your standards.

143
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,500
Just try and see how things go.

144
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:53,700
Luo.

145
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:54,540
Chi Yan.

146
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,820
What have you been up to these days?

147
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,020
These days?

148
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,260
I mean,

149
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,020
long time no see.

150
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,340
How are you doing?

151
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,980
Quite busy, as a doctor.

152
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,170
Good.

153
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,020
How are you?

154
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:16,980
I run this bookstore.

155
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:19,780
So this is the thing.

156
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,700
My family set up a blind date for me the other day.

157
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:22,820
I went and found that

158
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,170
the girl was Xu Zihao's sister.

159
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:27,620
Xu Ziqi.

160
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,180
Right.

161
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,300
She told me that you run a bookstore here.

162
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,140
We haven't seen each other for a really long time,

163
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:32,860
so I drop by to pay you a visit.

164
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,020
Right,

165
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,740
this place

166
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,220
is not easy to find.

167
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,220
Right.

168
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,299
Seems that you are about to move.

169
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:42,780
They are tearing down this place.

170
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,460
The landlord doesn't want to rent it to us.

171
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,820
Have you settled on a place?

172
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:47,780
Not yet.

173
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,930
We are trying to find one while packing.

174
00:08:59,140 --> 00:08:59,820
You have a cat.

175
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,010

Sorry that I scared you.

318
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,060
I've been

319
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,180
scared of getting married for a while.

320
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,610
My parents divorced when I was a kid.

321
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,100
My mom and my sister love me a lot,

322
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,420
but my dad is a different case.

323
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:16,460
I grew up watching my parents having fights.

324
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,100
After my mom divorced my dad,

325
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,140
she felt nothing but regrets 
every time she talked about him.

326
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,450
That's why I've always felt,

327
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:31,410
well, you know, since I was a kid.

328
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,420
It never left a good impression on me.

329
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,860
Actually,

330
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,740
my parents passed away when Liangliang

331
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,690
was still a kid.

332
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,210
Liangliang and I

333
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,580
grew up with Uncle Gao

334
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,580
and Auntie Lou.

335
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,340
They've been really nice to us,

336
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,620
and I am grateful for that.

337
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,220
But I can

338
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,420
sometimes feel that

339
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,410
something is missing.

340
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,610
I really hope that

341
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,220
one day I could have

342
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,060
a family of my own.

343
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:16,020
And we live happily together.

344
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:22,380
Right.

345
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,140
Who doesn't want that?

346
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,580
I always think that

347
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,780
people should go forward.

those mean nothing.

350
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,060
Even if things are difficult for you,

351
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,930
you shouldn't give up.

352
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,380
Right.

353
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,300
I need to go back to the hospital.

354
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,340
I will leave you to your business.

355
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,050
I haven't unpacked everything.

356
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,180
When we're officially open,

357
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,460
I will invite you here again.

358
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,380
Alright, no problem.

359
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,540
Just call me then.

360
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,180
Alright.

361
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,330
I will get going now.

362
00:20:59,330 --> 00:20:59,770
Alright.

363
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,060
It looks like my sister.

364
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,140
You know what?

365
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,100
The biggest difference between me

366
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,180
and my sister is our eyes.

367
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,820
The color of her pupils is darker.

368
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,300
But if you don't look close enough,

369
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,930
you can't even tell.

370
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,380
You will think

371
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,140
we look identical.

372
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:51,820
Then you can

373
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,540
see it as your sister

374
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,460
and visit it when you miss her.

375
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,490
Mingming.

376
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:15,860
Mingming.

377
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:18,820
I...

378
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,090
I...

379
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:23,220
What?

380
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,340
I...I...

381
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:31,740
Well,

382
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,140
go back and take a rest.

383
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:36,610
Alright,

384
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:38,810
remember to go to the hospital 
and check your foot.

385
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:39,860
In case something went wrong.

386
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:41,890
See you.

387
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,530
Bye. Take care.

388
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,520
Mingming.

389
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,350
Mingming.

390
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,340
Qin Mingming.

391
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,930
Qin Mingming.

392
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,500
Mingming.

393
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,580
Qin Mingming.

394
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,060
Mingming.

395
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:49,740
Mingming.

396
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,820
I can't give you much right now,

397
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,980
but I can tell the world that

398
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,150
I love you.

399
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,740
Stop yelling in the middle of the night.

400
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,140
Don't yell

401
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,420
if you don't plan to marry her.

402
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,410
I like him.

403
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,540
She said she likes me.

404
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:20,740
She likes me.

405
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,520
She likes me.

406
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,470
Mingming, I love you.

407
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,310
Mingming,

408
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,690
I love you.

409
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,310
Yuanzi.

410
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,220
What's wrong?

411
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:56,810
Brother,

412
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,660
have you seen the kitties lately?

413
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,820
Kitties?

414
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:03,740
What's wrong?

415
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,380
I wanted to feed them today,

416
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,860
but I couldn't find them.

417
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:10,420
They are gone.

418
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,140
Maybe they've gone somewhere to play

419
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,180
and haven't come back.

420
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:21,570
They used to eat the cat food I put there.

421
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,940
But they didn't eat the food

422
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,460
I put there a few days ago.

423
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,980
I didn't see them today,

424
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,220
and they didn't eat the food,

425
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,010
so I didn't add any food.

426
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,020
The cat food

427
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,220
has been drugged.

428
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,340
Once the cats eat it,

429
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,780
they will be really quiet and docile.

430
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,580
Yuanzi,

431
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:50,820
listen to me.

432
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,820
It's too late now.

433
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,860
Go home and find your mom.

434
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,890
Xiao Xiu and I will find the kitties.

435
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:57,980
Alright?

436
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,940
Then please take

437
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,100
all of them back.

438
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:03,660
We will.

439
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,700
Just go home.

440
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:05,620
Bye.

441
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,060
Go. Let's see what happened.

442
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:13,980
Five.

443
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:16,490
Bai.

444
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,820
It's not drugged.

445
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:36,140
Why does it smell like Luo Jiaxuan?

446
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:36,730
Who?

447
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,220
Doctor Luo.

448
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,410
Are you sure?

449
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,260
Luo just visited the bookstore.

450
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,580
He ran some errands nearby.

451
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,500
He may have passed here.

452
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,500
It's natural that it smells like him.

453
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,300
Five.

454
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,420
Chi Yan.

455
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,890
I may have neglected something.

456
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,740
I was on the second floor at the hospital.

457
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,530
I saw Doctor Luo and the man in black

458
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:10,580
talking about something.

459
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,180
Doctor Luo gave him an envelope.

460
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,500
If I am not mistaken,

461
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,660
there was money

462
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,780
inside that envelope.

463
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,980
The man in black?

464
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:21,740
Doctor Luo?

465
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,140
Right.

466
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,180
I think you've been mistaken.

467
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:29,700
Really.

468
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,180
He was the only one

469
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:34,340
who offered me help at high school.

470
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,700
I believe him.

471
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,420
He couldn't have done it.

472
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,180
Can you tell me

473
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:43,500
why he came here?

474
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:44,740
Xiao Xiu,

475
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,500
I know you are pretty anxious.

476
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,540
You worry about the cats.

477
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,740
Believe me. I feel the same.

478
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:52,740
But we can't make ill speculations about people.

479
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,460
He came here for many reasons,

480
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,980
but hurting the cats is not one of them.

481
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,380
What does Doctor Luo do?

482
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,780
He's a doctor.

483
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,180
Why would he hurt the cats?

484
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,740
I am really worried about them.

485
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,020
They are not me.

486
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,860
They can't protect themselves.

487
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,340
I don't understand

488
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,690
why anyone would want to hurt us.

489
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:14,570
I understand.

490
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,260
Not everything

491
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,500
is up to us.

492
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,220
Let's go home

493
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:20,940
and have a good sleep.

494
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,500
Let's figure it out tomorrow, alright?

495
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,540
I will not

496
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,940
let anyone hurt them.

497
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:31,820
Trust me, alright?

498
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:35,180
Let's go home.

499
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,740
I trust you.

500
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,450
I've seen you feeding cats.

501
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,530
You can't fake that smile.

502
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,130
As long as

503
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:24,260
there is still one willing to believe you in the world,

504
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,090
you are not alone.

505
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,620
This is a really nice place.

506
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,740
After so many years,

507
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,210
you've already become a director.

508
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:56,660
This is probably an offensive question,

509
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,210
but will there be any transactions

510
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,140
between patients and doctors?

511
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,810
You are still as cynical as you were.

512
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,700
Just asking.

513
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,180
It's okay if you don't want to answer it.

514
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,140
Why would you ask this?

515
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,380
Luo,

516
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,780
Have you seen a guy

517
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,460
with a scar on his hand?

518
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:32,780
No.

519
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:35,530
No?

520
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,060
Does he have

521
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:44,980
a scar here?

522
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,180
Right.

523
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,300
In his 30s,

524
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,900
with a beard?

525
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,780
Right. Exactly.

526
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:53,780
Have you seen him?

527
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,380
His grandmother used to be one of my patients.

528
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,850
I've met him several times.

529
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,820
I sort of know him

530
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,500
in that sense.

531
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:05,660
What's wrong?

532
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,100
Are you two involved

533
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:11,020
in anything related to money?

534
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,050
Her disease has reached an advanced stage,

535
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,380
so other doctors and I

536
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,420
donated some money to him.

537
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,060
What's wrong?

538
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,500
Nothing.

539
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,380
This is the thing. My friend,

540
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,460
her uncle is a police officer.

541
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:34,740
She told me that

542
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,730
the police

543
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:36,820
is looking for him.

544
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,700
He's really dangerous.

545
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:40,620
Luo,

546
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,890
if you ever see him again,

547
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:43,820
call the police at once.

548
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:47,780
Alright.

549
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,220
I didn't expect that.

550
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,770
I am here to warn you about him.

551
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,090
I really don't want to get you involved.

552
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:58,060
After hearing what you said,

553
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,140
I am so much relieved now.

554
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,660
Alright. It's about time.

555
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,220
I should leave now.

556
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,060
Fine. Let me walk you out.

557
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:06,740
There's no need.

558
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:07,700
You may get back to work now.

559
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:08,660
I'll just...

560
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,660
See you at the bookstore some other day.

561
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,140
Alright.

562
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:13,460
See you, Luo.

563
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,060
See you. Take care.

564
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:14,420
Alright.

565
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,740
You are back.

566
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,460
You are such a heavy sleeper.

567
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,100
What if someone catches you?

568
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,620
It feels so good under the sun.

569
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,700
So I fell asleep.

570
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,220
Did Doctor Luo say anything?

571
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:27,460
That guy is a relative of one of his patients.

572
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,220
His grandmother is sick.

573
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,780
He hasn't got enough money to treat her,

574
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,060
so Luo set up a fundraising event

575
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:35,980
and asked people to donate for him.

576
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,500
That's how

577
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,340
they came to know each other.

578
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:42,380
We've wronged him.

579
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,740
I got it all wrong.

580
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,460
It's okay.

581
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,940
As long as we believe he's a good guy,

582
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,050
that's enough.

583
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:15,940
Sorry.

584
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,500
The big balcony is gone.

585
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:20,540
This one is small.

586
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:23,860
What are you talking about?

587
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,090
I prefer this one.

588
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:28,100
I can get closer to you.

589
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:29,699
It also gives me

590
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:31,250
a reason to stay close to you.

591
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,380
Look. As we hold each other tight,

592
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,770
this place seems bigger.

593
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,139
Rest assured.

594
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:44,980
We will find the cats.

595
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:00,530
Xiao Xiu,

596
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,260
I've put your moving-in present

597
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,170
at the doorstep.

598
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:03,860
A present?

599
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:04,860
Where?

600
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:05,660
At the doorstep.

601
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:06,460
Let me have a look.

602
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,250
Careful.

603
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,820
I'll go and have a look.

604
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,380
Why is she in such a hurry?

605
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,780
She's just like a kid.

606
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,780
A present can make her that happy.

607
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:21,060
Mingming,

608
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:23,260
this is too dangerous for you.

609
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,220
Dangerous?

610
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,740
The shell can be really hard.

611
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,820
What if you get hurt?

612
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:33,940
-Just leave them to me.
-You've put them into the wrong place.

613
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,260
Doctor Xu, how brave.

614
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,460
Peeling shells without gloves on.

615
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,490
I am a professional doctor.

616
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,500
You two are so sweet.

617
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,420
Cheers.

618
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:13,660
Xu Zihao.

619
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:14,660
Xu Zihao.

620
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,100
You,

621
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,620
seem such a player,

622
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,740
but I know that

623
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:24,460
you are as innocent as a high school student.

624
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,380
But you also need to

625
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,700
keep in mind that

626
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,970
although Mingming looks tough,

627
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:34,700
fearless, and invincible,

628
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:37,180
she needs a sense of security

629
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,340
and wants to be protected.

630
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:41,380
So do remember

631
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,940
to throw your

632
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,380
playboy tricks away.

633
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,340
Be nice to her.

634
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,820
Don't make her sad.

635
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,820
Love her.

636
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,420
If you ever make her sad,

637
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,010
you will have me to answer to.

638
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:51,890
Rest assured.

639
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:53,380
I treat her well.

640
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,090
Xiao Xiu, thank you.

641
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:55,970
If he ever treats me badly, I will let you know.

642
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:57,100
You can beat him up for me.

643
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,740
Sure.

644
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,300
And Mengmeng.

645
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,980
The first time I saw you,

646
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,140
you were watering the flowers.

647
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,460
You are

648
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,410
the most gentle girl in this world.

649
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,020
You cook really well, too.

650
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,340
You smell nice, and you are pretty.

651
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:12,900
You know what?

652
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,130
If I were a guy,

653
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:15,620
I would totally fall for you.

654
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,210
Xiao Xiu,

655
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,380
are you drunk?

656
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,660
No, I'm not.

657
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,180
Why are you still eating?

658
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,500
You chubby boy.

659
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,900
You chubby boy.

660
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,940
How much did you earn from me?

661
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,260
Do you remember?

662
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:30,850
I am really

663
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:32,860
sorry about what happened.

664
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:33,860
But I am telling you.

665
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,690
You need to stop being so slow.

666
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:36,420
You know what?

667
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,100
She's gentle indeed,

668
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,300
but do you know how sensitive she is?

669
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,500
You can't always neglect her feelings.

670
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,020
You need to what's happening.

671
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:44,980
You need to care about her,

672
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:45,740
take care of her,

673
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,300
and protect her. You hear me?

674
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,740
Yes. Yes.

675
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:51,020
Wait,

676
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,180
when did I earn money from you?

677
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:53,850
Never mind.

678
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:54,820
Just ignore her.

679
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:55,460
She's drunk.

680
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,540
Why are you so serious?

681
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,810
I feel that

682
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,940
Xiao Xiu knows us pretty well.

683
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,340
I have the same feeling.

684
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,380
Me too.

685
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:05,900
Alright.

686
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:07,260
Cheers, everyone.

687
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:07,980
Cheers.

688
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,820
May all lovers live happily ever after.

689
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,620
Cheers.

690
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,500
May all lovers live happily ever after.

691
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,220
You know what?

692
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,580
When I first get here,

693
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,980
I had so many expectations about it.

694
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,130
I never thought that

695
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:35,740
I would meet you guys.

696
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,820
You are willing to play with me,

697
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,540
go crazy with me, cry with me,

698
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:42,740
and go through hardship with me.

699
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,500
More importantly,

700
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,210
you've taught me what friendship is

701
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,290
and what love is.

702
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,820
I don't know if you still remember something

703
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,140
or have forgotten everything.

704
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,780
I want to tell you that

705
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,620
this is

706
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,380
the most precious experience in my life.

707
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,770
I want you to be happy.

708
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:11,900
I want you to be happy every day.

709
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,580
And be happier than me.

710
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,180
And I want to thank you

711
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,940
for being here for my transi...

712
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,100
I...

713
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,140
for being here on such...

714
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:36,780
such...

715
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:40,900
for being here and spending some time with me.

716
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,940
Cheers.

717
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,500
To the past.

718
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:48,500
To the future.

719
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,170
Xiao Xiu.

720
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,250
The bookstore is not open yet.

721
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,180
Go and see if things are alright.

722
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,300
The bookstore is not open yet.

723
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,210
Why should I go there?

724
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:36,860
Then go get some breakfast.

725
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:38,540
Walk around.

726
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:45,820
Take care.

727
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:46,380
Come back soon.
