Looking for this?

What is that?

00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,010
Don't you know what this is?

Speak.

There is a wireless interface on this camera.

Even if you don't tell us now,

when we give it to the police,

they'll find out where the receiver is.

13

You broke in for this in the middle of the night.

14
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:37,740
It must be important.

I don't want anything.

I know that,

20

Chi Yan is writing a book for Zhang Yi.

21
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,340
And you two have conflicts.

00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,220
I can sell the juicy news to reporters

27
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,700
and make some money.

28
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,260
Plus, Zhang is so arrogant.

29

When I worked for him,

30

00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,580
It can help me clear up my suspicion.

49

When did you get a cat?

50
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,820
During the book signing,

51
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,380
didn't you go to the hospital?

52
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,820
I chatted with Dr. Xu there.

53
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,690
He said there were kittens waiting to be adopted,

54
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:32,820
so I got one.

55
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,020
What does it look like?

56
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,540
Oh, right.

Isn't this the one

59
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,020

60
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:42,780
Yes.

61
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,010
He told me that.

62
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,260
I didn't pay attention this morning,

63
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,460
and it ran out of the house.

64

65

I haven't.

70

I'll search the balcony now.

Yeah, this is a small shop.

122
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,140
Many of my customers are regulars.

This kind of book doesn't sell well,

132

I wanted to come over and have a look.

142

I didn't expect it was your shop.

143
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,540
But the cat has been given away now, right?

144
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,340
Yeah.

145
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,140
I read about it online.

146
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:34,140

177
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,140
Luo...

178
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,500
Do you know him?

179
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,180
He is a very good doctor.

180
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,530
I hurt my leg before.

181
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,020
He cured me.

182
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,540
I don't like him.

183
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,690
Why not?

184
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,380
I just don't like him.

185
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:12,460
Chi Yan.

186
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,100
What happened?

187
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,540
These cats. Are they...

188
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,460
I'm helping a neighbor find her cat.

189
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,580
And I found these.

190
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,620
I called Xu Zihao.

191
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,780
He is on his way.

192
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,660
How did this happen?

193
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:36,890
I don't know.

194
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,700
Why would anyone try to poison them?

195
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,060
What's up?

196
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,780
I haven't seen you for a few days.

197
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,980
I missed you, so I called.

198
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:02,970
Cut out the rubbish.

199
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,540
Did you forget something?

200
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:10,380
Don't you need to thank me for the errand?

201
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,940
I need to put something here.

202
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,980
I don't have money now.

203
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,620
Allow me for a couple of days.

204
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,460
Why is he always running out of money?

205
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:44,860
Are you okay?

206
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,060
I'm fine.

207
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,340
Did you just...

208
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,660
remember what happened in high school?

209
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,250
People say that,

210
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,580
When a pet owner loses their pet,

211
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,820
the grief is no less than the loss of a loved one.

212
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,980
I didn't believe it then.

213
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,340
I thought it was exaggerated.

214
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,140
But ever since I got Bulb,

215
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,620
I started to understand that.

216
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,660
You must be so sad.

217
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,820
Rather than sad,

218
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,260
it's more like not understanding.

219
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,690
I didn't understand why

220
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,420
someone can be so evil.

221
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,660
Actually, I'm not so decent.

222
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,460
After I became a journalist,

223
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,290
I have seen many things like that.

224
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,490
For most people,

225
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,940
the supreme thing is not to be right，

226
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,700
but to be the same as most people.

227
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,340
Just like me in high school,

228
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,540
so gutless.

229
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,180
But don't worry, Chi Yan.

230
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,530
I'm a grown-up now, not a coward anymore

231
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,580
I will help you this time,

232
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,620
with Zihao and Xiao Xiu.

233
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,060
We'll help you together.

234
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:42,940
Thank you, guys.

235
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:55,700
Thank you for coming today.

236
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,660
What we've done today,

237
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,260
can you not tell Xiao Xiu?

238
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,020
Xiu?

239
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,140
She like cats.

240
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,980
I'm afraid she might be irrational.

241
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,700
No problem.

242
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,100
Then I'll investigate it privately.

243
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,140
I'll try to figure out what's going on.

244
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:20,340
Thank you.

245
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,540
Chi Yan.

246
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,970
Do you want to eat together tonight?

247
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,060
Tonight?

248
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,620
No, thanks. I left my phone at home.

249
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,980
I was in a hurry.

250
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,330
If Xiu can't contact me,

251
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,420
she'll be upset.

252
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:49,460
Actually, I wanted to contact you today,

253
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,660
I want to tell you something.

254
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,620
Go ahead.

255
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:05,619
I think you know that

256
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:08,540
I like you.

257
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,060
Qin Mingming.

258
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:19,940
I...

259
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,500
OK. I understand.

260
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,579
You are always like that.

261
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,170
It's okay.

262
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,660
I just need closure.

263
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,380
Qin Mingming. I...

264
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,500
That's fine.

265
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,610
Do you know that

266
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,860
in high school

267
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,980
I always looked at you from far off.

268
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:45,500
But today, I have the courage to tell you that,

269
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,700
I feel so relieved.

270
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,300
Really.

271
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,140
Sorry, I...

272
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:57,580
It's alright.

273
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,700
What are you doing

274
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,500
I'm fine, really.

275
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,740
Don't worry about that.

276
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:05,980
Don't worry.

277
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,410
Why are you everywhere?

278
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,220
Stop following me.

279
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,220
It's a big road.

280
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,620
You walk your way, and I walk mine.

281
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:05,900
No conflict.

282
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,500
Have you seen it all?

283
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,860
I can pretend that I saw nothing.

284
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,340
What do you want?

285
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,490
I'm afraid you might cry.

286
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,140
Did I?

287
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,780
I'm off.

288
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:42,660
Wait.

289
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,900
What's that?

290
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,500
The cat of my neighbor, the florist, is lost.

291
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,330
I drew it for her.

292
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:52,820
It...

293
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:54,460
You drew it?

294
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:55,980
Nice, huh?

295
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,460
It is nice.

296
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,380
What a masterpiece.

297
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,100
Sure it is.

298
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:00,770
Look,

299
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,300
This is more than just a painting.

300
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,900
This is an artwork.

301
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:04,580
Here.

302
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,100
Since you are my good friend,

303
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,250
I will give you one for your collection.

304
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,540
Thank you, Picasso.

305
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,700
Wait a sec.

306
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,900
I'll look for it with you on the way home.

307
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,340
Then hurry up.

308
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:20,300
OK.

309
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:23,300
Picasso.

310
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,170
[Missing Cat]

311
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:27,620
Need more?

312
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:28,730
That's enough.

313
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:29,610
Alright.

314
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,250
Mark my word,

315
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,100
It will be found tomorrow.

316
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,410
Why are you laughing?

317
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:41,700
By the way,

318
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,860
How's that thing happened at the book signing?

319
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:44,980
How is the writer?

320
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:45,770
One, two, three, four.

321
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:47,940
Still alive.

322
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,660
I feel like you have trouble with him.

323
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,340
Of course I do.

324
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,860
He framed Chi Yan.

325
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,660
Fortunately, Chi Yan has proven his innocence.

326
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:58,820
Then...

327
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,530
Did you find out any results?

328
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,460
Not yet.

329
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,780
But I am worried about a problem

330
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,700
If something is wrong with that glass of wine,

331
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,180
then that person must come for Chi Yan.

332
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,140
You're right.

333
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,020
There were so many people.

334
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,460
It's hard to say.

335
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,500
You do care about Chi Yan.

336
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:26,810
Let's go.

337
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,090
Cheers.

338
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:41,980
Sorry.

339
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,380
What for?

340
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,370
To be honest,

341
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:53,450
I don't know if I should be happy

342
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,650
or sad.

343
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,610
You.

344
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,180
My best friend.

345
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:02,900
Qin Mingming.

346
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,700
The girl I like.

347
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:08,410
Why?

348
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,380
Why does she have to like you?

349
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,420
And you don't like her.

350
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,020
Why am I so unlucky?

351
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:17,500
Well.

352
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,220
Xu Zihao.

353
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,060
When she told you today,

354
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,780
I have to admit that I gloated.

355
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,260
But then she went home,

356
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,340
looking so sad.

357
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,060
I felt like...

358
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,220
I felt like it's better

359
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,380
to see you two date.

360
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,980
Are you drunk? Xu Zihao.

361
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,740
Hello? What's up?

362
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,940
My sister is jogging.

363
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,900
Do you want to come over?

364
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,180
Okay, I get it.

365
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:04,580
Where are you going?

366
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,220
Got a thing, bye.

367
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,140
I'm on the playground now.

368
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,410
What?

369
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,140
Why don't you stop her?

370
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,460
If I can stop her,

371
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,810
you'll not be needed.

372
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,860
I have to tell you that

373
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,460
My sister has finished multiple full marathons.

374
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,650
OK, gotta go.

375
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:33,900
Why are you here again?

376
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:35,940
The playground isn't yours.

377
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,060
Don't care about me.

378
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,530
Just run like I'm not here.

379
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:40,420
Whatever.

380
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,740
Wipe it.

381
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,860
I am so humiliated.

382
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,420
You must forget what happened today.

383
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,940
I won't forget.

384
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:48,850
I don't think it's a shame

385
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:49,730
to like someone.

386
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,460
And.

387
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,540
I will never forget

388
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,500
anything about you.

389
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,700
Liangliang told me that

390
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:05,500
you've finished multiple marathons.

391
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,380
I haven't.

392
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,100
But I know that those who run marathons

393
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:12,780
don't always know that

394
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,780
they will be able to finish it before they start.

395
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:19,460
Qin Mingming.

396
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:21,620
You don't have to wait for me.

397
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,140
I will catch up with you.

398
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:13,380
Are you asleep?

399
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,330
Are you asleep?

400
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,380
So early.

401
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:03,850
What's up, Lin Mo?

402
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,980
Send me that photo.

403
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,330
Are you alright?

404
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,020
OK, take it there.

405
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,300
OK.

406
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,300
Is it okay?

407
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,580
Sure.

408
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,340
Take care, both of you.

409
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:28,820
OK, then we'll meet there.

410
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:29,740
OK.

411
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,220
Sure.

412
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,420
Bye.

413
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:37,300
Found it.

414
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,020
You caught a cold?

415
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,420
Maybe, it was cold last night.

416
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,180
I'll get you some medicine.

417
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,020
I need to find He Meng.

418
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,660
Medicine first.

419
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,260
He Meng first.

420
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,330
-She is so worried.
 -Take some medicine!

421
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,620
Yes, that's it.

422
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,060
Where is it now?

423
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:56,260
It is injured a bit.

424
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,300
But don't worry.

425
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,210
I have asked my friend

426
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,740
to take him to Xu Zihao's hospital.

427
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,260
Let's go over now, okay?

428
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,060
OK.

429
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:03,820
Are you alright?

430
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,220
Yeah, I'm fine.

431
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,260
Chi Yan said I might have a cold.

432
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,210
You should take some rest.

433
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,500
I can go by myself.

434
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,980
No, I want to go with you.

435
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:14,660
We finally found it.

436
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,620
If you need anything,

437
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,740
do tell me.

438
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:17,460
Let's go.

439
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:17,980
OK.

440
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:19,700
Well,

441
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,700
there are not many caring boys like you nowadays.

442
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,460
It likes you so much.

443
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,860
Do you have a pet?

444
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,740
No, I don't.

445
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,300
Why not?

446
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,420
Does your girlfriend not allow it?

447
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,380
Who said he has a girlfriend!

448
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,500
Un-huh.

449
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,420
Should we bandage the wound first?

450
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,700
I'll get a cotton ball.

451
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,690
I‘ll get gauze.

452
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:40,860
I'll get alcohol.

453
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,540
People might think it was you who came to see the doctor.

454
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,730
You are finally here.

455
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,020
Thank you so much!

456
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,900
It soiled your clothes.

457
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,100
Sorry for that.

458
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:55,970
Mantou.

459
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,850
Don't run away again, do you hear me?

460
00:28:59,020 --> 00:28:59,540
You're back.

461
00:28:59,540 --> 00:28:59,980
By the way,

462
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,100
where did you find it?

463
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:02,100
By the road.

464
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,100
I saw a tag under its neck.

465
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,140
It's not like a stray cat.

466
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,420
You should thank Xiao Xiu.

467
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:08,850
She worked so hard

468
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:11,260
Especially the portraits on the poster.

469
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,540
Are you guys

470
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,900
keeping something from me?

471
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,140
No, no.

472
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,730
I'm on day shift today

473
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:22,490
Gotta go.

474
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:23,220
Thanks again.

475
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,300
Goodbye.

476
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:24,860
Bye-bye.

477
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,260
Sorry to bother you.

478
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,010
You're welcome.

479
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,650
You were naughty.

480
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:31,380
Why have you been naughty?

481
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,170
Never do this again, okay?

482
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:33,860
Mengmeng.

483
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,540
What's this?

484
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:38,890
Have you

485
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,420
never had bubble tea before?

486
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,610
Those black ones

487
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,860
are called bubbles.

488
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,250
It's made from tapioca.

489
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:48,690
And there is brown sugar in it.

490
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:49,860
It's so good. Try it.

491
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,020
Try it!

492
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,060
I'll try.

493
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,020
Slow it down!

494
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,860
What is this? This is so good!

495
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:14,540
It's better than beer.

496
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,180
Xiu likes bubble tea too much.

497
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:16,970
No.

498
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,700
If beer is sardines,

499
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,660
then you are salmon.

500
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,620
You are equally important.

501
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,540
Really, slow down.

502
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,540
It's not a competition.

503
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,540
You can have this one too.

504
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,580
Welcome.

505
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,980
Hi, what would you like to order?

506
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,100
Xu Zihao.

507
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,180
Have you been beaten?

508
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,330
It's nothing like that.

509
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,530
I ran a half marathon with Qin Mingming

510
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:39,340
at a speed of 15 kph last night.

511
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,460
When I woke up today,

512
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,370
I couldn't feel my limbs.

513
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,340
You two work out together

514
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,660
at night?

515
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,940
Do you think I need to work out?

516
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,410
It's because she told Chi Yan she liked him,

517
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:52,500
I was afraid that she'd be upset

518
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,980
so I ran with her.

519
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,010
She told Chi Yan she liked him?

520
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:57,740
I'll have this.

521
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:58,740
Okay.

522
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:02,940
That's not the point.

523
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,980
The point is that I was going to follow her,

524
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,500
but she told me to go away.

525
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,260
Then Liangliang called me,

526
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,260
So I went again.

527
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:12,740
Where is she?

528
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:16,020
She left at the "like" part.

529
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,140
Where did she go?

530
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:21,820
I guess she went to find Qin Mingming.

531
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,460
For god's sake.

532
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:25,940
New store!

533
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,380
Super discounts on cosmetics!

534
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,900
Miss, check it out.

535
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,380
Miss, check it out.

536
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,500
And free tutorials!

537
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,380
I'm busy.

538
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:34,500
You are obviously going to

539
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,900
have a fight.

540
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,700
There are tricks.

541
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,900
Stop following me.

542
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:38,740
As the saying goes,

543
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,780
Makeup is the girl’s second face.

544
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:41,780
Beautiful, sexy, cute.

545
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,500
You have to be whatever you want to be.

546
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,140
Whatever I want to be?

547
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:46,900
Sure!

548
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:47,780
Come!

549
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:57,530
Say it.

550
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,500
I accidentally told Xiao Xiu

551
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,220
that Qin told you she liked you.

552
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,170
Xiao Xiu is coming for her!

553
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,180
You told her?

554
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,540
Hello, welcome.

555
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,740
Please sit.

556
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:12,540
I want a fighter's makeup.

557
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:13,740
No problem.

558
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,300
I got you.

559
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:16,700
Close your eyes.

560
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,300
Where are they now?

561
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,700
I called Mingming but no answer.

562
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,420
I'll look for her at the TV station.

563
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,820
Wait there. I'll pick you up now.

564
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,540
I'm coming down now.

565
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,020
Across the road,

566
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,540
then turn right to see the main entrance.

567
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:35,900
Just come in.

568
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,740
I told the security.

569
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,420
What are you laughing at?

570
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:53,460
Nothing.

571
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:54,900
Why do you look like this?

572
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,260
Because I'm coming to see you.

573
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,540
For that?

574
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,060
What's the matter?

575
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,460
So you are going to meet a rival in love.

576
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,060
Rest assured.

577
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,100
I will do you a battle makeup

578
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,540
Don't be outdone!

579
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,060
You must tell her that he is yours!

580
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,540
Mine?

581
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:13,940
Yeah!

582
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,580
Don't let her take your man!

583
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:17,220
My man?

584
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,580
What's up?

585
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,780
I am here to tell you that

586
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,820
Chi Yan belongs to me!

587
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:27,740
Belongs to you?

588
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:29,410
You bet!

589
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,420
Chi Yan is an independent individual.

590
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,900
How come he belongs to you?

591
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:39,650
Because...

592
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,820
Be... Because... He...

593
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:44,930
Because he cooks for me,

594
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:45,900
gives me a bed,

595
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,260
plays with me,

596
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,140
and... and cares about me.

597
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,210
Gives you a bed?

598
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,340
Are you sure?

599
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,020
Yes, I'm sure.

600
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,580
So Chi Yan belongs to me!

601
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,810
You... You can't like him,

602
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:56,860
let alone tell him that.

603
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,060
OK.

604
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,620
Even if you are right,

605
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,420
then,

606
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,380
why can't I like him?

607
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,490
It's my own business to like him.

608
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:07,460
I like him, so I tell him.

609
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,340
You can't. You just can't!

610
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,380
You can't like him!

611
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,940
He'll never do these things to you!

612
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:12,620
You won't!

613
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:13,780
I disagree!

614
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:14,739
If you like him,

615
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:15,940
we can have a fair competition.

616
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,100
I don't compete with you!

617
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:17,980
Never!

618
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:18,810
He won't do the same with you!

619
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:19,370
If he does that,

620
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:20,620
I will tear down the bookstore!

621
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,659
You are not the boss.

622
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:22,889
I am the boss!

623
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:23,580
I don't care!

624
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:28,260
Xiao Xiu really loves you.

625
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:31,370
In contrast, your fans are weak.

626
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:33,219
No wonder they can't get you.

627
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:34,620
Wait a sec.

628
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,900
It's Xiao Xiu.

629
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,500
Will she lose it?

630
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:44,980
Stop fighting!

631
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:51,139
Chi Yan.

632
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:51,929
Will they fight?

633
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:52,860
Eyes on the road!

634
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,219
In terms of strength,

635
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:56,420
I don't worry about Mingming.

636
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:58,140
But if there is a fight,

637
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,850
will Xiu be taken by the police?

638
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:02,380
Can you shut up and drive?

639
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,580
I'm helping you analyze the situation.

640
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,620
We have to hurry up.

641
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,620
Do you understand me?

642
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,780
But don't you think

643
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,420
we have overlooked something?

644
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:16,860
What?

645
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,820
What Chi Yan thinks.

646
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,940
Why don't you ask him first?

647
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,170
Chi Yan.

648
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,620
What Chi Yan thinks.

649
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,820
What does he think?

650
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,290
What is that?

651
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:36,940
What is that?

652
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,780
You got backup?

653
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,690
It's okay.

654
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,260
Just let it sniff you.

655
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:41,860
Let go of me!

656
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,420
-They won't bite. 
-They are coming!

657
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,740
Don't look at me!

658
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,940
Let it go away!

659
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,420
Qin Mingming.

660
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,740
Are they fighting?

661
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,130
I...

662
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,100
You scared them away.

663
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,020
No, Qin Mingming.

664
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:54,900
Let's go.

665
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:58,100
If it weren't for the two police dogs,

666
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,620
I would definitely win.

667
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,820
And Xu Zihao said

668
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,700
that I looked like one of the Powerpuff Girls.

669
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,860
You are a Powerpuff Girl.

670
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,540
Although I don't know what that is,

671
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,420
I know it's nothing good.

672
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,060
You all laughed at me.

673
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,450
Xu Zihao dare not laugh at you.

674
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,300
He was afraid that

675
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,820
you would let the animals go again.

676
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,260
Don't be mad.

677
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:25,740
You!

678
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:28,330
Don't you like Qin Mingming!

679
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:31,020
OK.

680
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:40,940
Let's go home.

681
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:52,650
What?

682
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,940
Do you like me?

683
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,220
I told you so the night you were drunk.

684
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:08,020
It's true that you are always sour-faced

685
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,220
and weird.

686
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,010
But after such a long time staying with you,

687
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:12,540
I became weird too.

688
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,140
I don't want you to get hurt,

689
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,090
or be treated badly.

690
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,580
Every time you try to find me,

691
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,730
I'm so happy.

692
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:20,300
I forgot that I was here to repay my favor.

693
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,300
So when Qin Mingming told you she likes you,

694
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,180
I was so angry.

695
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,580
I want to...

696
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:26,420
Just...

697
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,500
But now I figured it out.

698
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:32,540
Chi Yan.

699
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,740
I like you.

700
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,450
I read the story of the little mermaid.

701
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,460
In the story, she loves the prince,

702
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,340
but the prince loves another girl.

703
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:54,140
In the end, she became bubbles and disappeared forever.

704
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:57,100
I don't want to be like the little mermaid.

705
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,330
I like you, Chi Yan.

706
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,970
So I want you to like me back.

707
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:02,580
Xiao Xiu.

708
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,620
I'm sorry.

709
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,020
I don't want to think about that now.

710
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:37,860
What happened to it?

711
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,420
How's it?

712
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:55,700
It's fine now.

713
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,980
It was given sleeping pills.

714
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,780
If with a bigger dose,

715
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,820
it may die.

716
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:02,930
How can someone do such things?

717
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:07,540
Are you OK?

718
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,340
You're having a fever.

719
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,100
Alright.

720
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,130
Let's go home.

721
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:17,100
How come you have a fever?

722
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,580
-Leave it to Zihao. 
-Quiet, please.

723
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,300
It's in good hands.

724
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,020
Don't worry.

725
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:26,420
OK, it's fine.

726
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,300
Let's go.

727
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:29,450
Take care of it.

728
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,540
Wait.

729
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:31,900
I will drive you home.

730
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,020
Let's go.

731
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:33,700
It's alright.

732
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,460
Have you eaten?

733
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,300
I'm not hungry.

734
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,890
The stray cat thing is definitely not accidental.

735
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,260
There were two in such a short time.

736
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:55,820
I'm afraid...

737
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,140
I'm afraid there might be more.

738
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,020
Many stray cats have been killed.

739
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,740
And more stray cats will be caught.

740
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:04,940
Be caught?

741
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:08,340
I've checked that

742
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:10,300
the number of stray cats is not right.

743
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,220
After the incident last time,

744
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,440
the number of stray cats
 have been decreasing every day.

745
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,340
They must have been taken away.

746
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,100
I will catch the bad guy.

747
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,180
Bro,

748
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,020
I was with you in high school.

749
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:38,700
But now,

750
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,970
don't take everything on your own.

751
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,170
Tell me,

752
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,460
otherwise you're not my friend.

753
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:46,380
Did you hear me?

754
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:46,940
Alright.

755
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,330
Take care on the way home.

756
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,140
Sleep early tonight.

757
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,090
Keep in touch.

758
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,700
Chi Yan!

759
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:09,460
What?

760
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:10,450
Come.

761
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:12,860
Look!

762
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,290
Will my face be like this forever?

763
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:20,420
Remove false eyelashes and eye makeup.

764
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,500
Remove lip makeup.

765
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,140
Remove facial makeup.

766
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,300
Cotton pads.

767
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:30,690
Makeup remover

768
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:32,540
Towelettes.

769
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,420
Almost done.

770
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,260
Hang in there.

771
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:46,210
♫ I can hear the raindrops outside the window♫

772
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:46,460
Chi Yan.

773
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:51,530
♫ My blurred vision is getting clear ♫

774
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:49,660
I like you.

775
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,540
I'm sorry, Xiao Xiu.

776
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:58,390
♫ My love has been awaken ♫

777
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,850
Since you appeared in my life,

778
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,220
you have done a lot for me.

779
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:03,190
♫ by the howling wind♫

780
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:01,980
To me,

781
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:03,340
you are brave,

782
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,620
cheerful and sweet.

783
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:09,170
♫ My head is going crazy♫

784
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,780
You are always full of energy.

785
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:10,500
I'm just the opposite.

786
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:15,070
♫ Replay our shared moments♫

787
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:14,250
Sooner or later, you will return to your world.

788
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,010
You don't belong here,

789
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:20,920
♫ This quiet joy I'm feeling♫

790
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,090
and you won't belong to me.

791
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,100
So,

792
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:27,260
♫ This peaceful satisfaction♫

793
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:22,610
I'm really sorry.

794
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:24,900
Please forgive me.

795
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,180
Even if I have to deceive myself,

796
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,820
I can respond to your feelings.

797
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:35,260
♫ Your starry eyes are blinking♫

798
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:39,970
♫ like a beacon that guides me home♫
