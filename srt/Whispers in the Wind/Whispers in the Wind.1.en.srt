1
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,411
Emil!

2
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:11,608
KARAOKE

3
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,333
Give me a smile.

4
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,961
There.

5
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,130
Eiko, can't you give me a smile today?

6
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,551
Only a few of them are left

7
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,637
and they always look sad.

8
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:45,099
Remember when we used
to have a lot of customers,

9
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:48,645
when I was swamped taking orders?

10
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:53,524
The tsunami changed everything.

11
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,735
As of now, it's still raging.

12
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,112
It changed a lot.

13
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,448
Otsuchi…

14
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:02,575
doesn't look like Otsuchi anymore.

15
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,620
You see, people have left this place.

16
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,957
We're the only ones here.

17
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,252
And then here I am,

18
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:15,296
crying over my Haruto.

19
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:18,049
It's a good thing he went first

20
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,219
and didn't witness the tragedy.

21
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,564
Have you talked to them?

22
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,652
He's still missing, Mayumi.

23
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:43,241
And I'm not ready to say goodbye.

24
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:44,951
Hannah.

25
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:49,998
We both know Emil is gone, right?

26
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:51,916
Also…

27
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,544
It's been too long since…

28
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,337
Wait…

29
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,840
How long has it been?

30
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:01,342
Sometimes I can't remember.

31
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,885
I get confused.

32
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,305
Hannah.

33
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,474
You should move on.

34
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,977
Go back to the Philippines.

35
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,272
Visit your parents, your family.

36
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:16,774
I'm sure they really miss you.

37
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,068
- And if I am your mother--
- Mayumi.

38
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,403
How do I return?

39
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,201
If I do…

40
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:31,080
I want it to be when I've found Emil.

41
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,543
So even that at least

42
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:38,087
I can give to our families.

43
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,428
I have to return to school now.

44
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,680
I still have things to do.

45
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,313
Come home early tonight.

46
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,106
I'll cook humba.

47
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:04,113
I'll make you humba tonight,
your favorite.

48
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,418
Mayumi. Come here.

49
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,628
- Come here.
- Why?

50
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,966
Look under Kaito's seat.

51
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,388
Take care of it.

52
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,890
Okay, take care.

53
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,145
Kaito, are you okay?

54
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,946
My sister's name is Midori Agawa.

55
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:49,909
She was at the school
when the tsunami hit.

56
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,079
I just want to know if you've found her.

57
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:56,165
We have her DNA on record.

58
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:01,754
You will be notified immediately
if we have news.

59
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,423
Thank you so much.
Please help me.

60
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,759
Excuse me.

61
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:07,760
My fiancé…

62
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:11,806
I saw him get swept by the tsunami.

63
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,684
Please find him.

64
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:15,601
Sir.

65
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:19,647
Sir.

66
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,192
Don't worry. Please calm down.

67
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,740
WIND PHONE

68
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,068
Excuse me?

69
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,698
What are they doing?

70
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,243
Looking for bodies.

71
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,955
Remember the tsunami?

72
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,791
It happened here.

73
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,334
On the north coast.

74
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,962
I read about it.

75
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:10,675
Things are swept away from here to the US,

76
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,218
Canada.

77
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:16,180
One time they saw a fiberglass boat.

78
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,016
Sturdy, right?

79
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,477
It floated for eight years.

80
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,522
That's how it is here in Japan.

81
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,901
There are still bodies
and debris being swept ashore.

82
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,364
I'm Ren.

83
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:35,491
Hannah.

84
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:40,830
I'm a hardware design engineer in Kobe.

85
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,582
Fujitsu Ten.

86
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,795
I teach English here.

87
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:49,755
There's something here!

88
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,094
Wait.

89
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,194
It's just a glove.

90
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,658
Are you okay?

91
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:20,244
Sorry, I have to go.

92
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,513
Hannah, right?

93
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,645
I saw this on a documentary.

94
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,940
That's a wind phone, right?

95
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,068
I just tried it.

96
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,154
It could be a viral video.

97
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:41,909
Viral?

98
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:47,415
Are viral videos not popular here?

99
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:55,506
It's not connected to anything.

100
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,802
You're not talking to anyone but the wind.

101
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,557
The owner of this garden,

102
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:08,018
he set up that phone.

103
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,649
When his cousin died,

104
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,028
he used to call him using that phone.

105
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,616
Calling through that phone

106
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,204
helped the survivors.

107
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,375
Illogical, but…

108
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:35,671
the thought that somehow

109
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:39,842
the wind carries your message
to your loved one…

110
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,888
It's comforting.

111
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,685
Who did you call?

112
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,566
How about you? Who will you call?

113
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,987
You can go to Namiita Fudo Falls.

114
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,615
There are shrines nearby.

115
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:03,782
Okay.

116
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,744
I'm looking for my mom.

117
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,624
The last Dad heard, she was here.

118
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,250
But that's a long time ago.

119
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,712
I asked around but I didn't get any info.

120
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,433
You haven't seen her in a long time?

121
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,311
I didn't grow up with her.

122
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,107
Where did you search?

123
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:44,114
That's my specialty, humba.

124
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,824
Eat well.

125
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,326
Thank you.

126
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,038
Hey.

127
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,999
You grew up without your mom?

128
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,709
It's just you and your dad?

129
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,422
Am I the only one freezing?

130
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,844
My parents weren't married.

131
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,098
When I was two years old,

132
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,267
my mom went to Japan.

133
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,186
She said she was going to work here.

134
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,398
She never came back.

135
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,526
Didn't call my dad anymore.

136
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,654
But you're still looking for her?

137
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,241
My dad is something else.

138
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:31,203
She left him but he still hasn't learned.

139
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,707
Even before he died a few months ago,

140
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:39,837
he was still waiting for Mom's return.

141
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,298
He'll tell anyone who went to Japan

142
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:46,385
to ask around for my mother

143
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,345
wherever they went.

144
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,931
Your dad really loves her deeply.

145
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,099
Crazy.

146
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:54,059
That's what he is.

147
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,397
But I love him.

148
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,900
That's why I'm here.

149
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,610
Because he told me

150
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,572
to find Mom and give her a letter.

151
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:13,954
It's something when guys fall in love

152
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,749
with beautiful ones like us.

153
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,584
Head over heels.

154
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,170
That's how my Haruto was.

155
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,964
That's why…

156
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:27,509
even if Otsuchi changed a lot,

157
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,971
with many buildings constructed,

158
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,724
I never let them touch this restaurant.

159
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:36,602
My Haruto and I built this.

160
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,813
No one can evict us from here

161
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,440
no matter how hard they try.

162
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,486
Hannah, you can relate
to Ren's dad, right?

163
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,784
Did the tsunami take
someone away from you?

164
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:54,370
Yes, her boyfriend.

165
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,414
As of now he's missing,
and she's still searching.

166
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,334
Is he also a teacher here?

167
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:05,881
He used to work in Singapore.

168
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:09,301
He just visited me here.

169
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:16,725
Hannah?

170
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,395
Hannah?

171
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:29,113
If your dad told you
your mom is in Otsuchi,

172
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,617
do you think she was here
during the tsunami?

173
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,872
Because you can go to the police station.

174
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,709
They have a list…

175
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,087
of people who died during the tsunami

176
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,297
and those who are still missing.

177
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,009
Hey, handsome Ren!

178
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,469
Eat. The humba will get cold.

179
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,055
Go ahead.

180
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:14,199
You didn't eat your food.

181
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,870
It looked good, but I don't know.

182
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,371
Maybe I'm just tired.

183
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,876
You and Mayumi live here?

184
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,464
We sleep downstairs.

185
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,383
When I arrived in Otsuchi,

186
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,595
Mayumi and I immediately became close.

187
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:39,641
Two Filipinas in a place where
there aren't many Filipinos.

188
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,935
It's automatic you'll become friends.

189
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,147
After the tsunami,

190
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:48,358
Mayumi opened her house

191
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,527
and restaurant to the survivors.

192
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,279
We stayed there.

193
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:56,033
We became each other's support group.

194
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,036
There used to be a lot of us.

195
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,747
But now it's only Mayumi and I.

196
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,166
Plus two others.

197
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:08,879
Good thing you and Mayumi
are there for each other.

198
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:15,094
I hope you find her.

199
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:18,639
Thank you.

200
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:23,811
It's hard to ask around here

201
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,729
since only a few people speak English.

202
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,857
My search would be easier
if you're with me.

203
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:35,697
You might be busy.

204
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:39,201
Sorry, I get bold when I'm tired.

205
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,456
Are you okay?

206
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,084
He's asking if you're okay.

207
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,296
Get in.

208
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,464
Go ahead.

209
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,300
There are only a few taxis here.

210
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,261
Get in.

211
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,470
Why is he rushing me?

212
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,930
Thank you.

213
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:30,794
Fuck!

214
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,213
Why does this keep happening?

215
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:36,133
Here it is again.

216
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,968
What'll I do?

217
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:41,847
It's hard to fix.

218
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,308
- Mayumi. Are you okay?
- It keeps happening.

219
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:47,311
Look, it won't get fixed.

220
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,189
I'm okay.

221
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,648
I'm a rich lady here,

222
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:55,319
I fix my own toilet and not others'.

223
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:01,366
If Haruto were here,
this would have been fixed.

224
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,244
If Kenji or Kai was here,

225
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,705
and everyone who left us.

226
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:12,878
There are still days when I think of them,

227
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:15,464
what has changed, and my Haruto.

228
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,884
I still want to break down.

229
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,637
- Hannah.
- Mayumi.

230
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,514
It's not just you.

231
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:28,518
- How are we going to fix this?
- Plunge deeper.

232
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,145
This is so hard.

233
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,233
I'll do it.

234
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,735
Thank you.

235
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:53,919
Dad.

236
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,802
I'm here.

237
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:08,517
I'm doing what you told me.

238
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,984
You're passing on your job to me.

239
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,535
All right, Dad.

240
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,870
I'll keep you updated.

241
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,230
You look so surprised.

242
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,190
I'm sorry.

243
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,365
What's written in this notebook?

244
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,744
Let me see.

245
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,427
Good for him.

246
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,099
You?

247
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,101
Have you asked?

248
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,439
I went to the police station.

249
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,109
Good thing we understood each other.

250
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:44,571
I gave them my mom's name,

251
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:50,535
but she's not on the list.

252
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:54,206
I'm think Dad got the wrong info.

253
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:57,042
Maybe she's not here in Otsuchi.

254
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,544
That's why I called him.

255
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,296
I complained.

256
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:04,800
I said his instructions
were based on "fake news."

257
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:09,971
Fake news? That's cute.

258
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,432
I'll use that on Mayumi.

259
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,309
You don't know fake news?

260
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:16,144
No.

261
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,272
You really should visit back home.

262
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,775
But you know,

263
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:24,820
even if you complain,

264
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:29,157
you still won't stop searching, right?

265
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:35,080
You love your "crazy" dad.

266
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:39,000
I don't want him to haunt me in my dreams.

267
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:44,172
What year did your mom get here?

268
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:47,634
Maybe she stayed here for a while,

269
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:51,721
but moved at some point.

270
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,932
How can we be sure of that?

271
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:59,980
I know someone who can help us.

272
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,940
I'll bring you to him.

273
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,567
Wait, you don't have a class?

274
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:04,943
It's done.

275
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,404
This early?

276
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:15,620
Yes.

277
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:16,913
Okay.

278
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,332
I'll just put this back.

279
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:29,885
Of all places, you went to Otsuchi.

280
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:35,432
I've been to a lot of places in Japan.

281
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:41,396
My first job wasn't teaching English.

282
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,899
I worked at a hotel,

283
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,943
and became a fruit picker.

284
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,529
I'm not kidding.

285
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:52,490
I paid for my siblings' education.

286
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,659
When the tsunami hit,

287
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,329
our youngest had just graduated.

288
00:24:57,954 --> 00:25:00,749
I love my family so much.

289
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:07,797
It was a relief when my responsibility
to them was over.

290
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:11,134
I can finally focus on myself

291
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,470
and all my plans in life.

292
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,557
But…

293
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:23,647
the tsunami washed it all away.

294
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,631
Yamato.

295
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,060
He's Yamato.

296
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,147
Yamato, this is Ren.

297
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,899
A new friend from home.

298
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:12,153
Welcome to Otsuchi, our new friend.

299
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:20,347
Did I say something wrong?

300
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:30,357
It seems you two are getting along.

301
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,907
Noella Basbas?

302
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,411
You know,

303
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:08,163
if Yamato wasn't here,

304
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:11,791
I don't know how I would've survived.

305
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:16,713
He became my refuge and solace.

306
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:40,797
Yamato.

307
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,515
Are you talking about me?

308
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,061
Wella.

309
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,065
Rikuzentakata.

310
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:48,925
Rikuzentakata is only
one hour away from Otsuchi.

311
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,886
You can get there easily.

312
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,444
Hannah, are you okay?

313
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,074
Hannah?

314
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,503
You know,

315
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,716
Emil and I talked

316
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,262
that we' meet after my class.

317
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,933
But there was an earthquake

318
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,978
so we escorted the kids out.

319
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,858
Then came the tsunami alert.

320
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,902
I left immediately

321
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,781
to go to Emil.

322
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,951
I saw him.

323
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,330
He was so close.

324
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:06,961
But I also saw the waves
crashing onto him.

325
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,965
After that,

326
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,426
the next thing I remember,

327
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:15,636
I was already underwater.

328
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,140
Until I reached the surface.

329
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:25,605
I searched for him
in all the evacuation centers.

330
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,690
But I didn't find him.

331
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,950
As of now, he's still missing.

332
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:46,125
Hannah, it's not your fault
that you lived.

333
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:02,517
What's your plan now?

334
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,648
I'll go to Rikuzentakata.

335
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,526
Come with me?

336
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,656
Come with you?

337
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:20,034
But it's in Rikuzentakata.

338
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:24,831
You told me it's just an hour away.

339
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,919
I can pick you up before I head there.

340
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,799
Why do you want me to join you?

341
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,138
Because…

342
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,642
you're now part of my search.

343
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:47,937
See…

344
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:51,232
I learned about Rikuzentakata

345
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,692
because of you.

346
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:56,070
It seems like you're my good luck charm.

347
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:03,411
I don't know.

348
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:08,332
I still have a lot to do for my class.

349
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,253
I'll come back here next week,

350
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:16,048
but if you're not ready then, it's okay.

351
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,233
How are you and Ren?

352
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,403
I already helped him.

353
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:39,822
Maybe that's enough.

354
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:44,452
You know I can't be away from Otsuchi.

355
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:48,706
No one would get mad if
you paused in your search for Emil.

356
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:51,292
Why are you scared?

357
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,085
Scared?

358
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:54,712
Me?

359
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,797
Why would I be scared?

360
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,591
I'm the one asking you.

361
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:02,011
I know what you're thinking, Mayumi.

362
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,095
Nothing's wrong.

363
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,223
You're single, he's single.

364
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:06,182
Mayumi.

365
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,683
Okay, I'll shut up.

366
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,312
What's holding you back?

367
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,230
Why?

368
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,397
He's handsome.

369
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:16,359
I thought you were going to shut up.

370
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:20,238
I can't keep quiet
because I don't want to.

371
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,031
I don't want to.

372
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:24,200
Because you're still young.

373
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:26,035
I don't want you to waste your life.

374
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:30,206
What you and Emil had
will forever be special,

375
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:34,710
but it's okay to have another
special someone in your life.

376
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,045
Right?

377
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:40,049
You don't understand, Mayumi.

378
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:43,886
What is it I'm not getting? Tell me.

379
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,644
There's nothing new in our lives.

380
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,813
Ren is new.

381
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:57,358
Embrace it!

382
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,860
If the embrace leads to a kiss

383
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,029
then that's great.

384
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:05,449
You told me you'd keep quiet.

385
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,285
I don't want to.

386
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:10,079
Mayumi, it's dripping.

387
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:13,124
- There's so much to fix in this house.
- Take care of it.

388
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:17,420
Do you know where Eiko is?

389
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,590
Can you help me?

390
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,554
The toilet needs fixing again.

391
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,731
Sorry, I don't understand English.

392
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:20,566
Sorry.

393
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,211
I've been looking for this restaurant,

394
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:23,421
but I couldn't find it.

395
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:26,340
I circled a few times.

396
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:29,927
Really?

397
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,681
It's the only restaurant here.

398
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,311
I think…

399
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,940
you should really come
because I might get lost.

400
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,693
I rented a car

401
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:49,864
so you'll be comfortable when you join me.

402
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:57,204
I contacted some Filipinos in Japan

403
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,539
on Facebook.

404
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,333
They know where my mom is.

405
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,295
You've found her?

406
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:09,049
If the address they gave is correct.

407
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,384
That's great.

408
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,677
What are you waiting for?

409
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,429
Go there already.

410
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:16,098
So you'll come with me?

411
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:18,893
Okay.

412
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:24,148
Your dad must be happy,
wherever he is now.

413
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,484
Are you excited?

414
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,155
Ren?

415
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,201
Sorry, I didn't hear you.

416
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:40,539
I said your dad must be really happy now

417
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,417
because finally

418
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:49,840
his letter will reach the woman
he waited for until his last breath.

419
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:53,052
You dad is so romantic.

420
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:55,221
Are you also a romantic like him?

421
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:58,015
Is there a woman you'll wait for

422
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:00,142
until your last breath?

423
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,231
No one.

424
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:17,034
I mean, no woman
has ever made me feel so deeply.

425
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:21,747
Not even one?

426
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:28,045
My second girlfriend…

427
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,465
It started great

428
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:34,176
but quickly fell apart.

429
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:38,973
My fourth lasted two years.

430
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,225
My third…

431
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:42,518
It lasted three years

432
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:44,395
but still had the same ending.

433
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:49,024
You lasted for three years,

434
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:53,862
but you never thought of her as a woman

435
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,781
you'd wait for in your deathbed?

436
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:11,380
Mayumi's restaurant is amazing.

437
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:14,341
Is it made of magic wood?

438
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,467
Come to think of it,

439
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,469
the tsunami wiped everything out,

440
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:20,014
but her restaurant stood firm.

441
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:23,058
A miracle, right?

442
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,186
Yes, a miracle.

443
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,527
We're almost there.

444
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:46,874
TAKATA MATSUBARA MEMORIAL PARK
FOR THE TSUNAMI DISASTER

445
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,168
What are we doing here?

446
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,712
It's my first time here.

447
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:54,923
Really?

448
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,677
I just want to take a look.

449
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,471
It's on the way anyway.

450
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:08,812
We could've visited this
after we met your mom.

451
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,949
Have you been here before the tsunami?

452
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:26,288
There were 70,000 pine trees here?

453
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:32,086
This used to be a pine grove.

454
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,921
I remember before,

455
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,759
Mayumi and I couldn't stop
taking pictures here.

456
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:43,889
Seventy thousand,
but only this one remained.

457
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:46,725
I recall, this also died,

458
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:48,602
survived for a while,

459
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,687
but also perished.

460
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:54,608
The locals just preserved it.

461
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:59,071
Sorry, I speak like a tour guide,

462
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:01,115
when you're the one who lives here.

463
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,327
This is the first time
I've seen this, too.

464
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:06,537
Really?

465
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:12,251
I was caught in the water.

466
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:19,633
It was a miracle
that I was able to reach the surface.

467
00:45:19,716 --> 00:45:24,638
I searched for something
I could grab onto.

468
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:31,687
Then I saw a clothes drawer
floating towards me and I climbed onto it.

469
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:35,691
I survived

470
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:43,782
but I saw people
being swept away around me.

471
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:50,497
I still see them every night.

472
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:14,897
Are you okay?

473
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:19,902
I should be the one apologizing.

474
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:25,407
This is just a museum to me,
but you went through it all.

475
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:27,951
Let's go.

476
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:49,097
Did they give you the address?

477
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:54,061
I think this is it.

478
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:58,732
I'll stay here.

479
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,317
I'll wait for you here.

480
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:35,269
What happened?

481
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:37,145
No one's answering.

482
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:39,106
No, maybe she just went out.

483
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:40,732
Come on, let's go.

484
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:41,733
What?

485
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:43,026
Let's wait for her.

486
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:47,573
Let's go.

487
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:48,615
Hey.

488
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:56,331
Ren!

489
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:01,503
You know, we were already there.

490
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:03,338
You didn't even wait.

491
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,841
It's your chance to see your mom,

492
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:10,053
and instead of hurrying,
you went on a stopover.

493
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:12,806
When you arrived,
not five minutes had gone by,

494
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:14,558
and you already left.

495
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:16,393
I don't understand.

496
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:18,687
This is not what I wanted to wear

497
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:21,398
for our reunion video.

498
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:23,900
It might go viral online,
I don't want that.

499
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:26,778
Are you serious?
You can still crack jokes?

500
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:30,657
Stop the car.

501
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:31,742
What?

502
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,660
Stop the car.

503
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:54,014
Do you want to know?

504
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:59,102
While we were on our way,

505
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:01,396
my chest kept getting tighter and tighter.

506
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,068
When no one answered,

507
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:07,694
that's when I calmed down.

508
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:11,615
Because I can't.

509
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,035
I don't want to.

510
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:18,372
Ren, do you know why I'm helping you?

511
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:22,459
Because I don't want you
to experience what I did.

512
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:24,920
Yours can still have an ending,

513
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:26,963
you can still find her.

514
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:32,678
If I'd been given a chance
to have closure like yours,

515
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:34,846
I wouldn't waste that.

516
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,848
Ren, you are lucky.

517
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:38,767
Don't you see that?

518
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,644
You call that luck?

519
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:45,857
I have to face the person who left us.

520
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,697
All the questions I kept
my whole life

521
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,241
are making noise in my mind again.

522
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:57,536
That's why you won't face her
like you did before?

523
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:01,331
Because you don't want to be like your dad

524
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:05,460
who waited and did everything for nothing?

525
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:09,047
Ren, until when?

526
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:12,217
Until when will you try to escape it?

527
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,761
Don't talk like you know me,

528
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,596
you don't know me.

529
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:18,849
You're right.

530
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:23,729
I also don't know what I'm doing here.

531
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:51,923
What are we going to do?

532
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:09,983
What's happening?

533
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:11,151
It happened suddenly.

534
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,069
I don't know what's happening.

535
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:15,363
I don't know why it's like that.

536
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,033
What's even worse,

537
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:20,577
Eiko left and never came back.

538
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:23,413
That's why only Kaito and I
are fixing this.

539
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:26,082
I don't know if Kaito can fix it.

540
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:31,296
Wait.

541
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:38,678
Mayumi,

542
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:43,433
I went to Rikuzentakata.

543
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:50,690
They built a museum there

544
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:54,319
to commemorate the tsunami.

545
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:59,032
Then there's a lone tree that survived,

546
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:01,368
which they preserved

547
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:04,079
to be a reminder of what happened.

548
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,417
How come I didn't know that, Mayumi?

549
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:13,463
Why did I see and hear about it just now?

550
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:14,881
Before,

551
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:18,301
it was like I was in a different world.

552
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:21,638
It seemed like a lot happened

553
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:23,849
and I didn't know everything.

554
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:25,517
It's like everyone has moved on,

555
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,435
and I'm still stuck.

556
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:29,521
Kaito.

557
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,565
Be careful!

558
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:44,786
Can you fix it?

559
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:55,922
Let's check the toilet later, okay?

560
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:07,309
I'm sorry about what I said.

561
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:09,519
I shouldn't have said that.

562
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:11,563
We just met.

563
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:16,693
Hannah, you're right

564
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,488
about everything you said.

565
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:25,577
My last relationship
went on for three years.

566
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:29,998
It came to a point where
she was expecting a wedding.

567
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:34,419
When I felt that, I broke up with her.

568
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:41,301
I told her we couldn't get married
because we were too different.

569
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:44,095
We always fought.

570
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:49,184
But after what you said,
I realized you're right.

571
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:53,939
I was scared of settling down because…

572
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:57,859
I might have the same fate as my dad.

573
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,989
It sounds immature

574
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:08,286
compared to what you and Emil had.

575
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:17,253
I hope you find your mom.

576
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:21,716
Hannah.

577
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,468
Sorry, did I say something wrong?

578
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:27,889
Ren, can you please stop?

579
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:34,437
Don't say I'm mature
or paint me as a saint.

580
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:40,652
You're also telling me not to feel guilty
that Emil died and I lived?

581
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:46,074
That's far from what really happened.

582
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:05,719
When I had to help my siblings
finish their studies,

583
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,473
Emil accepted that.

584
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:13,143
He waited for me.

585
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:16,771
In 2011,

586
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:21,026
when my sibling graduated,

587
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:24,571
I was ready to get married.

588
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:29,993
That's why he came here.

589
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:32,454
He surprised me.

590
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:36,374
I've waited so long,

591
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:37,709
to have you all to myself.

592
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:41,087
We can be together now, Hannah.

593
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,506
We can start a family now.

594
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:48,178
But, Emil, how about my job here?

595
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,639
Your youngest sibling graduated.

596
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:55,310
I'll take care of us in Singapore.

597
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:59,981
Just think about our future children.

598
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,942
That was really the plan.

599
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:07,322
But when I heard from Emil

600
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:12,494
what his plans for us were,

601
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,914
I realized I couldn't do it.

602
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:24,297
All my life,
I'd been responsible for my siblings,

603
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:27,842
for my family, for everyone.

604
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:33,807
I hadn't truly lived for myself.

605
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:37,435
For once, that's what I wanted.

606
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:42,440
I fell in love with teaching in Japan.

607
00:56:43,399 --> 00:56:45,610
That's why I needed more time,

608
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:48,363
for him to wait.

609
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:51,991
He wanted me to say yes right away.

610
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,868
Emil!

611
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:57,831
But I couldn't do it.

612
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:04,504
On the day of the tsunami,

613
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:07,966
Emil and I met

614
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:17,100
Because I wanted him to understand

615
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:21,062
that even though I said no to marriage,

616
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:25,567
I didn't want him out of my life.

617
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:35,118
I still wanted him to be a part of my life

618
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:37,078
because he was my best friend.

619
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:41,875
He was supposed to leave then,

620
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:45,795
but I asked him to stay.

621
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:50,300
I begged him not to leave.

622
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:53,887
Emil!

623
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:04,355
It's my fault.

624
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,693
Because of me, Emil died.

625
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:16,367
He died angry and hurt
because of my selfishness.

626
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:27,921
That's why I must not
stop searching for him,

627
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:30,924
because I don't have the right.

628
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:58,117
Okay.

629
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:03,373
How do you say,
"Thank you for accompanying me."

630
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:17,887
Thank you for accompanying me.

631
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:30,733
I give up, teacher.

632
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:35,363
You know,
you should join my English class.

633
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:41,995
My students get embarrassed
when they make mistakes.

634
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:48,459
But I tell them that's normal
when learning a new language.

635
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:03,933
You should smile more.

636
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:05,351
It suits you.

637
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:12,233
Thank you.

638
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:15,903
You know…

639
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:22,327
I'm scared of opening up
to people about what happened

640
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:24,078
to Emil and I.

641
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:29,667
I don't want them to blame me

642
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:32,128
like how I blame myself.

643
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:35,089
But now that I was able to tell you,

644
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:38,176
I feel relieved.

645
01:00:40,553 --> 01:00:43,181
I haven't felt this way in a long time.

646
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:45,850
Why thank me when I haven't done anything?

647
01:00:49,103 --> 01:00:51,105
Because you're here…

648
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,108
listening.

649
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:57,904
It means a lot.

650
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:31,562
Ren, my life still needs a lot of fixing.

651
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:33,856
I understand.

652
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:37,944
I shouldn't have done that.

653
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:48,830
We can still be friends, right?

654
01:02:36,669 --> 01:02:38,129
Hello, Emil?

655
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:46,220
Sorry I'm only just now calling.

656
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:51,225
I was shattered.

657
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:53,686
I was a coward.

658
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:59,108
The last time we met,

659
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:01,903
you were so mad,

660
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:04,739
you told me
you didn't want to see me anymore.

661
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,911
I looked for you, Emil.

662
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:15,792
So even that I would have done for you.

663
01:03:18,711 --> 01:03:21,088
That maybe when I find you,

664
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:24,550
you'll be able to forgive me.

665
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:32,809
Emil, it feels like I've been carrying

666
01:03:33,768 --> 01:03:37,563
a huge weight for so long.

667
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:44,028
I think I'm finally ready to let it go.

668
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:50,827
I want to live again,

669
01:03:52,286 --> 01:03:55,122
and I'm ready for possibilities.

670
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:01,170
But can I do that?

671
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:06,342
Can I embrace that?

672
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:13,558
Or will it make it harder for you
to forgive me?

673
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:49,886
Ren. Son.

674
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:51,554
Have some tea.

675
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:30,092
Before Dad died,

676
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:36,098
he asked me to give this to you.

677
01:05:40,394 --> 01:05:41,979
That's why I searched for you.

678
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:52,073
He waited for you until the end.

679
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:56,327
I didn't ask him that.

680
01:05:58,537 --> 01:06:00,581
But still, that's what he did.

681
01:06:05,002 --> 01:06:06,629
I'll go ahead.

682
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:11,717
I tried contacting you

683
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:17,390
but my life became complicated.

684
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:25,231
I never planned on looking for you

685
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:31,654
because I thought
I didn't want to see you.

686
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:36,117
Or…

687
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:42,039
because I wouldn't believe
anything you would say.

688
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:49,380
But I was wrong.

689
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:53,884
Because the truth is,

690
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:57,138
I don't want to face you

691
01:06:57,221 --> 01:06:59,598
because I'll be reminded
of how much we're alike.

692
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:04,729
Dad…

693
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:12,194
poured his heart out to you.

694
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:19,910
He didn't care even when he was hurting.

695
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:25,750
But you ran away.

696
01:07:31,922 --> 01:07:36,010
Those are the two kinds of people
in a relationship.

697
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:41,932
Dad and I are different,
so I'm more like you.

698
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:50,649
I can't wait and love
the way Dad did for you.

699
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:55,321
But I don't see it that way now.

700
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,658
Maybe I'm wrong.

701
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:05,915
It's funny I realized all this

702
01:08:05,998 --> 01:08:07,792
because I was looking for you.

703
01:08:09,376 --> 01:08:10,711
You're right.

704
01:08:12,713 --> 01:08:17,676
No explanation will be enough

705
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,513
for you to understand what I did.

706
01:08:24,308 --> 01:08:27,478
It's good you found me.

707
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:30,815
I searched for you first in Otsuchi.

708
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:35,361
A Filipina helped me.

709
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:36,445
A teacher.

710
01:08:38,405 --> 01:08:40,825
We also know someone from there.

711
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:43,536
She died during the tsunami.

712
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:45,496
She was my daughter's teacher.

713
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,373
Hannah.

714
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:48,666
Hannah Sarmiento.

715
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:51,877
You might be mistaken.

716
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:53,796
No.

717
01:08:53,879 --> 01:08:55,714
I can't be wrong.

718
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:56,924
- Look.
- You're wrong.

719
01:08:57,007 --> 01:08:58,551
No, my son. Look at this.

720
01:09:01,011 --> 01:09:04,098
She and her fiancé are tsunami victims.

721
01:09:05,266 --> 01:09:09,103
The guy survived, but she didn't.

722
01:09:10,354 --> 01:09:12,064
It was sad.

723
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:14,859
She and another Filipina died.

724
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:19,029
The other one
is a restaurant owner in Otsuchi.

725
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:27,746
Fuck, I don't know what I'm gonna do here!

726
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,290
Hannah!

727
01:09:29,373 --> 01:09:30,749
Mayumi!

728
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:31,792
Look!

729
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:33,294
What should I do?

730
01:09:33,377 --> 01:09:36,130
Look! Call Kaito!

731
01:09:36,213 --> 01:09:37,339
Hurry!

732
01:09:39,758 --> 01:09:41,260
Kaito?

733
01:09:41,343 --> 01:09:42,595
Kaito?

734
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:46,765
Kaito, will you help us in the bathroom?

735
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:49,435
Kaito?

736
01:09:50,477 --> 01:09:51,604
Kaito?

737
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:07,870
Mayumi!

738
01:10:12,958 --> 01:10:14,418
Mayumi!

739
01:10:25,596 --> 01:10:27,681
Mayumi!

740
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:28,641
Let's go!

741
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:56,752
Mayumi.

742
01:10:57,336 --> 01:10:58,629
It's Emil.

743
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:02,216
Maybe he's the reason
why all this is happening.

744
01:11:04,885 --> 01:11:07,638
I finally called him.

745
01:11:09,014 --> 01:11:11,976
I told him I'm ready to move on.

746
01:11:14,311 --> 01:11:16,814
But maybe Mayumi doesn't want me to.

747
01:11:17,648 --> 01:11:18,983
That's not true.

748
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:21,485
Emil can't do that to you.

749
01:11:21,568 --> 01:11:22,736
You know that.

750
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:57,896
Ren!

751
01:12:00,024 --> 01:12:01,150
Ren.

752
01:12:02,026 --> 01:12:05,112
Last night,
I called Emil on the wind phone.

753
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,073
What happened?

754
01:12:09,116 --> 01:12:11,285
It happened so fast.

755
01:12:11,368 --> 01:12:14,246
Water was coming out of the bathroom.

756
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:17,708
It was like water from the tsunami.

757
01:12:17,791 --> 01:12:21,712
The walls and floors were cracked.

758
01:12:25,466 --> 01:12:27,926
Don't you believe me?

759
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:29,970
Mayumi was there.

760
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:31,847
She saw everything.

761
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:34,975
Ren, I feel like I'm close
to finding Emil,

762
01:12:35,059 --> 01:12:38,020
here where I last talked to him.

763
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:45,027
Hannah, how did you get out of the water?

764
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:49,490
I don't know.

765
01:12:49,573 --> 01:12:51,533
You said you were washed away.

766
01:12:56,288 --> 01:12:58,624
You said you remember being underwater

767
01:12:58,707 --> 01:13:00,709
until you were able to breathe.

768
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:02,753
But how did you get out of the water?

769
01:13:02,836 --> 01:13:04,755
I said I can't remember.

770
01:13:04,838 --> 01:13:06,131
Why?

771
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:07,841
I don't know.

772
01:13:07,925 --> 01:13:11,887
I already told you,
I remember being underwater,

773
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:14,014
then I searched for Emil

774
01:13:14,098 --> 01:13:15,849
at the evacuation center.

775
01:13:15,933 --> 01:13:16,975
Hannah.

776
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:18,060
Please…

777
01:13:18,143 --> 01:13:19,520
Please stop.

778
01:13:19,603 --> 01:13:21,563
Can't you just believe me?

779
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:24,608
Hannah, Emil didn't die.

780
01:13:24,691 --> 01:13:26,360
I was able to talk to him.

781
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:34,159
Like you, he was washed away,

782
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:36,745
but he was able to hold onto something,

783
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:40,249
survived, and was brought to the hospital.

784
01:13:40,332 --> 01:13:42,209
He tried looking for you.

785
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:44,920
Why wouldn't he find me?

786
01:13:45,712 --> 01:13:47,089
I'm here.

787
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:50,592
I did what you told me.

788
01:13:53,011 --> 01:13:54,596
I went to my mom.

789
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:01,311
That's where I learned the truth.

790
01:14:02,146 --> 01:14:03,355
Thanks again.

791
01:14:04,481 --> 01:14:05,315
Get in.

792
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:11,738
Ghost.

793
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:15,826
Ghost!

794
01:14:21,373 --> 01:14:22,499
There's no one there.

795
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:40,184
Hannah, you're dead.

796
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:41,685
That's not true.

797
01:14:42,394 --> 01:14:44,855
I told you earlier

798
01:14:44,938 --> 01:14:46,899
that I was able to get out of the water.

799
01:14:46,982 --> 01:14:50,068
and I looked for Emil
at the evacuation center.

800
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:51,904
What are you talking about?

801
01:14:51,987 --> 01:14:55,282
He tried to save you,
but he didn't find you.

802
01:14:58,744 --> 01:15:00,037
Hannah?

803
01:15:11,632 --> 01:15:14,551
SUPPLIES RECEIVED TODAY: RICE, WATER,
BLANKETS PEOPLE HERE:

804
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:24,102
As of now you're on the missing list.

805
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:30,776
Mayumi is also gone.

806
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:33,529
I saw her grave.

807
01:15:36,073 --> 01:15:37,950
She was buried here.

808
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:40,452
The restaurant is still there, right?

809
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:42,329
You saw that.

810
01:15:42,412 --> 01:15:44,039
You saw the restaurant.

811
01:15:44,122 --> 01:15:45,666
You went inside it, Ren!

812
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:48,210
Aren't you wondering?

813
01:15:50,879 --> 01:15:54,091
I can only see the restaurant
when we're together,

814
01:15:56,176 --> 01:15:58,595
because nothing is left there, Hannah.

815
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:00,722
There's nothing.

816
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:04,726
Also…

817
01:16:05,644 --> 01:16:07,688
when you go to work,
when you teach,

818
01:16:07,771 --> 01:16:10,065
do you really remember doing that?

819
01:16:11,358 --> 01:16:12,568
Your watch…

820
01:16:13,485 --> 01:16:15,487
is stuck at 3:20.

821
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:18,615
That's the time the tsunami hit.

822
01:16:18,699 --> 01:16:21,660
But, but why are we here?

823
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:23,370
Why can you talk to me?

824
01:16:23,453 --> 01:16:26,123
Why can you see me?

825
01:16:26,206 --> 01:16:27,416
I have no idea.

826
01:16:27,499 --> 01:16:28,667
Because you're wrong.

827
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:30,669
I'm not dead.

828
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:32,254
I'm still alive!

829
01:17:04,244 --> 01:17:07,664
MAYUMI TAKAMOTO
DIED: MARCH 11, 2011

830
01:17:15,088 --> 01:17:16,548
Mayumi.

831
01:18:25,117 --> 01:18:28,245
Are you okay?

832
01:18:30,831 --> 01:18:35,627
You'll be fine.

833
01:18:37,504 --> 01:18:39,798
It's been a long time now.

834
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:37,392
Can you really hear me,

835
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:39,603
Hannah?

836
01:21:44,608 --> 01:21:46,484
They said yes.

837
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:50,363
Ren called me.

838
01:21:51,072 --> 01:21:53,450
He said you're looking for me.

839
01:21:55,452 --> 01:21:57,203
On that day,

840
01:21:57,287 --> 01:21:59,289
while in the water,

841
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:04,961
I tried grabbing your hand.

842
01:22:06,546 --> 01:22:09,215
I tried to save you.

843
01:22:12,218 --> 01:22:14,012
I hope you know

844
01:22:16,348 --> 01:22:18,850
that later I searched for you.

845
01:22:29,319 --> 01:22:30,445
Hannah?

846
01:22:32,238 --> 01:22:33,490
Hannah!

847
01:22:45,502 --> 01:22:49,798
It took long time before I gave up,

848
01:22:51,257 --> 01:22:52,258
Hannah.

849
01:22:54,219 --> 01:22:56,262
But I hope you understand

850
01:22:58,306 --> 01:23:02,394
that months and years have passed.

851
01:23:09,067 --> 01:23:10,819
I have a family now…

852
01:23:13,905 --> 01:23:15,490
that I love so much.

853
01:23:19,202 --> 01:23:23,832
But there are also days
when I still think of you.

854
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:32,215
Wherever you are,

855
01:23:35,969 --> 01:23:37,971
I hope you're happy.

856
01:23:38,722 --> 01:23:40,765
You'll always be in my heart.

857
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:45,020
Goodbye, Hannah.

858
01:25:01,721 --> 01:25:03,515
I went to Yamato.

859
01:25:06,851 --> 01:25:09,938
You know, he should be haunted.

860
01:25:16,277 --> 01:25:19,364
He said you weren't ready for the truth.

861
01:25:22,909 --> 01:25:24,911
You know, it's amazing

862
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:33,586
how we only see the things we want to see.

863
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:36,548
Those who were with us

864
01:25:37,882 --> 01:25:40,051
learned about the truth early on.

865
01:25:43,429 --> 01:25:46,015
I didn't want to believe then.

866
01:25:49,561 --> 01:25:52,689
That's why I only saw
what I wanted to believe in.

867
01:25:54,107 --> 01:25:55,233
Emil.

868
01:25:57,026 --> 01:25:59,529
You know, he called me

869
01:25:59,612 --> 01:26:01,906
on the wind phone.

870
01:26:02,657 --> 01:26:04,159
I heard him.

871
01:26:07,078 --> 01:26:09,122
It's really working.

872
01:26:10,373 --> 01:26:12,333
Tell everyone about it.

873
01:26:17,797 --> 01:26:19,674
Can you tell Emil

874
01:26:19,757 --> 01:26:22,135
I'm happy he has a family now?

875
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:25,555
That his dream came true.

876
01:26:27,348 --> 01:26:30,018
That's what I want for him.

877
01:26:31,811 --> 01:26:33,271
I'll do that.

878
01:26:36,107 --> 01:26:39,194
Ren, do you regret meeting me?

879
01:26:48,995 --> 01:26:50,872
According to Yamato,

880
01:26:53,374 --> 01:26:57,670
I met you because you needed me,

881
01:26:58,963 --> 01:27:00,506
and I needed you.

882
01:27:03,843 --> 01:27:05,595
I went to your school.

883
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:10,433
I met your co-teachers.

884
01:27:13,144 --> 01:27:15,104
I saw your picture there.

885
01:27:18,566 --> 01:27:20,777
You were always smiling, Hannah.

886
01:27:23,738 --> 01:27:27,784
You should have no regrets
because I know you were happy.

887
01:27:32,288 --> 01:27:33,915
Join them now.

888
01:27:36,542 --> 01:27:37,961
I'm sure

889
01:27:40,338 --> 01:27:42,590
I'll be happy wherever you go.

890
01:27:46,010 --> 01:27:48,304
Thank you, Ren.

891
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:54,936
Because of you, I felt like I was alive.

892
01:27:56,354 --> 01:27:57,939
Thank you, too.

893
01:28:00,024 --> 01:28:03,361
Because you made me understand
that real love

894
01:28:04,654 --> 01:28:06,572
is setting someone free.

895
01:28:10,076 --> 01:28:11,703
Rest now.

896
01:28:13,246 --> 01:28:15,915
Ren, I hope you learn from my story.

897
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:20,586
Live and love.

898
01:28:21,629 --> 01:28:27,218
Someday, the right person will come,

899
01:28:28,344 --> 01:28:32,640
because I know you have
so much love in your heart.

900
01:30:22,333 --> 01:30:23,960
How are you?

901
01:30:24,710 --> 01:30:26,212
Well, I…

902
01:30:28,339 --> 01:30:31,425
When I came to Manila,

903
01:30:31,509 --> 01:30:35,054
Mom called and asked me to move to Japan.

904
01:30:36,806 --> 01:30:38,808
That's why I'm here again.

905
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:43,146
I know it's peaceful wherever you are.

906
01:30:46,607 --> 01:30:50,153
I shouldn't be calling you,
I might just disturb you.

907
01:30:52,947 --> 01:30:54,824
I just miss you.

908
01:31:01,330 --> 01:31:03,833
There's something I failed to tell you.

909
01:31:06,377 --> 01:31:11,090
You asked me about the person
I'd wait for until my last breath.

910
01:31:14,135 --> 01:31:15,761
I told you no one.

911
01:31:23,519 --> 01:31:25,855
But the truth is it's you, Hannah.

912
01:31:32,653 --> 01:31:34,780
If we will be given a chance,

913
01:31:34,864 --> 01:31:36,699
I know that it's you.

914
01:31:40,328 --> 01:31:44,165
I wish the wind
carries all my love for you.

915
01:31:48,294 --> 01:31:51,214
If only it's possible
for you to call me, too, right?
