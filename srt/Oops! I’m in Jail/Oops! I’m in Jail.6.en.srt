00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Hello, Chief.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,120
Hello, Chief.

3
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:21,750
Hello, Chief.

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:22,520
Chief.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,500
Chief.

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,300
Hello, Chief.

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,180
How's everything?

8
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:30,870
Good?

9
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,280
Yeah, good.

10
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:34,870
Good?

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,870
Sleeping?

12
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:44,760
Get up now.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,620
What's going on?

14
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,870
-Why did the Chief suddenly come?
-How would I know?

15
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,370
Everyone else is working.
What are you doing?

16
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:49,370
The Chief comes in and lashes out at him.

17
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:50,120
Hurry up.

18
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,700
Ever since Chief Hu got flagged by
the higher-ups because of Assistant Chen,

19
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,960
he's been nitpicking about everything.

20
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:57,630
What?

21
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,530
Doing it with such an attitude?

22
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:00,750
Then don't do it.

23
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,950
If you don't do it, you just lose points.

24
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:05,970
And losing points just means
you can't get out.

25
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,010
Inmate 5514, sit down!

26
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,289
Con-Continue your work. Don't look.

27
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,250
What?

28
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,500
You wanna hit me?

29
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,060
Go on then, hit me.

30
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,020
All inmates, squat down!

31
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,610
Inmate 5514, calm down!

32
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:23,620
What are you saying?

33
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,750
What the hell are you saying?

34
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,620
That's enough!

35
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,100
What the hell are you saying?

36
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,010
Jiajun, push him aside!

37
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,370
Calm down!

38
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,870
Calm down!

39
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,250
Calm down!

40
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,539
I didn't push you!

41
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:38,370
What the hell are you saying?

42
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,370
Calm down! Step back!

43
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,750
Step back!

44
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,210
Keep running your mouth!
Keep talking, huh?

45
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:45,370
Put that down.

46
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,000
Director!

47
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,200
Director, go away!

48
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:47,750
Go away!

49
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:48,750
Come out!

50
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,620
Come out here!

51
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,000
Director Xiao, move aside!

52
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,250
Keep running your mouth, huh?

53
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,450
Keep running your mouth! Come out here!

54
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:02,840
Let go of it!

55
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:04,650
Calm down!

56
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,870
Calm down!

57
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,250
Calm down.

58
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,500
Calm down.

[OOPS! I'M IN JAIL]

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,120
[Episode 6]

61
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,290
Let me ask you two—

62
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,350
what the hell were you doing just now?

63
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,300
What if he had actually stabbed me?

64
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,970
My life is precious.

65
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,870
What? You can afford to compensate me?

66
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,370
Or you? You can afford it?

67
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,530
Chief, we were trying to help.

68
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,500
Oh? You were helping?

69
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,900
If you were helping,
would I look like this?

70
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,350
Helping, huh?

71
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,370
And you? Where were you?

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,830
Chief,

73
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,500
I was standing guard at the recheck point.

74
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,750
Slacking off then!

75
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,870
Every one of you is slacking off!

76
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,290
Chief.

77
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,500
Li Chengbing is in a bad state today.

78
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,560
Something happened with his family.

79
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,120
His grandmother is having health problems.

80
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,620
So, please don't provoke him anymore.

81
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,600
You think I don't know
he's not in a good state?

82
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,240
Even so, he still shouldn't have behaved
like that!

83
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,870
What if I weren't in a good state?
Should I take leave?

84
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,870
Should everyone just ignore their duties?

85
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,870
They can ignore their duties,
but I can't, right?

86
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,800
I have to, right?

87
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,290
I don't care.

88
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,000
All of you go write
self-criticism reports.

89
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,620
Also,

90
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,810
do more physical training

91
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,730
and close combat defense drills!

92
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,930
Chief, you should join us too.

93
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,830
Didn't you see
I was already defending myself?

94
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,390
Without me defending myself,

95
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,620
could your Director Xiao

96
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,620
have subdued him that easily?

97
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,750
Could he?

98
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,370
Director Xiao!

99
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:58,900
Yes, sir.

100
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,470
Later, go check on Inmate 5514 for me

101
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,470
and... and see if his hand is broken.

102
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,260
Screw you.

103
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Who said that?

104
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,420
What?

105
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,900
Got a problem with me?

106
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:18,650
Hit me then.

107
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:21,800
Idiot.

108
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,160
What? No adults at home
to teach you manners?

109
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,570
There was clearly a report this morning

110
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,370
that Inmate 5514's mental state
was unstable.

111
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,000
All he does is run his mouth.

112
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,300
Exactly. Chief Hu did that on purpose,

113
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,500
taking his frustration out on us.

114
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,710
It has nothing to do with Zhongwen.

115
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,960
He's just embarrassed and angry.

116
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,450
He probably doesn't mean it.

117
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,180
By the way, Boss,

118
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,370
aren't you supposed to
pick up your daughter today?

119
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,000
Oh, right.

120
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,310
Shui said that Director Xiao
has been sleeping

121
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,320
in the standby room for several nights
over the past few weeks.

122
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,190
Why is that?

123
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,420
Why doesn't someone with a family
sleep at home?

124
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,540
Could you go a day
without video calling your daughter?

125
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,540
I'd go crazy.

126
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,250
Right?

127
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,480
Working so hard for a lousy supervisor

128
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,550
like Chief Hu.

129
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,580
No wonder he got divorced.

130
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:11,970
That's true.

131
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:15,320
And he has such a tough personality
and only focuses on work.

132
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,090
Living like that must be exhausting.

133
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,450
Inmate 9568 has a stomachache
and needs to go to the Health Division.

134
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,330
Zhiyao, take him there.

135
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,330
Inmate 9568, it's you again.

136
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,160
What on earth did your wife

137
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,370
put in the food

138
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,490
that made you have such bad diarrhea?

139
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,370
Was it spicy?

140
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,320
Not as spicy as you.

141
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,400
You like spicy food, huh?

142
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,370
Seriously, hurry up.

143
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,870
The medicine here doesn't work at all.

144
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,500
I was in agony last night.

145
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,140
Please help me get
an external hospital referral.

146
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,830
I'm not falling for that again.

147
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,080
Falling for what?

148
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,930
I think he really needs a proper checkup.

149
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:53,640
See?

150
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,210
Besides, my wife has
a prenatal checkup today.

151
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,520
Prenatal checkup?

152
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,500
You mean your wife is pregnant?

153
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,050
Oh, you got cheated on.

154
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What the hell are you talking about?

155
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,030
You want an ass-kicking?

156
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,950
Last time at the hospital, one shot
and you got her pregnant?

157
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,750
Two shots.

158
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:19,570
So gross.

159
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,750
How are two shots gross?

160
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,550
You hadn't even showered,
and you still did it twice.

161
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,120
What acupressure point did you just press?

162
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,320
It's very effective.

163
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,130
It works.

164
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:40,950
Tokyo?

165
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,820
Isn't that too sudden?

166
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,620
It's really a rare opportunity.

167
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,500
And it's less than five days.

168
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,370
I'll be back on the afternoon
of the fifth day.

169
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,750
It's not about how long it takes.

170
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,500
There's a ton of work
waiting for me at the facility.

171
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,250
I need to go with the social workers

172
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,210
to visit inmates' families

173
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,900
to help them rebuild family bonds.

174
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,750
Do you know how important
this is for them?

175
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,750
What "family bonds"?

176
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,250
What about your bond with Yuqi?

177
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,430
What about your bond with me?

178
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,520
I'm always the one compromising for you.

179
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,520
Last time, I got into a car accident
because I was

180
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,580
trying to work around your schedule!

181
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,560
-Why bring that up now?
-Yuqi.

182
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,870
Mom.

183
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,120
Dad's picking you up today.

184
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,350
Later, I'll be away on a business trip,

185
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,490
so you'll be with Dad.

186
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,220
You need to listen to him, okay?

187
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,870
Daddy's here! Give me a hug!

188
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,870
No.

189
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,750
Why not?

190
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:21,850
You smell!

191
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,670
You're the smelly one.
Your whole family stinks!

192
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:25,940
That includes you too.

193
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,500
And that includes you too. How's that?

194
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,320
I brought egg cakes. Want some?

195
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,500
Yes.

196
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,620
Then give me a hug.

197
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,220
If I hug you, I get all of them.

198
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,750
Okay, let Dad hug you first.

199
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,250
-Then Mom is off.
-Go away.

200
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,620
Be good for Dad.

201
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,500
Bye-bye, bye-bye.

202
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,760
-Alright. Say goodbye to Mom.
-Bye-bye.

203
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,630
Where are you going?

204
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,710
-Have some egg cakes.
-You can't have them!

205
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,240
Why are you running so fast?

206
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,660
I'll be taking a few days off.

207
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,500
Please keep an eye on Li Chengbing.

208
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,360
He hasn't been doing well lately.

209
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,000
It's important to help him
stabilize first.

210
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Okay, got it.

211
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,370
-Thank you.
-No problem.

212
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,160
Thank you.

213
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,450
Miss Fang.

214
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:03,000
Director.

215
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,560
Hello, Director.

216
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,370
What are these?

217
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,720
We're converting the education room
into a family activity space

218
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,120
so they can spend time
with their children.

219
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,370
Let me help you. Give me.

220
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,190
-I can handle it myself.
-Gao Zhiyao!

221
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,120
You don't have anything better to do?

222
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,850
Let me know if you need any help.

223
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,130
I'm heading to the education room now.

224
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:19,620
Bye-bye.

225
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,660
-Hello, Miss Fang.
-Shui.

226
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,500
Horny much?

227
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,620
Hello, Shui.

228
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,120
Attention, Custody Division staff!

229
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,930
Yes, sir.

230
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,250
The warden just approved the document

231
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,500
about this year's
permanent position openings.

232
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,430
Who wants to see?

233
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:30,920
Me.

234
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,370
Full-time position openings!

235
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,870
Let me see first.

236
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,660
Alright, here you go.

237
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:36,810
That's not what I want.

238
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,330
Log out first.

239
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,410
So what's so great about
a permanent position anyway?

240
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,370
You don't know?

241
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:44,600
Let me tell you.

242
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,500
There's a big difference
in retirement pay.

243
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,360
And the key point is job security.

244
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,620
If you're just on contract,

245
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,200
one mistake and you're done—

246
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,120
fired.

247
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,370
But if you have a permanent position,

248
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,750
unless you break the law,

249
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,750
even if your review is terrible,

250
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,250
your job is still secure.

251
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,500
That's what a rock-solid job is.

252
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,250
Do you see how good that is now?

253
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,510
If your beef stew is bad, just improve it.

254
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,250
Not beef stew—review.
The performance review.

255
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,120
I know.

256
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,120
Sounds pretty good.

257
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,870
Right?

258
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,070
Work a little harder.

259
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,770
You all have a chance.

260
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,650
We're all watching.

261
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,670
But of course,

262
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,620
I'm not the crucial one.

263
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,250
It's the Boss.

264
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:17,620
Him?

265
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,370
Don't overthink it.

266
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,500
What's meant to be yours will be yours.

267
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,870
Director, could you tell us the criteria

268
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,120
so we can prepare better?

269
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,120
The Boss is your criteria.

270
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,680
Hello, it's me.

271
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,680
What? How did that happen?

272
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,800
Okay, I'll be right there.

273
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,670
What's wrong?

274
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,040
Yuqi got into a fight.

275
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,830
Her eye is injured.

276
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:44,710
I'm going over.

277
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,540
Oh, I see. Go ahead.

278
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,090
Sorry, please watch over
things here. Sorry.

279
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,200
Boss! Drive safe!

280
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,010
Okay.

281
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,750
Watch things here for me
while I'm on leave!

282
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,620
Shui.

283
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,750
While the Director is away these few days,

284
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,000
does that mean we can arrange

285
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,120
the duty roster however we want?

286
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,620
Dream on.

287
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,260
Of course, I'll be the acting Director.

288
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,660
Let me tell you,

289
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,680
I'll be stricter than the Director.

290
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,590
All of you, stay sharp.

291
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,120
Don't screw up.

292
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,250
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

293
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,730
Everyone, back to your posts.

294
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:15,860
Do your job.

295
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,640
Don't give me trouble.

296
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,000
Then I'll go back to the dorm to sleep.

297
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:22,870
Don't give me trouble!

298
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,000
It's like this—"Don't give me trouble."

299
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You're just like him.

300
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,470
You need to sound more world-weary.

301
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,470
"Don't give me trouble." Like that?

302
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,480
Why did you hit your classmate?

303
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,230
Are you even listening when I talk to you?

304
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,870
Look at me and stand properly
when I'm talking to you!

305
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,500
I'll ask you again:

306
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,250
Why did you fight with your classmate?

307
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,310
Don't treat me like a prisoner, okay?

308
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:46,870
Go away.

309
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,000
Why are you acting like this?

310
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,860
Because I want to go buy egg cakes.

311
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,620
Zhongwen.

312
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,370
The lantern-crafting instructor
is already here.

313
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,250
Go get her.

314
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,750
Jiajun, Jiajun,

315
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,370
the lantern-crafting instructor
has been waiting for a long time.

316
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,000
Why aren't you there yet?

317
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,250
Zhiyao, Zhiyao,

318
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,620
why aren't you at the education room yet?

319
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,510
Zhongwen, did you bring
the  instructor over or not?

320
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,370
What is this? Is he drunk?

321
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,920
Shui must have forgotten what he said.

322
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,050
Check with him.

323
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,620
Shui, Shui,

324
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,000
am I supposed to go assist with security

325
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,500
or pick up
the lantern-crafting instructor?

326
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,500
You're Zhongwen?

327
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,120
Shui, I'm Zhongwen.

328
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,770
Just do as I said earlier.

329
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,210
Yes, that's why I want to
confirm with you.

330
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,750
Shui, did you just ask me

331
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,070
to go assist with security

332
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,870
or to pick up
the lantern-crafting instructor?

333
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,790
None of you were listening to what I said.

334
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,620
What the hell?

335
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,480
Or should we follow what he said just now?

336
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,120
Which "just now" exactly?

337
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,370
The point is, what did he just say?

338
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:46,900
Exactly.

339
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,660
Zhongwen, the food truck is here.

340
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,500
Hurry to the vehicle check-up point.

341
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,370
Zhiyao,

342
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,250
escort the inmates to visitation.

343
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:54,750
Jiajun,

344
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,250
there are families dropping off food.

345
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,000
Go collect it quickly. Hurry up.

346
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,750
God, Shui is yelling random orders again.

347
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,200
I seriously have no idea what he wants.

348
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,500
What's happening right now?

349
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,250
Didn't he ask me to handle visitations
and you to deliver food?

350
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,250
No, I deliver food, and he goes to
inspect the food truck.

351
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,450
No, he just asked me to
handle visitations.

352
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,730
I already have those two with me.

353
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:10,870
What other visitations
do you need to handle?

354
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,000
Ask him.

355
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,120
Are you all deaf?

356
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,250
Wasn't I clear enough?

357
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,000
Shut up! Your mind isn't clear at all.

358
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,500
No!

359
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,000
-You suck...
-Don't be angry.

360
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,600
You didn't press the button.

361
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,250
I don't dare to.

362
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,050
You do it then.

363
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,050
Copy that, Shui.

364
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,730
Sir,

365
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,330
my wife has been waiting for a long time.

366
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,100
She only took half a day off today.

367
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,520
My lawyer charges by the hour.

368
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,500
Can we speed this up?

369
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,870
Do you three want to sit down and chat?

370
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:39,870
Hurry up! Move faster, will you?

371
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,000
I'll handle visitations.

372
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,940
I'll go take care of the food truck.

373
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:42,600
I'll deliver food.

374
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,500
-Food truck. Food delivery. Visitations.
-Food truck. Food delivery. Visitations.

375
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,120
Okay, let's go.

376
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,320
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

377
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:47,620
Okay, you go first.

378
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,950
-You first!
-You first!

379
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,250
Move.

380
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,620
Who's handling the lawyer visits?

381
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,750
Why hasn't anyone delivered food
to Cell Block Benevolence II?

382
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,120
Why hasn't anyone fixed
the broken sewage pipe?

383
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,120
Stop fooling around! I'm begging you!

384
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,250
Hurry up! Move! Move faster!

385
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:07,870
Hurry up!

386
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,960
-Roger that.
-Roger that.

387
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,280
Gao Zhiyao!

388
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:19,810
What?

389
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,860
Have you scheduled
my outside hospital visit yet?

390
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,760
I-I've applied for
the outside hospital visit for you,

391
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,020
but Director Xiao happens to be on leave.

392
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,320
Get Xiao Wenqiang back here.

393
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,130
How am I supposed to do that?

394
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,390
Figure something out.

395
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,280
Alright.

396
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,620
Do you have any skin medication?

397
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,950
I'm itching like crazy.

398
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:45,910
Scabies alert!

399
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,870
Attention everyone:

400
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,510
Scabies outbreak in Cell Block Loyalty I!

401
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,420
All Custody Division staff,
please pay extra attention

402
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:53,420
and proceed with isolation
and cleaning procedures!

403
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,620
Scabies?

404
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,120
Scabies, my foot.

405
00:14:58,770 --> 00:14:59,700
Fleas bit me.

406
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,000
AIDS then?

407
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,360
Since yesterday,

408
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,870
I've been getting piles of complaints.

409
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,400
And now a scabies outbreak?

410
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,730
What on earth are you all doing?

411
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,250
Senior.

412
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,500
Please teach them properly, okay?

413
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,250
Do I need to teach you
how to train newcomers?

414
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,120
Chief,

415
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,070
I'll reflect on myself.

416
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,670
I'll keep a close eye on them.

417
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,500
Thank you.

418
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:30,580
Yes, sir.

419
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,800
Everyone who screwed up, write me reports!

420
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,530
Especially you three, Gao Zhiyao.

421
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:38,870
Don't think
that just because the Director isn't here,

422
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:39,870
you can slack off!

423
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,220
We didn't.

424
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,380
What do you mean you didn't?

425
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,310
You three cause the most problems!

426
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,120
You too, and you're a senior.

427
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,230
Senior.

428
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,620
Please train them properly, will you?

429
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,620
Yes, sir!

430
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,070
Let me tell you all,

431
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:55,850
nobody leaves

432
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,630
until everything is handled.

433
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,460
That's too hot!

434
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:03,750
I'm sorry.

435
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,120
I'm sorry.

436
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:26,530
Gao Zhiyao.

437
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,810
What are you doing?

438
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,370
Picking up money?

439
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,250
Senior.

440
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,250
How did you know?

441
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,250
I found that.

442
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,620
This is contraband.

443
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,250
It needs to be confiscated.

444
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,310
What? Trying to keep it for yourself?

445
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,710
Are you guys
doing your job properly lately?

446
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,840
Step it up, will you?

447
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,290
Director Xiao finally got some time off

448
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,370
to spend with his daughter.

449
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,120
Don't make him get called back to work

450
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,750
just because you guys can't do your jobs.

451
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,350
We're short-staffed now...

452
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,750
and Shui is really not up to the task.

453
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,870
This isn't about being short-staffed;

454
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:04,000
it's about using your heads, isn't it?

455
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,500
How about this?

456
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,369
After your shift,

457
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,859
let's meet at Mona's bar.

458
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,030
Where are all my shrimpies?

459
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,280
Gao Zhiyao.

460
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:49,750
Yes.

461
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,500
Come on.

462
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,620
Sit.

463
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,600
I'm busy. I'm disinfecting.

464
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,740
Inmate 9568's goldfish—

465
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,850
was it the "fish ball soup"
you were talking about the other day?

466
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,770
What goldfish? What fish ball soup?

467
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,860
Did you put a goldfish

468
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,750
in the fish tank in my office...

469
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,500
and let it eat all my shrimpies?

470
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,120
Senior.

471
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,120
W-What are you talking about?

472
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,320
I don't understand.

473
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,300
Did Inmate 9568 tell you to do that?

474
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,250
Senior.

475
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,250
You need evidence to accuse someone.

476
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,410
You can't just see fish

477
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,000
in Inmate 9568's cell

478
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,660
and claim he told me to do that.

479
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,710
Those were over 20 lives!

480
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,000
Do you know
how long I've been raising them?

481
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,660
Each one even had its own name!

482
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,200
You want evidence, huh?

483
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:46,870
Fine.

484
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,210
Just hope I don't find any.

485
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,620
Wait!

486
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,680
The bed hasn't been disinfected yet!

487
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,370
Let me sanitize you.

488
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,450
Let me wipe it for you.

489
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,500
That's enough.
My underwear is all wet now.

490
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,330
Come on.

491
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,220
My hands!

492
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,500
I'm sorry.

493
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,350
[Mona]

494
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,500
While Director Xiao is away these days,

495
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,100
has anyone encountered any problems?

496
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,730
I suspect Shui has a goldfish memory.

497
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,230
He often mixes things up.

498
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,370
Right. Once he mistook my voice

499
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,250
for Zhongwen's.

500
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,710
Do our voices sound alike?

501
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,750
You say it.

502
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,120
Do our voices sound alike?

503
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,250
Do our voices sound alike?

504
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,000
Do our voices sound alike?

505
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,120
-Sound alike?
-Sound alike?

506
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,220
-Not really, right?
-Not really, right?

507
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,120
Just by listening to the voices, they...

508
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,250
they do sound a bit similar.

509
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,370
No, Senior.

510
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,760
I didn't expect

511
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,470
I'd miss Director Xiao this much.

512
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,470
He's always grumpy at work—

513
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,870
but who knew he was so scared of his wife?

514
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,400
He's not afraid of his wife.

515
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:07,720
It's because he used to be
so busy with work

516
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,100
that he never had time to help
take care of their kid.

517
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,850
Then his wife got overwhelmed

518
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,260
and had a car accident.

519
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,720
She almost didn't make it.

520
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,000
He really should've sent
their kid to daycare.

521
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,580
Why push himself this hard?

522
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,160
When Director Xiao was young,

523
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,750
he spent time in juvenile detention.

524
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,810
That had a significant impact on him.

525
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,460
So what he most wants to do now

526
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,860
is help inmates reintegrate into society.

527
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,370
Stay back!

528
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:33,660
Stay away from me!

529
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,750
[Three years ago]

530
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,080
Three years ago, when I first joined
the Custody Division,

531
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,200
there was an inmate riot.

532
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,870
Get me a car!

533
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,160
Wu Mingcai, calm down.

534
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,250
I'm here to help you.

535
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,620
I'll do whatever you ask.

536
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,870
Let go of my junior.

537
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,270
I know you need a hostage.

538
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:48,120
Let me switch with him.

539
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:48,980
Xiao Wenqiang.

540
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:50,870
Xiao Wenqiang.

541
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:51,930
Take off your gear!

542
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,790
Hurry up!

543
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,750
Handcuff yourself!

544
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,070
Hurry up! Handcuff yourself!

545
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:00,870
Now!

546
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:01,500
No...

547
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,250
Tell them to put their weapons down!

548
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,120
Put them down!

549
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,120
Put them down!

550
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,170
-Hurry! Hurry!
-Wu Mingcai.

551
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,900
Let me be your hostage.
I'm here to help you.

552
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,680
I'll do whatever you want. Let him go.

553
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,500
Don't try anything!

554
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,870
Okay, take me.

555
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:21,970
Come here!

556
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:24,630
What? What do you want?

557
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,770
Stop staring! What are you up to?

558
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,080
Director Xiao has always been like that—
throwing himself into danger

559
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,280
and neglecting what's more important
to him: his family.

560
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,870
So I hope all of you here

561
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:50,530
can cover for him when needed,

562
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,510
so that he can

563
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,620
spend some quality time with his daughter.

564
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,480
Can you do that?

565
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,250
Sure.

566
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,800
Come on, perk up.

567
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,580
Let's get to today's topic.

568
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,980
"Shui's Chaos." Repeat after me.

569
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,610
-Shui's Chaos.
-Shui's Chaos.

570
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:06,610
Yes. Shui is

571
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:09,370
someone with very rigid thinking.

572
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,620
Simply put, he has a ping-pong brain.

573
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,670
Ping-pong brain?

574
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,060
He's someone with decent focus,

575
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,950
but he's very rigid.

576
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,080
It's like that.

577
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,350
You hit one ball to him,
and he hits it back.

578
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,480
That kind of person.

579
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:25,330
Exactly.

580
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:26,620
He can only handle one thing at a time.

581
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,250
If there are two things, he gets confused

582
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,250
and can't manage.

583
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,060
Shui is getting older,

584
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:34,250
so we shouldn't try to change him.

585
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,750
But all of you here are different.

586
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,010
Because your heads...

587
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,760
are completely empty.

588
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,780
Is that a compliment or an insult?

589
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,920
It's a statement of fact.

590
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:49,940
Your heads are empty,

591
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:52,570
which means there's always room
for new ideas.

592
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,920
A compliment.

593
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,070
Actually, controlling the situation
isn't hard.

594
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,570
Just think zone defense.

595
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,840
Zone defense?

596
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,250
The three of you plus Shun
make four people.

597
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,120
You four

598
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:05,110
each choose an area to cover,

599
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,730
and when someone needs backup,

600
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,120
you help and support each other.

601
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:08,870
Understand?

602
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:10,750
Go ahead.

603
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,200
Like now with the scabies outbreak,

604
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,740
I'm busy as hell
with disinfecting the cells.

605
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,850
If Shui asks me to help elsewhere...

606
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:16,620
Zhongwen, Zhongwen,

607
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,960
please go to the third gate.

608
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,870
We have VIP visitors.

609
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,000
Shui,

610
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,980
I'm nowhere near finished here.

611
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,620
Jiajun.

612
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Help cover for him?

613
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,870
Shui, I'm Zhongwen.

614
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:27,450
Sorry,

615
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:29,120
I'm not that busy right now.

616
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,880
I'll go help right away.

617
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,370
Nice, Zhongwen.

618
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,850
I'll be counting on you.

619
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,890
Thank you, Shui.

620
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,040
What if Jiajun gets swamped too?

621
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:38,870
Jiajun, Jiajun!

622
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,620
Take Inmate 8014 to see the lawyer.

623
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,370
After the meeting, go deliver the food
that other families sent.

624
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:43,870
Then go pick up
the lantern-crafting instructor.

625
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,250
Go to hell!

626
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,850
Shui, I haven't finished cleaning
the bathroom.

627
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:52,310
Zhiyao.

628
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:53,330
Help cover.

629
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,950
Senior, I'll help Jiajun.

630
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:55,830
-Oh.
-Okay.

631
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,460
I'm here!

632
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,540
Hi, you're here.

633
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,700
But remember to return to defense.

634
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,620
Go back to the post you originally chose.

635
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,370
Senior! I'm back.

636
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,750
-You okay?
-Okay.

637
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,870
Reinforce the defense.

638
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:11,730
That's all it is—just help out...

639
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,080
What if Zhiyao gets overwhelmed,

640
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,000
-and Shui asks him to...
-Just ignore Shui.

641
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:19,230
You three need to stick together.

642
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,250
Shui!

643
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,250
The recheck point is nearby.

644
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,120
I'll go restock now. I'll handle it.

645
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:24,870
Are you sure about that?

646
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,000
I've got this. Don't worry.

647
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Hey! I haven't agreed yet!

648
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:29,880
Okay.

649
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,530
Zhiyao!

650
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,250
There's a power outage
in Cell Block Harmony I.

651
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,460
Go check it out.

652
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,340
Jiajun, go deliver the food
that other families sent!

653
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,860
Zhongwen, the truck has arrived!

654
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,250
Go get it at the vehicle check-up point.

655
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,120
Shui, it's Zhiyao.
I'll take the vehicle inspection.

656
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,250
I'll deliver the food.

657
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,000
I'll handle the power outage.

658
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,620
Good. Very efficient.

659
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,790
Today, you all

660
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,870
have improved a lot.

661
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:46,720
-Yes!
-Yes!

662
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,870
-Reinforce the defense!
-Reinforce the defense!

663
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:49,500
Let's go!

664
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,380
For once,

665
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,250
we can get everything done

666
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,120
and just chill while standing guard.

667
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:01,820
Yeah.

668
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,100
Good thing Yijie helped out.

669
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:05,120
I hope the permanent position openings

670
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,380
won't get canceled because of this mess.

671
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:09,670
Hey, what are you talking about?

672
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,310
The permanent position openings.

673
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,750
Don't worry.

674
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:16,020
You'll definitely get an opening.

675
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,570
How much longer do they need to sunbathe?

676
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:22,120
They say if they sunbathe like this

677
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,160
for 49 minutes,

678
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,290
the scabies will get better.

679
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:25,610
No idea where they heard that.

680
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:27,140
The solar panels told them?

681
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:37,830
Why did you say that so loudly?

682
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:55,320
Senior.

683
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,080
What are you doing here?

684
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,430
Well, isn't there
a family day event today?

685
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,790
I figured we're short-staffed,

686
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,920
so I came to help out.

687
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,930
What about Yuqi?

688
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,500
Aren't you supposed to take care of her?

689
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,000
This morning, when I left,

690
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,910
she insisted on tagging along.

691
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:09,240
She just wanted to come.

692
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,730
Then who's looking after her now?

693
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,250
Hi!

694
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,860
-Hi, Yuqi.
-Hello.

695
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:25,750
I'm Zhiyao.

696
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,620
Zhongwen.

697
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,870
Get back and prep for your shift.

698
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:30,370
Okay.

699
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:31,870
It's my turn to babysit you now.

700
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:33,120
You're the second leg.

701
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,120
That's right.

702
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,000
I'm the most handsome second leg,
don't you think?

703
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,750
No. He's more handsome.

704
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,000
There will be a third leg coming later,

705
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,130
and you can see if he's handsome or not.

706
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:45,790
Today,

707
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,270
our facility is having a family day event.

708
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:49,620
So your dad is quite busy.

709
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,150
Yuqi, wait a little longer.

710
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:53,790
Today is very important to everyone.

711
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,070
Some inmates

712
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,000
only get to see

713
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,120
their families or children
once or twice a year.

714
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,380
Everyone is very busy.

715
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,870
Can I go inside later?

716
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,120
Your dad is working all day today.

717
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,850
He'll probably be pretty busy.

718
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,500
Yes.

719
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,290
He never lets me come here.

720
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:15,490
I begged him for so long today
before he finally agreed.

721
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:19,260
He probably thinks it's inconvenient.

722
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,620
Why? He's not even an inmate,

723
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,570
and I can't see him?

724
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:35,500
Alright.

725
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:36,450
Collect your things.

726
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:37,650
I'll take you inside.

727
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,250
Really?

728
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,060
Are you sure?

729
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:41,630
It's fine. No problem.

730
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,860
Please, take me in.

731
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,850
Okay, we'll take you.

732
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,040
Let's go.

733
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:02,410
One, two, three, go!

734
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,580
Thank you.

735
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,870
Golden Retriever.

736
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:11,620
Golden Retriever?

737
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,150
-It's big.
-I like big dogs.

738
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,720
Is that a Chihuahua on your arm?

739
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:20,050
Yuqi, don't talk to strangers.

740
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,940
He's a bad guy.

741
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,870
Am I bad?

742
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:26,670
He says you're a bad guy.

743
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,210
What bad things did you do?

744
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:29,250
A lot.

745
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,260
Wanna hear?

746
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,120
I did something bad recently too.

747
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,370
I hit my classmate.

748
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,750
How did you hit him?

749
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,830
Like this, swinging my fist,
pulling his hair like this,

750
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,290
and kicking him like this.

751
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:40,800
He made fun of me,
saying my dad is in prison.

752
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,800
Damn, what a foul mouth.

753
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,250
You swore.

754
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,790
I'm sorry.

755
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,050
Which one is your dad?

756
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:50,640
Bro, stop messing around.

757
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,500
-I can't tell you.
-Let's go in.

758
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,500
Because my dad manages
a lot of people here,

759
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,900
and many people hate him.

760
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,250
You're...

761
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,840
Xiao Wenqiang's daughter?

762
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,120
What else did your little brother make?

763
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,750
This one?

764
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,500
So cute.

765
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,130
Senior.

766
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:16,970
Director.

767
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,910
Zhiyao, what are you doing here?

768
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,140
What are you doing here?

769
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:20,940
Where is Yuqi?

770
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,250
Yuqi, your dad's here!

771
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,620
Dad!

772
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:26,990
Are you crazy?

773
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:30,260
Why did you bring my daughter
to the custody area?

774
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:36,210
Who's in charge of the third gate today?

775
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:37,010
Shun.

776
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:38,730
I told him she's your daughter,

777
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:39,730
so he let us in.

778
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,560
He'll be disciplined for this.

779
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,470
Director, this was my idea.

780
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,160
It has nothing to do with Shun.

781
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:47,250
Didn't you say we should help him?

782
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:47,870
"Help?"

783
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,040
That was supposed to be outside
the third gate.

784
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,160
What were you thinking?

785
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,000
This is the most direct way

786
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,660
for Yuqi to understand
what her father does.

787
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,290
Rules are rules.

788
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:54,370
She shouldn't have come in.

789
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:56,750
Do you still not understand?

790
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:58,830
What the hell are you doing?

791
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,160
It's fine, Director.

792
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,310
Yuqi is here now. It's okay.

793
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,340
Who told you it's okay?

794
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,200
Director Xiao!

795
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:07,090
Could you please
keep your voice down here?

796
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,200
Yuqi just wants to understand your job.

797
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,280
She wants to spend time with you.

798
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,240
I'm begging you all—

799
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,730
stop interfering in my life, okay?

800
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:23,090
Don't cause me trouble.

801
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:23,620
Let's go.

802
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:26,020
I don't want to go.

803
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:28,250
Yuqi.

804
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,070
It's not safe for you here.

805
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:32,620
How can it not be safe when you're here?

806
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,220
All the uncles here are really nice.

807
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:38,870
What uncle?

808
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,620
There was a handsome uncle
over there just now.

809
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:44,120
He told me what your job is.

810
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:50,820
What did he say?

811
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:53,370
We're locked up here

812
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:55,500
because we made mistakes.

813
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:59,620
But people outside think we're bad,

814
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,620
so they've given up on us.

815
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:04,790
He works very hard.

816
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,370
He spends a lot of time making sure

817
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:10,230
that those of us who made mistakes

818
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,240
are properly taken care of.

819
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,370
Zhang Zixu!

820
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,400
Chief, I trust Zhongwen.

821
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,950
My dad says

822
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:24,370
people in prison did something wrong,

823
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:26,870
and that's why they're here
to reflect on their actions.

824
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:27,790
Reflect?

825
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:30,370
Yes, that's what my dad says.

826
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,780
We're reflecting properly.

827
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,500
Are you really a bad guy?

828
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,900
I think you're a good guy.

829
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:42,490
I think I'm a good guy too.

830
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,750
Good guy.

831
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,820
Let me show you something.

832
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,580
A lollipop.

833
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:52,870
Here.

834
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:57,620
My dad says I shouldn't take things
from strangers.

835
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,190
What's your name?

836
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,850
Xiao Yuqi.

837
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,000
I'm Zhang Longji.

838
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,500
Nice to meet you. We're friends now.

839
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,780
If your classmates bully you again,

840
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,870
just say my name.

841
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:11,490
Here.

842
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,430
Thank you.

843
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,870
I just wanted to come in and see

844
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:19,050
if your job is

845
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,000
exactly as I imagined.

846
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,540
So next time when they make fun of me,

847
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,670
I can tell them.

848
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,000
What do they make fun of you about?

849
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,030
They say that you're in prison.

850
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,870
They all say that?

851
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,040
Because Mom always says

852
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,310
working in a prison

853
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:34,730
is basically serving a sentence yourself.

854
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,550
So that's why you fought with them?

855
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,250
Okay.

856
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,750
Now you understand.

857
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,650
From now on, just explain it
to them properly.

858
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,580
Don't fight with them, alright?

859
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,320
Dad, can I come visit you often?

860
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,740
I want to make you happier.

861
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,670
Dad, damn.

862
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,050
Hold on, hold on.

863
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:11,950
What did you just say?

864
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:13,870
Zhang Longji just told me...

865
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,690
"Damn" isn't a swear word.

866
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,370
It's just a way

867
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,970
to say "You've worked hard."

868
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:27,770
Dad, you've worked hard.

869
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:55,250
Here, Boss.

870
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,260
Make your selection.

871
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:01,440
Come on.

872
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,370
How am I supposed to choose?

873
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:11,750
This one then.

874
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,500
Have them gather around.

875
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,270
Zhiyao, Zhongwen, Jiajun,

876
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:18,170
gather around!

877
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:20,170
Boss has something to announce.

878
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:24,030
You've all been working here
for a while now.

879
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,730
We've seen your performance.

880
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:28,750
There's only
one permanent position opening.

881
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,080
We still have to choose.

882
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,719
-Now, we're announcing who won this spot.
-Definitely you.

883
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:33,389
Shui, please make the announcement.

884
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:34,639
I'll announce it now.

885
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:37,540
And the winner is...

886
00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:42,040
Gao Zhiyao!

887
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,699
Congratulations, congratulations.

888
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:46,449
Seriously?

889
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,449
Director, why me?

890
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:50,620
Actually, all three of you
have been doing very well.

891
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,739
But we still had to make a decision.

892
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:54,679
That's all there is to it.

893
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:55,340
Don't worry.

894
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,739
More openings will come.

895
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,360
You all have worked hard lately.

896
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,230
Drinks on me!

897
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,660
-Thank you, Boss!
-Thank you, Boss!

898
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,520
Maybe if I take a few more days off,

899
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,960
Shui might retire before I get back.

900
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,610
No way, I still have four years left.

901
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:08,610
I'm only 59.

902
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,610
Have a soda. Here.

903
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,300
Shun, how much longer for you?

904
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:15,120
Zhiyao,

905
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,310
congratulations.

906
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,120
Does... Does he mean it?

907
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,120
It looks fake.

908
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,060
That's what you get for being so nosy.

909
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,590
Feels good, right?

910
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,250
Yes, it does.

911
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,310
Come to work for me tomorrow.

912
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,380
I'm an old man.

913
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,720
My arms get sore too.

914
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:52,370
What's wrong? You seem troubled.

915
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,980
I'm worried about your expansion project.

916
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:00,370
Well,

917
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,680
I'll supervise

918
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:03,290
and report the progress

919
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:04,550
to you at any time.

920
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Jiang Guocheng,

921
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,800
do I look like I'm joking with you?

922
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,680
You were the one
who requested this initially.

923
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,900
I've been running around, busy with this

924
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,150
for over half a year,

925
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:20,180
and you still can't get it done
on your end.

926
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,530
Are you playing me?

927
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:24,850
I'll get it done as soon as possible.

928
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,090
And how soon is that?

929
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,460
Give me a specific time.

930
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,750
Don't forget,

931
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,470
I can turn this matter against you.

932
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,750
I'm starting to wonder

933
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:51,140
why you've been so nice to me
all this time.

934
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:53,000
What do you mean by that?

935
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:56,350
Nothing, really.

936
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,120
Alright.

937
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,370
My shoulders.

938
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:26,210
Taking a break?

939
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:28,500
Come on up.

940
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,500
Senior.

941
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,220
Are you that deficient in vitamin D?

942
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:43,500
I heard that Director Xiao promoted you
to permanent staff.

943
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,630
So, how does it feel?

944
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,960
Any thoughts about it?

945
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,500
How do I feel?

946
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:51,820
Well...

947
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,500
it feels quite strange.

948
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:56,370
I never thought I'd end up
in a place like this,

949
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:57,700
taking care of inmates.

950
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,920
But after working here for a while,

951
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:03,770
I've gotten... some fresh perspectives
and a clearer direction.

952
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,710
I now want to be like Director Xiao,

953
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,620
helping prisoners become better people.

954
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,560
Everyone...

955
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:13,030
deserves a second chance, right?

956
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,210
You've been working hard.

957
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:20,220
I can see you're pretty tired lately.

958
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,970
I know a really good massage place.

959
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:23,500
Let's go together after work.

960
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,250
My treat.

961
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:26,970
Sure.

962
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:28,870
If you're paying, I'm in.

963
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,480
I think that place is called

964
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,250
Phoenix Beauty Salon.

965
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,380
Have you heard of it?

966
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:46,620
Drop the act.

967
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:49,630
I already know you're
one of Zhang Wenfeng's guys.

968
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,430
Senior, what...

969
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:57,830
what are you talking about?

970
00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:00,030
I don't know what you're talking about.

971
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:02,620
Still playing dumb.

972
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,740
This contains footage of you
sneaking to see Inmate 9568

973
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,140
and smuggling contraband

974
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,620
when you first came to work here.

975
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,820
And footage of you fixing games

976
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,200
and throwing goldfish into my tank—

977
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,130
letting them eat all my shrimpies!

978
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:14,820
Yet you still deny it?

979
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,970
Won't admit it?

980
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,330
Won't say anything? Not saying anything?

981
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:18,920
Senior.

982
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,450
I have all the evidence.

983
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,280
Anything you want to say?

984
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,170
Come on, I want to hear
your side of the story.

985
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:29,250
What's your relationship
with Zhang Wenfeng?

986
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,220
And how did you get to work here?

987
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,220
Who's the mole inside our facility?

988
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:37,850
Senior.

989
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,500
I-I really don't know.

990
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,840
I'm just a small fry.

991
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,000
Is that so?

992
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:51,110
Then I'll hand over the evidence.

993
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,250
Wait, wait!

994
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,850
I'm really not

995
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:57,490
one of Zhang Wenfeng's guys.

996
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,120
I... I was forced into this.

997
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:00,750
I...

998
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,080
I'm in debt,

999
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:05,770
and that's why they arranged for me
to come here

1000
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,000
to take care of Inmate 9568.

1001
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
As for other things,

1002
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,260
I-I really don't know.

1003
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,000
And they said if I didn't cooperate,

1004
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,930
they would shut down my mom's shop.

1005
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:16,230
My mom raised me by selling beef noodles.

1006
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,850
And her beef noodles are
incredibly delicious!

1007
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:19,160
It'd be such a waste if the shop closed.

1008
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,220
Breaking the law is breaking the law.

1009
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,950
What does that have to do
with a beef noodle stand?

1010
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,000
Yeah, I guess it doesn't.

1011
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,920
-But, Senior...
-Alright, alright.

1012
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,120
Then give me

1013
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:31,250
a reason not to report you.

1014
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,030
Go ahead.

1015
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,440
I want to start over.

1016
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,940
I ruined my life because I was frustrated

1017
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,110
and turned to gambling.

1018
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,500
But now that I'm working at the facility,

1019
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,750
I feel grounded.

1020
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:58,180
This might be my only path forward.

1021
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:00,270
Once I pay off my debts...

1022
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:03,120
I can start fresh.

1023
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:05,500
Senior.

1024
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:08,680
Even though I was planted here,

1025
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:10,350
Senior,

1026
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:12,170
you can see my work ethic, right?

1027
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,080
How I treated Zhang Zixu,

1028
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,740
Zhongwen, and Director Xiao—

1029
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:18,670
you've seen it all, haven't you?

1030
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:19,620
Right?

1031
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,280
I can choose not to report you.

1032
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,020
But I have one condition.

1033
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:32,070
W-What condition?

1034
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:34,640
I want you to keep me updated on any news

1035
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,750
about Zhang Wenfeng

1036
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:36,880
or Chihuahua.

1037
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,250
Whenever you learn anything,

1038
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,450
tell me immediately.

1039
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,750
S-So...

1040
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,250
you want me to be your informant?

1041
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,680
That's right.

1042
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:47,630
After all, I'm after

1043
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,690
the biggest bad egg in this facility.

1044
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,410
I'll be counting on you now.

1045
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I'm doomed.

1046
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:56,040
Don't double agents usually die miserably?

1047
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,590
You want to say

1048
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,730
that being a double agent
might end badly, right?

1049
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:02,000
Listen,

1050
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:03,630
if you don't do your job well,

1051
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:05,030
you'll end up even worse.

1052
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:09,440
Come on.

1053
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:25,250
I believe in you.
