00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,560
you can't just break out of prison.

192
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,260
This is a crime.

193
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,980
I'll be put in jail too.

194
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,510
If anything goes wrong,

195
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,280
I'll take full responsibility.

196
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,210
Will you really take all the blame?

197
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,510
I'll help you.

198
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,290
But you must promise me one thing.

199
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:52,890
You must come back right away

200
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,280
after you hold your son.

201
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,050
Easy with the noodles.

202
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:58,840
Zhang Longji, listen.

203
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,880
No more hesitation.

204
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,430
Just steal a car and run away.

205
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:02,180
Listen to me.

206
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:02,840
No way.

207
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,430
-Listen to me!
-If you get caught,

208
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,160
you'll never see your son!

209
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,110
I'll go with the original plan.

210
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,380
I'm coming to see you.

211
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:10,880
Are you crazy?

212
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,010
-That's it.
-Why don't you just leave?

213
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,930
To think I even personally

214
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,130
handed you the security plan for today.

215
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,200
Senior, you did a good job on that plan.

216
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,260
We nearly failed to leave the prison.

217
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,180
Inmate 9568 had better come back.

218
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,300
Or you'll be thrown into jail.

219
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,630
If that happens, I'll tell the media

220
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,460
that you guys deny treatment
to an inmate with cancer!

221
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,210
I've told you I am trying.

222
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,110
He would be dead
by the time you work out something.

223
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,280
Enough!

224
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,390
Stop arguing.

225
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,800
You'll both be finished
if I tell the media about this,

226
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,730
especially you.

227
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,630
You handcuffed me and even tased me.

228
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,830
What did I do wrong? Did I commit a crime?

229
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,220
You just assaulted an officer!

230
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,620
You tased me a moment ago.

231
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,260
But you tased me twice!

232
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,800
I'm only a slop collector.
What have I done wrong?

233
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,590
What has an ordinary civilian
such as myself done wrong?

234
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,260
Exactly!

235
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:29,160
You made this happen,
since you just tased me.

236
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,760
It's been a long time.

237
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,130
Why aren't they here yet?

238
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,020
Could something have happened?

239
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:51,980
My apologies.

240
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,050
Senior.

241
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,890
Why are you guys here too?

242
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,780
You're all in this together?

243
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,240
They have nothing to do with this.

244
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,590
I planned for this whole thing.

245
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,840
-Wa...
-Why didn't you run as I told you?

246
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,440
Everyone stay where you are!

247
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,160
Inmate 9568.

248
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:46,740
Stop moving.

249
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,690
I'm too tired

250
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,050
to run anymore.

251
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,240
Senior.

252
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,730
Alright. There, there.

253
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,290
Mom's here.

254
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:07,880
Senior.

255
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:13,050
As I said, I won't let you take the blame.

256
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,829
Senior, I'll resign
as soon as I get back to the office.

257
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:17,520
His son's right there.

258
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,550
Please let him hold his son.

259
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,670
Yeah, Senior, don't do this.

260
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,680
Make an exception. Let him see his son.

261
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,780
My son is crying.

262
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,690
Given his current health condition,

263
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,930
this could be the last time

264
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,330
he gets to hold his child.

265
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,050
Let me see my son.

266
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,340
I...

267
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:40,630
Yijie.

268
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,630
He's already here. Let him hold his son.

269
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,200
Why are you here too?

270
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,840
So you've known this all along?

271
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,930
Are all of you crazy?

272
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,310
Assisting in a prison break?

273
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,330
I told you this is all my doing.

274
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,240
They're completely innocent!

275
00:17:59,130 --> 00:17:59,630
My...

276
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:00,780
My son is crying.

277
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,130
Please let me see him.

278
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,510
Then take me back to the prison, okay?

279
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,260
Senior,

280
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,150
please show some leniency.

281
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,880
Yeah. Senior, please.

282
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,180
Inmate 9568!

283
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,010
Senior, just a small exception.

284
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:15,630
Senior.

285
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:16,380
Jiang Yijie,

286
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:20,140
are you sure of keeping a child
from is father's embrace?

287
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,220
Zhang Longji.

288
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,080
My son is right there.

289
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,800
I'm just one step away from holding him!

290
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,600
Can't you show some compassion?

291
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,720
No wonder nobody in the Central Prison
likes you,

292
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,800
you damn nuisance!

293
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,160
Go ahead.

294
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,270
Look.

295
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,280
Use the sanitizer first.

296
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,970
It's in the bag.

297
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:52,730
Dad's here to hold you.

298
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:53,680
Come on.

299
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,390
Dad's going to hold you.

300
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,230
Time to turn on the lanterns.

301
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:03,760
Right.

302
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,520
You guys go there.

303
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,760
Senior, come help me.

304
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,850
Dad is holding you.

305
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,900
He's a beautiful boy.

306
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,010
So beautiful.

307
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,510
Senior, turn on this switch later.

308
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,110
His eyes opened

309
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:11,540
as the lanterns went on.

310
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,610
If you have anything to say to him,

311
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:15,260
say it now.

312
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:20,340
But he won't understand.

313
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,680
Do it this way?

314
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,300
Yes, like this.

315
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,180
Put his...

316
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,670
Look at his thing!

317
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,350
Be quick, or he'll get cold.

318
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,350
-And then?
-What should we do next?

319
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,120
Get me a taxi later.

320
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,880
Zhiyao and I will take him back.

321
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,390
Let's consider this... medical parole.

322
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,630
Senior.

323
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,380
What?

324
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:10,980
You seem fine.

325
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,070
This must taste good.

326
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,880
He's gulping down the milk.

327
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,500
Everyone within the prison walls
has their own story.

328
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,380
Some made mistakes.

329
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,300
Some took wrong turns.

330
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,760
After going through hell
on both sides of the law

331
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,820
and days filled with mixed emotions,

332
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,190
my time behind bars is finally over.

333
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,470
I'm leaving. Take care.

334
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:24,200
I'll miss you.

335
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,920
No one will eat instant noodles with you
anymore.

336
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,300
Stay strong.

337
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,830
Officer.

338
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,760
I'm sorry
for constantly causing you trouble.

339
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,930
Come visit us when you have time.

340
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:09,090
Goodbye.

341
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:13,960
Let's eat out sometime.

342
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:14,830
I'm taking off.

343
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:15,720
Bye.

344
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,840
She said

345
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,380
that

346
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,780
Sister said,

347
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:46,590
"Please don't"

348
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,340
"die."

349
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:48,480
"Please don't"

350
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:48,980
"die."

351
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,880
Oh no.

352
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,540
Monster

353
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,630
looking

354
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,420
said...

355
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,970
Are you done with it?

356
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:58,310
The doctor said

357
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,470
Boss just had surgery
and needs to be under observation.

358
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:02,260
And you're reading English stories
to him now.

359
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,120
This is really giving me a stroke.

360
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:07,030
Boss, if you see the light,
don't go towards it.

361
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,320
When I'm able to sit up again,

362
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,970
I'll beat you until you see that light.

363
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,470
Boss, tell us if you're in too much pain.

364
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:19,070
We're just trying to keep you
from despair.

365
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:21,490
You're taking a dump over there again.

366
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:23,220
That's what gets us in despair.

367
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,300
It really stinks.

368
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,340
Despair?

369
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,800
Right now,

370
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:35,180
my will to live is stronger
than anyone else's.

371
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,380
Tiantian.

372
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,300
Continue.

373
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,510
Monster said,

374
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:46,780
"Please don't"

375
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,570
"die."

376
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,460
"She don't die."

377
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,620
Oh, sky...

378
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,720
Oh, sky is

379
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,050
so pretty.

380
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:58,680
Pretty.

381
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,220
I like

382
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,590
a pretty girl.

383
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,760
Oh, sky is

384
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,470
a bird,

385
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:03,970
and

386
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,340
a butterfly.

387
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:06,510
Butterfly

388
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,180
said, "Please"

389
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,380
"don't die."

390
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,890
[Warden's Office]

391
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:16,090
It feels great.

392
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,300
But what was that disturbance

393
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,260
about?

394
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,130
That was nothing. I already...

395
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,380
I already took care of it.

396
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,880
Problem solved.

397
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,600
Mr. Chen Bingzhong,

398
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:28,820
Mr. Hu Renshuo.

399
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:31,760
We're from the Anti-Corruption Unit.

400
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,700
You are both suspected of corruption.

401
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,260
Please come with us.

402
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,590
What corruption?

403
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,090
Everything's clearly stated
in the search warrant.

404
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,200
What proof do you have?

405
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,330
Proof? Warden Jiang Guocheng
has provided plenty of it.

406
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,990
This is about the cooperative.

407
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,970
This is about the mess hall.

408
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:48,620
This is about the workshop.

409
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,470
I went over the figures and found

410
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,760
something off.

411
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,630
They two have done many things
behind closed doors,

412
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,470
especially the chief of Custody Division.

413
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,590
I know something about
how they've colluded with

414
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,840
and threatened the inmates.

415
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,970
Previously,
I was busy with the extension project,

416
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:06,120
so I didn't have time
for a careful review.

417
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,010
I meant to do a good deed

418
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,170
before retirement,

419
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,000
but it turned out to be
a stain on my record.

420
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,470
Please conduct a thorough investigation

421
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,130
and ensure justice is served.

422
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,970
Are you playing "Red Light, Green Light"?

423
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:18,720
Get a move on!

424
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:19,800
Why so rude?

425
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:20,880
They're not convicts yet.

426
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,220
We're just taking them away
for questioning.

427
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,430
Be cooperative. Come with us.

428
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,800
Could it be possible that...

429
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,470
Save that for later.

430
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,340
Enough said for now.

431
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,000
You want me to carry you on the back?

432
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,410
Why do you have to yell?

433
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,090
When did you finish
your pre-service training?

434
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:36,620
We may be complained again.

435
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,250
Inmate 1026.

436
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:42,590
[Central Desk]

437
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,430
Can you put this

438
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,680
on the bulletin board?

439
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,700
-Okay.
-Thanks.

440
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,970
Reporting for duty. Hello, Senior!

441
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,840
You're finally back.

442
00:27:59,090 --> 00:27:59,970
I missed you so much,

443
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:00,590
so much.

444
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,940
Chief, you're so lucky.

445
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,470
Even that severe injury couldn't kill you.

446
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:07,010
Now I not only have a hole in the stomach,

447
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:09,410
but also one in the head.
Good ventilation.

448
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,990
Health is all that matters.

449
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,030
Hello, Chief.

450
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,510
Zhongwen.

451
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,760
You get to work at the Central Desk now?

452
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,890
Yes, Chief, I'm still learning.

453
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,350
He makes progress quickly.

454
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,810
He's also a fast learner.

455
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,150
But he's a worse nagger now than before,

456
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,330
sticking his nose here and there.

457
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:25,300
That'll take a lot off my shoulders.

458
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,050
Chief!

459
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,200
Here comes...

460
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:29,980
Tian!

461
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:33,090
Cut it out. You know I'm Shun.

462
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,720
You've wasted too much time
reading comics.

463
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,680
Zhongwen is already
working at the Central Desk,

464
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,800
yet you're still stuck here.

465
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,470
This is more like it, Chief.

466
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:42,800
We need you here to lash out at everyone.

467
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,840
It's what the Custody Division
should be like.

468
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,090
You're a bit of a masochist.

469
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,180
You can't live without being scolded.

470
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:48,840
It's not like that.
Things have changed a lot lately.

471
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,680
Look, the warden resigned.

472
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,720
The deputy warden and Chief Hu
were taken into custody.

473
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,430
Two idiots left, too.

474
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,350
What?

475
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:02,250
Feeling lonely
now that there's no one to scold?

476
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,330
Director Xiao!

477
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,150
I'm sorry.

478
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:24,730
Li Chengbing,

479
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,100
it's alright.

480
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,680
Director...

481
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:35,220
Your grandma's still waiting for you.

482
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,580
Thank you, Director.

483
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,930
Alright. Go and get some rest.

484
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:59,530
Shun has been taking care of his grandma
lately.

485
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:01,780
Good.

486
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,800
Nice work.

487
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:07,840
It's the least I could do for my senior.

488
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,300
"Senior"? What should you be doing now?

489
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,700
Get back to work! Are you messing with me?

490
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,480
Yes, Chief!

491
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,160
Yes, Chief!

492
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:20,010
See, everyone's happy
now that you're back.

493
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,470
Grandpa is doing really well now.

494
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:47,020
And he no longer mistakes me
for someone else.

495
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,770
He finally recognizes you.

496
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,800
What's the warden been doing
after retirement?

497
00:30:59,050 --> 00:30:59,790
Well, he...

498
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,140
He's now...

499
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:04,800
Wenfeng and I have known each other
since we were young.

500
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,800
In the past,
it was she who saw me fighting everywhere.

501
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,780
Who would have thought...

502
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:11,680
she managed to make her name,

503
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:13,460
while I wound up being a warden?

504
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:15,930
Why put it that way?

505
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,550
Because it's true.

506
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,620
Being young and foolish,

507
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,820
I used to be a hooligan that fought a lot.

508
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:23,530
But there's a good side
to being a hooligan.

509
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,800
I think it's most appropriate
to manage prisoners

510
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,600
from a hooligan's perspective.

511
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,960
Look,
what a man of great depth your father is.

512
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,160
Come on.

513
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,260
It got on your mouth.

514
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,310
Let me wipe it.

515
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,640
I'm wiping it.

516
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:45,320
Eat up.

517
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,260
Sure.

518
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,860
Do you feel like you have a new mother?

519
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,110
As long as my father is happy.

520
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,610
But based on how I feel...

521
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:56,000
Yes.

522
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:59,680
Your father is supportive of you
joining the Prison Reform Foundation,

523
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,880
right?

524
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,680
Actually, he supports my every decision,

525
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,180
as long as I've thought it through.

526
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,550
That's good.

527
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,800
But it's a civil society after all.

528
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:11,120
I'm not sure of how much I can do.

529
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,300
Jiang Yijie,

530
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:19,030
you're up for it.
Have some faith in yourself.

531
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,190
I'm up for it.

532
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,720
What, feeling cold now?

533
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,010
I told you to wear a jacket,
but you just wouldn't listen.

534
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:46,070
Alright. It's time to eat!

535
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,080
It smells so good.

536
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:50,550
Here, who wants this meatball?

537
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,800
-Me.
-Okay.

538
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,550
-It's hot.
-Next one's mine.

539
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,180
-Okay.
-Fine, after you.

540
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,740
You two really look...

541
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,930
amazing now.

542
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:59,550
-Is it true?
-That's without a doubt.

543
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:01,260
Come on.
They eat well and live well at my place.

544
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,300
Why wouldn't they look good?

545
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,300
Jiajun,
what have you been up to these days?

546
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,960
I'm getting prepared
to take the bar exam again.

547
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:08,800
Oh, right.

548
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,130
Tell your father I say thanks.

549
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,600
He's been concerned
about my job situation.

550
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,620
And he keeps referring me

551
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,220
to the Phoenix Beauty Salon.

552
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,880
But I'd like to stay
and help out my sister.

553
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:18,430
-Thanks anyway.
-Thanks.

554
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,600
No problem. Just ignore my father.

555
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:21,930
Hello.

556
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:22,530
Zhongwen!

557
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,430
Zhongwen!

558
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:25,060
It's cold out there.

559
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:26,430
Yu Jiajun.

560
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:27,800
Long time no see.

561
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,930
Long time no see. What a spread.

562
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,550
What would you like to drink?

563
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,550
-Beer.
-Okay.

564
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:34,080
Let me get you some food.

565
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,180
Where is Gao Zhiyao?

566
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:39,230
Zhiyao said he was tired today
and he'd come next time.

567
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,190
Why?

568
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:42,550
How tired is he
that he can't even come see us?

569
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,680
It's quite exhausting
to be an assistant trainer.

570
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,550
I once visited him
during a training session.

571
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:48,350
-He seemed happy.
-Here you are.

572
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,300
-Thank you.
-It's hot.

573
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,430
Does he want to attend contests again?

574
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:53,230
Of course he'd love to, if he can.

575
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:55,680
But... it's not his decision to make.

576
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,680
Isn't the Custody Division short-staffed?

577
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,800
Why not get Zhiyao back?

578
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,050
How's that possible?

579
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,090
He assisted in a prison break.

580
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,430
Drop that subject for good.

581
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:08,429
Or we might all get arrested.

582
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:09,179
No, that won't happen.

583
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,800
We don't know anything whatsoever.

584
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,340
Come on, drink up.

585
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,850
I need to get this call.

586
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,679
Hey babe, are you off work?

587
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:18,850
Yeah, everyone's here.

588
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:19,929
Are you coming over?

589
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:20,800
Do you know who that is?

590
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,510
Who?

591
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,480
Shun from the Custody Division.

592
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,960
-Really?
-Shun?

593
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:26,429
-Is it true?
-Yes.

594
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:28,550
Come on, faster.

595
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,730
Quicken your pace.

596
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:51,389
Kai, wait a moment. Take a break.

597
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,909
Coach, sorry, a friend of mine is here.

598
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:53,790
Excuse me.

599
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:55,060
Take a break.

600
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,130
What are you doing here?

601
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,230
I was passing by.

602
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,550
How's your arm?

603
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:03,050
Good.

604
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,540
This junior just won a gold medal.

605
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,430
He has great potential.

606
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,560
What about you?

607
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:16,510
When will you officially attend a contest?

608
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,910
Contests are held all the time.

609
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,550
But to get on the official roster,

610
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,930
I need to practice more.

611
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,560
In fact, I don't know what else I can do.

612
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,090
I heard from Jiajun that you're joining

613
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:33,000
the Prison Reform Foundation, aren't you?

614
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,860
Senior, you're truly ambitious.

615
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,300
I wouldn't put it that way. I just...

616
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:40,110
I talked to my father.

617
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:41,960
Just like you,

618
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,980
I want to do what I really care about.

619
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,730
What exactly...

620
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,780
did your father do?

621
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:56,760
My father?

622
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,740
I mean your biological father.

623
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,010
Why suddenly bring him up?

624
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:06,370
Jieyu told me something.

625
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,850
Was your father really a murderer?

626
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,730
Yes, he was a murderer.

627
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,510
To survive,
he did all sorts of crimes—

628
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,970
stealing, kidnapping, robbery, and fraud.

629
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:29,930
I just never expected him to receive

630
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,980
heavier and heavier penalties.

631
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:34,300
He was sentenced to death

632
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:36,210
when I was 8 years old.

633
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:42,240
My father once told me

634
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:44,130
to be a good person

635
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,680
and not to go astray.

636
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:49,290
Take one wrong step,
and there will be no going back.

637
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,640
Prison shouldn't be the way it is now.

638
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,610
Prison should be where people get help,

639
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:56,180
earn a second chance at life,

640
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,240
and are rehabilitated
for entering the society again.

641
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,320
As said by Director Xiao.

642
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,550
Anyway,

643
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:11,880
thank you.

644
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:17,010
You made me realize that the law is rigid,

645
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:18,820
but people are not.

646
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,420
I came here just to tell you

647
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:32,840
that the Central Prison
is understaffed now.

648
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,260
So, if you feel like coming back,

649
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,660
you're welcome anytime.

650
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,130
I'm welcome anytime?

651
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:41,190
Can I really come back?

652
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:42,960
Of course.

653
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:44,180
I'm just not sure if you'll be locked up,

654
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,780
or the one locking people up.

655
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:50,880
Just kidding. Well,

656
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,760
everyone misses you.

657
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,080
What? You want to puke?

658
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,500
A little bit.

659
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:03,690
You're not asking me
to be a double agent again, are you?

660
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:05,050
Mickey Mouse?

661
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,800
He's gone.

662
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:13,470
Handsome,
your beef noodles with extra beef.

663
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,930
It's perfectly warm.

664
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:16,220
Neither cold nor hot.

665
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,440
Do you want to continue the training,

666
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:23,470
or become a civil servant?

667
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:26,470
Whatever your decision is,

668
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,200
you'll always have my support.

669
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:38,340
Didn't you say you'd let the prices
reflect your compassion?

670
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,860
When did I ever say that?

671
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:42,090
Twenty is far too small a raise.

672
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:44,900
Do I look like a bodhisattva to you?

673
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,720
Coach,

674
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:23,020
can I have a match with the junior?

675
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,660
But he's a gold medalist.

676
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,260
I'd like to give it a try.

677
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,980
Senior, I won't hold back.

678
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,220
Let's get serious.

679
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:34,720
Come on.

680
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,380
Chief.

681
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:03,670
[Lin Maowei,
Administrator, Custody Division]

682
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:21,200
[Gao Zhiyao,
Administrator, Custody Division]

683
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,440
I've been keeping it around.

684
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:29,360
Welcome to the Central Prison.

685
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,480
You're all the best of the best.

686
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,090
Listen,
as you start working in the prison,

687
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,720
you've basically
become the same as the inmates—

688
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,290
you must obey

689
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,220
the superiors' orders unconditionally.

690
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,300
The only difference

691
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,800
lies in your uniform and ID badges.

692
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,680
Don't you dare lose them,

693
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:47,720
or cause me any trouble.

694
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,070
Yes, Director.

695
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,340
Louder!

696
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,050
Yes, Director!

697
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,470
Zhongwen,

698
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:55,480
your first task today

699
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:58,430
is to give the prisoners
who were just transferred here

700
00:40:58,430 --> 00:40:59,550
body searches!

701
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,300
Move a bit to the left.

702
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,810
A bit more, Momo.

703
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:08,210
I think you should just

704
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,650
freestyle.

705
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,800
You are all overestimating actors.

706
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,050
Freestyle in every situation.

707
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:15,260
Freestyle in dancing too.

708
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:15,980
All of us are asked to...

709
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:18,370
[Hey, freestyle even in dancing]

710
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,260
Where were you going?

711
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:48,810
The chair just slid away.
