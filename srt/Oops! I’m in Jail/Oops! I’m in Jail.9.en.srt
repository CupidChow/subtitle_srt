00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,790
Wa, please behave yourself
after you're out of Cell Block Violation.

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,210
Medical parole isn't something
you can ask for so easily.

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:12,210
What do you mean?

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:13,920
My son is about to be born.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,580
I can't be there for the delivery?

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,200
Bro,

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,300
you're in prison.

8
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,050
Screw you.

9
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,160
I must get out.

10
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:22,510
Given the way I am now,

11
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:23,550
who can stop me?

12
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:25,670
Boss.

13
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:26,540
Listen,

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,980
even if I help you get medical parole,

15
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,510
how are you going to get
to the maternity ward?

16
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,700
I'll arrange everything outside myself.

17
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,900
Don't worry about it.

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:35,910
Thanks.

19
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,870
Arrange?

20
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,890
How are you going to arrange it?

21
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:40,640
Wait.

22
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:41,280
Boss.

23
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,350
I'll have to take the fall if you mess up.

24
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,570
Then take the fall.

25
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:45,730
If you get replaced,

26
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:47,330
I can just find someone else.

27
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,440
Wa,

28
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,060
I finally got a proper job.

29
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,170
Can you please not do this to me?

30
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,020
A proper job?

31
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,830
How do you think you got in here?

32
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:06,850
Listen.

33
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,350
I'll talk to the guys at the workshop.

34
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,140
Starting next week,

35
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,940
they'll give me some extra points.

36
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,670
And for the drama competition,

37
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:15,810
only one group is participating.

38
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,440
They're making me the director

39
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,039
so that I can get more points.

40
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,690
Director,
I want you to take advantage of me.

41
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,310
For medical parole

42
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,770
and Family Visitation Day,
I must qualify for both.

43
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,020
Do you understand?

44
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,190
Every second
I can spend with my son counts.

45
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,890
I almost forgot the most important thing.

46
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:39,520
Here.

47
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,560
Which cells need cigarettes

48
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,440
and which ones need fried chicken are

49
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,900
all clearly written on it.

50
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,190
Handle these things for me.

51
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,850
I'll offer you a bigger bonus.

52
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,190
Let's say

53
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,100
100,000.

54
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,650
Consider it your Mid-Autumn Festival gift.

55
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,390
Inmate 7392,

56
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,470
don't smoke in the cell.

57
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,520
It's mine.

58
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:07,890
Wa,

59
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,100
if you smoke in your cell

60
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,270
and the other inmates find out,
they'll make a fuss.

61
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,390
I know.

62
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,000
Have you been feeding them regularly?

63
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,270
They can spin in circles now.

64
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,270
Come on, Ahua and Arhui.

65
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,140
Show it to the Director. Spin. Come on.

[OOPS! I'M IN JAIL]

67
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,329
[Episode 9]

68
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,770
Is it good?

69
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,260
How is it?

70
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,220
Is it delicious?

71
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,390
I never expected orange juice
to go so well with chicken.

72
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,520
This is my first time
tasting something like this.

73
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,390
Really?

74
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:08,200
This is my newly developed
orange juice fried chicken.

75
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,000
Your orange juice fried chicken
has a rich flavor.

76
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,290
Have another nugget then.

77
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:15,780
Okay.

78
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:17,430
This tastes super weird.

79
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:20,880
By the way,

80
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,770
when is the Health Division
going to hire new staff?

81
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:24,890
If they don't get any new recruits soon,

82
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,270
I'm going to file a complaint.

83
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,210
Instead of spending time
writing a complaint letter,

84
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,140
you might as well help me directly.

85
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,210
Exactly.

86
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,630
Why don't you just study to be a nurse?

87
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,560
You can't pass the bar exam anyway.

88
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,140
You'd look cute in a nurse's uniform.

89
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,150
Let me give you injections.

90
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,290
It's not impossible.

91
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,330
But how many years
do you have to study to become a nurse?

92
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,140
If you want to be a nurse,

93
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,690
you'll need to learn
how to clean up feces.

94
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:52,640
You can't freak out at blood.

95
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,640
Can you insert a catheter?

96
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,390
To do it,

97
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,520
you should take a tube

98
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,020
and then put it on the penis like this.

99
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,020
Alright, forget it.

100
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,920
-And then insert it.
-No.

101
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,200
I'm just kidding.

102
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:09,770
Um.

103
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,060
This is for you.

104
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,810
Oh, so sweet.

105
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:18,770
What's this?

106
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,020
This is for you.

107
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,520
It's for you.

108
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,540
Here you go.

109
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,180
Your brother's keychain was
quite hard to find.

110
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,620
How did you find it?

111
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,590
I went to Thailand...

112
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,159
You went to Thailand?

113
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,570
No, I mean I bought it
from a Thai shopping platform.

114
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,350
You scared me.

115
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,640
I thought you really went
all the way to Thailand for it.

116
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,690
That was clever.

117
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,240
And it took him quite a while to find it.

118
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,790
How do you know that?

119
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,520
He used my computer.

120
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,770
Thanks.

121
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,440
It looks the same, I guess.

122
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,640
Do you want some more?

123
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,230
Sure.

124
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,470
You don't seem to have finished yours.

125
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,020
Is it too hard?

126
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,550
No, I'm just

127
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:14,690
savoring it.

128
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,540
Xiaohui, I've been waiting for ages.

129
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,190
Be patient.

130
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,320
What medication are you prescribing?

131
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,480
I was coughing all night yesterday.

132
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,100
Nobody heard me, huh?

133
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,370
I've been coughing for days.

134
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:33,690
Do I have to cough myself to death
before anyone notices?

135
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,820
Inmate 7692 says he's feeling unwell.

136
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:36,890
Keep it down.

137
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,190
Lie down on Bed No.1 first, okay?

138
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,020
Okay.

139
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,220
Always complaining.

140
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,390
Alright, put your mask on.

141
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,020
It protects both you and me.

142
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:44,690
Can you make it?

143
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:45,770
Yes.

144
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,040
Just a moment.

145
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,170
Alright, let me check
your blood pressure first.

146
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,690
Keep it down.

147
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,390
Don't infect me.

148
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,050
What symptoms are you having?

149
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,600
Director,

150
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,330
the planned expansion site is
that area outside.

151
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,560
Currently, we're planning
to build two new cell blocks

152
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,560
and one more workshop.

153
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,390
Counselor,

154
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,140
could you please

155
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,270
take more frontal shots
of the Director's face

156
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,480
and capture more footage
of him instructing us?

157
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,560
Thanks, I appreciate it.

158
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,060
Hold on.

159
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,950
But I can't control
the Director's movements.

160
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,010
Don't worry about that.

161
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,670
The Director knows what to do.

162
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:18,890
Thanks for your help.

163
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,750
Try to finish as quickly as possible.

164
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,810
Yijie.

165
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,620
The Custody Division will be short
of staff after the expansion.

166
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,850
I know.

167
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,890
There's a vacant deputy chief position.

168
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:33,480
Are you interested...

169
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,540
Sorry, Dad. I'm in the middle of work.

170
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,320
Watch out, Director!

171
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,810
Be careful! Are you alright, Director?

172
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:39,730
What happened?

173
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:40,980
Director!

174
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,890
Your blood pressure is a bit high.

175
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,140
When I'm not feeling okay,
I need to see you, babe.

176
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,520
Don't say this. You have a wife.

177
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,890
Why are you just like my beautiful wife?

178
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,140
Such a jealous one.

179
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,270
This isn't right.

180
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,440
Relax.

181
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,270
Okay.

182
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,330
Seeing you just makes me feel better.

183
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,140
Can you please stop coughing?

184
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,890
Damn you.

185
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:01,890
Xiaohui.

186
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,910
Could you wait for me for a moment?

187
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,190
So you're here.

188
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,570
Didn't you hear the walkie-talkie?

189
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,640
It's just busy today.

190
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,640
You deliberately brought the inmate here
to see Xiaohui, didn't you?

191
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,980
No, it was just a coincidence.

192
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,020
What's wrong?

193
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,640
The visiting director is injured.

194
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,020
Could you go check on him?

195
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,080
I'm kind of busy.

196
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,020
Do I have to go right now?

197
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,270
-There are no doctors on duty today.
-Yeah.

198
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,770
They've already called an ambulance.

199
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,390
But the Chief is making a fuss over there.

200
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,480
Just tell them to wait there

201
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,890
for the ambulance.

202
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:27,890
It's just a fall.

203
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:28,890
You tell him that.

204
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,290
Gao Zhiyao,
have you found someone to help?

205
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,770
Chief,

206
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:35,309
the Health Division happens to have
no doctors on duty today.

207
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:36,520
There are quite a few sick inmates.

208
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,320
So they might be too busy to help.

209
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,030
Tell the nurse

210
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:41,539
that the Warden is also here.

211
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:42,760
If you don't follow my order,

212
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,560
let's see who will be in trouble.

213
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,020
Who will be in trouble?

214
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,270
I got an ACE!

215
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,020
You idiot.

216
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,770
Stop it.

217
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:50,770
-What are you saying?
-You didn't press it, did you?

218
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,270
I didn't press it.

219
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,460
Fine, I'll go with you.

220
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,640
I won't be gone for too long, I think.

221
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,020
So can you help me?

222
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:03,890
Sure.

223
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,190
If he wants water later,

224
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,640
please give him
some room-temperature water.

225
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,730
Don't let him lie down.

226
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,270
Sitting or reclining is fine.

227
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,440
-Okay.
-If he coughs up phlegm,

228
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,100
check what color it is.

229
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,350
Okay.

230
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,640
I've already taken Inmate 7692's

231
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,390
blood pressure.

232
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,140
It seems a bit high now.

233
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,020
Please check it again in 30 minutes.

234
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,890
And ask Director Xiao for medical parole.

235
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,390
I'll be back soon.

236
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,890
Wait for me. I'll be right back.

237
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,270
It's fine.

238
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,790
The Director needs you.

239
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,890
Seeing you,

240
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,770
I feel stronger than Mazinger Z.

241
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,270
-Stop it.
-Go ahead.

242
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,270
Okay, bye-bye.

243
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,990
-Go.
-Babe, McDonald's.

244
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:40,940
There's nothing like that here.

245
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,600
Chief, we're setting off now.

246
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,640
Alright, Mazinger Z.

247
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,020
Do you feel any better?

248
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:50,560
Yeah.

249
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,850
I'll lie down for a while.

250
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:52,440
Okay.

251
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,640
Tell me right away if you feel unwell.

252
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,020
Okay, I'll let you know.

253
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,020
Inmate 5514, do you want some more water?

254
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,360
Hot water!

255
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,390
-Keep it down.
-I want hot water!

256
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,390
Lower your voice.

257
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,230
Was it a coincidence?

258
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,640
Why did this happen right at this time?

259
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,100
Let's not worry about that now.

260
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,200
You've got quite a few things

261
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,530
to handle at the prison.

262
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,520
Otherwise, we'll hit a snag in the EIA.

263
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,980
The building contractors are waiting, too.

264
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,450
By the way, thank you
for your hard work, nurse.

265
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,140
You should all return to your posts.

266
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,190
-Thank you.
-Let me walk you out.

267
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,390
Don't bother.
I'll go to the hospital to visit him.

268
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,560
You stay and handle things here.

269
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,120
Okay.

270
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,320
Be careful on your way.

271
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,680
What are you looking at?

272
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,530
You've got nothing better to do?

273
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,750
What are you looking at?
You've got nothing better to do?

274
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,550
Yeah, nothing better to do here.

275
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,260
[Medical Center]

276
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,060
How is it?

277
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:04,900
They're all asleep.

278
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,890
I found that Inmate 2253 was

279
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,680
faking illness just now

280
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,110
and asked Senior
to take him back directly.

281
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:12,890
Nice.

282
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,320
How did it go on your side? All good?

283
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,160
Just a tiny little wound like this.

284
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,810
And they called an ambulance.

285
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,340
-Hilarious.
-So dramatic.

286
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,940
So you just tried being a nurse.

287
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,690
Do you still want to be one?

288
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,440
I really admire you.

289
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,130
Just Inmate 5514 alone
nearly drove me crazy.

290
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,550
Aren't you tired?

291
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,060
I am tired.

292
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,280
Working with you is exhausting.

293
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,790
How can you say that?

294
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,950
Because my heart is racing all for you.
It's exhausting.

295
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,780
-It hurts.
-Stop talking nonsense.

296
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,040
-One more time.
-Wait.

297
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,060
Go check.

298
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,820
Mr. Liu.

299
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,420
Mr. Liu?

300
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,750
Mr. Liu!

301
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,160
Mr. Liu!

302
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,140
Jiajun, call 119 for me now.

303
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,770
And bring me the AED and bag valve mask.

304
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:40,970
The AED is over there.

305
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,180
The green one!

306
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,390
Mr. Liu!

307
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,780
Wake up, Mr. Liu!

308
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:48,600
What next?

309
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,000
Turn on the AED for me.

310
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:53,900
Mr. Liu!

311
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,690
Mr. Liu, wake up!

312
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,170
When we visited Dad a few days ago,

313
00:12:59,170 --> 00:12:59,850
[The administrator slacked off at work;
the inmate died mysteriously.]

314
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,640
he was perfectly fine.

315
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,100
And now he's gone!

316
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,080
We requested to check
the surveillance footage,

317
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,600
[A man died from a minor illness;
the prison's medical system is a mess.]

318
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,480
but they wouldn't let us.

319
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,020
Then how are we

320
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,480
supposed to know
if they've messed anything up?

321
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,480
They keep saying
that they need to investigate further

322
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,140
for more information.

323
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,140
And then what?

324
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,600
He was completely fine just two days ago.

325
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,440
But why did he suddenly pass away?

326
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,460
Is it because there was no emergency care?

327
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,860
Is it because inmates
have no human rights?

328
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,070
Or is it because people
who make mistakes deserve to die?

329
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,110
This is just from one TV station.

330
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:33,010
Sooner or later,
other TV stations will also...

331
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,350
Of all times for it to happen,

332
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,480
it flared up

333
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,100
when the nurse was not there.

334
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,350
If I hadn't left at that time,

335
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,230
I might have had a chance to save him.

336
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:42,730
Hey,

337
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,190
none of us wanted

338
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,120
to see something like this happen.

339
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,630
Inmate 7692 had a history
of heart disease.

340
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,170
This was a sudden accident.

341
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,980
Everyone, don't blame yourselves too much.

342
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,690
We'll ask the social worker

343
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:57,010
to fully assist his family
with funeral arrangements.

344
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,440
The Education Division will handle
the emotional needs of his cellmates.

345
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,560
And I will personally explain
the situation to his family.

346
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,020
But if this case
sets the social media abuzz,

347
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,890
we'll all be in trouble.

348
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,190
We all reviewed
the surveillance footage just now.

349
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,810
When inmate 7692 had his attack,

350
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,990
there was indeed no nurse present.

351
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,140
If his family sees

352
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,640
this footage,

353
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,500
they definitely won't accept it.

354
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,970
And as you just said,

355
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,100
if you had stayed with him,

356
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,610
there might have been a chance
to save him.

357
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,760
So, regarding this issue,
you, as the nurse,

358
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,160
should bear some responsibility, I think.

359
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,980
Chief, why should the nurse
be held responsible?

360
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,440
That's right. It was you, Chief,

361
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,560
who asked her to help the Director.

362
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,370
The Director was bleeding.

363
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,440
I asked a nurse to help stop the bleeding.

364
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,060
Is there anything wrong with that?

365
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,270
But the nurse should be able
to make her own judgment.

366
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,940
Let me ask you. Who makes decisions
about Custody Division matters?

367
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,950
Our Custody Division staff, of course.

368
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:49,190
Then who makes decisions
about Health Division matters?

369
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,420
The nurse does!

370
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,310
The nurse left Inmate 7692

371
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,560
in Yu Jiajun's care.

372
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,980
May I ask,
are you from the Health Division?

373
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,110
Can you make
professional medical judgments?

374
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,190
To put it plainly,

375
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,280
the nurse should take

376
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,990
full responsibility for the whole thing.

377
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03,810
Chief, you were the one
who pressured her that day.

378
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:04,560
What pressure did I give?

379
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,520
Please tell me where the pressure was.

380
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,060
What did I do?

381
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,060
You threatened her
to go help the Director.

382
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:07,810
I threatened her?

383
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:08,770
How did I threaten her?

384
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,560
-What kind of attitude is that?
-Enough!

385
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,690
Both of you, shut up!

386
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,730
Chief Hu,

387
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,730
someone has passed away,

388
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,440
and everyone is upset.

389
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,370
So let's not discuss this anymore.

390
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,380
Besides, the Warden just said

391
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,880
this was an accident.

392
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:28,060
We shouldn't be blaming each other, okay?

393
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,310
If we really need to blame something,

394
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:31,310
it's that we made the nurse
run around exhausted,

395
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,810
rushing from place to place.

396
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:35,310
We can only blame
the insufficiency of medical staff.

397
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,060
How can we blame her alone?

398
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,090
Right now,

399
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,940
pacifying his family is
the first priority.

400
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,260
Let's not hurt them
by arguing about who's right or wrong.

401
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,740
In my point of view,

402
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,810
I'd like the nurse
to take more responsibility

403
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:54,940
with a temporary suspension

404
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,540
to give his family an answer.

405
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,710
Warden.

406
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,560
We've made our decision.

407
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,470
Let's go meet his family now.

408
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,810
I'm sorry.

409
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,280
We feel deeply sorry

410
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,810
for this unfortunate accident.

411
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,690
The nurse feels extremely remorseful

412
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:21,950
about her negligence.

413
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,840
She has asked
to take the punishment herself.

414
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,190
I don't need your apology,

415
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:28,940
you know?

416
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,440
I want my husband back.

417
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,810
I want my daughter's father back.

418
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,850
You're a nurse,

419
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,730
and you've done your job so poorly.

420
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:36,690
A man died!

421
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,950
This was a human life. Do you understand?

422
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,260
Have you ever considered how we'd feel?

423
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,940
Where do you place
the inmates in your priorities?

424
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,440
Have you ever
thought about their families?

425
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:47,630
Can a nurse

426
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,300
do her job like this?

427
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,579
Dad, are you okay?

428
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,880
Why'd you buy so many supplements?

429
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,500
Don't worry about the supplements, okay?

430
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,600
[Feng, Japanese Restaurant]

431
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:32,810
I've told you

432
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,270
that it's the Central Prison
that's been holding us back.

433
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:38,400
You know how I, Zhang Wenfeng,
handle things, don't you?

434
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,390
Welcome.

435

Waitress, table A2's liquor-steamed clams.

436
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,230
Okay, coming right up.

437
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,030
That's too dramatic.

438
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,060
I'm telling you the truth, seriously.

439
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,940
That's ridiculous. How is that possible?

440
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,690
There are just so many coincidences.

441
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,020
Only when you experience them
will you think,

442
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,690
-"How can something like this happen?"
-Boss.

443
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:05,640
One more serving of sake, please.

444
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,190
Okay, coming right up.

445

Yijie?

446
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,440
Did you make an appointment with him?

447
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,060
No, I did reschedule my meeting with him.

448
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,310
Come on, join us for a meal.

449
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,690
So you're Mickey Mouse?

450
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,650
What Mickey Mouse?

451
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:21,810
Come on.

452
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,190
Why did you talk nonsense
when we just met?

453
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,560
Come on. Let me introduce you.
This is Wenfeng.

454
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,940
I'm Zhang Wenfeng, your father's junior.

455
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,080
Senior,

456
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,370
I'm just a nobody.

457
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:33,940
I'm in debt,

458
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:34,940
and that's why they arranged for me
to come here

459
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,470
to take care of Inmate 9568.

460
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:39,120
The cell block expansion needs funding.

[Ms. Zhang Wenfeng,
Founder of Feng Xiang Construction]

462
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,580
Nothing will go wrong
at the Central Prison this year.

463
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,570
You understand?

464
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,190
Come on, let's have a meal together.

465
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,160
Join us. Come on.

466
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,850
Why did he run away?

467
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,440
So weird. What's wrong with him today?

468
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,630
Mom, I won't be coming home this week.

469
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,480
Why not?

470
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,440
-I cooked...
-Something went wrong at the prison.

471
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,770
-You should come back home.
-Alright.

472
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,770
-I'll go back to eat it next week.
-I said, come back home.

473
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:17,230
Hey!

474
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:18,690
Senior.

475
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,580
You appeared out of nowhere.

476
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,680
I know everything now.

477
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,050
Know what?

478
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,170
You still want to keep lying to me?

479
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,840
Senior, what are you talking about?

480
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,810
My dad is Mickey Mouse, right?

481
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,840
He let you in here, didn't he?

482
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:45,760
So the Mickey Mouse we've been looking for

483
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,990
turns out to be your dad?

484
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:49,120
What else are you hiding from me?

485
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,080
Why don't you tell me the truth?

486
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:54,690
How many things has my father covered up
for the expansion project?

487
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:55,940
Did my father actually take bribes?

488
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,310
Wait, Senior, please hear me out.

489
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:02,060
I do know that your father
has connections with Zhang Wenfeng,

490
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,810
but I really don't know anything else.

491
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,720
I was just assigned here
to look after her brother.

492
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,440
Look, it took me great effort that day

493
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,310
just to get one ultrasound photo.

494
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,270
I'm just a tiny, menial mouse
among the mice.

495
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:18,050
How could I tell if you're acting or not?

496
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:19,980
Senior,

497
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,380
if what you're saying is true,

498
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,690
then the Warden must be
the best actor of all.

499
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,560
It's true that Inmate 9568
has been exercising special privileges.

500
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,560
Are we just not going to investigate?

501
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,190
Then why don't you consider this?

502
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,940
Maybe the Custody Division

503
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,600
has put Inmate 9568

504
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,660
in the crowded Cell Block Harmony II,

505
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,440
intending to use him to maintain

506
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,370
the order in Cell Block Harmony II?

507
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,800
It's fine.

508
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,750
I'll get to the bottom of it myself.

509
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,830
Although I'm not a professional,

510
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:01,560
Mr. Liu really appeared

511
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,020
to be alright that day.

512
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,920
Weixiang was really nice to us.

513
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,380
He liked to joke around
with us all the time.

514
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:14,060
When I saw his wife and child today,

515
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,220
I couldn't even bear
to look them in the eyes.

516
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,240
Both of us heard it.

517
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,810
It was Chief Hu
who threatened you in the Warden's name,

518
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:28,060
saying that you'd be in trouble
if you didn't go to help the Director.

519
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,690
So you must
explain everything clearly to his family.

520
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:31,310
Don't let

521
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:33,710
people like that
shove all the blame on you.

522
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:34,690
Xiaohui,

523
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,310
we've got your back.

524
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,680
We're with you for sure.

525
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,390
Thank you all for caring about Xiaohui.

526
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,940
Why are you here?

527
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,190
I asked him to come.

528
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,290
Why did you do that?

529
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,560
He's the Warden's son.

530
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,160
He said
he wanted to discuss something with us.

531
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,830
I'm so sorry, everyone.

532
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:00,830
I never thought
things would unfold like this.

533
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:02,560
Xiaohui,

534
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,060
I'm sorry.

535
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:05,390
I also find it unacceptable

536
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,440
that someone who's so focused on work

537
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,100
has to wrongly take the blame.

538
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,940
So what do you plan to do?

539
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:16,980
I think we can

540
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,310
try to find eyewitnesses,

541
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,060
and then I'll talk to my dad.

542
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,310
Then, the first thing tomorrow morning,

543
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,970
I'll go
get the inmates from that day to testify.

544
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,100
Can you do that?

545
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,560
Yes, I got this.

546
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:30,590
Are you going to talk
to the Warden by yourself?

547
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,060
I think

548
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,560
if everyone is up for it,

549
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,350
we should go together.

550
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:41,850
More people can be more persuasive.

551
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:42,520
Okay.

552
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,240
No problem.

553
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,740
Thank you all.

554
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,720
Thank you for helping me.

555
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:53,480
Alright, it's okay.
Don't be afraid. It's alright.

556
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,810
Everyone will help.

557
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:58,310
You didn't do anything wrong, right?

558
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,130
Don't feel bad. It's okay.

559
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,430
[Chief, Custody Division]

560
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,060
Where's Zhiyao?

561
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,010
We're screwed.

562
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,940
The inmates who were going to testify
have all gone back on their word

563
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,400
and now say they didn't hear anything.

564
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,080
Didn't you say you got this?

565
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,190
Everyone's just scared.

566
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,640
You really can't do anything right.

567
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,940
What are you even good at?

568
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,270
You go give it a try then.

569
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,380
Warden.

570
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,220
Warden.

571
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,050
Warden.

572
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:56,940
Come in.

573
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,270
Go ahead.

574
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:06,440
I know what you mean.

575
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:07,940
So,

576
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,470
can you withdraw the punishment
on the nurse?

577
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,760
That's not possible.

578
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,990
I'd like to know why not.

579
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,370
From what I know,

580
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:32,480
the nurse noticed that day

581
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,740
that Inmate 7692 needed medical parole,

582
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:37,310
and she asked you
to report to Director Xiao.

583
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,540
Is that correct?

584
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,500
Yes.

585
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,670
Good.

586
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,230
You claim

587
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,100
that Chief Hu threatened the nurse

588
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,810
to leave her post,

589
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,600
but you have no evidence.

590
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,860
In the civil service system,

591
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,380
we need to handle things
based on evidence.

592
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,150
And this footage shows
the undeniable facts.

593
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,220
The prisoner died a sudden death inside,

594
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,950
while the nurse was chatting
and joking outside.

595
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,310
After watching this footage,

596
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:05,970
do you still think
that I punished her unfairly?

597
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:09,890
But Xiaohui has always been
diligent and responsible with her work.

598
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:11,820
Isn't this punishment too severe?

599
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:14,000
Yeah, isn't it too harsh?

600
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,390
Yeah, too severe.

601
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,460
Is it really that severe?

602
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,820
His family has seen this entire footage.

603
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,060
I made the nurse take responsibility,

604
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,520
and the inmate's family
didn't raise any objections.

605
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,190
They didn't pursue the matter further.

606
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:28,850
Or would you prefer to see
his family make a scene

607
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:31,600
so that the nurse can never work again?

608
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,990
But still, the nurse
shouldn't take full responsibility.

609
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,520
We're understaffed, and that's a fact.

610
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,290
Counselor,

611
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,330
is this part of your job?

612
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:44,560
I've made my decision.
This is how it will be.

613
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,420
Alright, all of you can leave now.

614
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,420
Please leave!

615
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,750
I'll leave it to you.

616
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,410
Let's go.

617
00:25:59,050 --> 00:25:59,680
Let's go.

618
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,030
Just leave it like this?

619
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,500
Yijie,

620
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:19,190
the nurse was at fault.

621
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,270
Let's leave it at that.

622
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,770
Don't argue with me anymore.

623
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,810
Dad, are we letting Chief Hu
get away with it

624
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:25,810
just because
there's no evidence against him?

625
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:27,230
Isn't your decision too arbitrary?

626
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:27,810
Yes,

627
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,190
it is arbitrary.

628
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:31,270
But I've said this before.

629
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,640
I want to push forward
with the expansion project.

630
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,440
So there can't be
any major incidents at the prison.

631
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,940
I also never expected things
would turn out this way.

632
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,540
What expansion project
could be so important?

633
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,980
Or is it because of Zhang Wenfeng?

634
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,440
About me knowing Zhang Wenfeng,

635
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,120
I thought you would understand it.

636
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,810
What am I supposed to understand?

637
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,310
Zhang Wenfeng is no ordinary person.

638
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,280
What on earth am I supposed to understand?

639
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,560
Dad, let's be honest
with each other, okay?

640
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,740
Did you let Zhang Wenfeng's people in

641
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,200
to take care of her brother

642
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:04,080
and let her win the project
with the most favorable bid?

643
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,080
Why?

644
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:07,190
Did she threaten you?

645
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,440
Or

646
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:09,990
did she bribe you?

647
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,940
I've raised you all these years.

648
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,190
Everything I've done was

649
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:15,100
to set a good example for you!

650
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,160
Now you accuse me of corruption?

651
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,690
You ungrateful bastard!

652
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:22,940
So you call collusion between officials
and businesspeople a good example?

653
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,740
Alright then! Now I understand.

654
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,110
I really wish you had never adopted me.

655
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,190
What the hell.

656
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:32,370
Yijie!

657
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,470
I'm sorry.

658
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:30,290
It's all because I was teasing you

659
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,940
that things turned out this way.

660
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,310
It's not your fault.

661
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:41,060
That situation was difficult,

662
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,310
with Chief Hu yapping there...

663
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:49,400
Sometimes I really wanted to do more,

664
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:56,300
but I was just a nurse.

665
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,530
But I'm not a nurse anymore.

666
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,640
Maybe it's for the best.

667
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,440
Anyway,

668
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:25,310
I guess I just don't fit in here.

669
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:36,690
So...

670
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:39,940
You're leaving?

671
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,080
What are you doing?

672
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,920
Let's leave this place together.

673
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,190
Why are you doing this?

674
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,390
Instead of staying here

675
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,160
and putting up
with all that crap and nonsense,

676
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:14,570
I might as well go back
to work at my brother's firm.

677
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:18,810
Besides,

678
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,560
if you're not here,

679
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,060
I don't have any reason to stay.

680
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,910
Well, maybe there is something.

681
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,480
I mean,

682
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,440
those two in my dorm.

683
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,090
Good thing it didn't leave a scar.

684
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,810
24681, 2464.

685
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,690
Good. Come on. 4,

686
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,760
1, 4.

687
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,310
414.

688
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,690
What does 414 mean?

689
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,520
Go to hell? (Pronounced similarly.)

690
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,050
Boo-boo.

691
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,080
It means "give it a try."
(Pronounced similarly as well.)

692
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,230
You're about to start
a new chapter in your life.

693
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:48,110
Go do something different.

694
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:51,250
Come work in my shop
as a regular employee, okay?

695
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,100
Okay.

696
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:52,940
Great.

697
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,270
Don't bother with that Warden anymore.

698
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,860
Tell him to go to hell.

699
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:58,920
Okay, Ms. Mona.
I've decided to stay and help.

700
00:31:58,970 --> 00:31:59,850
Very good.

701
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,390
Alright!

702
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,250
Everyone, I've officially
left the prison today!

703
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:04,910
Great.

704
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,530
Thank you all.

705
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,820
I, Yu Jiajun, will also quit my job today.

706
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:12,940
Are you serious?

707
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:13,690
Yes, I am serious.

708
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:16,310
At least work until the end
of this month or next month.

709
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,310
-The whole schedule will be messed up.
-Zhongwen,

710
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,570
there's no way.

711
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,200
No one can resist Xiaohui.

712
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,690
I can!

713
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,560
I just read your fortune.

714
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:27,830
It's 333 for Jiajun. What does that mean?

715
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:30,440
Three lifetimes of love.

716
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,310
Boo-boo.

717
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,550
Disgusting.

718
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,060
It means if you dare to bully Xiaohui,

719
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,100
you'll face a bloody disaster
within 3 months

720
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,980
and fall 3 points short
of passing your exam

721
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,440
-Alright, Ms. Mona.
-for 3 years.

722
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,770
-It's enough, Ms. Mona.
-She's jinxing him.

723
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:43,230
Stop scaring him.

724
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:45,730
Come on.

725
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:48,780
Thank you all
for the care you've given me these days.

726
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:51,310
Counselor,
thank you for speaking up for me.

727
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,440
Come on.

728
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:55,430
Senior, you did your best.

729
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:58,470
Yes, you did your best,
and that's what matters.

730
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,770
I'm doing well now.

731
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:00,970
Don't worry too much.

732
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,940
Xiaohui, good luck.

733
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,940
Come on, cheers.

734
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,060
Here we go.

735
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,940
Cheers.

736
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:11,100
So when did you and Xiaohui start dating?

737
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,810
Yeah, when did it start?

738
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:14,060
You never told us.

739
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,690
24 hours ago.

740
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,350
Jiang Yijie!

741
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,600
Mr. Jiang Yijie!

742
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:29,980
Jiang Yijie!

743
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,690
Stop!

744
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,310
Jiang...

745
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,140
Why do you run so fast?

746
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,700
I was about 500 meters away

747
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,220
when I shouted, "Jiang Yijie, stop."

748
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,850
Why did you keep running?

749
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,620
May I ask who you are?

750
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,940
I'm from the Anti-Corruption Unit,
the Central District Prosecutor's Office.

751
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,060
Let me show you my ID badge.

752
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,890
This is my badge.

753
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:01,270
VIP?

754
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,730
This is a karaoke club card.

755
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:06,860
The blue one.

756
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,760
Team Leader, Liu Junhao.

757
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:11,790
Nice to meet you.

758
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:12,940
Listen.

759
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:15,560
We're looking for you because we suspect

760
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,940
the Central Prison Warden,
Mr. Jiang Guocheng,

761
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,060
of corruption

762
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,690
related to the expansion project.

763
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:23,290
So we need you to come with us.

764
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:27,420
I can tell from your expression

765
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:29,190
that you have a lot to say, right?

766
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,050
It's okay.

767
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:33,949
The Anti-Corruption Unit will give you
a chance to talk. Come with me.

768
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:35,750
Thank you for your cooperation.

769
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,600
See if you know this person.

770
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,190
Is it a coincidence

771
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:41,190
that one person went in,
and two came out every time?

772
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,190
And there were always gifts.

773
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,460
Look at what he was holding.

774
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,960
Phoenix Beauty Salon.

775
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,710
Phoenix Beauty Salon.

776
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,260
This one was also Phoenix Beauty Salon.

777
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,440
What's the relationship between these two?

778
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,570
What a coincidence!

779
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,440
Don't just stare at him. Ask questions.

780
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,690
Let's begin then.

781
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,700
We reckon that Zhang Wenfeng is

782
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,560
suspected of bribing Jiang Guocheng,

783
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,310
using his position
to push forward projects

784
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,940
so that her company could make profits.

785
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,810
Come on. Let me introduce you.
This is Wenfeng.

786
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:06,850
I'm Zhang Wenfeng,

787
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,110
your father's junior.

788
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,890
And Zhang Wenfeng

789
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:11,810
established
a construction company this year,

790
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:14,310
right when Warden Jiang Guocheng was
pushing the expansion project.

791
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:16,220
The timing matches perfectly.

792
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,500
Is that a coincidence?

793
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,870
We're gathering evidence.

794
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,750
Zhang Wenfeng
has already been taken into custody.

795
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,630
For Jiang Guocheng's part,
we need your help.

796
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,670
The hard drive.
And don't let him touch anything.

797
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,550
Excuse me, Warden.

798
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,560
We're from the Anti-Corruption Unit,
Central District Prosecutor's Office.

799
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,350
We suspect you

800
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:47,020
of violating
the Government Procurement Law

801
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:47,770
and the Anti-Corruption Act.

802
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:48,810
You need to come with us.

803
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:50,670
Please don't touch anything now.

804
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,350
Search everywhere. Don't miss anything.

805
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:55,380
You know
Jiang Guocheng is my father, right?

806
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,060
Why do you think I would tell the truth?

807
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,560
Because, according to our information,

808
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,290
you're well-known at the Central Prison
for your personality.

809
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:03,050
I'm well-known for my personality?

810
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:04,050
Nitpicky.

811
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,030
It's meticulous.

812
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,210
Difficult to deal with.

813
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:08,620
It also means meticulous.

814
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,990
Overly critical.

815
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:10,710
Enough.

816
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,010
What? Do you want to pick a fight?

817
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:14,740
Anyway, we mean

818
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,190
we believe you're a person
with principles.

819
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,920
You will tell the truth, right?

820
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,810
Have you confirmed that my father

821
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,300
accepted bribes?

822
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,060
These are all what we've identified

823
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,990
as illegal gifts
received by Warden Jiang Guocheng.

824
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,460
We don't make subjective judgments.

825
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,320
Everything depends on evidence.

826
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:37,620
Check all the stuff.

827
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:41,480
About the decision-making process

828
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,560
for restricted bidding
in the expansion project case

829
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,890
and the meetings
between Jiang Guocheng and Zhang Wenfeng,

830
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,890
what else do you know?

831
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:52,710
This watch is for you.

832
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,840
Why are you suddenly giving me a watch?

833
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:56,560
A friend bought it for me.

834
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,310
I told her
my watch was still functioning well,

835
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:00,640
yet she insisted
on buying it for me. Oh...

836
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,870
Why is there a smell of perfume, Dad?

837
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:30,140
Warden Jiang Guocheng
from the Central District Prison was

838
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,120
subjected to a search
and questioning this morning,

839
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,280
suspected of using the expansion project
to benefit a construction company.

840
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,660
And that company is run

841
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:39,310
by none other than Zhang Wenfeng,
the female boss of the Pingyang Gang.

842
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:41,770
According to the investigation,
Zhang Wenfeng mainly runs beauty salons

843
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:43,520
-and entertainment venues.
-Boss.

844
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,600
She holds considerable influence locally.

845
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,580
Something's happened to your sister.

846
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:50,380
She maintains close ties
with both the underworld and authorities.

847
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,220
So...

848
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:57,090
This is what you wanted to tell us before.

849
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,800
What's this?

850
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,190
Stage 4 colon cancer?

851
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,800
Could this...

852
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,110
Could they have gotten it wrong?

853
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:36,730
How about checking with another hospital?

854
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:40,490
That's why I've worked so hard
to get points.

855
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,550
I want to hold my son in my arms

856
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:45,210
on the Family Visitation Day.

857
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,210
But now,

858
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:50,680
it's not that simple.

859
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:52,600
Boss, you...

860
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,280
Stop smoking.

861
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,060
Come on.

862
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:59,810
It's colon cancer, not lung cancer.

863
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,020
Are you crying?

864
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,210
Come on, stop crying.

865
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:23,810
Alright, stop crying.

866
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,250
[Central Desk]

867
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:29,750
Good morning, everyone.

868
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,310
I believe you've all

869
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:34,310
heard about the recent incident
at our prison.

870
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:36,440
Our warden, Mr. Jiang Guocheng...

871
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:40,280
Former Warden Jiang Guocheng is
involved in corruption charges.

872
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,810
The law enforcement officers are
currently investigating it.

873
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,110
I'm just as surprised as all of you.

874
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:49,060
But we still need to stay vigilant,

875
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,630
monitor the inmates carefully,

876
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:52,380
and do our jobs properly.

877
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,150
The warden position

878
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:56,450
will be temporarily filled
by our deputy warden.

879
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:57,310
Deputy Warden.

880
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:58,890
Thank you, everyone.

881
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:02,120
I also feel bad about what happened

882
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:04,100
with our former warden.

883
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:06,430
However,

884
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:08,340
the Central District Prison has always had

885
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:10,670
many bad practices that need correction.

886
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,990
Starting today,

887
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:14,980
I will tighten all the screws

888
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:17,560
in this prison one by one.

889
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:19,350
As for personnel matters,

890
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,080
there will be a small transfer.

891
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:21,960
Chief Hu.

892
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:22,760
Yes, Warden.

893
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:26,560
In our management team,

894
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,560
there has always been
an outstanding individual

895
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,190
who works diligently and responsibly,

896
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,190
fulfills his duties,

897
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,940
and strictly follows regulations.

898
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,810
This person,

899
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:34,480
starting tomorrow,

900
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,210
will be the Deputy Chief
of our Custody Division.

901
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:44,110
Counselor Jiang Yijie,

902
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,710
Deputy Chief Jiang, congratulations.
