Warden.

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,660
If I get the assessment report

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,370
done by a structural engineer
I'm acquainted with,

4
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,330
the remodeling application
will definitely be approved.

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,930
I want this to be
a hybrid space that integrates

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,750
as many factors as possible.

7
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:20,600
Sure.

8
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,360
Only in that way
can we all get a share of benefits.

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,900
What's up, Deputy Chief?

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:26,800
Warden.

11
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,120
Chief Hu.

12
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,330
Inmate 9568's medical report

13
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,890
from the second hospital is already out.

14
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,350
Why haven't you granted him
medical parole?

15
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,750
Given that Inmate 9568 has seriously
violated the rules

16
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,000
and lied too many times,

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,410
we must conduct careful reviews.

18
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,620
We might need a third hospital's opinion.

19
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,680
I know fairly well
this is a revengeful act out of spite.

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,140
But it doesn't matter now.

21
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,370
I'll try every channel of appeal

22
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,960
in the prison administration system
for Inmate 9568.

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,250
Let's see who will end up embarrassed,

24
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,100
you or me.

25
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,590
Deputy Chief Jiang Yijie,

26
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,360
you'd better know your position.

27
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,620
Are you threatening your superiors?

28
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,040
If I submit the report

29
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,640
about your negligence during custody duty
now,

30
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,640
you will receive

31
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,540
disciplinary punishment.

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,130
Have me punished me right now, please.

33
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,780
Are you declaring war on us?

34
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,220
My focus is the issue,
not specific individuals.

35
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,120
When the chief of general affairs
took kickbacks,

36
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,500
I guessed
some higher-ups must've profited.

37
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,500
Now it's very clear

38
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,740
that my father has nothing to do
with this matter.

39
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,450
I think

40
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,220
the investigation unit has realized

41
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,620
who exactly to look into.

42
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,330
Mickey Mouse.

43
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,250
What Mickey Mouse?

44
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,300
He didn't mean you.

45
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,240
You don't look like it.

46
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,110
I agree.

47
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,229
You look more like a guinea pig.

[OOPS! I'M IN JAIL]

49
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:01,620
[Episode 11]

50
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,400
Guys,

51
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,690
I'm sick of the prison system.

52
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,860
Inmate 9568 is so ill
that he's basically dying,

53
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,600
yet he's still not allowed
to meet his family.

54
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,060
Isn't it too harsh for him?

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,530
So, I'm planning to help him

56
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,310
take a self-initiated leave
from the prison.

57
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,070
Self-initiated?

58
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,340
Are you saying

59
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,660
he'll leave the prison on his own?

60
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,250
He'll just be out for a short while,

61
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,440
so he can hug his son.

62
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,750
Then, he'll be back to the prison.

63
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,350
Won't that be a prison break?

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,120
Don't get all worked up.

65
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm just raising a hypothesis.

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,750
Hypothesis?

67
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,160
Do you know the severity of it?

68
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,460
If caught,
you'll face more than dismissal.

69
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,790
It's just a hypothesis.

70
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,910
How are you going to help Inmate 9568

71
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,370
with his self-initiated leave from prison?

72
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,500
I've thought it through

73
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,500
and devised a perfect plan.

74
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,530
I'll bring Inmate 9568
to the vehicle check-up point

75
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,200
and find a way to get him out.

76
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,490
And then?

77
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:03,660
That's all.

78
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,870
"I'll bring Inmate 9568
to the vehicle check-up point."

79
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,530
You're so naive.

80
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,690
"And find a way to get him out."

81
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,960
Seventeen words.

82
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,250
What kind of crappy plan is that?

83
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,410
You really are amazing.

84
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,370
Quiet down.

85
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,120
Hear me out.

86
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,200
The Central Prison is a square area

87
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,870
surrounded by two walls.

88
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,890
The inner wall is 5 meters high,

89
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,490
while the outer one is 7 meters high.

90
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,490
Maybe someone is thinking about letting
Inmate 9568 leap over the walls

91
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,620
in a corner that cameras can't cover,

92
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,880
with blankets laid
on the high-voltage grids.

93
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,380
But Inmate 9568 has been having diarrhea.

94
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:38,409
I don't think it's possible
for him to climb over walls

95
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,620
or break through by force.

96
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,620
Yes. Also,
there are fewer and fewer blind spots,

97
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,880
and the alarm system
is getting better and better.

98
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,560
Ten years ago, an inmate

99
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:54,070
burst into the Custody Division for a gun
and a chance to break out of prison.

100
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,430
Chief Hu, you have a visitor.

101
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,050
Who is it?

102
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,900
I've hated you for a long time!

103
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:08,910
Senior.

104
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,720
That incident ended in a horrific way.

105
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,150
The inmate just raised the gun and...

106
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,050
Bang! Bang!

107
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,120
Breaking out of a modern prison
is extremely difficult.

108
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,120
We're not making a movie here,

109
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,950
so get those crazy ideas out of our minds.

110
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:35,620
Alright?

111
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,970
The vehicle check-up point
is usually visited

112
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:43,370
by produce trucks, cargo trucks,
garbage trucks,

113
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,750
and prison vans.

114
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,480
Prison vans...

115
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,970
We can get Inmate 9568 into a prison van.

116
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,040
And transfer him to another prison?

117
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,870
A produce truck or a cargo truck will do,

118
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,250
-right?
-The problem is,

119
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,000
the trucks come in fully loaded

120
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,750
and leave empty.

121
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,290
Where is he supposed to hide?

122
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,690
What about the lanterns?

123
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,330
The lanterns being sent out
are capable to hide a man, right?

124
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,500
That might work.

125
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,120
Let me be clear.

126
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,040
I'm only raising a hypothesis.

127
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,100
Just a hypothesis.

128
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,500
Hypothesis.

129
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,120
Only a hypothesis.

130
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,000
It's just a casual chat.

131
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,700
Suppose Inmate 9568

132
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,250
will be brought out
while hiding in a lantern.

133
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,620
So, first, we need to find

134
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,500
a lantern big enough to fit him in.

135
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,370
Then, we'll send him
to the Health Division.

136
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:29,350
You two will be responsible for
hiding him in a lantern.

137
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,420
If we are to send him
to the Health Division,

138
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,920
a body double of him
should be placed there in advance.

139
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,750
Or people will notice he's gone

140
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,440
missing.

141
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,240
Have a sidekick of his
wear his clothes as a disguise.

142
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,240
That should work.

143
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,159
Among all his sidekicks, I think

144
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:42,120
only Sunny can fit in his clothes.

145
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,500
It's okay. As long as they look alike.

146
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,870
The nurse is new to her job.

147
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,370
She probably won't notice.
We can dodge a bullet there.

148
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,120
-Good.
-But...

149
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,960
We two won't be assigned
to watch the lanterns, will we?

150
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,220
That part will probably covered by Shui.

151
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,000
Director Xiao will still
be in hospital by then.

152
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,010
The one
attending to the Central Desk will be...

153
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,190
[Central Desk]

154
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,000
-Shui.
-Shui.

155
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,750
Shui is terrible at management.

156
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,750
-We do stand a chance.
-This is going to work.

157
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,670
-It's a sure win.
-That's a real opportunity.

158
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,800
Have you forgotten about Jiang Yijie?

159
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,120
Why not just ask him if he'll join us?

160
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,910
-No!
-No!

161
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:14,580
No!

162
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,620
He won't join us.

163
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,160
One more obstacle to deal with.

164
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,230
Is there a way to distract him?

165
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,010
Usually, that's highly improbable.

166
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,130
But we may have a chance
on the Family Visitation Day.

167
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,910
That will be a busy day.

168
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So, this is what will happen that day—

169
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,370
Jiang Yijie will watch the venue,

170
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,370
while Shui will stay at the Central Desk.

171
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,750
And the two of you

172
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,250
will transport the lanterns.

173
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,120
Shun won't fight us
over such manual labor.

174
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,250
Take proactive action.

175
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,830
Weather through all adversities.

176
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,440
The day of greatest danger...

177
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,480
is the day of success!

178
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,170
Perfect!

179
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,659
Perfect!

180
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,730
You guys aren't serious, are you?

181
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:54,970
Yeah, this is

182
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,340
all hypothetical,

183
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,290
right?

184
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,250
Yes. It's all hypothetical.

185
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,890
-Just a hypothesis in a random chat.
-Right.

186
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,120
-It's all hypothetical.
-Okay. Enough said about it.

187
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,500
We're just chitchatting.

188
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,620
How can we possibly carry out

189
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,950
a prison break?
You think we're making a movie here?

190
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,120
You're overthinking it. Let's eat.

191
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,120
Does anyone want fried chicken?

192
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,910
Me!

193
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,250
Anything but fried chicken
with orange sauce.

194
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:14,870
Look,

195
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,410
when it's time to attack,

196
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,700
we'll hit it with rocks.

197
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,620
We'll just hit it...

198
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,200
-As we're doing it...
-Boss, don't!

199
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,540
Have you only watched one movie?

200
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,410
Boss...

201
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,910
We can crawl our way out.

202
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:24,500
You're also...

203
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:24,950
Don't!

204
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,250
You're also

205
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,000
-afraid to get dirty.
-What's going on?

206
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,660
Mind your health.

207
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,990
-What's going on here?
-Mind your health.

208
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Do you have a plan?

209
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,130
I'm planning to kill.

210
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,500
I'll help you.

211
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,820
But you must promise me one thing.

212
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,940
You must come back right away

213
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,420
after a hug with your son.

214
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:05,760
Gao Zhiyao.

215
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,290
Yes!

216
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,260
I'll be right back.

217
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,600
Deputy Chief.

218
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,180
Director Xiao's condition has stabilized.

219
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,610
When did that happen?

220
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,190
I was informed of it this morning.

221
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,830
I'll go visit him again.

222
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,870
Okay.

223
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,120
By the way,

224
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,000
I was wrong about Inmate 9568.

225
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,120
I believe letting him hug his son

226
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,720
will improve his condition.

227
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,750
It's an issue about human rights.

228
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,410
I know there are problems
with Deputy Warden's

229
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,520
current management style.

230
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,920
Please give me some time.

231
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,980
I believe I'll find a new balance

232
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,650
and a new way to work with our colleagues.

233
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,120
Thank you.

234
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,500
Thank your for your understanding,
Deputy Chief.

235
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,390
Trust me.

236
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,620
Let's all do our best.

237
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,830
Sure thing.

00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,100

for Mid-Autumn Family Visitation]

246
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,460
do you know where the duty roster

247
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,590
for the family visitation is?

248
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,340
I don't know.

With Director Xiao away,

00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,750
I really need everyone's help.

258
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,750
Senior...

259
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,660
Deputy Chief,
you got everything lined up perfectly.

260
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:08,700
Wait.

261
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:09,410
Zhiyao,

262
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:12,160
have you decided to help Inmate 9568?

263
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,060
Didn't you say it was just a hypothesis?

264
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,320
I'm being serious about it.

265
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,300
First, explain to us

266
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,190
what exactly your relationship
with Inmate 9568 is.

267
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,320
Do you owe him money?

268
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,580
I owe his sister money.

269
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,290
That's why Zhang Wenfeng

270
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,540
got me this job at the prison

271
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,340
to look after her brother as repayment.

272
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,090
However,

273
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,200
this temporary release

274
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,800
has nothing to do with money.

275
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,290
My debt to his sister
has already been settled.

276
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,550
I just can't bear to see

277
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,490
that he can't even hold his child.

278
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:45,080
You also have a child,
so you must understand.

279
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,610
You remember I have a child?

280
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,160
It's exactly because of Ningning

281
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,750
that I can't afford to be imprisoned.

282
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,790
You won't be imprisoned.

283
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,810
He said if anything went wrong,
he'd take it all on himself

284
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,340
and wouldn't implicate us.

285
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,920
I'm with Zhiyao on this.

286
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:58,570
Being unable
to hold your child is unbearable.

287
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,120
Inmate 9568 is
in the terminal stage of cancer.

288
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,320
I'm with Zhiyao, too.

289
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,710
I also support you.

290
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,410
I'm not getting involved
in any temporary release scheme.

291
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,620
I'm taking my leave.

292
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:16,230
Just take it as if I were never here,
we had never discussed this,

293
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,160
and I hadn't helped with anything.

294
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:19,870
Wang Zhongwen!

295
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,980
Wang Zhongwen.

296
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,080
When Inmate 7234 was
giving you a hard time,

297
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,140
it was Inmate 9568 who helped you out.

298
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,910
Anyway, Jiang Yijie knows

299
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,410
that I was sent here

300
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,170
to look after Inmate 9568.

301
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,330
If we really get caught,

302
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,620
just tell them I'm the mastermind.

303
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,540
Your nose is bleeding.

304
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,670

324
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,440
What's the plan?

325
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,090
Shui, I'll entrust

326
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,490
the Family Visitation Day's venue to you.

327
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,320
No problem.

328
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:41,120
And, Shun,
we're in charge of the Central Desk.

329
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,120
Okay.

330
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,830
And I'll leave the lantern to you two.

331
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:45,500
Got it.

332
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,200

00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,040
It's super fragile.

335
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,100
Understood, Shui. We'll be careful.

336
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,370
Also, we're still

337
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:53,160
so understaffed now.

338
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,290
So everyone, please be careful.

339
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,750
And let each other know
if you need anything.

feeling unwell

342

and needs to go to the Health Division.

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,100
-I'll go!
-I'll go!

344
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,310
Senior, leave it to me. I'll go handle it.

345
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,110
I'm the senior here, and I'll go.

346
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,790
Senior, don't you need to watch over

347
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,790
the Central Desk?

348
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,550
Just leave these chores to me.

349
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,170
I...

350
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,060
What?

351
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,290
Going to the Health Division
means you can slack off

352
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,470
and even read comics.

353
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,840
So cut it out.

354
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,080
You're not going.

355
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:20,830
I wasn't...

356
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,040
You think
I don't know what's in your mind?

357
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,160
Let Zhiyao go.

358
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:25,070
He's more familiar
with Inmate 9568 anyway.

359
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,600
But do you have enough time?

360
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,280
Sure, it's still early.

361
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,690
I'll escort Inmate 9568 first
and then go help with the lantern.

362
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,290
Thank you for your help then.

363
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,270
I'll go escort Inmate 9568 now.

364
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,310
See you later.

365
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,540
Don't you need to go find someone
to move the lantern?

366
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,400
See you around.

367
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,290
This is Zhiyao.
I'm going to escort Inmate 9568.

368
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,690
Oh, right. I need to find someone

369
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:46,760
to move the lantern.

370
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,720
Yes.

371
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,070
-Thank you.
-Be careful not to break it.

372
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,690
Shui, I'll leave this to you then.

373
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,770
No problem.

374
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,010
Let's go.

375
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:57,510
Let's go.

376
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:03,840
Okay, let me summarize
what you all just said.

377
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:08,140
I'll take Inmate 9568
to the Health Division.

378
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,470
As for Zhongwen...

379
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:12,340
Hey, you three.

380
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,040
Yes!

381
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,100
When he takes his sidekicks
to move the lantern,

382
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:23,170
they'll come to the Health Division
for the switch.

383
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:25,270
Then we'll take Inmate 9568

384
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,820
to hide inside the lantern.

385
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,700
Step by step,

386
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,640
without anyone noticing,

387
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,250
we'll drive him out!

388
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,120
Perfect!

389
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,030
You should be having a stomachache.

390
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,410
Give me your hand.

391
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,910
I felt dizzy after breakfast today.

392
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,790
I think my blood pressure is
getting too high.

393
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,060
That should be high blood sugar
after eating breakfast.

394
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,500
Really, my medical record shows
I have hypertension.

395
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,500
Then you should go
lie down for a while.

396
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:06,870
Stay still now.

397
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,370
I might really
need to lie down for some rest.

398
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,970
I feel like
my blood vessels are going to burst.

399
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:14,790
What's wrong?

400
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,920
My stomach feels a bit uncomfortable.

401
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,160
After changing clothes with your boss,

402
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,040
keep sleeping with your face down.

403
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,710
You must not let anyone see your face.

404
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:21,110
Hurry!

405
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,230
Hurry what?

406
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,000
What's wrong?

407
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,570
Oh, no! I need to use the bathroom.

408
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:32,070
Okay.

409
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,070
Hurry up.

410
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,290
Okay, let's go. Be careful.

411
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,120
It's coming out soon...

412
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,850
Can you do it?

413
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,010
Keep it down.

414
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,100
Okay, after using the bathroom,
go rest in Bed 1.

415
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,220
Nurse! The inmates are fighting!

416
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:47,950
Stop fighting!

417
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:48,910
-He hit me.
-Come on.

418
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,580
Stop fighting! Go sit over there.

419
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,250
Separate them.

420
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,160
Let me see.

421
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,290
I told you not to wear my slippers!

422
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,160
You ate my salted egg!

423
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,000
Stop arguing!

424
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,450
Help stop their bleeding now.

425
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,800
Get some tissues.

426
00:16:58,830 --> 00:16:59,830
Pinch your nose.

427
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,390
Breathe through your mouth.

428
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,830
And you. Let me see.

429
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,190
You, too.

430
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,150
Pinch your nose.

431
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,010
Breathe through your mouth.

432
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,200
Zhiyao, don't let her go over there.

433
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,700
Inmate 9568, are you okay?

434
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,450
I'm almost done.

435
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,109
Then go rest in Bed 1 later.

436
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,760
Nurse, nurse.

437
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:23,450
What? Is it still bleeding?

438
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,250
Let me see.

439
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,200
It seems to have stopped.

440
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:26,829
I'm fine.

441
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,830
Do you feel dizzy or discomfort?

442
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:30,990
No.

443
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:31,960
Any trouble breathing?

444
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,660
No.

445
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,080
How about you? Let me check.

446
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:38,510
Do you

447
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,940
have trouble breathing?

448
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,830
Do you?

449
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:42,830
No.

450
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,040
Alright. It's okay.

451
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,920
These two are fine.
You can take them back.

452
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,290
Sir.

453
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,660
For this kind of bleeding,
just handle it yourself next time, okay?

454
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,520
The nursing station is very busy.

455
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,180
-Nurse!
-Inmate 9568.

456
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,160
Nurse,

457
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,330
how is

458
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,160
9568's condition?

459
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,450
How did you get here so fast?

460
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,290
Are you okay?

461
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:05,910
You're fine?

462
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,110
-Have a rest.
-Nurse!

463
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,110
Let's not disturb his rest.

464
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,040
I'll leave him to you.

465
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,460
Okay.

466
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,080
This one.

467
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,120
Yes.

468
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,330
How do I get in?

469
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,460
They didn't tell me how to get in.

470
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:50,500
Tiantian.

471
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,570
Carry me.

472
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,270
Why are you still standing here?

473
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,130
Get in quickly.

474
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,000
How do I get in?

475
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,770
First, hold this carrot.

476
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,860
Tear the bottom part.

477
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,150
Your schlong?

478
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,540
It's a carrot.

479
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,560
Wa, it's ready. Enter from here.

480
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:10,880
Bear with it.

481
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,290
Wa, be careful.

482
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:16,950
Be careful.

483
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,000
Be careful.

484
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,920
Who's touching my butt?

485
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,400
Your shoulder.

486
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,470
Busybody Ze is coming.

487
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,660
We're doomed.

488
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:28,730
Senior.

489
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,120
-Hello.
-How are the lanterns?

490
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,120
It's fine.

491
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,650
What's going on down there?

492
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:33,660
Nothing.

493
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,290
Just some issues
with the light bulb wiring.

494
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:36,290
He's fixing it.

495
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,290
Do you need any help?

496
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,190
No need. He's a professional.

497
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,340
Just leave it to him.

498
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:44,000
The lanterns are really
getting bigger and bigger.

499
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,370
That's right.

500
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:46,570
It's big enough to hide a person inside—

501
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,080
The head is quite big too.

502
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,330
Yes.

503
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,260
It looks a little like a groundhog.

504
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,200
No, it's...

505
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,590
Jade Rabbit.

506
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,300
All right, carry on with your work.

507
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,170
Be careful when you move it later.

508
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,600
Thank you, Senior.

509
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,760
Thanks for your hard work, Senior.

510
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:05,560
Your nose is bleeding.

511
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,420
It's bleeding?

512
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,280
Wa.

513
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,050
Are you okay?

514
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,240
Yes.

515
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,420
Then get in quickly.

516
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,470
Wa, be careful.

517
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,660
Tiantian, if you touch my butt again,

518
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,040
I swear I'll beat you up.

519
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,680
And your foot too.

520
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,300
Quickly take him
to the vehicle check-up point.

521
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,970
Okay.

522
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I'll take this.

523
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,430
-Shun.
-Huh?

524
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:46,680
What's this?

525
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:47,560
A lizard?

526
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:49,890
It's Zhiming.

527
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,540
He's on a date with Chunjiao over there.

528
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,800
Get rid of it.

529
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,330
No need. It'll leave soon.

530
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,020
Zhiming! Zhiming!

531
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,230
Shoo!

532
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,120
Be careful, there's a dent here.

533
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:02,870
Okay.

534
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,890
Wait...

535
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:08,970
Wait.

536
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,580
Who made this lantern in the end?

537
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,600
Why does this rabbit look so creepy?

538
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,730
That thing in its hand is...

539
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,610
The shape is so weird.

540
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,420
It's so long.

541
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:25,390
How did this happen?

542
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,820
The hand broke off.

543
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,670
The hand can be detached?

544
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,600
Do you remember
how many people they took out in the end?

545
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,530
It seems like they're missing one.

546
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,930
Really? It was two.

547
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,340
It's always been two.

548
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,250
Two?

549
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,530
Yes.

550
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:41,790
Zhiyao.

551
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,470
Aren't you bringing too few people?

552
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,530
Be careful not to damage the lantern.

553
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:47,080
Zhiyao.

554
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,670
Is everything going smoothly on your end?

555
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:51,580
Uh, Deputy Section Chief,
Shui,

556
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:53,470
everyone is going fine.

557
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,410
I think I'll

558
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:58,330
come help you out
at the vehicle check-up point later.

559
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,200
The Education Division
has a lot of people lined up today.

560
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,080
During the performance later,

561
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,280
I should have time to slip away for a bit.

562
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,870
Uh, Shui,
there must be a lot to take care of

563
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,040
at today's Family Visitation Day.

564
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,160
Leave the lanterns to us.

565
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,790
We'll protect them with our lives.

566
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:10,290
Don't worry.

567
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:10,790
Yao,

568
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:11,910
let Shui guide you.

569
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,200
He is more familiar with it.

570
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,160
After he shows you how it's done,

571
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,490
it'll be easier for you
to handle it later.

572
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,960
What should we do?

573
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:21,540
Got it.

574
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,680
Wait.

575
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,550
What's wrong?

576
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,140
What's the matter?

577
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:34,780
My stomach hurts.

578
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,290
I can't.

579
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:36,370
Hold it in.

580
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,400
Shui is coming.

581
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,230
Otherwise we'll blow our cover.

582
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,100
Meat Soup.

583
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,060
Yes.

584
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,490
Tell everyone to make some noise.

585
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:45,360
Make noise?

586
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:46,480
I'll tell everyone to make noise
in the cell.

587
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,010
Making noise won't work now.
They won't pay attention to you.

588
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:48,630
Right.

589
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,590
That won't work.

590
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,510
Start a fire.

591
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,910
If the dormitory really catches fire,

592
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,840
we'll all end up as roast chickens.

593
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,320
No way.

594
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,140
Water-based fumigation insecticide.

595
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,410
I have two in my cabinet.

596
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:02,410
If we use those...

597
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:03,540
Yes, Wa,

598
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,910
the smoke would be really thick with that.

599
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,640
-Yes, that sounds good.
-Gosh, it hurts.

600
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,900
Okay, here's the plan:

601
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,640
Zhongwen,

602
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,040
you set off the smoke to distract Shui,

603
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,200
then we'll move Wa quickly

604
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,410
onto the vehicle.

605
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,350
Do I have to go alone?

606
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,290
What, should we wait for your mom to come?

607
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,830
Zhongwen, we're counting on you now.

608
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:18,770
Can I really do it?

609
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:19,850
Please.

610
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:20,910
It's on you now.

611
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:21,910
For the walkie-talkie code,

612
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,910
if everything goes well,
the signal will be...

613
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:24,640
"psst psst."

614
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,580
-"Psst psst."
-If there's a problem,

615
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,840
it will be "pfft pfft."

616
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,700
If it goes well?

617
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,450
"Psst psst."

618
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,120
If there's a problem?

619
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:30,870
"Pfft pfft."

620
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,160
We're counting on you.

621
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:33,500
Okay.

622
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,830
Zhongwen can do it.

623
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,710
Let's go.

624
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:41,010
Is Zhongwen gay?

625
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,660
He's not.

626
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,480
He has a wife.

627
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,650
He doesn't look like one.

628
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:45,440
I'm...

629
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,090
the one who's gay.

630
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,160
The Director has arrived.

631
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:49,760
Copy that.

632
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:51,100
The Director is coming.

633
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,100
Hello, Director!

634
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,010
-Hello, Director.
-Hi.

635
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:55,540
Officer.

636
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,970
This way please.

637
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:03,210
Instructor, I'll leave this to you.

638
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,610
Those two rookies...

639
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,300
I don't trust them. I'll go check.

640
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,050
Okay.

641
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:25,790
Shun.

642
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:29,290
Isn't that Zhongwen
in the central hallway?

643
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:30,190
Yes, it is.

644
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,450
What's he doing there?

645
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:34,980
Yeah, right.

646
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:37,040
Wasn't he moving the lanterns?

647
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,700
Where is he?

648
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:39,620
There's a small blind spot over there.

649
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:42,280
Cameras can't see it.
Perfect for slacking off.

650
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,830
So you often slack off there too?

651
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,190
No.

652
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,810
Of course not. I'll call him.

653
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:50,920
It's fine.

654
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:52,600
I'll go check.

655
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,210
You watch this area.

656
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,660
Sure.

657
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,340
Okay.

658
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,690
Zhongwen, rest in peace.

659
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,290
I can't save you anymore.

660
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,800
Careful!

661
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,190
Security camera!

662
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,980
Turn!

663
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,010
Wait.

664
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:13,660
Boss, what's wrong?

665
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,800
Can we use the bathroom first?

666
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,540
Are you serious?

667
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,140
We're about to get to the car.

668
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,790
I need to poop right now.

669
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,000
Let Wa go to the bathroom.

670
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,330
Let him use the bathroom first.

671
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,550
Let's go over there first
then figure something out.

672
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,300
It's coming out! What plan?

673
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:30,200
-You go in first.
-Let him go to the toilet first.

674
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:34,920
We need to get to
the vehicle check-up point before Shui!

675
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,820
Wang Zhongwen, what are you doing now?

676
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,990
What are you doing?

677
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,070
Miss Fang, why are you here?

678
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,610
I just saw you running.

679
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,550
Shui said
he was going to move the lanterns.

680
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,550
What are you going to do?

681
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,580
Didn't you say it wasn't your business?

682
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,310
Can't I just show some concern?

683
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,640
I don't know what
to do about Shui's situation either.

684
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,010
Jiang Yijie.

685
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,040
Zhongwen.

686
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:00,930
What are you doing?

687
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,020
Deputy Chief.

688
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,910
I'm fumigating.

689
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,210
There are so many bugs here.

690
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:06,910
Slacking off?

691
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,080
No.

692
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:12,380
Deputy Chief,
you understand what a father feels, right?

693
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,320
Fumigation? What's this for?

694
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,120
I just thought there were

695
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,790
a lot of bugs here,
so I thought I'd fumigate them.

696
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,480
Wasn't he moving the lanterns?

697
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,940
Who asked you to come here?

698
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,820
You're not going to fire me, are you?

699
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,940
What on earth are you talking about?

700
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,780
Are you okay?

701
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:49,310
We don't have time!

702
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,660
We need to go
to the vehicle check-up point!

703
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,290
Let him go to the bathroom!

704
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,410
We won't have time!

705
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:54,160
We can't wait!

706
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,090
What can't wait?

707
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,200
Hurry up!

708
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,510
Zhongwen!

709
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,420
Pfft pfft! Fumigation pfft!

710
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,690
Zhongwen, don't run!

711
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,220
Meat Soup!

712
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:05,960
Tiantian!

713
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,160
Wa!

714
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,710
Wa, are you alright?

715
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,060
What's "pfft pfft, fumigation pfft"?

716
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,510
Sir, I'm on it!

717
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,160
I'm taking care

718
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:45,790
of it.

719
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,540
Go find out what's happening quickly!

720
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:51,270
The officers are all happy,
don't mess things up!

721
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,640
Master Jiu.

722
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,790
Hello.

723
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,660
Zhongwen, come out! What are you doing?

724
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,290
Many people have complained
about the bugs there before,

725
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:08,040
so I thought I'd get rid of them.

726
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,290
Why are you fumigating for no reason?

727
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:10,910
Shouldn't you
be moving lanterns with Gao Zhiyao?

728
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:12,410
My stomach suddenly feels terrible.

729
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:13,410
I need to use the bathroom.

730
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:15,040
Are you going to come out
and explain clearly?

731
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,410
My stomach hurts so much I can't come out.

732
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,910
I must have been infected by Inmate 9568.

733
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:21,140
What Inmate 9568?

734
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:23,770
Isn't he supposed
to be in the Health Division?

735
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:24,980
Health Division!

736
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:26,380
Is 9568 there?

737
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:27,410
Reply if you hear me.

738
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:28,200
What do I do?

739
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:32,190
Did you say 95 or 98?

740
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,670
9568.

741
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,530
Okay, I'll verify.

742
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,040
Gao Zhiyao, where are you?

743
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,340
What's wrong?

744
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:44,800
You're just in time.

745
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,340
Zhongwen won't come out.

746
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,330
Keep an eye on him for me.

747
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:48,580
Okay.

748
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,410
Thanks.

749
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,790
Zhongwen,

750
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,660
it's me.

751
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,200
It's me.

752
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,160
Is Yijie gone?

753
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,160
He's gone.

754
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:05,910
-What's going on?
-It's over.

755
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,290
I'll be arrested.

756
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,460
The plan has failed.

757
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,550
Reporting, Deputy Chief.

758
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,540
We have a problem with the lanterns.

759
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,000
We're not going out today.

760
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,550
Not going out?

761
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:21,080
Zhiyao.

762
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,090
You took Inmate 9568
to the Health Division, right?

763
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:24,550
He's there now, right?

764
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,750
Yes, I took him to the Health Division.

765
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,660
Are you sure?

766
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,710
Wa, do you feel better?

767
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:36,120
He's still there.

768
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,090
We've completely failed.

769
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,380
The vehicle check-up point
is right ahead.

770
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,120
That's it.

771
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,820
You all go back.

772
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:54,340
If we get caught,

773
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:55,810
they'll extend your sentences.

774
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:56,450
Don't say that.

775
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:57,790
I'll find another way to escape.

776
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:58,950
Don't.

777
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,790
I remember,

778
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,020
the check-up point has two gates.

779
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:11,600
The switch is just beside them.

780
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,540
But if that's the case,

781
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:16,860
if a guard gets taken hostage,

782
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,660
then prisoners

783
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,780
would have a chance
to escape on their own.

784
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:24,510
Later, the Central Prison changed that.

785
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,980
To open the gate
at the vehicle check-up point,

786
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:30,840
one must call the Central Desk.

787
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,270
Calling Central Desk.

788
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,860
Vehicle check-up point
eequesting permission to open.

789
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,860
Copy that.

790
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,540
If the Central Desk sees no issues,

791
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,380
then will they open the doors.

792
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:45,830
I've been here so long,

793
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,500
but I've never seen anyone
check the slop buckets.

794
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,440
The driver will be here soon.

795
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,440
Don't worry.

796
00:30:58,330 --> 00:30:59,660
Cameras can't see here.

797
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,500
It's filthy.

798
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,920
The slop is really dirty.

799
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:03,880
It's all greasy.

800
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,940
Boss, what are you thinking?

801
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:11,210
Boss, don't!

802
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:11,870
That's slop water!

803
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,290
This is my only way out now.

804
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,160
Don't do it!

805
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,860
There are other ways!

806
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,810
Let me spray some alcohol for you.

807
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:49,980
We have to add more.

808
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,210
-Sorry, Wa!
-More?

809
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,440
Bear with it a little.

810
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,690
Master Jiu, that's enough!

811
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,220
No more!

812
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:18,250
That's enough!

813
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,140
Don't move.

814
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,550
Nurse, have you seen 9568?

815
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:23,520
Zhang Longji? Chihuahua?

816
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,380
The one with terminal cancer.

817
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,260
He's in bed one.

818
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:26,040
Bed one?

819
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,240
9568.

820
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,410
9568.

821
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,590
Sir, he says he's not feeling well.

822
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:39,970
9568?

823
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,640
Stop pretending.

824
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:47,680
Who are you?

825
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,550
7392.

826
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,850
Why are you wearing 9568's clothes?

827
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:52,560
I...

828
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,010
I am 9568.

829
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:56,070
Where is Zhang Longji?

830
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,160
Sir, you...

831
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,500
Sir, why don't you understand?

832
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,040
I am 9568!

833
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,910
-What do I need to know?
-You need to understand.

834
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:02,710
Do you believe I can keep you locked up
until you die?

835
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,500
I really am—

836
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,430
Huh?

837
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,200
What's wrong?

838
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:10,790
Hey, inmate.

839
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:15,470
Why am I here?

840
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,290
Why am I here? How did I...

841
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,260
Did you see him?

842
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,090
Why am I wearing Boss's clothes?

843
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:24,370
The health post needs backup.

844
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:26,170
Take 7392 back to his cell first.

845
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,140
Attention everyone,

846
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,260
report immediately
if you see prisoner 9568.

847
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,500
I was in such a hurry this morning,
so I put on the wrong clothes.

848
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,500
Keep an eye on him.

849
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,390
Gao Zhiyao!

850
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:40,570
Where is 9568?

851
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,580
He's not in the Health Division.
Where did he go?

852
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,240
Master Jiu.

853
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:43,900
Gao Zhiyao!

854
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,120
Was that radio call
about finding 9568?

855
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,170
Yes.

856
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:49,300
9568 is missing.

857
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:51,330
Can you help me with one more thing?

858
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,380
Sure, go ahead.

859
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:56,410
Shun, check the surveillance footage

860
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,160
for any prisoners moving alone.

861
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,320
Look carefully.

862
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,320
No, Deputy Chief.

863
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:04,660
When was the last time

864
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,540
you saw 9568?

865
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:07,660
When?

866
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:09,320
When?

867
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:12,880
Jiang Yijie, what are you talking about?

868
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,739
What's going on with 9568?

869
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:14,739
Chief,

870
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,840
9568 pulled something
and disappeared.

871
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,250
Bullshit! That's impossible.

872
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:20,040
The alarms
and electric fence didn't go off,

873
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,239
which means he's still within the walls.

874
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,040
It's raining.

875
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:26,340
Why are there so many problems?

876
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:27,790
Jiang Yijie,

877
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:29,870
you must find him

878
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:31,060
before the event ends.

879
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,120
Do you understand?

880
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:36,469
Yes, I'm already looking.

881
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:42,659
Please sign for this.

882
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:43,159
Okay.

883
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:46,840
Ze.

884
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,920
Have you seen 9568?

885
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,750
No.

886
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,179
Excuse me, I need to check this.

887
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:52,710
I've already checked this.

888
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:58,410
And that area too.

889
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,410
Sorry about that.

890
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:10,740
Why?

891
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,290
Are you hungry?

892
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,810
This isn't edible.

893
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:18,250
Not edible.

894
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,520
Do you want to try the second bucket?

895
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,520
The second one has soup
and tastes even better. Try it.

896
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,420
How is it?

897
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,540
Are you done?

898
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:03,260
Yes, thank you.

899
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:06,350
It's just a slop bucket.
How could anyone hide in there?

900
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,720
Seriously.

901
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,610
How could anyone possibly hide in there?

902
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:11,090
Didn't even put the lid back properly.

903
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:12,170
Jeez.

904
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:17,290
Deputy Chief.

905
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,450
There's something strange.

906
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:21,660
Go on.

907
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:26,150
The lantern that Zhiyao's team was pushing
was left at the kitchen.

908
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,280
Gao Zhiyao.

909
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,320
The lantern is in the kitchen.

910
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,970
That means they didn't fail.

911
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:38,100
So where did they go?

912
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:45,050
Master Jiu, why are you here?

913
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,220
That rookie...

914
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,450
Keep your voice down.

915
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,210
That rookie and Chihuahua...

916
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,340
The two of them...

917
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,370
They're hiding in...

918
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:54,530
Take your time. Deep breath.

919
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,290
Speak slowly.

920
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:56,000
That's it.

921
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,660
The two of them
are hiding in the slop buckets.

922
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,670
Slop buckets?

923
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:03,940
What are those?

924
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,660
The food waste bins.

925
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,080
-Food waste bins?
-In the food waste bins?

926
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:08,790
Yes.

927
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:12,590
Anyway, they've already
dunked their heads in.

928
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:14,350
I've never seen anyone here
with such courage.

929
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:15,790
They definitely deserve praise.

930
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:17,040
My task is complete.

931
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,120
I'll go now.

932
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,120
I couldn't understand
the last few lines he said.

933
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,290
Me neither.

934
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,760
Have you thought about

935
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,180
what you'll say
to your son when you get out?

936
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,740
He's only a month old.

937
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:36,950
What can I say?

938
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,370
Will I be able to carry him?

939
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,050
You definitely will!

940
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,000
After all this mess,

941
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:47,660
you have to.

942
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:50,540
Definitely.

943
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,410
Gao Zhiyao!

944
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:03,540
Complete lockdown!

945
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:05,410
Everyone listen up! Complete lockdown!

946
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:06,830
No personnel or vehicles in or out.

947
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:07,870
Full lockdown!

948
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:09,660
Shui, are you
at the vehicle check-up point?

949
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,790
I'm here.

950
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,660
A food waste truck
will be going through soon.

951
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,040
Check it again for me.

952
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,660
No one would hide in the slop bucket.

953
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,790
Shui, please check it one more time.

954
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:20,290
Roger!

955
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,310
I'm heading there right now.

956
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:23,690
We're dead.

957
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,220
What if he gets caught?

958
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,880
Who would be so crazy

959
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:32,520
to hide in a slop bucket?

960
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,390
Alright, come on.

961
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:37,540
You can proceed.

962
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:39,810
Come on.

963
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:45,770
Move it.

964
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,720
Up ahead.

965
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,160
Okay, stop.

966
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:54,660
Open sesame.

967
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,590
Sorry, we have a situation today.

968
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,850
What? Can't leave now?

969
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,930
Right. Turn off your engine first.

970
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:00,910
Get out. Hurry.

971
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,490
Another situation?

972
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,980
Can you open the back for me?

973
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,910
Hey, you've already checked twice.

974
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:08,640
I need to check the slop bucket.

975
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:10,290
What's going on?

976
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,910
I keep getting checked.

977
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:13,790
A prisoner has gone missing.

978
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:16,110
They told me to check thoroughly.

979
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:17,200
Okay.

980
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,200
Please cooperate.

981
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,330
Fine, just a moment.

982
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:21,200
Careful.

983
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,380
These prisoners...

984
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,140
They're always up to something.

985
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,450
So, what now?

986
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,480
Is the prisoner chopped into pieces

987
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,870
in my slop bucket now?

988
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,840
Damn, what kind of movies do you watch?

989
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:37,770
That's not how our story normally goes.

990
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:38,790
Understood.
