00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,790
Deputy Warden, may I ask
why I was promoted?

3
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,200
We've been working together
for some time now.

4
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,710
I know your character

5
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,660
very well.

6
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:36,910
When your father got into trouble,

7
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,770
not only were you not implicated,

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,910
but you even went to testify as a witness.

9
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,360
Everyone can see

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,500
your integrity and righteousness.

11
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,370
Come here.

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,730
Help me massage it a bit.

13
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,200
Come here. Come on.

14
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:51,740
Let me tell you,

15
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,300
frankly speaking,

16
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,570
your father's ideas are too outdated.

17
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,340
I've brought you into management

18
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,440
because I believe with your efforts,

19
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,280
the Custody Division
can become more efficient,

20
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,100
and the inmates can be more disciplined.

21
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:09,850
Yeah, that's the spot.

22
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:11,870
Those with connections,

23
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,200
like Inmate 9568, should all
be handled properly.

24
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,470
Don't let him fool you.

25
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,940
I heard his cancer report

26
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,180
was forged by his sister
in collusion with a hospital.

27
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,800
Go verify it.

28
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,200

00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,550
Good day, Deputy Chief.

37
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,040
No need to salute like that normally.

38
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,820
This is a matter of respect, okay?

39
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,350
Good boy.

40
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,450
What did Deputy Warden say to you?

41
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,120
Listen.

42
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,270
I know you're not scheming,

43
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,730
but he's different—he's very calculating.

44
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:33,480
Director,

45
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,110
what do you mean he's calculating?

46
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,040
What do you think?

47
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,730
He just replaced his father

48
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,790
and immediately promoted him.

49
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,660
What do you think that's about?

50
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,910
He's just trying to show

51
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,790
everyone in the prison

52
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,790

between reward and punishment.

54
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,260
I don't care what he's thinking,

55
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,970
but I know exactly what I want to do.

56
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,220
Fine, I know what you want to say.

57
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,590
You want to make changes, I understand,

58
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,830
but things aren't as simple as you think.

59
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,730
If you make changes,
you might disrupt the current balance,

00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,790

It's either stomach pain
or high blood pressure.

You've been timing it with
your wife's ovulation period.

91

Now that she's successfully pregnant,

what else are you up to?

93
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:37,820

How do you know he's not lying to you?

100
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,600
Maybe even his cancer report was bought.

101

What nonsense are you talking about now?

102
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,720
Let me ask you, would you be
the kind of person who rats someone out?

103
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,810
Telling on your own father
and getting him locked up—

104
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,690
that's something only a beast would do.

105
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,790
No wonder everyone in the Central Prison
resents you.

106
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,910
What a nuisance.

107
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,960
I used to think you were handsome.
You're actually really ugly.

108

This fish?

135
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,400
There's no rule against keeping fish,
is there?

136
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,910
There's no rule
saying you can keep fish either.

137
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:09,710
Confiscated.

138
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:13,420
And this.

139
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,940
Darn you. Don't touch my photo.

140
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,410
Then have your family

141
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,290
bring it in through proper channels.

142
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,690
Right now, this is considered contraband.

143
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,370
Zhiyao, confiscate it.

144
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,350
What are you waiting for? Confiscate it.

145
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:35,909
Inmate 9568.

146
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,670
You have so many contraband items here.

attend family visitations anymore.

149

Also, as for your medical parole,

150
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,680
I will review it strictly.

151
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,659
Get moving.

152
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,340

Hello?

154
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,300
How is it?

155
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,799
Is that buddy handsome?

156
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,809
Even more handsome than you.

157
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,299
Is his dick big?

158
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,070
It's as small as yours.

159
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,590
Then it's very big.

160
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,130
It hurt so much.

161
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,810
You have to make it up to me.

162
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,720
Alright.

163
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,820
I'm trying to find a way to get out.

164
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,090
Once I get out,

165
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,200
I'll make it up to you properly.

166
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,160
Be good.

167
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,300
Apply properly for medical parole
and get treatment.

168
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,550
Don't mess around in there.

169
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,480
I'm dying from anxiety
because of you every day.

170
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,900
I'm already dying.

171
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,800
I can't wait anymore.

172
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:08,910
I want to get out
and be with you right now.

173
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,970
I just want to hold that little buddy.

174
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,750
Don't do anything reckless.

175
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,870
You know what?

176
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,410
I know a doctor in Taipei.

177
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:16,680
I heard he's very good.

178
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,410
You should go see him.

179
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,910
Are you crying?

180
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,330
I've already told you

181
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,660
they've got their eye on me now.

182
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,410
There's no more medical parole, okay?

183
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,290
I'd rather get out and die freely

184
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,690
than stay in here
and be mistreated by them.

185
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:32,930
Hello?

186
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,030
Hello?

187
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,650
Did you hear me?

188
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:39,730
Hello?

189
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,230
Say something.

190
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:42,850
Zhang Longji!

191
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,160
I was only speaking to you nicely

192
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,320
because you're not feeling well.

193
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,700
What nonsense were you

194
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,050
talking about just now?

195
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,290
Let me tell you,
you're really asking for trouble.

196
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,040
You just wouldn't listen
when I talk nicely to you.

197
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,160
Do I have to be this harsh with you?

198
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,050
Alright,

199
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:53,910
I'll call you again later.

200
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,970
Seriously, I swear... Call me again?

201
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,640
So will you move back home?

202
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,760
No way.

203
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,790
I'll rent my own place.

204
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,740
You can come back whenever you want.

205
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,540
You're always welcome here.

206
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,550
Zhongwen, your instant noodles.

207
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,290
It's already my last day here.

208
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,500
-Do I not even have the right
-Alright.

209
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,630
-to eat instant noodles?
-Wait for me.

210
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,550
Alright, let's have a toast.

211
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:28,970
Cheers with the bowl.

212
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,300
Cheers with the bowl.

213
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,500
Cheers with the bowl.

214
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,690
So many things happened
in the blink of an eye.

215
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,940
You and Xiaohui are leaving,

216
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,870
the warden has been replaced,

217
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,340
and the counselor has become Deputy Chief.

218
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,220
Also, as soon as he came in today,

219
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,550
he started talking about making changes.

220
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:48,210
Feels like everyone needs to adjust
and learn to work together again.

221
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,750
And Inmate 9568 is really done for.

222
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,290
His sister was arrested.

223
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,820
Probably no one will
look out for him anymore.

224
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,700
And he's really pitiful.

225
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,230
He already has cancer,
and now he's targeted.

226
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,800
Jiajun, let me ask you something.

227
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,300
If Zhang Wenfeng is imprisoned,

228
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:13,460
do the people who owe her money
still have to pay her back?

229
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,610
Of course they do.

230
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,440
It's not like she's dead.

231
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,180
So how long will Zhang Wenfeng
be locked up?

232
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,180
I'm not a judge, how would I know?

233
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,320
I haven't even passed the bar exam.

234
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,080
However,

235
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,450
the presumption of innocence
requires evidence.

236
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,600
She might end up being fine.

237
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,680
Why? Do you like her?

238
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,200
Huh? Don't make me laugh.

239
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,210
Zhiyao,

240
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,620
why are you so interested in Inmate 9568

241
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,410
and Zhang Wenfeng?

242
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,750
I'm not. It's just that...

243
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,330
Inmate 9568 helped us before.

244
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,860
Just showing some concern.

245
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,910
Remember our first day here?

246
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,210
We were completely scared.

247
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,410
And I was even...

248
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:12,650
He was possessed by an evil spirit.

249
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,040
You had a nosebleed.

250
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,290
And I had a runny nose.

251
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,300
It was hilarious.

252
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,180
When you were short-staffed,

253
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,480
collecting those things

254
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,230
always went past 8 PM.

255
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,860
You borrowed our staff,

256
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,120
and now we have to work until 9 PM.

257
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,860
Our people basically
have no personal time at all!

258
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm just restoring the staffing structure

259
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,200
to its original form.

260
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,800
Master Jiu, have you considered that...

261
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,330
That it might be an efficiency issue?

262
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,100
Now you're talking about efficiency?

263
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,040
You keep changing things back and forth,

264
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,540
and now you're talking about efficiency?

265
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,840
Fine. Then let's not do anything at all.

266
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,100
Don't cook! Don't eat!

267
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,290
Let's just eat slop instead!

268
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,350
Come on, don't talk like that, okay?

269
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,230
This is just the new regulation.

270
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,540
Everyone just needs some time

271
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,160
to get used to it.

272
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,540
I'll try to figure something out

273
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,290
and see if other inmates can help.

274
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,910
If they don't cooperate,
we'll have to deduct points.

275
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,970
What else can we do?

276
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,100
So everything leads to
point deduction now?

277
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,300
What's your problem?

278
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,800
Show some respect
when talking to a CO, okay?

279
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,530
What do you think this place is?

280
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,970
Pick that up!

281
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,830
You'll be the first one to lose points!

282
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:14,960
Alright. It's okay.

283
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,130
Master Jiu.

284
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:19,030
I'm sorry.
Please give me a little more time.

285
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,620
We'll make adjustments
as soon as possible.

286
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,480
If there's a better way to do this,

287
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,360
we can change it anytime.

288
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,900
Please put up with it for the moment.

289
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,250
Zhongyi, take Master Jiu back.

290
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,350
Thank you for your hard work.

291
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,930
Senior.

292
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,100
If there are any more issues
in the canteen,

293
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,730
please let me know anytime.

294
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,670
Let's leave it for now.

295
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,880
I'll get back to work.

296
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:49,950
Pardon me.

297
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:58,290
Are you done? What are you staring at?

298
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,820
Do you have a problem?

299
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:02,850
Director.

300
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,040
I heard that Inmate 9568's

301
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,970
medical parole was rejected. Why?

302
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,300
He was causing
all sorts of trouble before,

303
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,150
getting involved in various issues.

304
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,290
So of course
it's hard to pass the review now.

305
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,040
But doesn't he have cancer?

306
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:17,070
Yeah. If his cancer is real,

307
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,890
it will be approved eventually.

308
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,270
Just put it there.

309
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,870
Run.

310
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,010
Officer,

311
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,770
can we talk to Boss for a moment?

312
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,600
Thanks.

313
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:21,640
Boss.

314
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,440
Are you okay?

315
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,490
Is that okay?

316
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,490
It's just for a moment.

317
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,250
They've banned me from family visitations

318
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,150
and meetings,

319
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,650
and they even blocked my medical parole.

320
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,390
That's ridiculous.

321
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,810
What are you going to do then?

322
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,560
You need medical treatment.

323
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,760
No use thinking about that.

324
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,490
I'm thinking of another way.

325
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,160
What do you mean?

326
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,630
Boss, are you planning to
break out of prison?

327
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,410
What's happening?

328
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,380
The way they're targeting me now,

329
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,940
I'll die in here sooner or later.

330
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,290
So no matter what, I have to get out

331
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,250
and see my son.

332
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,680
But I'm being watched closely now.

333
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,680
The Custody Division's duty roster
has become very tight.

334
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:18,840
It's won't be easy.

335
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,790
So

336
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,960
I need you guys

337
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,030
to help me out.

338
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,170
Boss.

339
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,570
To be honest, I knew this day would come.

340
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,080
I have a wild idea

341
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,250
that might help you.

342
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,670
Look,

343
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,350
this prison

344
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,070
is heavily guarded,

345
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,500
but all you see is what's above ground.

346
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,980
Boss, we can go underground.

347
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,600
I checked the workshop.

348
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,000
There are some tools there

349
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
that we might be able to
smuggle into our cells.

350
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,510
But they'll search everywhere
if even one tool goes missing.

351
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,260
We'll figure something out.

352
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:09,040
The three of us can help Boss
dig a tunnel.

353
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,089
We can take shifts digging 24 hours a day,

354
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:14,119
then put the dirt in our pockets

355
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:15,500
and dispose of it outside.

356
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,750
Once the tunnel is complete...

357
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,119
I know that movie very well.

358
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,869
You think I haven't seen
"The Shawshank Redemption?"

359
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:21,750
I did say it was a wild idea.

360
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:24,550
What's the situation here?

361
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,050
Officer, please give us a hand.

362
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,400
Even his medical parole requests
have been blocked.

363
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,130
It's a matter of life and death.

364
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,780
Please help him.

365
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,250
Please.

366
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:37,870
We'll take care of it.

367
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,950
Now get back to
whatever you should be doing.

368
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,670
Inmate 9568, are you okay?

369
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:14,130
Do you need to use the bathroom
or go to the Health Division?

370
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:15,120
No need.

371
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,350
Wa, what's wrong?

372
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,360
Wa?

373
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,460
It hurts.

374
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,500
-What?
-It hurts.

375
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,600
My stomach.

376
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,630
Wa, are you okay?

377
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,470
No.

378
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,770
What's happening?

379
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:22,650
He...

380
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,490
Quick, get him to the Health Division.

381
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,350
Okay.

382
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,270
Come on.

383
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,890
I can't.

384
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,960
I can't walk.

385
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,010
Go get a wheelchair!

386
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,790
Okay.

387
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,900
Give me back

388
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,610
my son's photo.

389
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,750
My son's photo!

390
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:04,630
Do I really have to die

391
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,120
for you to believe me?

392
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,680
[Warden]

393
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,970
Inmate 9568 doesn't seem to be faking it,
right?

394
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,250
[Maintain Proper Appearance]

395
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,780
He's still alive, isn't he?

396
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,330
What if this leads to another death?

397
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,520
Don't worry.

398
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,730
If anything happens,
just let Jiang Yijie take the blame.

399
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:26,330
By the way,

400
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:27,770
about the executive assistant,

401
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,510
make sure to cover it up completely,

402
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,670
send him to the minimum-security prison,

403
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,130
and comfort him properly.

404
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,640
He'll contact the representatives

405
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,850
to secure our expansion project.

406
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:40,250
We can also replace the contractor
with our own people.

407
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,070
Got it.

408
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,660
Once I officially become the warden,

409
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,030
you'll be my secretary.

410
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,100
Come at the same time next week
for our health session.

411
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,400
Yes, Warden.

412
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,050
Good health.

413
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:57,680
Alright.

414
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,250
Good health, Warden.

415
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,120
Good health.

416
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,000
Good health.

417
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,730
Wait for me a moment.

418
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,040
Why is it taking so long?

419
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,640
Isn't anyone taking shifts?

420
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,520
I'm losing all my interview time.

421
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,310
There's nothing I can do.

422
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,740
There are many new regulations lately.

423
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,250
The inmates are acting up everywhere.

424
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,040
We're a bit short-staffed.

425
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:35,320
Was this requested by Jiang Yijie?

426
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,460
And the deputy warden too.

427
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,660
They've both been very strict lately.

428
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,380
Look at the state Inmate 9568 is in,
yet they still won't let him get treated.

429
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,910
I really don't understand.

430
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:55,020
Not off work yet?

431
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,880
Did you feed the fish today?

432
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:09,580
Aren't you busy?

433
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,750
Why are you back?

434
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,080
I still have some things to pack.

435
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,860
What's wrong? You seem upset.

436
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,750
You were understaffed today.

437
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,880
My interview schedule got cut in half.

438
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,620
And those who had stabilized
over the past few days—

439
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,150
due to too much pressure,

440
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:33,700
their panic attacks and mood disorders
are all coming back.

441
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,000
Growing pains, I suppose.

442
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,500
I believe if everyone follows the rules

443
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,870
and does things by the book,

444
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,400
they'll get used to it soon.

445
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,500
All I want to say is that

446
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,130
many things could be adjusted
gradually, right?

447
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,500
And many inmates are saying

448
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,750
that Inmate 9568's medical parole request

449
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:48,950
was blocked by you.

450
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,550
That's right.

451
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,360
Because I suspect
his cancer report is fake.

452
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,240
How could it be fake?

453
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,700
Inmate 9568 took prohibited drugs

454
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,000
to induce symptoms,

455
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
and during his medical paroles,

456
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,420
he actually secretly dated his wife
at the hospital.

457
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,750
Did you know about that?

458
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,250
He's been exercising special privileges
in prison.

459
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,910
How is this any different from
what Inmate 7234 did?

460
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,310
And he's been lying to me all along.

461
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:11,500
A lot of things were covered up
by my father.

462
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,410
But as for his cancer,

463
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:14,120
have you checked with the Health Division?

464
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,000
When Xiaohui was still around,

465
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,120
he already had symptoms.

466
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,050
Are you pretending not to see them?

467
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:20,870
It's exactly because
I can't pretend not to see them

468
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,400
that I need to see evidence!

469
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,120
My father colluded with
those officials and businessmen,

470
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,720
allowing Inmate 9568 to do
whatever he wants in prison,

471
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,050
but I can't accept that!

472
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:29,220
So I'll see this through to the end!

473
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,790
I'm sorry I raised my voice.

474
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,170
I was interfering too much.

475
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,230
Get Master Jiu transferred.

476
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,620
He's been in the canteen for too long

477
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,120
and has become difficult to manage.

478
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,120
Deputy Warden,

479
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,120
if you do this, they'll just go on strike.

480
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,850
Are we running a business here?

481
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,120
If the canteen doesn't function properly,

482
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,870
we'll bring in external resources
for meals.

483
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:15,230
All violators will be penalized

484
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,110
until they learn to obey.

485
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,750
The public authority granted to us
as law enforcement officers

486
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,540
is precisely to manage those

487
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,340
who cannot function in society.

488
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,250
Deputy Warden, public authority
isn't something you could just...

489
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,870
Address me as Warden!

490
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,960
So you're teaching me about
public authority now?

491
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,540
When you and Gao Zhiyao were escorting

492
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,120
Inmate 9568 for outside medical treatment,

493
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,750
there was a serious security breach:

494
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:50,140
you let Inmate 9568 out of sight
for 40 minutes,

495
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:53,750
allowing him to have intimate contact
with a civilian.

496
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:55,760
May I ask why

497
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:58,910
this matter wasn't punished
according to regulations?

498
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:00,200
Without seeing

499
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,340
the diagnosis from a second hospital,

500
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:03,680
I won't sign this.

501
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,670
It's my exercise time now.

502
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:11,530
Get out.

503
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,240
CO!

504
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,260
You even blocked our medical parole!

505
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,370
This isn't fair, is it?

506
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,870
How is this any different from murder?

507
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:40,330
-Prison murder! Prison murder!
-Prison murder! Prison murder!

508
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,380
Director.

509
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,930
The inmates in Cell Block Harmony
are rioting too.

510
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,390
How should we handle this?

511
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,720
I know. I can hear it from where I am.

512
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,260
Don't open the doors
under any circumstances.

513
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,540
Communicate if possible.

514
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,400
If not, wait until they calm down.

515
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,740
Stay safe yourselves.

516
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,120
Got it.

517
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:11,430
Inmates, please calm down!

518
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:13,180
-Inmate!
-Please calm down!

519
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,170
Guys, please.

520
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,790
Do me a favor, will you?

521
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:25,440
Just cooperate.

522
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,610
The Mid-Autumn Festival is coming.

523
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:28,760
Don't you want your family visitation?

524
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,390
But Director,

525
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,620
are there no human rights in prison?

526
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:35,020
Why can't he see a doctor when he's sick?

527
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,790
Yeah, he already has cancer.

528
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,980
Rules are rules.

529
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,740
It was Zhang Longji
who violated the rules first.

530
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,830
Your rules keep changing all the time,

531
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,220
deducting our points
for every little thing.

532
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,380
What exactly do you want?

533
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,340
Let me ask you:

534
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:51,070
who would deduct your points
if you follow the rules?

535
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,470
You've changed the regulations
to be like this.

536
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,450
Nobody can stand staying here!

537
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,070
Can't stand it, huh?

538
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,540
Go stay in the Disciplinary Cell then!

539
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,200
You're messing with me again!

540
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,970
[Emergency]

541
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,230
Jiajun.

542
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,650
How's Director doing?

543
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,000
He's in surgery now.

544
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,890
It's been over an hour.

545
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,230
Did the doctor say anything?

546
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,720
No. We'll only know when they come out.

547
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:48,780
Senior.

548
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,600
Is this what you call change?

549
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:53,260
Is this your way?

550
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,940
Sit down. Why argue about this now?

551
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,160
Okay, got it.

552
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,460
Everyone, I need to go back
to the prison now.

553
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:19,060
We're really short-staffed at the moment.

554
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,310
We can't afford any more incidents.

555
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:24,850
Ma'am.

556
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,450
Director... I believe he'll be okay.

557
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,020
I'm truly sorry.

558
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,890
What happened in the prison...

559
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,320
What happened in the prison is definitely

560
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,560
not what I wanted.

561
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,320
I'll discuss this with Deputy Warden
as soon as possible.

562
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,110
I'm sorry.

563
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,610
I need to go back to the prison now.

564
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,340
When you were promoted to Deputy Chief,

565
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,550
Wenqiang was really happy for you.

566
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,100
I was happy too.

567
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:30,580
I thought his workload
would ease up a bit.

568
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:33,260
But it didn't.

569
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,250
Not at all.

570
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,680
His burden remained just as heavy.

571
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,580
He even looked more exhausted than before.

572
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,330
Don't you value human rights?

573
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:52,930
Then let me ask you:

574
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,620
for someone working at the ground level
in the prison,

575
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,480
who protects their human rights?

576
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,870
Who is responsible

577
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,260
for their safety?

578
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:04,370
The Custody Division's affairs
are my responsibility.

579
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:06,510
I should be the one bearing this burden.

580
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,760
Let go of my junior.

581
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,290
I know you need a hostage!

582
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:17,270
But things aren't as simple as you think.

583
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:19,180
If you make changes,
you might disrupt the current balance,

584
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:19,720
you know?

585
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,950
I've thought through the entire plan.

586
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,280
I want to give it a try.

587
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,770
Alright, if you want to try,
I'll support you.

588
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:28,580
But remember, I've warned you.

589
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,760
These things aren't that easy to handle.

590
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,620
If anything happens, let me know.

591
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,420
Are you okay?

592
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,260
I'm okay.

593
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,870
I was just thinking

594
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,910
maybe I'm not suitable for this position.

595
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:19,790
If Director Xiao never wakes up...

596
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,620
It'll be alright.

597
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,780
Director Xiao and the prison
will both be alright.

598
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,060
Has Director woken up?

599
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:40,360
He's pretty badly injured.

600
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,560
He probably won't wake up anytime soon.

601
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,140
That mad dog.

602
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,850
How are you feeling?

603
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:56,440
Without medical parole,

604
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,150
your condition can't wait
any longer, right?

605
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,180
I blacked out that day,

606
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:04,550
and I almost died.

607
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:08,030
Then what's important in life

608
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,850
suddenly became very clear.

609
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,040
I only care about one thing now:

610
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:27,800
I want to be with my son.

611
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,670
I'll try applying for a family visitation
for you again.

612
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,550
Do you think my application
will be approved?

613
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,620
Good point.

614
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:03,170
I've thought of all possible ways.

615
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,620
There are just no blind spots here
whatsoever.

616
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,540
That's why I need help from
you administrators.

617
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,620
Did you draw this?

618
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:13,020
What exactly do you want me
to help you with?

619
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,590
Bring your son in here
to reunite with you?

620
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,260
I want to get out of here
and be with my son.

621
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:24,510
You're thinking about a jailbreak?

622
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:31,040
My dear buddy, you can't escape like that.

623
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,980
Keep it down.

624
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,719
I do sympathize with you,

625
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,210
but if I break the law directly like this,

626
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,610
I'll end up in prison too.

627
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,270
I've got everything prepared.

628
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:45,139
If anything goes wrong,

629
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,360
I'll take the blame.

630
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:53,540
Don't throw that around.

631
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:01,640
Will you really take the blame?

632
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,640
If anything goes wrong,
it truly won't be on me?

633
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:06,550
Will you help me or not?

634
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,160
If I don't help you,

635
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,460
you'll ask your sister

636
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:13,790
to shut down my mother's shop, right?

637
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:21,140
I did threaten you before
to make you run errands for me,

638
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,080
but I'm really out of options now.

639
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,590
Do you remember Mei?

640
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,620
Your elementary school classmate.

641
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:02,250
She's grown up to be very beautiful.

642
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:04,650
-Do you remember her?
-Madam.

643
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,660
-Thank you.
-It was really good.

644
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,620
Come again.

645
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,330
The customers all like it.

646
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,790
Gao Zhiyao!

647
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:15,090
What's going on with that bowl?

648
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,550
You didn't rinse it.

649
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,020
What's on your mind?

650
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,350
You look troubled.

651
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:26,620
Tell me if something's happened.

652
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:31,160
There's indeed been a lot going on lately.

653
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:31,910
What is it?

654
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:34,790
Mom, let me ask you something.

655
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:35,620
Go ahead.

656
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,860
If there's something

657
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:39,990
that I think is right,

658
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:42,190
but if I do it, I'll lose my job;

659
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:45,870
and if I don't do it, I...

660
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,370
I will...

661
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,080
I...

662
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,850
You're stuttering.
Really conflicted, aren't you?

663
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,790
Well, let me ask you this:

664
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,450
if you don't do what's right,

665
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,560
you'll be unhappy,

666
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:03,420
then tell me—will you still love this job?

667
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,620
If doing the right thing

668
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,330
could cost you your job,

669
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:09,290
then this job's not worth keeping anyway,

670
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:10,410
right? Just quit.

671
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:11,660
Don't worry.

672
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:14,250
I've got this beef noodle shop
to keep you fed.

673
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,350
Gao Zhiyao.

674
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,600
Sis Wenfeng.

675
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,000
What do you want?

676
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:24,560
Why are you blocking me?
What's your problem?

677
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:26,710
What are you doing?

678
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:27,650
Go away.

679
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,290
Don't be like that. I know them.

680
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:31,550
What's your problem? Show some manners,

681
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:32,500
okay?

682
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:34,330
Auntie.

683
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,650
I've heard so much about you.

684
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:36,710
Calling me auntie?

685
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,090
Good girl.

686
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,390
What are you doing here?

687
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,180
You really underestimated me.

688
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:43,410
Come on, see what you want to eat.

689
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:44,870
See what you want to order.

690
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,510
Sis.

691
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:47,800
Their braised eggs

692
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,790
are really delicious.

693
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:49,870
Why order braised eggs?

694
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:51,750
Now that I've come here,
of course I'll order beef noodles.

695
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:52,540
Sis.

696
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,910
Their braised eggs are really good, Sis!

697
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,440
Alright, fine!

698
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:57,340
I believe you.

699
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,010
Four bowls of half-tendon half-meat.

700
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:02,540
You know your stuff. No problem.

701
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,600
With braised eggs.

702
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:05,690
[Exclusive Flavor, Carefully Crafted]

703
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:08,790
So

704
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,410
you'll be okay?

705
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,590
You're disappointed, aren't you?

706
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,410
O-Of course not.

707
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:17,690
I'm happy for you, Sis Wenfeng.

708
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:18,830
Happy for you.

709
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,570
What the Warden asked me to do,

710
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:23,960
I wouldn't mess with it.

711
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,410
I followed regulations on everything.

712
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:28,070
They won't find any problems.

713
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,540
Auntie.

714
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,590
Your son is quite good.

715
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:36,370
You're too kind.

716
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,540
Although he always acts impulsively

717
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,540
and never thinks things through...

718
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,540
That's true.

719
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,550
But he's kind.

720
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,640
He cares about family and works hard.

721
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:44,790
He's good in nature.

722
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,930
He takes after me.

723
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,000
Good choice.

724
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,330
Sis, check him out.

725
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,730
There's a guy who fell and got back up.

726
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,020
Looks like he's got some guts.

727
00:38:56,410 --> 00:39:00,250
To be honest, that debt of yours was
supposed to take a long time to pay off.

728
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,330
I didn't expect our Wa

729
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:03,910
to be so nice to you.

730
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,910
Sis, as for that last payment,

731
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,870
consider it settled.

732
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:10,160
3 million.

733
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:13,650
Tear it up.

734
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:15,460
Tear it up.

735
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,120
Couldn't you just hand it to him properly?

736
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,410
Why tear it up like that?

737
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:23,730
It's not like that, Sis.

738
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:25,370
I thought it would look cooler this way.

739
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:26,540
Cool!

740
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,790
Super cool!

741
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:29,500
Auntie.

742
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,000
The broth is excellent.

743
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,620
It's delicious, right?

744
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,660
It is.

745
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,320
Gao Zhiyao.

746
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:33,930
Yes?

747
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,360
It's your treat today.

748
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,380
No problem.

749
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,420
You can come eat here every day
for free.

750
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,040
Bye-bye.

751
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,360
Thank you.

752
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,200
That's a great deal.

753
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,260
To go?

754
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,450
Take it.

755
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:46,220
Bye-bye.

756
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:50,540
Gao Zhiyao, you borrowed 3 million?

757
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,040
Wasn't it 2 million?

758
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:58,050
Every day I see many families
coming to pick up their relatives,

759
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,840
but walking out of here myself today

760
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:02,960
actually feels quite awkward.

761
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,760
Dad, how have you been doing?

762
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:09,100
The warden is my junior.
Of course I've been doing okay.

763
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:11,910
Dad.

764
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,540
It was actually my testimony

765
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,750
that got you arrested.

766
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:18,710
Do you blame me?

767
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:25,060
Are you regretting it
or asking me to coordinate our stories?

768
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:29,570
I didn't corrupt you after all, did I?

769
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,960
I did give Zhang Wenfeng the project,

770
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,250
on the condition that she would give

771
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:43,540
all the job opportunities
to reformed prisoners.

772
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,670
I didn't take a single penny from this.

773
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,660
For everything she bought me,

774
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,550
I paid her back for each item.

775
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:52,680
So about the reformed prisoners
and this project,

776
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,050
I must make my intentions clear to you.

777
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,110
I don't regret it at all.

778
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:07,570
Dad.

779
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:11,120
Would you like some pork knuckle noodles?

780
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:12,580
No.

781
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,650
I want to eat sashimi.

782
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:24,570
Sashimi.

783
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:31,290
Go on.

784
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,490
Boss,

785
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,730
after you go around here,

786
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,920
you'll pass the education room.

787
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,780
This area is patrolled the least,

788
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:42,160
but there are cameras here.

789
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,100
How often do they patrol?

790
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:50,410
Every 5 to 6 minutes.

791
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,220
If that's the case,

792
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,280
you guys cover for me...

793
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,730
It's every 5 to 8 minutes.

794
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:00,410
Okay, let's say 8 minutes.

795
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:01,410
If it's 8 minutes,

796
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:03,040
we'll take 7 minutes

797
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:03,540
with some time in between...

798
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,000
It's every 5 to 15 minutes.

799
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:06,790
How many minutes exactly?

800
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:09,290
I don't know.

801
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:11,120
Alright, Boss.

802
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,100
There are more blind spots
behind the canteen,

803
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,620
but last time when I was on duty there,

804
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:16,910
I got really itchy all over.

805
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:18,160
I felt terrible that day,

806
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,040
and I hate the smell there.

807
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:22,200
Boss,

808
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:24,120
I actually have a way
to completely avoid...

809
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,660
If it's just a pipe dream,
then don't say it.

810
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,790
No, Boss, listen to me.

811
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:27,500
Just don't say it.

812
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,250
Listen to me.

813
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:31,250
This time, we don't have to
steal any tools.

814
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,160
One rock will suffice.

815
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,910
As long as we find the sewage pipe,

816
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:37,500
we can take advantage of a rainy night.

817
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,870
When the thunder's booming like this,

818
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:42,160
we'll hit it with a rock.

819
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,160
We'll just hit it...

820
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,750
-And when we hit…
-Boss, don't!

821
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:46,160
Have you only ever watched one movie
or something?

822
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:46,750
Boss.

823
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,880
You too!

824
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:50,310
Afraid of getting dirty?

825
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:52,120
-What are you doing?
-Your health.

826
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,050
-What are you doing?
-Your health.

827
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:00,550
You have a plan?

828
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,800
I'm planning to kill someone.

829
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,040
I'll help you.

830
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:13,620
But you have to promise me one thing:

831
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,310
after you hold your son,

832
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:18,590
you must come back immediately.

833
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:29,960
What are you doing?

834
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,090
I want to kiss you.

835
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:35,060
Well,

836
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,580
you only have one chance.

837
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:40,290
Which day?

838
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:43,690
Promise me first.

839
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:46,180
I promise you.
