00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:07,540
Chihuahua,

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,080
your visitor meals
are too greasy and salty.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,720
You ate them and ended up in the hospital.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,250
You need to watch your diet.

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,910
You sent me to the Health Division twice,

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,050
and you're a doctor now?

7
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,500
I'm sent here to take care of you.

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,580
Boss.

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,540
I don't eat visitor meals.

10
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,890
Tell the kitchen to make our food

11
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,600
a bit more presentable.

12
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,850
That's not the kitchen's fault.

13
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:46,930
Everyone's food is the same.

14
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,000
Officer,

15
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,740
the slop from the kitchen...

16
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,640
Two days of it is enough
to make me want to bust out.

17
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,740
-Is that right?
-Bust out?

18
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,540
Are you threatening an officer?

19
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,080
It's really inedible, Boss.

20
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,510
You can beat me to death,
but it won't change that.

21
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,040
I think it's the food from the kitchen
that is giving me the runs.

22
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:02,830
Listen to me.

23
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,950
If we eat well,

24
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,650
we don't cause trouble.

27
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,350
Hey. Where's your CO?

28
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,630
In the bathroom.

29
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,370
Is there a problem?

30
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,410
No problem.

31
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,530
What are you doing?

32
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,250
How many times have I told you?

33
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,829
Use a bowl to taste the food.

34
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,120
Hygiene matters, you know?

35
00:02:56,579 --> 00:02:58,329
Master Jiu?

36
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,880
Sorry to interrupt.

37
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,800
I just want to give some advice.

38
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:02,740
What?

39
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,550
Got a problem with our cooking?

40
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,860
Some of the inmates think the food is bad,

41
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,610
and they keep getting the runs.

42
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,950
So you are

43
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,410
criticizing our hygiene?

44
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,390
No.

45
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,000
I think it's their problem.

46
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,930
But they think it's your problem.

47
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,650
In the end,

Everyone, listen up! Come on!

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,010
This CO here

52
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,660
wants to review the hygiene of this place.

53
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,370
It's a misunderstanding.

54
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,320
Master Jiu, don't put it like that.

55
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,850
I just want to...

56
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,270
I just want to say...

Say what?

58
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,350
Are you looking for trouble?

Who?

63
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,110
Hold on.

64
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:44,800
Look,

65
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,630
you guys are pros,

66
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:47,480
right?

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,950
made a little better.

69
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:50,829
More delicious.

70
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:52,250
Go eat slop. It's faster.

Look.

76
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,400
Look at this.

77
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,320
The radishes are moldy.

78
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,710
Come on, look.

79
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,760
The greens are rotten.

80
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,340
Look at the meat.

81
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,680
Nobody would buy this crap.

82
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,980
It stinks.

83
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,980
And over here, look.

84
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,950
The dried tofu has gone sour.

85
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,190
Want to smell it?

86
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,790
Same with the meatballs.

87
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,750
Who knows how long ago they were made?

88
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,700
Exactly!

89
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,760
They complain if the food sucks;
they complain if they get the runs.

90
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,250
But we're given ingredients like these.

91
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,880
We can't work miracles.

92
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,830

Look,

100
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,680
I was just passing on feedback.

101
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,320
I'll report the ingredient issue, okay?

102
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,400
Here, have this pack of cigarettes.

103
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,140
Thank you for your hard work.

104
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,220
You're all talk.

105
00:04:49,409 --> 00:04:50,340
I can do that too.

106
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,470
Please.

107
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,490
Alright. Forget it.

108
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,310
Back to work.

109
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,670
You can't do this, Sir.

110
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,990
I said forget it!

111
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,280
Shut up and move the veggies back.

112
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,420
Next time, get your facts straight

113
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,610
before you come here causing trouble.

114
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,570
Move the radishes over there.

115
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,710
Sir.

116
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,400
Anything else?

117
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,510
Nothing.

118
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,630
Master Jiu,
I'll report the food quality issue.

119
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,470
Morning, Senior.

120
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,940
I'm here to check for the kitchen.

121
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,140
Good morning, Sir.

122
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,350
What's up?

123
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,350
Morning, Cai.

124
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:24,500
Cai.

125
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:28,250
These vegetables are rotten.
You're accepting them?

126
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,500
It's fine. The outside is rotten.

127
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,700
Just pick it off, and it's still edible.

128
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,970
No, it's not just the veggies.

129
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,320
Everything has… has quality issues.

130
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,880
Zhiyao, you're not a rookie anymore.

131
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,990
You should know how things work.

132
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,320
Don't look for trouble.

133
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,810
This stuff has all been inspected.

134
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,040
No, but there is a problem…

135
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,040
Cai, the quantity is correct, right?

136
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,790
No problem.

137
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,820
Hey man, your veggies are bad.
Can we return them?

138
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,260
Isn't that a bit much?
They just got squashed on top.

139
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,230
-It's all the same once cooked.
-I know.

140
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,980
Just squashed on top?

141
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,280
Look at this, man.

142
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,520
It's completely rotten.
We can return this, right?

143
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,220
Fine, return it if you want.

144
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,390
-I'll make it up in the next shipment.
-Okay.

145
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,030
No, wait. Leave it.

146
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,130
You can't return it.

147
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,950
The inmates will have nothing to eat.

148
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:21,850
They'll riot.

149
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,590
That's it. Done.

150
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,970
Just be careful next time.

151
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:25,970
Alright.

152
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,040
Be careful next time.

153
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,700
I know. I'm off then, Cai.

154
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:34,950
Cai.

155
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,610
That supplier looks shady.

156
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,010
My family runs a restaurant, so I know.

157
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,860
Can't we switch suppliers?

158
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,610
Look,

159
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,370
we scolded him this time.

160
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:45,870
He'll be more careful next time.

161
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,170
He'll improve the quality.

162
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,100
Besides, we're a government unit.

163
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,880
Switching suppliers isn't that easy.

164
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,330
You think you can just switch
like buying groceries?

165
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,430
This is buying groceries.

166
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,470
Stop looking for trouble.

167
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,780
Do you have too much free time?

168
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,780
I'm very busy!

169
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,600
Zhongyi.

170
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,420
If the count is right.
Send them to the kitchen.

171
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,290
-Weird.
-Come on. Haul them away.

172
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,280
Zhiyao.

173
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:12,400
Senior.

174
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,760
What are you doing here?

175
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,750
Inmate 9568 has been
experiencing diarrhea lately.

176
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,150
He said the food is bad
and asked me to check.

177
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,180
Turns out the food really stinks.

178
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,180
What is that smell?

179
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,200
The smell of rotten vegetables.

180
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,500
I've heard rumors

181
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,430
that our food quality is unstable.

182
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,080
So I suspect
someone is skimming off the top.

183
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,770
Is it Cai?

184
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,890
Cai is just a little mouse.

185
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,549
We need to catch Mickey Mouse.

186
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,230
Mickey Mouse?

187
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,570
That's my codename for this person.

188
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,400
Anyway, just keep watching
and keep looking.

189
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,130
We'll check every single item.

190
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,730
Let's see who cracks first.

191
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,230
It's definitely that supplier.

192
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,700
Can you stop being

193
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,420
so simple-minded?

194
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,080
It could be someone higher up.

195
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,510
Just keep investigating.

196
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:03,440
Good luck.

197
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,770
Wash your hands.

198
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,600
Dispensing cold water.

199
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,840
Dispensing cold water.

200
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,920
Yes!

201
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,190
Yes!

202
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,910
Cai, you're still here?

203
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,110
I forgot my car keys.

204
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,010
You…

205
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,670
-You're the counselor, right?
-Yes.

206
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:42,130
What are you doing here?
You need something?

207
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,970
Cai, I heard you bought this amethyst

208
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,240
at a great price.

209
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,560
You're interested in amethyst?

210
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,120
Let me tell you.

211
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,240
A friend of a friend introduced me to it.

212
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,060
After I bought it,

213
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,330
I really felt my energy flow better.

214
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,210
Most importantly,

215
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,880
you have to buy this first—

216
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,020
the money toad.

217
00:10:59,050 --> 00:10:59,950
After I bought it,

218
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,910
just like this,
I got promoted three ranks.

219
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,960
We have to believe that
the gods will protect us.

220
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,330
So I want to give you a token—

221
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,020
a protective amulet from Fu'an Temple.

222
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:08,870
-Cai.
-It works if you believe in it.

223
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,830
It's not superstition.

224
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,700
I have duties to attend to.

225
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,750
-Here, hold these for a sec.
-So…

226
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,330
-Wait…
-Put them in the front seat later.

227
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,200
I'm busy with work, Cai.

228
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,700
I insist on giving you this token.

229
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,580
Just wait a second.

230
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,370
Don't be in such a rush.

231
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,370
Jiang, here.

232
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,200
This is the token.

233
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,200
-No thanks.
-An amulet from Fu'an Temple.

234
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,870
Really, Cai,
you don't need to give me anything.

235
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,670
This is fate. See it as a little token
of our connection.

236
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,500
The gods will really protect you.

237
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,330
Thanks, Cai. Thanks.

238
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,130
-See you tomorrow.
-Drive safe.

239
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,200
Thanks for your cooperation, Cai.

240
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,360
Inmates these days
yap about human rights all day,

241
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,840
always threatening to sue us.

242
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,440
Let me check. It'll be quick.

243
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,590
The veggies are great.

244
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,510
Cai gave special orders

245
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,290
to bring the freshest stuff.

246
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,160
Is everything on the right ours?

247
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,220
Yes, yours.

248
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,440
I'll take a look too.

249
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,010
No. That's just squashed.

250
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,330
I'll talk to them when I get back.

251
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,620
Just a little bit.

252
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,830
Sir, did we order stinky tofu?

253
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,670
Zhiyao.

254
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,330
It will be fixed tomorrow!

255
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,160
If not, you're disqualified!

256
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,410
What's wrong with you? I told you already.

257
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:46,420
I know.

258
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,510
I'll handle it now.

259
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,560
Gao Zhiyao.

260
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,310
Why quit the team?

261
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,150
Isn't your foot almost healed?

262
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:20,520
Healed my ass.

263
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,490
It'll heal.
You've got the "Golden Right Foot."

264
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,050
The doctor said I need to rest
and rehab for two years.

265
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,630
So do the rehab.

266
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,190
I'll stick with you for two years.

267
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,400
Shut up.

268
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,370
You want me to be a sparring partner

269
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,370
and watch you prep for the Olympics?

270
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,700
Good luck to you guys.

271
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,320
You lost to me once, and you quit?

272
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,830
I kept playing until now

273
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,270
only because of you.

274
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,140
If you give up like this,

275
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,150
I'll look down on you forever.

276
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:06,030
If you hadn't messed me up,
would I be like this?

277
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,530
Zhongwen, wait.

278
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,190
Inmate 1026, wait.

279
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,010
I want to speak to this inmate.

280
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,250
Don't chat with the inmates.

281
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:34,920
Okay.

282
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,570
Don't get me in trouble.

283
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:37,490
Just a second.

284
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:38,460
Just a sec.

285
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,380
I'm Gao Zhiyao.

286
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,760
Don't you recognize me?

287
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,920
Sir, can I go?

288
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,400
I have work in the kitchen.

289
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,770
It is you, right?

290
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,430
Tadpole.

291
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,700
What's wrong with you?

292
00:14:59,190 --> 00:14:59,810
Director.

293
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,970
Gao Zhiyao, are you slacking off?

294
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,430
Take him away.

295
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,720
Inmate 1026, we can go.

296
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:08,320
Let's go.

297
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,720
How did you end up in here?

298
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,620
What are you doing?

299
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,350
Director,

300
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,230
I ran into someone I know.

301
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,080
What a coincidence.

302
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:20,790
He's a good friend of mine.

303
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,100
Then how did he end up in here?

304
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:31,600
I don't know.

305
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,540
You don't know,
and you call him a good friend?

306
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,280
Are you trying to mess with me?

307
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,250
You worked so hard
to get this full-time spot.

308
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,380
What the hell? This could end up badly.

309
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,250
What do you think he's in here for?

310
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:45,980
Summer camp?

311
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:47,870
Get it straight.

312
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,710
You are an administrator. He is an inmate.

313
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,070
Understood, Director.

314
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:57,400
Don't be a clueless idiot.

315
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,410
He ate free beef noodles here
for ten years.

316
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:14,620
I never saw him come back.

317
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,620
That brat…

318
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,650
You said you ran into him?

319
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,870
Is he your colleague or…

320
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:22,880
Not a colleague.

321
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,080
Why?

322
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,120
How did he end up in jail?

323
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:35,740
Arson. Involuntary manslaughter.

324
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,500
Oh my god.

325
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,330
That's serious.

326
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,540
What are his parents supposed to do?

327
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:44,150
They must be heartbroken.

328
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,290
You kids...

329
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,270
My gosh.

330
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,320
Parents worked so hard
to raise you to this age.

331
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,510
You quit playing just like that.

332
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,240
And now one of you is in jail.

333
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,730
I really...

334
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,110
All of you...

335
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,570
It was all in vain!

336
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,380
You kids really piss me off.

337
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,060
Excuse me.
Here are the side dishes. Enjoy.

338
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,130
Why aren't you going back?

339
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,060
Don't you have to work?

340
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,329
Mom.

341
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:21,410
What?

342
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,000
I want noodles.

343
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,540
Cook them yourself.

344
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,830
You cook them for me.

345
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,890
I'm already on it.

346
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,380
Half tendon, half meat?

347
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,590
What's with that face?

348
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,660
Next time there's a vacancy,
it'll be your turn.

349
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,800
But my wife and I have decided on daycare.

350
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,320
That's an extra 10,000 a month.

351
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,250
That expensive?

352
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,150
Yeah.

353
00:17:59,100 --> 00:17:59,930
And...

354
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,460
my wife missed
her period again this month.

355
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,360
Pregnant again?

356
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,890
We don't know yet.

357
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,780
Whoa, that's impressive.

358
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,510
No wonder you're so huge down there.

359
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,260
And you're small down there.

360
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,960
Getting a reaction?

361
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,290
Cut it out.

362
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,300
Having fun?

363
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,620
Counselor.

364
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,330
Counselor.

365
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,850
Nothing is happening right now,

366
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,630
but stay alert at all times.

367
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,750
We never know when danger will strike.

368
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,360
Yes.

369
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,820
Zhongwen, go back up Shun.

370
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,750
I've got this area.

371
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,120
Yes.

372
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,110
So?

373
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,200
Are the ingredients normal now?

374
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,190
Much better.

375
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,080
But I'm thinking

376
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,960
Cai might not be the one embezzling.

377
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,750
Because he's just...

378
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:45,950
How do I put it?

379
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,330
A typical civil servant.

380
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:48,750
He doesn't want
to get involved in anything

381
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,910
and does the bare minimum to get by.

382
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,800
You're amazing.

383
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,430
Yeah, that's exactly who Cai is.

384
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,510
So it can't be him.

385
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,630
Plus, Cai doesn't have the authority
to pull this off.

386
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,290
The guy can control the budget

387
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,790
and plant his own people.

388
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,360
He's higher up than we thought.

389
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,210
I know. Let's just ask Cai directly

390
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,740
who Mickey Mouse is.

391
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,320
Wouldn't that solve it?

392
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,020
Check it out.

393
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,320
Inmate 9416, what are you doing?

394
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:23,950
Tadpole.

395
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,580
What are you doing?

396
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,280
There's a kid inside.

397
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,280
There's a kid inside.

398
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,990
Little girl!

399
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,080
Can you hear me?

400
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:37,360
It's hot.

401
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,070
Little girl!

402
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,940
Little girl, can you hear me?

403
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,800
All doors are locked.

404
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,510
Little girl!

405
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,160
All the doors are locked.

406
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,490
Locked on this side too.

407
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,900
How long has this car been here?

408
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,560
It's been here the whole time.

409
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,670
Little girl!

410
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:57,760
Little girl!

411
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,370
Can you hear me?

412
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,280
Little girl!

413
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,360
-Hey, Tadpole!
-Inmate 9416!

414
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,040
Tadpole!

415
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,630
Everyone, squat down!

416
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:05,740
Squat down!

417
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,280
What are you doing?

418
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,510
Try this.

419
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:13,950
What is this for?

420
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,460
Just trust me.

421
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,850
Zhongwen, I have a situation here.

422
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,700
It's open!

423
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,220
Little girl.

424
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,540
Careful.

425
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:31,920
Little girl.

426
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,550
Little girl.

427
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,230
Her mom just went to buy something
while she slept.

428
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,110
It's so hot. Thank goodness she's okay.

429
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,440
Thank you for your help.

430
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,560
We'll be going now.

431
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,030
Thank you for coming.

432
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:46,970
Thank you.

433
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,380
Tadpole helped
with the kitchen issue last time too.

434
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,470
I know you're friends.

435
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,020
But don't forget he's serving time.

436
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:00,990
I know.

437
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,670
So what should we do about Cai?

438
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,680
Are you close with Mona?

439
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,680
Ms. Mona?

440
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,190
I guess we are.

441
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,840
I go there
for late-night snacks sometimes.

442
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,720
Why?

443
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,730
Cai is very superstitious.

444
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,480
He always goes to Mona
for astrology readings.

445
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,120
You again? What now? You're annoying.

446
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:25,980
Seer,

447
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,910
check my career and wealth luck for me.

448
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,110
How many times a week do you have to ask?

449
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,440
It's the same question every time.

450
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,160
Got too much money to burn?

451
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,200
So?

452
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,470
So I might need you

453
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,920
to ask Mona to help us trick Cai.

454
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:43,640
No way. As if she'd agree.

455
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,610
Ms. Mona agreed.

456
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:49,040
But she wants us to do a few things first.

457
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,220
Okay. Like what?

458
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,140
Alright.

459
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,510
To deal with Cai,

460
00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:01,360
first, we need to create an evil spirit.

461
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:06,110
Zero two two.

462
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:07,230
An evil spirit.

463
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,530
There is an evil spirit
in General Affairs.

464
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,490
Next, we let the evil spirit

465
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:15,460
infiltrate Cai's daily life.

466
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:17,840
Another one.

467
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,870
The roaches here eat too well.

468
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,120
Another one.

469
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:25,640
Zhiyao.

470
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,790
Blood for blood!

471
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:29,990
What's wrong with you?

472
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,510
It feels spooky,

473
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,040
like something's gonna possess me.

474
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,020
You're such an idiot.

475
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,510
Just now,

476
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,520
was there a breeze?

477
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:48,920
No.

478
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,530
Senior!

479
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:06,250
Senior!

480
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:27,300
Seer.

481
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,580
The things happening to me lately

482
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,660
are just too bizarre.

483
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,470
The other day, at the water cooler,

484
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:36,530
the machine suddenly spoke to me.

485
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,520
Do you know what it said?

486
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,340
"Dispensing cold water."

487
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:42,600
Dispensing cold water.

488
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,390
D-Dispensing…

489
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:47,880
c-cold…

490
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:48,820
w-water.

491
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,940
You really love stealing water.

492
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:00,710
Screw you!

493
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,190
Can you live with yourself?

494
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:06,870
You come to me after work every day.

495
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:08,700
Do you like me?

496
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:13,040
I want to be with you forever.

497
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,600
Did you charge the speaker?

498
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,660
You didn't steal my water.
You stole my heart.

499
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:24,410
Ready.

500
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,470
One, two, three.

501
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,790
Dispensing... c-cold... water.

502
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,200
What is going on? Oh my god.

503
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,910
That water...

504
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,030
Don't drink it anymore.

505
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,620
Why did it say those things to me?

506
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,750
Oh my god.

507
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,450
What is happening to me?

508
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,000
Am I being haunted?

509
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,650
Cai.

510
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,690
You're usually by the book.

511
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,870
But this reading

512
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:58,660
looks very serious!

513
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:01,300
Have you done something shady?

514
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,470
I haven't.

515
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,280
Speak the truth.

516
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:10,250
Or how can I resolve this for you?

517
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,120
Even if you just turned a blind eye

518
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,840
to the dirty deeds happening
under your watch,

519
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,830
it is the same.

520
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:19,720
Speak.

521
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,510
I'll tell you, but don't tell anyone.

522
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,050
It's the Chief of General Affairs.

523
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:27,670
Who?

524
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,350
The Chief of General Affairs.

525
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,010
The Chief of General Affairs.

526
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,910
H-He ordered me

527
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,630
t-to let things slide.

528
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:36,980
To let what slide?

529
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,260
The ingredients coming in—

530
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,780
the vegetables and stuff.

531
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:44,440
They were rotten, foul, and spoiled,

532
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,240
but I let them through.

533
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,180
You let them through and take kickbacks?

534
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:48,840
But

535
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,530
I think it's not that simple.

536
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,060
The Chief is

537
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,670
just a mid-level manager.

538
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,450
There must be someone
higher up ordering him.

539
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,550
You know me.

540
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,120
I'm always law-abiding
and down-to-earth.

541
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,450
If not to make a living

542
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,670
and raise five kids,

543
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,070
how could I do something so sinful?

544
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,620
Having five kids is a sin.

545
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,370
The world's crowded enough.

546
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:14,690
Why have so many kids?

547
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,240
You didn't wear a condom.

548
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,500
Serves you right!

549
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,010
So who is Mickey Mouse?

550
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,670
Feels like it's not that simple.

551
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:27,060
How do I resolve this?

552
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,390
Alright, let me communicate with him.

553
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,010
Okay, I got it.

554
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,060
Speak and then leave.

555
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:34,990
Begone! Begone!

556
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:37,730
Alright.

557
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:39,280
Six words.

558
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:40,990
Say it out.

559
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,330
Spit it out.

560
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,980
About Cai…

561
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,180
how did the higher-ups handle it?

562
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,730
Cai was transferred.

563
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:53,620
And

564
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:56,250
the Chief of General Affairs resigned.

565
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,230
That's it?

566
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,620
We went to all this trouble.

567
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:05,720
Didn't we suspect
there was someone higher up behind it?

568
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,510
Yeah.

569
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,700
They definitely have other backers.

570
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,980
Anyway, I'll figure it out.

571
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:15,890
Warden.

572
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,200
There's a vacancy in General Affairs.

573
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,040
I'm transferring Zhikai there.

574
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,110
What do you think?

575
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,530
What do you want?

576
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:26,390
Why did you let them off like that?

577
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:28,750
Why didn't you keep investigating?

578
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,950
Why let the subordinates take the fall?

579
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:32,950
Deputy Warden.

580
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,040
Handle the personnel arrangement

581
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,460
in General Affairs as you see fit.

582
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:39,130
Understood. I'll leave you to it.

583
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,150
Deputy Warden.

584
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,390
So, did you suppress this case?

585
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,600
I told you.

586
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,590
I'm fighting for the expansion project.

587
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,700
The Central Prison
cannot afford any incidents this year.

588
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,870
Next time before you act,

589
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:55,270
can you let me know first?

590
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:58,450
I know you're busy
with the expansion project.

591
00:27:58,450 --> 00:27:59,370
But do you know someone

592
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,000
in our prison has ties to the mob?

593
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,870
They even sent someone directly

594
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:03,330
to look after Inmate 9568.

595
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:04,280
That's none of your business.

596
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,620
I have my methods.

597
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:07,810
Dad.

598
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:08,670
Enough!

599
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,980
In what capacity
are you speaking to me right now?

600
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:14,580
Please leave.

601
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:15,650
Fine.

602
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,100
I know you have your methods.

603
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,600
But I have my principles.

604
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,100
I am definitely going to
catch Mickey Mouse.

605
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,980
Mickey Mouse?

606
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:57,860
Thanks.

607
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,900
You fought with your dad?

608
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:08,910
Want to talk about it?

609
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,600
If not, I'm leaving.

610
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,120
I often wonder...

611
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,400
if I were his biological son,

612
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,330
would I be able

613
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:35,790
to understand him better?

614
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:40,750
I wouldn't say that.

615
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,690
He has always wanted to protect you.

616
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:45,880
He just protected you too well,

617
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,680
and it built a wall between you two.

618
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,730
Why does it sound like

619
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:56,170
you're calling me a daddy's boy?

620
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,540
That's not what I meant.

621
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,170
You've been doing well.

622
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,040
Thanks.

623
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,530
You gave me the wrong one.

624
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:29,470
My bubble tea.

625
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:48,520
Thank you.

626
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,140
Not bad.

627
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:19,970
Meat Soup.

628
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:27,300
It tastes fresh.

629
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,420
Oh yeah.

630
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,070
Yeah.

631
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,810
Here, Tiantian.

632
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,910
It's improved.

633
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,670
Eat more. You've lost weight.

634
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,700
Yeah.

635
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,670
Thanks, Boss.

636
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:48,940
Inmate 9568.

637
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,260
Report to the Health Division tomorrow.

638
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:56,080
What for?

639
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:57,630
Who knows?

640
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,340
Hey, where's Tadpole?

641
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:08,500
Tadpole? Over there.

642
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:11,620
Thanks.

643
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,140
You really are a taekwondo fighter.

644
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:21,960
That was a high kick.

645
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,170
What?

646
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,180
Wanna fight?

647
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,080
Why aren't you talking?

648
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,860
Here, try this.

649
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,430
Your fellow inmates made it.

650
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,250
New flavor. It's pretty good.

651
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:45,890
Thanks.

652
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,440
I know you've been helping me.

653
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:54,120
I just didn't want to eat garbage anymore.

654
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,760
It's not just the ingredients.

655
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,650
The other day,

656
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,940
you helped that kid in the car.

657
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,600
How high can you kick now?

658
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,120
High enough to press your head down.

659
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:14,430
Try it then.

660
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:22,720
You really kicked me.

661
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,640
I kicked you? Sorry.

662
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:25,840
Idiot.

663
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:27,220
My bad.

664
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,840
How did I run into you here?

665
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:41,810
Seeing you

666
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:43,930
reminds me of the old days.

667
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,930
I thought you'd stick with taekwondo.

668
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,580
Do you know how I got in here?

669
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,980
I just wanted to warn that guy

670
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:02,030
and set his motorbike on fire.

671
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,540
But the fire
accidentally spread to a house.

672
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,920
Two people died.

673
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,570
I know.

674
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,080
I asked around.

675
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,000
I really didn't mean to.

676
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,620
I didn't know the fire would get that big.

677
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,219
I'm so sorry to them.

678
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,420
It already happened.

679
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,800
You're paying the price

680
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,030
by serving time here.

681
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,250
So reflect on it

682
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:36,100
and start over when you get out.

683
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:37,750
Start over, my ass.

684
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,889
They're dead. Can they come back to life?

685
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:45,670
By the way,

686
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,860
the day I quit the team,

687
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:48,909
you ran over and told me

688
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:50,770
you only kept going because of me.

689
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:52,120
Why did you say that?

690
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,940
Because you always stood back up.

691
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,390
Wait.

692
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,710
What do you mean?

693
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,660
I can always stand.

694
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:08,160
You can't?

695
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,870
I mean, no matter
how strong the opponent was,

696
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,010
no matter how badly you got kicked,

697
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:19,480
you always got back up.

698
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,260
So I thought

699
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,190
if you could keep going,

700
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,550
I definitely could too.

701
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:31,950
I'm sorry

702
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,590
for ending your taekwondo career.

703
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:43,850
Okay.

704
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,140
I accept your apology.

705
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,420
I feel like an idiot.

706
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,260
Let me tell you.

707
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,850
Since I got here, I've realized

708
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:56,510
anyone can start over

709
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,680
if they really put their mind to it.

710
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,800
You're working in the kitchen now,

711
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,170
learning a trade.

712
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,430
You could be a chef when you get out.

713
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,250
You mean your mom's sous-chef?

714
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:07,890
Sure.

715
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,060
I really miss your mom's noodles.

716
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,880
They smelled and tasted so good, right?

717
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:19,280
Gao Zhiyao! Where are you
delivering that food?

718
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,100
Report back to Central Control!

719
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:23,450
I'm on my way.

720
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,490
Gotta go.

721
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,830
Your letter.

722
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,400
Don't overthink it.

723
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,050
Sir,

724
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,690
Tadpole needs
to go to the Health Division.

725
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:00,560
Dispatch. Kitchen requests backup.

726
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,660
Inmate 9416 is burned.

727
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,460
He needs to go to the Health Division.

728
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,410
Run cold water on it!

729
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,800
Go run cold water on it!

730
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:10,140
Hang in there.

731
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,330
Hang in there.

732
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:15,950
Zhang Yilong.

733
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,040
How did you get hurt so badly?

734
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,170
We have to transfer him out.

735
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:23,750
I've already called an ambulance.

736
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,500
I need to ride along

737
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,870
because I can't handle this here.

738
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,620
-Director.
-I think he's at risk of infection.

739
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,370
How could you be so careless?

740
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:30,200
What are you doing here?

741
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,070
Get over here.

742
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:32,520
I'll find someone for guard duty.

743
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,060
Okay.

744
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:34,390
Director, why find someone else?

745
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:35,320
I can go with him.

746
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,180
You can't.

747
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:37,560
Why?

748
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,120
He's my friend.

749
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,410
I can take him there.

750
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,420
That is exactly why you can't.

751
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,500
Please, Director.

752
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,770
Let me escort him, okay?

753
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:46,570
How can you guarantee anything?

754
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:48,130
The ambulance is here.

755
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:49,460
Anyone available to go?

756
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,060
Boss.

757
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,580
The kitchen food truck
had a fender bender.

758
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,250
Can you send some backup?

759
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,360
What's the situation?

760
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,890
It crashed into a transport truck.

761
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,080
Alright, wait a sec. I'll be right there.

762
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:05,200
Director, I really can do this.

763
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,670
We're short-staffed. Please let me go.

764
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:09,140
Trust me. I won't screw this up.

765
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:09,930
I'll be careful.

766
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:11,580
Then watch yourself.

767
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,250
You are there to guard him.

768

769
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,500
Go.

00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:16,830
Thanks, Director.

772
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:20,520
Okay.

773
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,870
Okay, take him out first.

774
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:22,890
I'll get the paperwork.

775
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:24,220
Okay. Come on. Careful.

776
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,050

That's about it.

779
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:32,110
Have you treated this before?

780
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:32,780
Yes.

781
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,980
Follow these steps to change the dressing.

782

bring him back anytime.

783

Okay.

784
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:38,840

I'm sorry.

Why are you...

789
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:49,000
Don't come closer!

790
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,700
What are you doing?

791
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,410
Don't come closer!

792
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:51,110

-Tadpole, what are you doing?
-Back off!

795
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,800
Don't come closer, or I'll stab her.

Tadpole, stop it.

797
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,220
If you need help, just tell me, okay?

798
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,280

I want to tell her

801
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:05,490
I really didn't mean to do it.

802
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:06,790
Why go look for her?

803
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:08,260
She'll come back to me.

Tadpole, calm down. Listen to me.

815
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:28,620
You followed the rules before

816
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,620

No.

859
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:14,160
