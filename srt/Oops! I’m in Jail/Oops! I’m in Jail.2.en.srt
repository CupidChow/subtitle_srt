00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,930
-Alright?
-Thank you, Warden.

191
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,010
What the hell is wrong with you?

192
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:53,880
You can't even hang up

193
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,540
the central station's phone?

194
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,920
Are you an idiot?

195
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,320
I'm sorry.

196
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,090
What are you doing?

197
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,950
Why did you come here yesterday
for no reason?

198
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,310
Was it even your shift yesterday?

199
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,060
I... misread the schedule.

200
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,280
Misread the schedule?

201
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,400
He misread the schedule.
What's wrong with you?

202
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,400
Why are you letting
any random person in here?

203
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,400
He's a rookie.

204
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,030
What are you? Senior rookie?

205
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,150
Jesus said, “Do not forbid him,

206
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,860
for no one

207
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,400
who works a miracle in my name

208
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,030
will soon afterward
be able to speak evil of me.

209
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:31,780
For whoever is not against us

210
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,180
is for us."

211
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:33,780
[Event of Spreading Love and Care]

212
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,530
Amen.

213
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,650
-Amen.
-Amen.

214
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:39,320
Brothers,

215
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,280
you all sound so lifeless,
like you're falling asleep.

216
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,730
Please play the music.

217
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:43,650
He's sitting so close to the front.

218
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,280
Come on, everyone. Please stand up.

219
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,530
Let's move around a bit.

220
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,900
Sing along together.

221
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:51,030
Feel the joy that God gives us.

222
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,230
Get up.

223
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,530
Senior.

224
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,010
Come on, let's cheer together!

225
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:10,970
Very good!

226
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,110
Hello, Warden.

227
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,530
H-Hello, Warden!

228
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,330
You all look energetic. Great!

229
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,280
This class is going very well.

230
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,860
What are you doing here?

231
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,440
I wanted to come learn

232
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,480
before my shift.

233
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,220
Stop the music for a moment.

234
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,180
Actually, I've been baptized for 30 years.

235
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:40,190
Come.

236
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,900
Warden, this is my personal Bible.

237
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,150
I didn't expect you to be so devout.

238
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,450
Let me see it.

239
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:03,410
May I?

240
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:19,730
Everyone,

241
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,860
You should all

242
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:24,030
be like this student here.

243
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,270
Read and study God's words every day.

244
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,570
Let God move from the page

245
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,190
into your hearts.

246
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,450
-Yes.
-Amen!

247
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,550
Amen.

248
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,730
How about this? Test me.

249
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,690
Read any passage.

250
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,610
Senior, do you go to church?

251
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,970
Do you have to be so close?

252
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:51,900
My eyesight is poor.

253
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,150
Alright.

254
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,690
Please read.

255
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,650
God’s will is that we should be holy,

256
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,810
avoiding sexual immorality.

257
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,460
That each of you should know

258
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,030
how to control your own body

259
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,900
in holiness and honor,

260
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,780
not in the passion of lust

261
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,400
like the Gentiles who do not know God.

262
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,280
How was that? Did I recite it correctly?

263
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,260
-Yes.
-Yes.

264
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,640
The Warden recited it correctly.

265
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,400
The Warden spoke wonderfully.

266
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:33,980
Right.

267
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,130
Everyone,

268
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,280
the Bible is the best gift

269
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,270
from heaven.

270
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,030
I sincerely hope you will take time

271
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,420
to appreciate it

272
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:47,050
and discover the wisdom of life

273
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,150
and the source of existence within.

274
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,720
Okay?

275
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,440
Okay!

276
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,080
Well said, Warden!

277
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,080
Well said, Warden!

278
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,690
Great!

279
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:55,840
Oh, right.

280
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:57,280
Also...

281
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,200
Warden!

282
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,170
This is really quite personal.

283
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,320
There are many

284
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,040
of my personal reflections in there.

285
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,130
That's true.

286
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,900
Our prison

287
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,950
deeply respects

288
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,080
the rights of the inmates.

289
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,190
Personal privacy is very important too.

290
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:19,820
That's right.

291
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,510
Students,

292
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,070
you should learn from this student here.

293
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,440
Believe that God is always by our side.

294
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:26,960
-Yes!
-Yes!

295
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,690
The Warden spoke wonderfully.

296
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,160
Excellent.

297
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,860
Counselor, what are you doing?

298
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,550
Reporting, Warden. I...

299
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,070
I suspect some students

300
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:47,270
are hiding contraband in their Bibles.

301
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,450
Are you all?

302
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,340
No.

303
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,690
No, we're not.

304
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,830
Did you find anything?

305
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,830
No.

306
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,670
Then I would ask our Counselor

307
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,450
not to casually suspect

308
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,980
our inmates, alright?

309
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,090
Come on, continue with the music!

310
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:13,490
Continue with the music.

311
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,090
Come on, start singing.

312
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,900
Let's end by giving thanks together.

313
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,030
Thank the Lord, thank God.

314
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,160
Reporting, Warden.

315
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,220
My stomach is not feeling well.

316
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,400
It's been days.

317
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,300
I'd like to go to the Health Division
for a check-up.

318
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,930
Alright, administrator,

319
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,320
take this student to the Health Division.

320
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,670
Take him to the Health Division, hurry up.

321
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,010
Quickly, take him.

322
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,760
To the Health Division, quick.

323
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:37,740
Hurry.

324
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,850
What did you eat?

325
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,270
[Medical Center]

326
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,520
What did you just eat?

327
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,850
High blood pressure medication.

328
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,270
You have high blood pressure?

329
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:06,900
I will soon.

330
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,280
Okay, take some digestive medicine first.

331
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,240
Here, water.

332
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,780
Let me measure your blood pressure.

333
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,990
Do you have any other discomfort?

334
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,500
I'm feeling great now.

335
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,690
Or would you like to go back
to your cell to rest?

336
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,170
I'm feeling unwell again.

337
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,000
Okay.

338
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,310
Hey, bro.

339
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,870
I don't care what you're planning,

340
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,130
but you can tell your sister

341
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:42,330
I want 100,000 for those playing cards.

342
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,650
I didn't get a single card.

343
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,580
What are you talking about?

344
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,680
Here, here's one.

345
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:57,480
How is it?

346
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,530
Okay, let me take your temperature.

347
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:02,530
37.3.

348
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,460
There's a crease on the nipple.

349
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:05,810
What did you just say?

350
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,510
I said, you little girl

351
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:11,369
have very good service.

352
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,099
Thank you.

353
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,240
Does it matter?

354
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,480
Why is your blood pressure so high?

355
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,530
Is it high?

356
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,440
Maybe it's because I saw you.

357
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,900
Sir, stop joking around.

358
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,940
Do you know this could very likely

359
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,400
lead to complications?

360
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,640
What complications?

361
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,140
It could cause a stroke.

362
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,890
I'll report to the supervisor
about escorting you to the hospital.

363
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,700
Here you go.

364
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,150
100,000.

365
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,240
Look at this.

366
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,580
Talking to Chihuahua,

367
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,030
gotta be a gentleman.

368
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,940
Here comes the troublemaker.

369
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,190
Dare me to report you.

370
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,550
If you swallow this card now,

371
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,030
I'll pretend this never happened.

372
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,780
Hurry up, give it to me.

373
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,900
Counselor.

374
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,780
Fine.

375
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:19,280
-Counselor.
-Hurry up.

376
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,220
He seems to have something in his mouth.

377
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,010
What are you eating?

378
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:30,070
Are you hiding something? Let me see.

379
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,540
What's going on?

380
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,150
Zhang Longji.

381
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,280
What are you playing with over there?

382
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,280
-You’re disgusting.
-Yijie.

383
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:35,780
Xiao.

384
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:37,280
Director.

385
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,400
Are you okay?

386
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,650
Everything's okay.

387
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:42,710
Help him up slowly.

388
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,340
Watch his head.

389
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,030
Director Xiao,

390
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,530
his blood pressure is already at 200.

391
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,150
He must be taken to the hospital
or else...

392
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,400
I'm really worried.

393
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,180
Okay, but I don't have anyone available
for escort duty.

394
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,680
I can go by myself.

395
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:54,610
I'll come back.

396
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,030
I know you're just saying crap.

397
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,760
Need an escort to the hospital?

398
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,280
I'll go.

399
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,570
Director, don't want him.

400
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,880
Let this rookie take me instead.

401
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,150
It's a special situation.

402
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,570
Director, he scares me.

403
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:08,570
Can it not be him?

404
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,330
You're being picky now?

405
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,060
Gao Zhiyao.

406
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:12,400
You go with him.

407
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,400
Gao Zhiyao, may I ask

408
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,900
why No. 9568 is eating cookies?

409
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,030
Doesn't he have high blood pressure?

410
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,180
And, excuse me, where did he

411
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,110
get the cookies?

412
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,540
I have high blood pressure,
but I also have low blood sugar.

413
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:40,120
Senior, our gear looks so cool.

414
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,900
And we even have tasers.

415
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,150
It looks like we're shooting a movie.

416
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,150
like John Wick.

417
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,530
You're dead.

418
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,030
I wasn't ready. One more time.

419
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:52,280
Dead again.

420
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:53,650
One more time.

421
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,330
And you're dead again.

422
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:57,870
One more time.

423
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,820
Dead yet again.

424
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,340
Move again and I'll tase you, I swear.

425
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,040
Be careful at the hospital.

426
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,770
If something goes wrong,
we'll be in big trouble.

427
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:20,430
[Emergency]

428
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,190
Okay, thanks.

429
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,000
Want to add me on LINE?

430
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,950
How inappropriate.

431
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:39,770
I'm sorry.

432
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:53,010
Your hands are cuffed

433
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,490
and you're still horny.

434
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,090
I'll come find you tonight.

435
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,330
Bro, seriously.

436
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,400
How many eye-pleasing pictures
do you want?

437
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,890
I'll find a way to get them for you.

438
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:05,350
You're outside now.
Don't cause any trouble.

439
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,190
How about this?

440
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,030
Get me some

441
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,330
nude photos of elderly people.

442
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,550
That's terrible. So inappropriate.

443
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,780
You already have high blood pressure.

444
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,940
And what's that blood pressure medicine
you took?

445
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,070
You still get horny after taking it.

446
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,570
That's a happy pill.

447
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,440
Take it and you can come get happy.

448
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,130
My stomach hurts.

449
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,200
I need to take a dump.

450
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,440
For real?

451
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:44,340
Does it look like I'm faking it?

452
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:48,760
Senior.

453
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,020
He needs to take a dump.

454
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,070
You take me there.

455
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:53,940
You take me.

456
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,690
-Don't want him.
-Why?

457
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:55,930
I don't want him.

458
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:58,830
He needs to take a dump.

459
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,320
You're really troublesome.

460
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,320
How many times do you need to go?

461
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,440
I have a good digestive system.

462
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,500
I can't control it.

463
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,690
Hurry up!

464
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,570
Here, fill out the rest.

465
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,750
At the bottom, and then this one below.

466
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,720
I'll take him.

467
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,720
What? You need to fill out forms
just to take a dump?

468
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,920
Senior, how do I fill this out?

469
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,400
I just got here. I don't know how.

470
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,570
He needs to learn too?

471
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,440
I'm seriously about to soil my pants.

472
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,860
By the time you finish learning,
I'll be done pooping.

473
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,990
Sit down!

474
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,880
-I'm gonna explode.
-Sit down!

475
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:26,820
I'm sorry.

476
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,140
No noise in the hospital.

477
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,140
Lower your voice.

478
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,820
-Lower your voice.
-Sit down.

479
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,800
I'm sorry.

480
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,940
-Then hurry up.
-Sit down first.

481
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,940
You're still filling out the forms.

482
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,520
You take him.

483
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,880
I'll fill this out.

484
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:40,910
Okay.

485
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,070
Be careful.

486
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:46,820
Be careful.

487
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,690
No. 9568, the toilet is over there.

488
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,130
Thanks.

489
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:00,820
Are you going to do it or not?

490
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,080
Are you leaving or not?

491
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:05,940
Can I have some privacy
for using the bathroom?

492
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,200
Didn't you say you were about to explode?

493
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,130
How can I go with you standing here?

494
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,330
Are you two...

495
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,800
Ma'am, you've misunderstood.

496
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,820
How is it? Do you like it?

497
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,360
Fine, I'll wait for you outside.

498
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,360
Hurry up.

499
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,570
Ma'am, you've got it wrong.

500
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,030
I'm just supervising him.

501
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,930
Ma'am, are you feeling unwell?

502
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:05,400
Ma'am, please rest over there.

503
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,900
Let me help you.

504
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:07,970
Okay.

505
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,880
I'll get some water first.

506
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:10,910
Wait for me.

507
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,900
Why is your little buddy hanging out?

508
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,930
I was about to use the bathroom.

509
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,070
Ma'am, were you eating porridge?

510
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,670
Would you like to rest over there?

511
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,210
Thank you.

512
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,320
Good, that's fine now. Thank you.

513
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:58,580
Here, drink some warm water first.

514
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:00,940
Are you feeling better?

515
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,780
If you still feel unwell,
remember to make an appointment.

516
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,400
Okay, thanks.

517
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:05,970
Thank you.

518
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,870
Gao Zhiyao, what are you doing?

519
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,810
She just vomited all over the floor.

520
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:11,210
I'm helping her clean up.

521
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,280
Where's No. 9568?

522
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,230
He's in the bathroom.

523
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,350
Are you okay now? Take care of yourself.

524
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,260
Gao Zhiyao.

525
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,900
Where's No. 9568?

526
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,200
How long has he been out of sight?

527
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,650
-Well...
-How long? Hurry up.

528
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:32,780
Just now, not long ago.

529
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,280
Let's split up and search.

530
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,710
I'm screwed.

531
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:44,130
He probably hasn't gone far.

532
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:45,340
I'm done for, Senior.

533
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,340
Will I go to jail if we can't find him?

534
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,030
Let's check the security cameras first.

535
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,150
-Okay.
-Let’s go.

536
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,820
Senior, what are you going to do?

537
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,190
Ask them for the security footage.

538
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:06,980
No, don't.

539
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,460
If you ask them for help,

540
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:09,940
won't that make this a bigger issue?

541
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,440
I'll get punished.

542
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,310
I'll be the one punished.

543
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,440
You'll be expelled.

544
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:17,070
Do you have a better idea?

545
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,820
I have an idea.

546
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,900
I have an idea.

547
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,080
-Wait for me.
-What?

548
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:26,050
Don't be rash. I have a solution.

549
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,180
Where are you going?

550
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,570
Let's go check it out.

551
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:42,280
Everything seems normal.

552
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,900
There is a fire emergency.

553
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,150
Please evacuate immediately
toward the emergency exits.

554
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,940
Attention, everyone!

555
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,530
There is a fire emergency.

556
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:52,790
Please evacuate immediately
toward the emergency exits.

557
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:54,930
Senior!

558
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,650
They all came out.

559
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:57,030
They're all out. What's wrong?

560
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,290
Did you pull the alarm?

561
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,400
Are you crazy?

562
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,900
Why are you making things worse?

563
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,780
Hurry! They'll be back soon.

564
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,400
Such good habits.

565
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,600
Hey! What are you doing?

566
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,130
Great!

567
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,730
Now we can add vandalism to the charges.

568
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:21,860
Hurry!

569
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,530
Isn't that the volunteer from earlier?

570
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:34,040
What's their relationship?

571
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:34,740
Yeah, right.

572
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,610
Is that lady drinking porridge?

573
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,030
So that lady was part of their plan?

574
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,360
That's too much!

575
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,440
They took advantage of my sympathy.

576
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:48,770
He escaped during this time.

577
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,980
Where are they going?

578
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,380
-The ninth floor.
-The ninth floor.

579
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:13,660
No. 9568 must have been
holding it in for too long.

580
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,860
So wild.

581
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,030
He's turned himself into a wild beast.

582
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,240
She's not going to jump up there, is she?

583
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,570
She actually jumped up.

584
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,400
Having fun?

585
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:31,590
Enjoying the show?

586
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,040
He's missing
and you're still laughing?

587
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,530
I'm looking at...

588
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,650
the room number. It's 9...

589
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,130
Wait, zoom in.

590
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,620
-9A12.
-9A12.

591
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,320
Senior, you...

592
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,820
It's the ninth floor.

593
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,680
Why didn't you take the elevator?

594
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,800
I didn't see it earlier.

595
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:01,730
You could've seen it
by rounding the corner.

596
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,330
Where are we going now?

597
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:22,440
Want more?

598
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,270
Yes.

599
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,570
You pervert!

600
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:30,430
You big lecher!

601
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,600
You're messing with me again.

602
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:37,820
Come on, let me introduce you all.

603
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:39,290
My wife.

604
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:42,250
Unlucky guy, annoying guy.

605
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,370
He's hot.

606
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:45,090
Really?

607
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,570
Hello, I'm Elsa.

608
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:48,940
I just wanted to
give him a health check-up.

609
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,940
Everything is healthy.

610
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,570
Just some areas
that are blocked, you know.

611
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:53,820
So I helped clear them out.

612
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,750
Prostate care.

613
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:58,490
Handcuff him.

614
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:03,150
Give me your hands.

615
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:09,000
Is this how you want to play?

616
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,940
You little tease.

617
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,440
Isn't this exactly what you like?

618
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,070
-I like it.
-I’m glad you do.

619
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,400
Can we stop playing now?

620
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:21,370
Or would you both like to go to prison?

621
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:22,500
Can we?

622
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:24,950
Can we?

623
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,560
-Zhiyao.
-You can sleep with me.

624
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,270
But is your room big enough?

625
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,320
Or should we request a double suite?

626
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:32,690
Great!

627
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:33,440
What about using the bathroom?

628
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,690
Get down now.

629
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,940
So fierce, yet so cute.

630
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,280
As cute as me?

631
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,090
He's the ugliest one in there.

632
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,210
Where did you find this hot guy?

633
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,590
Thank you, hottie.

634
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,150
I'm still here.

635
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,000
I've already gone through
two rounds with you.

636
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:00,760
Turn around.

637
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,680
Put your hands behind your back.

638
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,620
About what happened at the hospital today,

639
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:16,220
I'll request
disciplinary action for myself.

640
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:19,210
There you go again.

641
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,360
No.

642
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,900
Can you stop being so stubborn every time?

643
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,530
This isn't a small matter.

644
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:26,990
No, he's just a rookie,

645
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,760
so the responsibility is on me.

646
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,110
He's a rookie,

647
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:32,240
so the responsibility should be on me.

648
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,780
Right? I was the one who sent you there.

649
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,320
No, according to protocol,

650
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,570
I should request disciplinary action.

651
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:38,780
And I will do it.

652
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,420
According to protocol,

653
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,150
it's the Custody Department's problem.

654
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:44,910
The Custody Division's problems
are my responsibility.

655
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:46,460
I'll take the blame.

656
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:50,270
I should take responsibility, that's it.

657
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,270
Fine.

658
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,780
Zhiyao caused some damage

659
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,650
at the hospital today.

660
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:55,910
The hospital said they'll send us a bill.

661
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,480
What kind of damage?

662
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,480
Anyway, when you get the bill,

663
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,700
give it to the director.

664
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,840
You'll have to handle the director.

665
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,170
You handle everything.

666
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,020
Thank you.

667
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:05,530
I'll go write my report first.

668
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:06,900
Sorry for the trouble. Thanks.

669
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,570
-Wait.
-I’ll write the report.

670
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:08,650
Yijie, wait.

671
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,030
Hey, talking about money hurts feelings.

672
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,090
What's this about?

673
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:13,800
What damage? Tens of thousand of dollars?

674
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:16,150
What is he,

675
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,650
the Terminator?

676
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:24,280
I'm back.

677
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,650
So energetic.

678
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:30,880
Zhongwen.

679
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,840
Is this yours? Can I have a bite?

680
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:40,320
Did your hospital escort duty
go smoothly today?

681
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,620
No. 9568 played me.

682
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,530
I almost lost him.

683
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:45,600
Lost?

684
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:47,440
I'm glad you didn't lose him.

685
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:49,990
Otherwise, you'd lose your job

686
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:51,670
and have criminal liability.

687
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,530
Are you serious?

688
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,040
No.

689
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,540
You can try it.

690
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,030
But with your IQ,

691
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:01,310
just try not to lose yourself.

692
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:04,150
But you just got here and already
assigned to external medical escort duty.

693
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,680
I think that's pretty good.

694
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,570
It should help with
getting a permanent position later.

695
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:10,070
Zhongwen, is there more?

696
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,230
I bought extra.

697
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:13,830
Do you want me to microwave it for you?

698
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:15,230
-Wait for me.
-Thank you.

699
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:16,850
Do you want some soup?

700
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,500
It's too salty. I might need a dialysis.

701
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,530
Hey, the washing machine is still running.

702
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:24,260
Don't use the microwave yet,
or the power will...

703
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:25,400
Go out.

704
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,300
Sorry.

705
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:36,500
Is everything okay?

706
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,110
No.

707
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:38,389
Next room then.

708
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:39,340
Thank you, Officer.

709
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,469
Thank you for your hard work, Officer.

710
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,530
Excuse me.

711
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,300
Please squat down again.

712
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:48,280
Counselor, is something wrong?

713
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,280
Well, I received information that

714
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,210
there are prohibited items in this cell.

715
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:53,210
Who said that?

716
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,150
There's no problem.
We just finished checking.

717
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,530
Everything is in compliance.

718
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,400
That's right.
Everything is in compliance.

719
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,030
Officer, we've been good.

720
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,650
Sorry,

721
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,160
but please squat down.

722
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:05,650
Squat down.

723
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:06,370
Squat down.

724
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,030
How did you conduct your inspection?

725
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,900
Everything is neatly arranged.

726
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,780
Did you really inspect this?

727
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,780
Is being neat a problem?

728
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,650
What's wrong with being clean and proper?

729
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:22,780
We're neat.

730
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,210
That's right.

731
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,530
My inspection methods
are more... effective.

732
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,080
What methods?

733
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,030
The method of turning a blind eye?

734
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,600
We'll inspect again.

735
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:40,400
Officer,

736
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:43,240
you've been very concerned
about me lately.

737
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,980
I'm a counselor.

738
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:47,030
I care about everyone here.

739
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:50,900
You just gave me demerits
for violations earlier,

740
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,780
and now you're personally
conducting routine inspections?

741
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:56,180
Your status is different from others here.

742
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:58,780
Officer,

743
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,900
I have a question I'd like to ask.

744
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:03,110
If I went out

745
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:05,490
and left the guard's sight
without permission,

746
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:06,780
and got demerits for that violation,

747
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,280
then what about the guard in charge?

748
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,560
Thank you for your concern.

749
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:15,100
I've already requested
disciplinary action for myself.

750
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,080
Requested for yourself?

751
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:18,530
Did you get any demerits?

752
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:20,650
Will you get transferred?

753
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,150
Watch your attitude.

754
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:23,780
Sorry, Officer.

755
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:27,110
Or did Daddy just give you
a little spank on the butt?

756
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,780
Ouchie!

757
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:34,280
How's it going? Did you find anything?

758
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:37,090
Found some things.

759
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,780
Wow, No. 9568.

760
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,400
So many cigarettes.

761
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,900
No, those are within the allowed limit,

762
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,150
right, Shun?

763
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:49,030
No, they're way over the limit.

764
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:49,590
Really?

765
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,880
What are you doing? You want to sell them?

766
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:57,780
And what's this? Sorghum liquor?

767
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,160
This is really unfair.

768
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:00,230
I've never even seen that thing.

769
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:00,960
What's that?

770
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:01,880
Whose is it?

771
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,100
Officer, reporting!

772
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,900
They're all mine.

773
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,730
I accept my punishment.

774
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,210
Bad apple!

775
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,690
What's going on with this cell block?

776
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:10,400
Don't you care about losing points?

777
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,530
Don't want family visits anymore?

778
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:13,140
No, we're afraid.

779
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,150
Officer, please have mercy.

780
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,830
It won't happen again.

781
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:21,340
This also...

782
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,320
This was also just found now?

783
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,400
It was well hidden.

784
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:29,530
Wow, No. 9568.

785
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,530
Excuse me,

786
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,720
whose raunchy cards

787
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,780
are these?

788
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,780
If I were you,

789
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:41,150
I wouldn't hold those cards so close.

790
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,440
So dirty.

791
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:53,280
Shun.

792
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,960
Confiscate everything.

793
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,540
Give demerits as required.

794
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:18,410
Time's up.

795
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:21,180
My head hurts so much.

796
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,550
Can you massage it more?

797
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:25,030
You need to pay more.

798
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,320
So materialistic.

799
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:30,990
I'm the boss
and I'm serving you personally.

800
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,980
You should be grateful
I'm not charging double.

801
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,400
Fine.

802
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,780
Come on.

803
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:42,720
What's giving you this headache?

804
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,580
My son, of course,

805
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,880
and the prison.

806
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:48,400
It's frustrating. There's no solution.

807
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,060
Sometimes, just thinking about it
makes my blood pressure spike.

808
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,670
Speaking of blood pressure...

809
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,810
Here, for your blood pressure.

810
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,240
Remember to take it.

811
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,490
More health supplements?

812
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:05,900
Thanks.

813
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:09,530
You got to take care of yourself
at your age.

814
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:12,460
How does it feel?

815
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,340
Dad, is your health okay?

816
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,400
Why are you buying so many supplements?

817
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,600
Come on, don't worry about
the supplements.

Dad.

820
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,660
Did you remove my disciplinary report?

821
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,950
You think I'm protecting you?

822
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,950
I never thought about
if you're protecting me or not,

823
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:58,070
but I've said before that
I don't want special treatment.

824
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:00,930
If I make mistakes,
I should face the consequences.

825
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,440
Fine.

826
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,400
If I let this issue become public,

827
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,780
and everyone gets inspected daily,

828
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,980
would that be better?

829
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,650
Do what should be done.

830
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:18,590
Yijie.

831
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:20,940
I really don't know

if your goal is to climb the ladder

833
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:25,210
or to study why people commit crimes.

834
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:28,430
Anyway, if you want to stay here,

835
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:31,560
there are certain rules
you must understand.

Understand?

840
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,520
So for the sake of expansion,

841
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,780
rights and wrongs don't matter anymore?

842
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:47,170
Things have different priorities.

843
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:48,700
Let me emphasize again.

844
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:50,420
This year, the Central Prison

why does Jieyu get a drink?

I accidentally kicked her prisoner
last time.

858
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:58,910
It's an apology.

859
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:00,400
Senior, here are the documents.

860
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,060

00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:03,250

Why don't I get a drink?

So pretty.

866

I don't know her.

Don't know her?

If you don't know her,
why did she greet you?

874
