I'm sorry.

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,670
Now I understand why you didn't let me
bring him.

5
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:47,760
It's too late to say that now.

6
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,520
Come with me to talk to Chief.

7
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:52,730
How is he?

8
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,150
How's his condition now?

9
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,800
He's okay.

Isn't he your good friend?

13
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,550
How could you not know anything?

14
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:03,770
What do you even know?

15
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:04,790
I had no idea

16
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,720
he couldn't get over his ex-girlfriend
to that extent.

Why am I not surprised at all?

21
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,420
Again!

I'm sorry, Chief.

27
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,030
It was my oversight.

28
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,660
Of course it was your oversight.
Or was it supposed to be mine?

Chief.

30
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,000
That was an unexpected situation.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,160
He already did his best, alright?

32
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,010
Director Xiao, are you taking his side?

33
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:32,880
Fine, if you want to shoulder it—

their salaries deducted for 3 months.

00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:41,360
it was an unexpected situation.
This is too harsh.

37
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,820
Once might be considered unexpected,

38
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,330
but how many times
has this happened with Gao Zhiyao?

39
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,130
He's long been unfit for the job.

Let me ask you.

41
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,810
I've heard he's your friend.

42
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,530
Does being friends mean
you can ignore the rules?

43
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,030
Are you trying to help him escape,

44
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,150
or do you want to accompany him in jail?

45
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:55,690
You can do that, you know?

46
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,330

-Chief.

50
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,320
He still lacks experience, alright?

51
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,820
Lacks experience? No way.

00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,930

00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,910

00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,310
A life for a life!

186
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,050
A life for a life!

187
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,670
Cell Block Violation, requesting backup.

188
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,190
The inmate in Cell 9 is having an issue.

189
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,940
-Please calm down, inmate.
-Gao Zhiyao.

190
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,800
What issue is Inmate 5119 having?

191
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,820
Hurry over! He's hurting himself!

192
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,190
I'm sorry, inmate. Please calm down!

193
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,250
Please don't be so agitated, inmate.

194
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:33,940
Director.

195
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:35,530
What should we do?

196
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,440
What's the current situation?

197
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,190
He's running around
and yelling loudly in there.

198
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,530
My guards!

199
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,590
Did you touch his things?

200
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,070
You mean those?

201
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,000
Did you call them paper figurines?

202
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,420
Aren't they just tissues?

203
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,040
Those are his buddies!

204
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,300
-His buddies?
-No time for that now.

205
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,570
This psycho has H.

206
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:53,690
We need to put him in a straitjacket

207
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:54,570
to calm him down.

208
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:55,690
Otherwise, if he keeps bumping around
like this,

209
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:56,940
he'll end up covered in blood.

210
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,940
Do you understand?

211
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,940
What is H?

212
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,320
HIV.

213
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,900
You've been here for so long
and you still don't know what's going on?

214
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,070
Are you an idiot?

215
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,710
I'll handle restraining him.

216
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,440
You know what that means?

217
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,320
AIDS.

218
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,380
A life for a life!

219
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,560
Get ready.

220
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:15,870
Three.

221
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:17,900
Two.

222
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:20,630
One.

223
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,780
Zhan Wenlin, calm down.

224
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,610
Inmate, please calm down.

225
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,810
Don't be so agitated.

226
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,030
Don't be so agitated, okay?

227
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,020
Zhongwen, go!

228
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,250
Zhongwen!

229
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:39,130
Director!

230
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,090
Zhongwen, restrain him!

231
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,790
[Mona]

232
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:34,050
So, will I get AIDS?

233
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,570
The report is out.

234
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,540
What's the result?

235
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,280
It's negative.

236
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:52,780
I think it's a pity.

237
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,370
Here.

238
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,910
This is the inmate log
our Education Division compiled.

239
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,020
If you want to keep working in
Central Prison,

240
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,520
memorize it.

241
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,950
I hate studying the most.

242
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,070
S-So many pages?

243
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,940
There's more than one biter in there.

244
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,390
Memorize it or not, it's your choice.

245
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,900
The inmates in Cell Block Violation
all have their own triggers.

246
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,940
Aside from HIV, Inmate 5119

247
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,900
also suffers from long‑term schizophrenia.

248
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,230
The paper figurines you damaged

249
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,780
are like family to him.

250
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,320
If you want to keep working in
Cell Block Violation,

251
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,580
you need to know them better.

252
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,760
But it'll take me several days
to finish reading this.

253
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,680
You have to memorize it now.

254
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,570
The last thing I memorized
was the multiplication table.

255
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:28,300
Come on then.

256
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,050
The multiplication table.

257
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:30,820
What's 8 times 7?

258
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,570
56!

259
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,570
Wrong. 87 is you—an idiot.

260
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,400
Alright, let's give him
a bit of confidence.

261
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:39,530
The key point is

262
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,010
you need to memorize
the inmates' keywords and characteristics,

263
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:42,550
okay?

264
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,160
Come on, Jiajun.

265
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,100
I've only read this book once.

266
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,570
Inmate 0776, life imprisonment.

267
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,940
He has a mole on his face,
and he likes to fight and cause trouble.

268
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,130
He's not afraid of anything but his mom.

269
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,990
His favorite is popcorn chicken.

270
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,530
So his memory points:
has a mole on his face, likes fighting,

271
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:59,530
afraid of his mom, popcorn chicken.

272
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,020
Has a mole on his face, likes fighting,

273
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,570
afraid of his mom, popcorn chicken.

274
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,320
You go.

275
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,170
Has a mole on his face,
afraid of fighting,

276
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,460
chicken mom, popcorn.

277
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,500
Is it really that hard?

278
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,020
You two, repeat it.

279
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,690
Has a mole on his face, likes fighting,

280
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,320
afraid of his mom, popcorn chicken.

281
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,070
You two.

282
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,690
Has a mole on his face, likes fighting,

283
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,690
afraid of his mom, popcorn chicken.

284
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,690
Has a mole on his face,
afraid of fighting,

285
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:23,570
chicken mom, popcorn.

286
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,070
Has a mole on his face, likes fighting,

287
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,940
afraid of his mom, popcorn chicken.

288
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,940
I really feel like giving you a slap.

289
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,820
-Idiot.
-This is too hard.

290
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,820
How can I possibly memorize all this?

291
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,280
Just let him get bitten then.

292
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,570
I agree.

293
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:52,900
Come on.

294
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,660
Self-harm, loud and noisy,

295
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,350
likes strip-shaped objects.

296
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,530
Come on.

297
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,570
Concentrate. Hurry up and memorize it.

298
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:08,790
Likes to bite people,

299
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,400
has schizophrenia, and loves to laugh.

300
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,440
Inmate 0776.

301
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,570
Has a mole on his face, likes fighting,
afraid of his mom, and...

302
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:16,440
Popcorn!

303
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,820
It's popcorn chicken!

304
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,690
It's popcorn chicken!

305
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,470
Inmate 4807.

306
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,180
Inmate 4807...

307
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,470
Can't talk about his mom.

308
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:32,090
If he loses control,
give him a braised egg.

309
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,140
Inmate 2388.

310
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:36,280
Inmate 2388...

311
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,180
Can talk about his mom.

312
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,160
If he loses control,
put protective gear on him.

313
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,500
The last one, Inmate 5119.

314
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,210
Has schizophrenia,

315
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,190
likes to bite people, likes anime.

316
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,130
Yes. Finally.

317
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,320
Finally.

318
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,280
Wait.

319
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:58,940
Inmate 0776.

320
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,520
What kind of flower does he like?

321
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,430
He knows. He knows.

322
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,550
No, that won't do.

323
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,570
Inmate 0776—what kind of flower
does he like?

324
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,820
Popcorn chicken.

325
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,700
Class is over! I'm going home.

326
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,390
I'll pack this up for you to bring home.

327
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,860
I'm exhausted.

328
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,350
I'll leave the rest to you.

329
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,420
Good luck.

330
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:24,990
There's more?

331
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:25,950
Follow me.

332
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,780
I know you used to learn taekwondo,

333
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,570
but in the prison, what we need
isn't heavy strikes,

334
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,440
but restraining the inmates.

335
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,320
So judo actually works better
than taekwondo.

336
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,320
Isn't judo just that martial art
where you grab each other's clothes

337
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,920
and twist each other around?

338
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:41,820
Have you learned it?

339
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,740
I've tried it.

340
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,190
In the prison,
since it's not a competition,

341
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,850
no one has rules in their mind.

342
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,910
What you need to learn
is breaking their stance.

343
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,850
Come on, try to break free.

344
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,000
Use your strength.

345
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:05,550
Didn't you say you'd tried it before?
Use your strength then.

346
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,120
You've watched too many movies.

347
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,750
This is completely useless in real combat,

348
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,210
because the inmates won't just
stand still.

349
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:23,480
Senior.

350
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,840
You didn't even give me time to get ready.

351
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:29,060
The inmates won't give you time
to get ready, either.

352
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,180
Get up. Come on.

353
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,080
You need to find my center of gravity,

354
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,210
and then disrupt it.

355
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,320
Shrimpies!

356
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,150
Shrimpies!

357
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,020
Senior.

358
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,170
This is to avenge my Shrimpies.

359
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,430
Come on! Let's continue.

360
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,480
Get up.

361
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:57,690
Come on.

362
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,280
Center of gravity!

363
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,030
Feel my center of gravity.

364
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,550
Senior.

365
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,540
Are you okay?

366
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,550
I didn't expect you to be so good.

367
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,000
Let's continue later.

368
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:27,780
Bring it on.

369
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,070
Central Desk!

370
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,500
Cell Block Violation requesting backup!

371
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,470
Director!

372
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:44,530
Director!

373
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,280
He's banging his head against the wall
in there, as usual.

374
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,780
We're ready.

375
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,780
I've never seen a bumpkin like you.

376
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,880
Show me what you've got then.

377
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:54,780
Get ready.

378
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,400
Okay.

379
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,560
Three, two, one.

380
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,070
Zhan Wenlin.

381
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,420
Relax, inmate.

382
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,460
We'll put you in a straitjacket now,

383
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,180
so you can go out for some fresh air

384
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,310
and chat a bit with our social workers.

385
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,540
Murderer!

386
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,780
-Director!
-Restrain him!

387
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,030
Don't let him bite you!

388
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,570
Relax!

389
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:34,400
Jiajun!

390
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,490
Jiajun!

391
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,150
Inmate 5119.

392
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,940
Has schizophrenia, likes to bite people,

393
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,860
and likes to imagine

394
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,400
that he's a character from an anime world.

395
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,780
What anime?

396
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,190
Which anime does he like again?

397
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,030
-Which anime does he like again?
-Think fast!

398
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,150
How many words are there in the title?

399
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,030
Hurry up!

400
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:50,580
One word or two!

401
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,450
Digimon!

402
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:51,900
That's not it!

403
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,030
Pokemon! Pokemon!

404
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:53,780
Not that!

405
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,780
Doraemon?

406
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:55,840
Not that either!

407
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,780
Major?

408
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:57,620
Hurry up!

409
00:18:59,030 --> 00:18:59,980
Ju...

410
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,400
Ju...

411
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,400
Jujutsu Kaisen!

412
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,000
This is it!

413
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,580
Jutsushiki jyunten, "Ao."

414
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,270
Jutsushiki hanten, "Aka."

415
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,150
He's reacting!

416
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,270
It's working.

417
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,240
So this is not the anime you like?

418
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,700
You said you memorized it!

419
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:31,510
Well...

420
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,760
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

421
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:37,780
Beast Breathing!

422
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,280
Second Fang!

423
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,910
Sharp Blade Counter-Slash!

424
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,230
It's Demon Slayer!

425
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,510
It worked.

426
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,900
Tanjiro!

427
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,500
Found you!

428
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,280
Tanjiro.

429
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,090
I'm...

430
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,030
Inosuke.

431
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,410
Inosuke?

432
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,050
You idiot...

433
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,030
Where have you been?

434
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:16,850
I'm sorry.

435
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,650
I'm sorry.

436
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,150
Inosuke.

437
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,280
Tanjiro.

438
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:24,530
Inosuke.

439
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,240
I just slayed an evil spirit.

440
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,110
Sorry to keep you waiting.

441
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,400
Don't worry.

442
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:34,110
They're from our Demon Slayer Corps.

443
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,570
You're injured.

444
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,630
I'll take you to get treated.

445
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,590
Get up first.

446
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,400
Get up first.

447
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,780
Tanjiro!

448
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,060
Tanjiro!

449
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:51,840
Jiajun.

450
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,310
Put him in the straitjacket.

451
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,060
Tanjiro!

452
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,030
Tanjiro.

453
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,890
We'll help you put on
your Demon Slayer Garment.

454
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,000
Come on.

455
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,330
Your Demon Slayer Garment.

456
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,690
-Demon Slayer Garment.
-Demon Slayer Garment.

457
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,190
Demon Slayer Corps, pack up.

458
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,900
-Demon Slayer Garment.
-Demon Slayer Garment.

459
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,280
Demon Slayer Garment.

460
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,270
Your meeting with him is over?

461
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,750
What's going on,

462
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,680
already out of ideas
and resorting to fried chicken?

463
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,210
I guess there's no other way, right?

464
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:35,880
Yeah.

465
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,530
Gao Zhiyao.

466
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:39,900
Come here.

467
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,840
Get over here.

468
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,400
Think of a solution with us.

469
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,440
What solution?

470
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,350
Get over here.

471
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:51,030
Your friend has been on a hunger strike
for 3 days.

472
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,150
He said if his ex-girlfriend doesn't come,

473
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,530
he'll starve himself to death.

474
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:55,650
I know this. I've talked to him,

475
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:56,530
but he wouldn't listen.

476
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:57,780
I don't know what else to do.

477
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,150
But he's your friend.

478
00:21:59,150 --> 00:21:59,650
Right.

479
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:00,630
Help me talk some sense into him

480
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:02,230
and chat with him a bit, okay?

481
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,280
He's the one who got things
into this mess.

482
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,030
There's no way things can work
between them now.

483
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,900
What is love in this world anyway?

484
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,530
If he still refuses to eat,

485
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,790
I'll tie him up and force‑feed him.

486
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:15,460
Miss Fang, no need to go that far, right?

487
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:17,810
I'll try talking to him again.

488
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,560
Why are you holding your stomach
like that?

489
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:21,720
Director!

490
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,180
Director, I have a stomachache.

491
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,150
Well, let me check.

492
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,650
No, I mean I'm about to have diarrhea.

493
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,710
I need to go to the restroom right now.

494
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,290
I'll figure something out.

495
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,760
Think about it while you're at it.

496
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,330
Miss Fang, instead of only giving him
fried chicken,

497
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,180
the urn‑roasted chicken,
the four‑herbs chicken—

498
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,530
bring them all out.

499
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,060
If he won't eat, I'll eat them.
How about that?

500
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,400
Is it this one?

501
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,560
Put it away properly.

502
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,850
What about beef noodles?

503
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,650
It's really hard to bring beef noodles in.

504
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,970
By the time they get here,
they'll be cold and not taste good.

505
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:06,770
How about I give you
instant beef noodles instead?

506
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,530
Come here!

507
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:11,720
Come here.

508
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,950
Stop it.

509
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:13,780
Come here.

510
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,030
Stop it.

511
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,330
Have a lollipop.

512
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,190
Here.

513
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,200
Come here, let me flick your ear.

514
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,000
I... I'll figure something out.

515
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:34,570
Tadpole.

516
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,400
Why are you hiding in the corner?

517
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,150
Tadpole?

518
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,900
Are you trying to starve yourself to death
by not eating?

519
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,430
I might as well die.

520
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:46,540
My life's ruined. I've lost everything.

521
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,980
No way.

522
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:52,280
You're so handsome and good at taekwondo.

523
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,900
Don't imitate the way I talk!

524
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,460
You're really pesky.

525
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,930
What's his girlfriend's name?

526
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,500
I'll tell my sister to bring her in.

527
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,750
You can't do this.

528
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:04,730
Let him have this book

529
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:07,150
and release a bit, and he'll be fine.

530
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,980
You're really getting ruder and ruder.

531
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:21,800
This is from the weird guy next door.

532
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,690
Why don't you give it a try?

533
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:23,150
Also,

534
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:25,530
give him a lollipop

535
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,660
and tell him to stop crying.

536
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,030
And a lollipop.

537
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,530
Beef noodles.

538
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:39,380
Got it, alright?

539
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:45,780
Little shrimp.

540
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,630
Enjoy.

541
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,400
That's my favorite issue.

542
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:55,350
They finally released the limited edition.

543
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,030
Why did you have to give me this?

544
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:10,900
You forced me to betray Xiang!

545
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,520
Are you done crying?

546
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,530
-Xiang is with someone else now.
-Shut up!

547
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:17,780
Shut up! You don't understand!

548
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,380
Little shrimp.

549
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,390
Stop crying.

550
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,740
Your girlfriend ran off with someone else.

551
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,260
You should be happy for her,

552
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,530
for finding someone better than you.

553
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,400
Right, stop crying.

554
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,650
I'll take you to find a woman.

555
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:34,050
I don't want anyone else.

556
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:36,980
I only want Xiang.

557
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,300
I might as well die.

558
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,150
No sleep for us tonight again.

559
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,440
I might as well die.

560
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,650
Are you punching the wall
or banging your head against it now?

561
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,030
If you're banging your head,

562
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:51,900
do it harder.

563
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:53,360
Only then can you die.

564
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,530
You won't die if you don't bang it harder.

565
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:56,280
Harder.

566
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,780
What, afraid of the pain?

567
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,530
You see the fan?

568
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,290
Take off your clothes,

569
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,530
hang yourself on it,

570
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:10,730
point the chopsticks

571
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,510
at your carotid artery,

572
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,100
and pull it downward.

573
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:21,150
Stop being sarcastic, okay?

574
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,210
Sarcastic?

575
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,400
That's because
you're not determined to die.

576
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,280
If you really are determined to die,

577
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,780
block up the sink,

578
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,400
fill it with water,
and submerge your head in the water.

579
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,930
You'll be gone in 3 minutes.

580
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,210
Or you can stand high,

581
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,030
aim your chin at the sink,

582
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:40,630
close your eyes, and jump.
Then your cervical spine will just...

583
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,780
Why did you go quiet?

584
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:53,810
Are you dead?

585
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,620
Stop crying.

586
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,080
It's okay your girlfriend left you.

587
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,530
It's not like you lost a piece of yourself
or something.

588
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:07,530
That's right. You're a man.

589
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,060
Don't lose the whole forest

590
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,700
for a tree.

591
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,030
Calling Xiang all the time,
wailing like that.

592
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:15,280
That's right. There are so many
pretty girls out there,

593
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,530
tons with great figures. You can find
any kind of girl you like.

594
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:18,390
You heard that?

595
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,150
Seriously,

596
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,900
if you want to compare
who's got it worse,

597
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,230
everyone in this row
has it worse than you.

598
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,660
If you really want to die,

599
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,550
make it quick. Be brave.

600
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,130
If you don't,

601
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,780
stop making us all
lose our sleep. Understand?

602
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,780
Nice, bro. That's more like it.

603
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:39,450
Great. Now we can finally sleep.

604
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,570
Bro, have you eaten?

605
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:00,200
I have.

606
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,860
I heard you've competed abroad before.

607
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,650
Yeah.

608
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:11,310
I've been to Tokyo, Busan,

609
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,240
Jakarta, and Doha.

610
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:15,260
Duha? Where's that?

611
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:16,530
It's Doha.

612
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:20,030
It's over in... Saudi Arabia.

613
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:21,510
Let me tell you,

614
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:23,710
the houses there are super pretty,

615
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,300
and the streets are full of rich people—

616
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,230
there are a bunch of Lamborghinis.

617
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,710
Have you been to Iceland?

618
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:33,530
Iceland.

619
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,030
No.

620
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,060
You want to go there, bro?

621
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:43,070
At the Doha Asian Games that year,

622
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,030
I lost in the quarterfinals,

623
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:45,610
but it was still one of

624
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:47,280
the highlights of my life.

625
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,730
Bro, do you have

626
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,330
any highlights in your life?

627
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:54,280
Life's full of ups and downs.

628
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,690
I just keep going in
and out of this place.

629
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:59,220
What kind of highlight
could I possibly have?

630
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,530
Seems like your life's been
pretty exciting.

631
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:05,400
Mostly just fighting, though.

632
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,110
What's exciting about that?

633
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,840
In official matches in junior high,

634
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,530
I had 33 wins and 21 losses.

635
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:16,090
Have you ever fought more than that?

636
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:17,930
Yes.

637
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,010
More than that.

638
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,000
So did you mostly win or lose?

639
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,880
Does it matter?

640
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,260
Either way, I'd end up in here.

641
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,140
So what was the reason this time?

642
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,130
Cat abuse.

643
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:35,300
I was in a good mood that day,

644
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,760
then I saw some idiot abusing a cat.
Darn it.

645
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,030
So I stepped in to stop him.

646
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,530
You got locked up for that?

647
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,530
I smashed his face in.

648
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,250
That was you...

649
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:58,420
Delivering justice, alright?

650
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:00,350
Sure.

651
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,370
He finally ate something?

652
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,400
Yes, finally.

653
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:13,280
If he still wouldn't eat, Miss Fang
would use her ultimate move.

654
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,940
Tie him up and force‑feed him.

655
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,140
Sounds super scary.

656
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,810
Gao Zhiyao, help me return this
to that buddy.

657
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,410
Leave this to me.

658
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:27,400
You're a full-time staff member now.
Be good, alright?

659
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,150
Got it.

660
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,650
Thank you.

661
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,650
Wa.

662
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,650
Your secret photo book.

663
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:41,390
You came at the right time.

664
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,080
Get me a photo.

665
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,910
With snowscape.

666
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,440
Preferably taken in Iceland.

667
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:50,200
Also,

668
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:53,780
go to my sister

669
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,360
and get me something.

670
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:57,030
Your sister...

671
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:06,780
Do you have to follow me?

672
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,250
You're making me nervous.

673
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:09,620
What's to be nervous about?

674
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,350
You do your thing, and I do mine.

675
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,990
Alright, go.

676
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,900
But could you stop grabbing onto me?

677
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,880
Also, don't make it so obvious.

678
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:31,590
Wa asked me to come and get something.

679
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:32,970
Yes.

680
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,770
Yes.

681
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,030
Hello.

682
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,090
How would I know
how much longer I have to wait?

683
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:56,870
Are you worried I might bail?

684
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:59,280
Yes, I'm here. Yes.

685
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,570
I've told you

686
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,150
it's the Central Prison side
that's been holding us back.

687
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:06,410
I've already paid for it.
I'm even more anxious than you...

688
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,010
Mr. Chen.

689
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:11,820
Yeah.

690
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,820
Don't you know how I, Zhang Wenfeng,
handle things?

691
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:13,750
Which room is it?

692
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,150
This Saturday.

693
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,030
I'll have lunch with him this Saturday.

694
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,280
I'll give you an answer.

695
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,400
Whether it's yes or no,

696
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,530
wait for my message.

697
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:23,530
Alright.

698
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:27,230
Look.

699
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:28,790
What are you doing?

700
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,350
An ultrasound image.

701
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:32,530
Let's take a look.

702
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:37,180
Why did she give this to you?

703
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,330
She asked me to give it to Chihuahua.

704
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,120
It's a baby.

705
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,530
His baby?

706
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,290
Do you know who Zhang Wenfeng

707
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:48,290
is having lunch with this Saturday?

708
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:49,890
How would I know?

709
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,540
I suspect Mickey Mouse will show up soon.

710
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,150
7.

711
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:01,320
What are you going to do
after you get out of here, bro?

712
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,190
17.

713
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,220
I don't even know if I'll make it out.

714
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,730
Aren't you getting out soon?

715
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:14,760
I have terminal cancer.

716
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,900
If the treatment doesn't work,
I'll die in here.

717
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:19,960
20.

718
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,160
You won't. Don't think like that.

719
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:27,440
Modern medical technology
is very advanced now.

720
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:28,810
10.

721
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,360
Have you ever seen snow?

722
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:37,840
Xiang and I saw it once
on Hehuan Mountain when we were kids.

723
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,580
I want to take my wife to Iceland
to see the snow.

724
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:47,710
She keeps saying she's loved Frozen
since she was a kid,

725
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,770
singing "Let It Go"

726
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,920
all day long.

727
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:54,680
So annoying.

728
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,600
I'll take her to Iceland

729
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,970
and let her be a princess once.

730
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,060
You're really romantic, bro.

731
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,080
2.

732
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,110
So do you have a kid?

733
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:11,739
Almost.

734
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:13,630
It's on the way.

735
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:20,250
I don't know if I'll get to see it

736
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,830
before I die.

737
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:31,670
Wa.

738
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,650
Your stuff.

739
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:47,030
Congratulations.

740
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:52,690
How's your health?

741
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,900
Colon cancer.

742
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,600
When did you find out?

743
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,740
Where are my beef noodles?

744
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:15,190
My mom used to take me to that restaurant.

745
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:18,830
I want to have them one more time.

746
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,780
Ginger as well.

747
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,650
Don't cut it so thick. Slice it thinner.

748
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:41,780
-You know?
-Senior.

749
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,070
Master Jiu.

750
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,400
This is the recipe for
my mom's beef noodles.

751
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,650
This is our unique spice. Take a look.

752
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,250
Can you arrange one meal of
beef noodles for me?

753
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,570
But the menu for all 3 meals

754
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:02,320
for the whole week
has already been planned.

755
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,200
I know.

756
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,030
But these are the beef noodles

757
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:08,450
Tadpole and I have loved
since we were kids.

758
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:11,710
He's in Cell Block Violation now,
and he wants to have them.

759
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,190
Please.

760
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,920
Okay, I'll do it for your sake.

761
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:18,740
Thank you.

762
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,650
Coming right up.

763
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,150
Time to eat.

764
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,400
Thank you, bro.

765
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,230
Was this made in the canteen?

766
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,100
Just have a try.

767
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:52,720
How is it?

768
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,680
Does it taste like mom's cooking?

769
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,920
You bought this from outside?

770
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,580
Does it remind you of your mom?

771
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,040
Are you going to tell me or not?

772
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,700
This is my mom's beef noodles.

773
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,570
Are you trying to mess with me?

774
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:08,150
I'm serious.

775
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,820
This is our family's beef noodle recipe.

776
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:14,660
I asked Master Jiu to cook it accordingly.

777
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:19,570
I've got you my favorite food.

778
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,500
This noodle should still
remind you of your mom.

779
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:25,310
Don't care about the details.

780
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,150
Is it good?

781
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,690
Eat slowly.

782
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:04,180
I miss the taste of Auntie.

783
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,760
Go tell my mom this yourself.

784
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,760
Can I get a second helping of noodles?

785
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:10,840
There's none left.

786
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,340
Check the side of the bowl.

787
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:22,270
And this.

788
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,150
Here's another one for you.

789
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,490
Back when we won matches,

790
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,360
my mom would give us these.

791
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:33,390
Collect 10, and we could
exchange them for a red envelope.

792
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,180
You still remember that?

793
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,050
Keep it safe.

794
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,280
My mom said you can use this sticker

795
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,650
to eat beef noodles for free for life.

796
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,530
Thank her for me.

797
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:52,970
Go thank her yourself.

798
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:00,140
She asked you
to take good care of yourself

799
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:02,270
and go see her after you get out of here.

800
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,280
She'll wait for you.

801
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:18,220
I really envy you
for having a mom like that.

[Exclusive Flavor, Carefully Crafted]

803
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:31,730
Mom.

804
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:35,130
Why are you back?

805
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,440
The canteen chef said there was extra,

806
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,650
so he asked me to bring it back for you.

807
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:41,570
Making a run just for this?

808
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,870
Don't you have to work tomorrow?

809
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:44,820
I do.

810
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,810
Or are you sleeping at home?

811
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,220
I can't. I have an early shift tomorrow.

812
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,320
How was it? Did everyone enjoy it?

813
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,320
Did Tadpole eat it? This recipe.

814
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,390
I gave him the stickers.

815
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:59,130
He said

816
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,830
he would come to see you himself.

817
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:03,460
He has some conscience after all.

818
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:05,280
Tell him my noodle shop won't go under.

819
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,940
I'll wait for him to come to me.

820
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,510
Come on, put these things away.

821
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:11,980
This.

822

824
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:16,650
I'm sorry.

825
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:18,480
Why?

826
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,070
I dragged you down.

Those guys before,

828
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:23,940
and me ending up working in the prison...

829
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,590
-It was all because I gambled.
-Hold on, hold on.

830
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:28,790
Why are you suddenly
confessing your feelings like this?

831
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,980
I feel like I've hurt you.

832

Don't cry.

I won't wipe your tears.

837
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,430
You've been like this
since you were little—stubborn as can be.

838
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:49,660
You wouldn't let me wipe your tears,

839
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,970
or even wipe your sweat.

840
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:51,970
Alright, go back.
