00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,460
Get over there quickly.

189
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,630
Junior, are you an idiot?

190
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,130
Those three aren't wearing handcuffs.

191
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,880
They're our new staff.

192
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,500
This way, you idiots!

193
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,000
Come here!

194
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,130
Over here!

195
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,460
This way.

Attention.

199

Attention.

200
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,750
I'm now giving you these ID badges.

201
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,380
Don't lose them.

202
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,380
Inside these walls,

203
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,110
having this badge means
you're a correctional officer.

204
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:39,110
And without it, you're an inmate.

205
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,000
Here.

206
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,880
Pass them around.

207
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,380
Each take your own.

208
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:45,700
Hurry up.

209
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,460
-This one's yours.
-Thank you.

210
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:47,980

212
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,320
I'll take them in first.

213
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:00,880
What's your problem?

214
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,290
You're the one with problems!

215
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,830
Why are you kicking my stuff?

216
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,550
-Break it up!
-What're you doing?

217
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,150
Step back.

218
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,010
-Back off!
-What?

219
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:08,930
Squat down! Don't you understand?

220
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:09,810
Squat down now!

221
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:10,960
Squat down!

222
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,660
Squat down properly.

223
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:13,820
Do you hear me?

224
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,210
I said squat down!

225
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,630
This sucks.

226
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,260
Are you trying to cause me trouble?

227
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,220
Where's your ID badge?

228
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,710
This is weird. It's gone.

229
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:36,960
I'm sorry,

230
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,210
but could I have another badge?

231
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,210
Do I look like a printer to you?

232
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:41,960
You're just unbelievable.

It's only been a few minutes

235
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,830
and you've already lost it.

236
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,060
If we ask you to escort the inmates,

237
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,320
will you lose them too?

238
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,960
Boss, I was just...

239
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,990
Who are you calling Boss?

behind the bars already, okay?

I was over there just now.

244
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:55,860
You gave me the ID badges

245
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,580
and asked me to hand them out.

246
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,710
I remember I said

247
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,010
that without this badge,

248
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,230
you'd be an inmate.

249
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,610
If you've got no badge,
go get in line over there.

250

261

fallen over there.

just now.

is useless, right?

00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,490
If you have any questions,

376
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,960
don't hesitate to ask them.

377
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,790
In the future,

378
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:58,210
we'll offer permanent job opportunities.

379
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,610
If you perform well here,

380
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:00,830
you'll be welcome to join us.

381
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,460
If you don't perform well,

382
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,020
we have plenty of cells,

383
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,870
and you're welcome to move in those too.

384
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,580
Just kidding.

385
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,360
It's not like you've committed any crimes.

386
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,360
Or have you?

387
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,620
Of course not.

388
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:18,900
Alright.

389
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,170
I've talked too much.

390
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,430
That's all then.

391
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,180
Good luck!

392
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,170
Thank you, Chief!

393
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,710
Remember what Chief said.

394
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,830
I'm not as positive

395
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,210
or optimistic as Chief.

396
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,830
Prisons will always be understaffed.

397
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,730
Why? It's simple.

398
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,880
Because this isn't

399
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,730
a job most people would like.

400
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,730
Also,

401
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,870
all the trainings you've received

402
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:44,940
are nothing.

403
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,880
Starting from today, your experience here

404
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,500
will be your real training.

405
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,670
And most importantly,

406
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:55,080
don't cause me any trouble.

407
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,230
Do you understand?

408
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,640
Do you understand!

409
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,740
Understood.

410
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:01,960
Shui.

411
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,960
Your first job to learn

412
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,580
is to give the prisoners
who were just transferred here

413
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,640
body inspections.

414
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:12,660
Alright.

415
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,960
Is everyone clear on the previous steps?

416
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,630
Next, you need to ask them

417
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,210
to remove their underwear

418
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,840
and lift their genitals.

419
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,960
Right. Don't think it's a small matter.

420
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,460
Don't underestimate
this genital-lifting procedure.

421
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,330
Many things can be hidden there.

422
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,210
Next step: have them turn around,

423
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,460
bend over,
use both hands to spread their buttocks,

424
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,210
and cough.

425
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,330
Why do we need them to cough?

426
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,190
Because coughing

427
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,830
helps your sphincter muscles relax.

428
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,580
And once those muscles relax,

429
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,080
secrets can't stay hidden.

430
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,080
Next,

431
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,570
each of you pick one inmate

432
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,910
and proceed in order.

433
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,460
Everyone, please cooperate.

434
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,960
Turn around and remove your pants.

435
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,080
Please.

436
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:53,920
Come on.

437
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,980
What are you waiting for?

438
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,210
Hurry up. Move it.

439
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,410
Are you admiring a flower or something?

440
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,980
Bro, you take
really good care of yourself.

441
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,330
Stop touching.

442
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,790
Sorry.

443
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:20,190
Can you spread your buttocks
and cough twice for me?

444
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,260
That's enough.

445
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,960
May I ask, bro,

446
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,120
how many days it's been
since you last washed it?

447
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,530
Three days.

448
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,610
Only three days
and it's already like this?

449
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,580
I wash it three days a month.

450
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,060
Well...

451
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:47,210
Please cough twice for me.

452
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,720
Alright. That's enough. That's enough.

453
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:54,960
Bro, I'll...

454
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,650
I'll be serving you.

455
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,580
I shower every day.

456
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,210
My butt is very clean.

457
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:02,330
Yeah.

458
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:03,830
I can tell.

459
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,910
My stomach feels weird.

460
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,330
Sir, he says his stomach feels weird.

461
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,830
What, are you trying to cause trouble?

462
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:13,640
It's true.

463
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,960
Look, he just farted.

464
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,910
Alright, go after the inspection's done.

465
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,810
Do as told.

466
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,140
Bro, please.

467
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:25,710
Could you cough a bit more gently later?

468
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,460
Please.

469
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:34,960
Bro,

470
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,080
please be gentle...

471
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,490
I can't hold it anymore!

472
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,710
What the hell?

473
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,190
Washing doesn't work.
It still stinks so bad.

474
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,480
What did he eat?

475
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,420
Do you guys want alcohol wipes?

476
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:03,320
I'll take one.

477
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I'll pass.

478
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,880
Are you sure?

479
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,630
I suggest you use one.

480
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,540
If you only wash clothing fibers
with water,

481
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,640
bacteria can still cling to them

482
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,240
for 4 to 6 hours.

483
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,000
It's fine if you want to die yourself,

484
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,530
but please don't infect me.

485
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,610
There's still corn in your hair.

486
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,250
Are you serious?

487
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,500
Stop running!

488
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,000
Get back here! Now!

489
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,880
You're only allowed to run in prison
when there's an emergency.

490
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,810
Do you know this could cause panic?

491
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,130
Workshop One!

492
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,000
Boss,

493
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,880
there's a big fight in the workshop.

494
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,000
Requesting backup!

495
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,490
What's happening?

496
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,320
One person laughed at how ugly
the other's folded cardboard boxes were,

497
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,780
and they started arguing.

498
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,080
The pot calling the kettle black.

499
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,250
Fighting inside the workshop again.

500
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,500
Why are you still standing there?

501
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,630
Come with me!

502
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,000
You're really a jinx.

503
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,800
There's still corn in your hair!

504
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,250
Hurry up.

505
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,380
Start running!

506
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,130
What? Is your foot injured or something?

507
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,380
Didn't you say we can't run?

508
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,880
If you don't run, I'll break your legs!

509
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,750
I'm sorry.

510
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,100
You three are really lucky today.

511
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,830
First day on the job
and you get to see everything.

512
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,380
-Go in.
-No, please.

513
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,750
Why work here if you're such a coward?

514
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,130
We'll get beaten to death
if we go in there.

515
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,270
You think?

516
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,880
Let's wait for the police then!

517
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,810
Don't worry.

518
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,630
They don't dare hit anyone
wearing a uniform.

519
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:30,380
Get in there!

520
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,380
Just separate them. Go on!

521
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,460
What are you doing?

522
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,040
How did you pass the entrance exam?

523
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,220
Do you know how to use this?

524
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:40,790
No.

525
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,950
Take it in and spray!

526
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,130
I...

527
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,250
I... I'm fine.

528
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:44,880
You're fine?

529
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,710
I'm not!

530
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:46,670
Stop fighting, guys!

531
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:47,210
Don't push!

532
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:47,670
Don't push, bro!

533
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:48,250
Don't push!

534
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:48,830
Bro...

535
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,830
The CO hit someone!

536
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:02,160
I asked you to restrain them,
not to kick them!

537
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,760
There's going to be a complaint.

538
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,370
Everyone, retreat!

539
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,800
Bro, I'm sorry.

540
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,030
I didn't mean to, bro.

541
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:15,960
Didn't you say they wouldn't hit anyone
wearing a uniform?

542
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,830
Help! Don't just watch!

543
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,000
Pull him away!

544
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,270
I'll save you!

545
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,580
Not me! I mean him!

546
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:28,830
Sorry.

547
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,080
Not me! I mean him!

548
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,960
Where are you going?

549
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,330
Calm down.

550
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,560
Gao Zhiyao, what are you doing?

551
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,630
Jiang Yijie, come help!

552
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:22,920
Okay, I'm coming!

553
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,710
I'm wearing a uniform!

554
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,210
I'm wearing a uniform!

555
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:35,080
Squat down now!

556
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:43,630
You don't want parole anymore, huh?

557
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,210
Squat down properly!

558
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,350
Counselor.

559
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:14,340
Cool. Are you two dating or something?

560
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,710
You're pressing on my hand.

561
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,690
You're pressing on my lower part...

562
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:21,940
My balls...

563
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,210
What the hell is wrong with you guys?

564
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,340
Are you still kids or what?

565
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,460
You started fighting over
some cardboard boxes?

566
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,080
Are you okay?

567
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,680
What's there to argue about?

568
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:32,750
Hands on your head!

569
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,540
Hands on your head!

570
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,460
You want to skip your meals or what?

571
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,460
Still moving while squatting?

572
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,250
Don't move!

573
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,330
Work together, work happily!

574
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,710
Hello, newcomers.

575
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,580
I'm the nurse here, Hong Xiaohui.

576
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,910
Are you feeling uncomfortable anywhere?

577
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:54,710
I twisted my hand.

578
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,330
So, which hand is it?

579
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,330
This one? Let me check it for you.

580
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,730
Does this hurt?

581
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,620
How about this?

582
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,240
And this?

583
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,080
Yes.

584
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,890
I'll get you an ice pack in a moment.

585
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,710
What about you two?

586
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:17,040
Are you feeling uncomfortable anywhere?

587
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,210
I'm fine.

588
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:20,760
Okay. And you?

589
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,170
He got kicked in the balls.

590
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:25,830
Let me take a look.

591
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:27,460
No need.

592
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,330
I'll just ice them when I get back.

593
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:31,080
Then check them yourself
when you get back.

594
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,830
If there's a tear, let me know.

595
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:36,710
Instructor,

596
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,020
I've already disciplined them.

597
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,150
Who sprayed pepper spray on my inmate?

598
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:42,960
Speak up.

599
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,380
Say something. Why are you all silent?

600
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,940
The pepper spray went off by itself.

601
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,960
Is it funny?

602
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:52,660
Do you think it's funny?

603
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,860
And who kicked my inmate?

604
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,580
Are you an idiot?

605
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,960
Do you know you've ruined all my work?

606
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,330
Touch your classmates again
and you're dead.

607
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,460
Sorry, Instructor.

608
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,900
Director, who's that girl?

609
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:09,560
Social worker, Fang Jieyu.

610
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:14,390
You guys think this is fun, don't you?

611
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,480
Still sitting on the bed?

612
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,710
Get up now!

613
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:21,360
Stand properly!

614
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,940
Please, guys.

615
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,290
Can't you just cooperate?

616
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,680
It's only your first day here.

617
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,410
Stop causing me trouble, okay?

618
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:37,080
Your name is actually "Zhongwen",
as in "Chinese"? That's really funny.

619
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,540
Can I call you "Fish" then?

620
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,080
No.

621
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,630
So you did a lot of research
before coming here?

622
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,690
Is it hard to get in?

623
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:51,750
Since most correctional facilities
are understaffed now,

624
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:54,210
I think anyone who takes the exam
can pass it.

625
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:56,380
If anyone can pass the exam,

626
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,910
that means there's no need
for an exam, right?

627
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:00,530
Didn't you take the exam?

628
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,380
I...

629
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,880
I-I did.

630
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,010
What I took was more like an interview.

631
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,380
Interview?

632
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,750
No way.

633
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,630
Are you sure this is the right place?

634
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,030
The address says it's here.

635
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,810
Let's go in and see.

636
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,080
Maybe it's better inside than outside.

637
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,710
This ceiling is so low.

638
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,630
-What’s wrong?
-Look!

639
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:13,880
It's so dark.

640
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,500
Your nose is bleeding.

641
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,000
He must have been hit by the evil spirit.

642
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,130
No, I wasn't.

643
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,300
What is it?

644
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,820
Where? Where is it?

645
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,380
It's huge!

646
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,250
Don't push me!

647
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,380
What is this?

648
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,880
What is this thing?

649
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,980
Who are they trying to scare
by putting this here?

650
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,730
Although it's a bit dirty here,

651
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,810
it's already bigger than my place.

652
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,370
How bad must your place be?

653
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:54,900
Where's our room?

654
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,440
What happened?

655
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,310
The door is broken.

656
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,630
Here you are.

657
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,130
Thanks.

658
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,000
Is this a prank show?

659
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,730
I've even slept in worse places
during training.

660
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,480
Alright, we'll clean up later.

661
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,250
Are you okay?

662
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,210
There's a rat on me!

663
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,340
It's on your jacket!

664
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:42,130
[Warden's Office]

665
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:45,880
I heard you've been reviewing
attendance records of Custody Division.

666
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,810
Yes, just routine business needs.

667
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:53,250
What business needs
could your Education Division have

668
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,250
that you need to check their schedules?

669
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,830
An inmate complained to me that

670
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,500
No. 9568 is exercising special privileges

671
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,030
by choosing his cell block.

672
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:01,330
So I think

673
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:03,250
someone in the Custody Division
must be taking bribes.

674
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,500
Taking bribes?

675
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:07,000
Bribery is a serious accusation.

676
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:10,250
Don't make insinuations
without concrete evidence.

677
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,580
This will ruin the relationship between
the Education and Custody Divisions.

678
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,630
Do you think that's a good idea?

679
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,230
Right, I understand, but...

680
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,380
It's true that No. 9568
has been exercising special privileges.

681
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,750
Are we just not going to investigate?

682
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,950
You can investigate,

683
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,500
but you should report it to
Internal Affairs.

684
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,000
Why is your Education Division
carrying out the investigation?

685
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,630
I promoted you to counselor

686
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:27,890
not to be the disciplinary patrol there.

687
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:38,180
Which cell block was
No. 9568 transferred to?

688
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,230
Cell Block 2.

689
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,080
They just updated the water tower there,

690
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,010
so the water there is the cleanest.

691
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,890
That's why you think

692
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:46,510
someone gave him privilege?

693
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:47,330
Yes.

694
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,480
-And I also found that...
-Yijie.

695
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,910
You know No. 9568's background, don't you?

696
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:53,630
Yes.

697
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:55,380
Then why don't you consider

698
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,760
the possibility that

699
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,880
the Custody Division placed No. 9568 in

700
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,210
the crowded Cell Block 2

701
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,880
to use No. 9568 to stabilize

702
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,500
the order in Cell Block 2?

703
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,380
-I'm off.
-Good work.

704
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,380
Are you okay?

705
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,250
I'm okay.

706
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:30,380
What about you? Why're you still here?

707
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,130
Those two idiots kicked my inmate,

708
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:35,130
and now Zhang Zixu
is being uncooperative again.

709
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:35,860
When I talked to him,

710
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,380
it was like I was just talking to myself.

711
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,880
Zhang Zixu...

712
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,250
He's really pitiful.

713
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,250
Do you have his file?

714
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,130
Let me see it.

715
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,250
He's been having insomnia lately?

716
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:55,250
Yeah.

717
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,000
You should go back and rest.

718
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,630
The report can wait until tomorrow.

719
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:05,890
I can go check on Zhang Zixu
for you later.

720
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:08,710
Are you sure?

721
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:11,500
Go ahead.

722
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:12,790
Thank you, Sir.

723
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:14,380
I'm leaving then.

724
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,880
I'm off.

725
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:20,250
Don't feed the fish too much food.
I just fed them.

726
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,710
-You just fed them?
-Yeah.

727
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,290
-Bye.
-Bye.

728
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:34,090
Last one.

729
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:40,199
I've cleaned the bathroom.
You can take a shower now.

730
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,130
Thanks.

731
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:43,130
All done. Now I can finally sleep.

732
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,750
How come the beds got switched?

733
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,409
I thought this would be my bed.

734
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,850
Because I just checked the feng shui.

735
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,870
I think sleeping on this side
is better for my exam luck.

736
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:59,040
Just to let you know,

737
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,630
I'm just here to mess around a bit.

738
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:03,000
The fortune teller said I have to
endure the hardships of the people

739
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,380
before I can change my fate.

740
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,630
So the "Yu" in your name
actually means slacking off, huh?

741
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,750
You said you'd help clean up,

742
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:08,880
but you disappeared halfway through.

743
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,540
I did help.

744
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,000
I moved your luggage over there.

745
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,380
I also replaced your broken bed board.

746
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,880
I'm the one
who brought in the bed board.

747
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,380
Yes, and I installed it.

748
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,250
But you moved my luggage and took my bed

749
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:20,130
without my permission.

750
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:21,130
Alright.

751
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:22,250
Stop arguing.

752
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,130
Let's all get along.

753
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,750
We'll be working together here after all.

754
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,060
I'm fine with it.

755
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:31,000
A senior once told me that

756
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,960
there are three "don't"s
for surviving in a correctional facility:

757
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,000
don't meddle,

758
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,040
don't start trouble,

759
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,580
and don't try to be clever.

760
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,750
So don't worry about me.

761
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:39,580
I'll be okay.

762
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,280
Need any help, Zhongwen?

763
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,080
Where's your mattress?

764
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,380
I'll just use a sleeping bag for now.

765
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,640
Could you help me unroll my sleeping bag?

766
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,780
So you're aiming for a permanent position?

767
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:57,630
I am.

768
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,930
Well, I have to, actually.

769
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:01,940
After all, the real job security

770
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,220
only comes once I'm officially permanent.

771
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:04,850
What about you?

772
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:06,600
Why did you decide to work here?

773
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:09,250
I... I don't really know.

774
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,380
You don't know?

775
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:14,450
By accident, I guess.

776
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,420
Accident?

777
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,000
Zhiyao,

778
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,900
can I show you something?

779
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:23,000
What is it?

780
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,130
Look.

781
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,740
Isn't she cute?

782
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,150
This is my little girl.

783
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,510
This is your daughter?

784
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:32,100
Yeah.

785
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,000
She looks really like me, right?

786
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,830
Wait. That's way too many.

787
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:35,460
My little girl.

788
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,710
-Excuse me.
-And this.

789
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,380
Are you setting up
a photo booth here or what?

790
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,580
Excuse me.

791
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,390
Could you please lower your voice?

792
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:46,080
I've turned my music up to maximum volume.

793
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:47,970
And it's still... Noisy.

794
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,460
Sorry.

795
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,580
Didn't I tell you to go pay your respects?

796
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,630
Did you see him?

797
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,430
What's wrong?

798
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,810
I forgot to check in with my mom.

799
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,380
With the riot today,
I really didn't get a chance.

800
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,180
I'll definitely do it tomorrow.

801
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,460
So many excuses.
Are you asking for trouble?

802
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,690
How did this happen? What did I press?

803
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,010
How do I remove this?

804
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,600
Got it.

805
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,750
You must find my brother before midnight.

806
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:38,350
Otherwise, I'll shut down
your mother's shop.

807
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:39,710
Don't forget

808
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,770
that I always know what you're doing.

809
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,880
Please don't, Sis. I...

810
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,500
Chihuahua. Zhang Longji.

811
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,230
No. 9568, Cell Block 2, Room 25.

812
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,460
Chihuahua. Zhang Longji.

813
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,790
Cell Block 2, Room 25.

814
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,250
No. 9568, Cell Block 2, Room 25.

815
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,900
Chihuahua. Zhang Longji. 95-

816
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,820
Cell Block 2, Room 25.

817
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,380
Hey.

818
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,560
What are you doing?

819
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,880
I'm...

820
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:22,250
Working the night shift.

821
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,130
Night shift?

822
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,330
You just arrived.

823
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:27,590
How could you be working the night shift?

824
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,000
Director Xiao said they're short-staffed,

825
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,580
so he asked me to come.

826
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,580
Even if they're short-staffed,
they shouldn't put you on night shift.

827
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,380
You don't know anything yet.

828
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,460
How are you supposed to
work the night shift?

829
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,580
Maybe since I messed up,
this is my punishment.

830
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:42,080
I guess Director Xiao
wants me to learn more.

831
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,080
That makes sense.

832
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,210
Next time you go on field duty,
remember to wear a jacket

833
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:50,340
so passersby won't get the wrong idea.

834
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:51,830
Yes, Senior.

835
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,140
Thank you, Senior.

836
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:53,930
Good luck.

837
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,330
Move it!

838
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:56,710
Which key?

839
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:14,710
No. 9568.

840
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:17,840
Cell Block Loyalty.

841
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:20,470
Cell Block Violation.

842
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,710
Stop looking.

843
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:44,640
I'm going to pee.

844
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,330
Remember to wash your hands.

845
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:48,080
I know.

846
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,500
My wife is driving me crazy, you know?

847
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,500
I'm already working such long hours
these days,

848
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,750
and sometimes I have to work overtime.

849
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:26,010
She keeps asking me to come home earlier,

850
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:29,500
saying I need to help with
the kid's errands,

851
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,500
like washing the dishes and stuff.

852
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,000
And she asks me to help with
taking care of the kid,

853
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
as well as laundry.

854
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Where am I supposed to find the time?

855
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:47,460
Where's No. 9568?

856
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,460
It's like a moving maze.

857
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,210
CO.

858
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:54,960
Do you have any medicine?
My head aches so bad and I can't sleep.

859
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,880
No. 9568.

860
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,080
My headache's even worse than yours.

861
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:58,830
You'll be fine after some sleep.

862
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:00,330
Wait, CO!

863
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,850
CO!

864
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:05,910
I want to file a complaint.

865
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:07,770
Someone touches my butt at night.

866
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:08,830
Just touch them back.

867
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:09,580
I'm serious!

868
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,460
Someone touches my butt at night.

869
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:13,390
What's all this noise?
Can't a person get some sleep?

870
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,330
No. 9568.

871
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:15,960
Chihuahua.

872
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:19,630
Over there.

873
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:21,830
Thanks.

874
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,560
No. 9568! Chihuahua.

875
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:30,550
Zhang Longji? Chihuahua?

876
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,110
There's no Chihuahua here.

877
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,460
I'm a Labrador.

878
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:37,960
This one's a French Bulldog,

879
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,080
and that one's a Shiba Inu.

880
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,710
Nice to meet you.

881
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:45,080
Stop messing around.

882
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,270
I'm in a hurry.

883
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,460
I'm looking for Chihuahua.

884
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,960
Who are you to call him Chihuahua?

885
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,890
That's enough. Stop making a fuss.

886
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,160
It's so late, and everyone's sleeping.

887
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,460
Chihuahua?

888
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:56,380
Zhang Longji?

889
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:01,300
Chihuahua?

890
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,210
Looking for me?

891
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:10,580
♪ Shout it out loud,
I don't want to part with you ♪

892
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,300
Remember to tell your sister

893
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:14,710
that I showed up on time.

894
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,480
If there's nothing else, I'm leaving.

895
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,820
Bye.

896
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,460
I have a small favor

897
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,180
I need your help with.

898
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,830
Asking for help so soon?

899
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:42,030
The priest is coming to teach tomorrow.

900
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,460
Get me a deck of

901
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,190
playing cards with nude girls.

902
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:52,210
Tomorrow?

903
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:55,080
Where am I supposed to get that now?

904
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,210
I have no idea.

905
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:58,210
That's why I'm asking for your help.

906
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:05,830
Also, it's getting hotter lately.

907
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,710
None of us can sleep well.

908
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,920
Could you turn on the exhaust fan for us?

909
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:15,760
It's over there.

910
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:18,960
Please.

911
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:23,080
Okay, remember to tell your sister

912
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,330
that I helped you. Don't forget.

913
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:32,460
Which one?

914
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:34,110
The one with the light on.

915
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:45,420
You set off the alarm! You're dead!

916
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:49,100
So that was a prank?

917
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:54,580
Don't forget our deal!

918
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:00,430
What's all that noise about?

919
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,750
Which one is it?

920
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:14,470
The noise's coming from that direction.

921
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:20,500
Zhiyao.

922
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,080
Why did you decide to work here?

923
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,460
I don't really know.

924
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,320
You don't know?

925
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:29,430
This is how miserable my life is.

926
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:31,310
I can't even explain

927
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:33,050
why I'm here.
