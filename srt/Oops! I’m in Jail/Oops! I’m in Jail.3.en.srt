00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,910
Let me tell you,

189
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,840
this is what it's like in prison.

190
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,310
Major incidents often happen

191
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:26,860
when you least expect them.

192
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,750
I'm not telling you not to save people—

193
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,880
I'm saying you never know
if you're saving someone

194
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,810
or signing your own death warrant.

195
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:37,850
Oh,

196
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,140
and this seems to be his suicide note.

197
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,380
It was on his pillow.

198
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,040
Rumor has it

199
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,880
he deliberately refused to pay the fine

200
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,940
and insisted on being locked up here.

201
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,820
He was just trying to find a place
to hide, huh?

202
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,690
That's what happens
when you're famous.

203
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,780
Fame has its downsides too.

204
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,240
Alright, I'll give this to Jieyu.

205
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,110
Everyone, get back to what you were doing.

206
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,960
I'm here from the Custody Division
to provide support.

207
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,740
Hand out the materials.

208
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:42,680
Miss Fang,

209
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,510
were you having a bad day the other day?

210
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,010
Why did you speak
to Zhang Zixu like that?

211
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,000
You...

212
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,210
You should apologize to Zhang Zixu.

213
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,750
Why should I apologize?

214
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,380
You knew what he was going through,

215
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,500
yet you said things that provoked him.

216
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,100
Don't you think you owe him an apology?

217
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,230
But I did everything I was supposed to.

218
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,670
If he insists on shutting everyone out,

219
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,790
what else can I do?

220
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,540
That doesn't mean
you should say those things.

221
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,870
You're a social worker!

222
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,350
Yes,

223
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,040
I am a social worker. So what?

224
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,090
That's not the point!

225
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,870
If you don't like your job, then quit!

226
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,170
You almost got someone killed!

227
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,580
What do you mean, "got someone killed"?

228
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,240
Did I tell him to hang himself?

229
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,540
Besides, he's a grown man!

230
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,540
He should take responsibility
for his own actions, don't you think?

231
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,920
So if I hadn't saved him last night,

232
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,460
he would've deserved it—
is that what you're saying?

233
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:39,860
Hey, what are you doing?

234
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,640
Since when is this

235
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,160
how social workers handle things?

236
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,890
Why are you running your mouth?

237
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,380
What's your problem?

238
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,410
And you're giving this
"positive energy" session?

239
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:49,530
What a joke!

240
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,520
Are you alright?

241
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,140
Zhang Zixu

242
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,840
is confirmed to be transferred.

243
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:26,220
Chief Hu contacted
North II Prison directly.

244
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,420
So...

245
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,040
In his current state,

246
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,700
he can't handle a sudden change
of environment.

247
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:32,720
I know.

248
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,050
And what's the standard

249
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,320
here anyway?

250
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,220
"Ineffective rehabilitation"?

251
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:39,670
Shouldn't I be the one removed,

252
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,040
not him?

253
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,180
Zhang Zixu is a special case.

254
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:48,130
The environment there is better—

255
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,390
he'll likely receive more focused care.

256
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,260
I believe it could be good for him.

257
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,220
So you've agreed to this?

258
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,330
This is not helping him at all.

259
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,280
Everyone's just passing the buck.

260
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,920
Whatever. Fine.

261
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,460
I'm sorry

262
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,710
for putting you in a difficult position.

263
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,660
Don't be sorry.

264
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,300
Have you read

265
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,640
Zhang Zixu's suicide note?

266
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,140
I'm afraid to.

267
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,730
Using reverse psychology is, after all,

268
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:10,930
a communication technique.

269
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,180
Don't overthink it.

270
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,170
But I truly lost control.

271
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,540
It's just so hard…

272
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,540
Inside these walls,

273
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,340
passion wears away too quickly.

274
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,420
Stop smashing things!

275
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,650
Calm down now!

276
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,000
It's alright!

277
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,100
The Custody Division mentioned you've been
refusing to go out during activity hours.

278
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,170
Even if you don't feel like talking,

279
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,280
just getting some fresh air might help.

280
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,080
What would a social worker know?

281
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,620
I'm so worn out worrying

282
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,040
about everyone else

283
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,680
that I took my frustration out
on Zhang Zixu.

284
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,600
Maybe I'm just not cut out for this job.

285
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,680
We all know you've really done your best.

286
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:14,770
I've been wondering—

287
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,560
is there anything

288
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,830
we can still do for him
before his transfer?

289
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:29,570
Not within your authority.

290
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,000
What if you asked your father?

291
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:37,940
Fang Jieyu,

292
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,040
the case regarding Inmate 1453

293
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,290
is now following standard procedure.

294
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,230
We have no grounds

295
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,460
to intervene.

296
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,960
But if the warden stepped in,

297
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,000
Zhang Zixu wouldn't have
to be transferred.

298
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,630
You know

299
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,460
I don't like asking my father
for favors like that.

300
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,210
Understood.

301
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,740
Never mind, then.

302
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:16,160
[Cell Block Violation]

303
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:24,090
Have you read
Zhang Zixu's suicide note?

304
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,810
"I took a fan's life

305
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,720
and destroyed his family.

306
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:36,300
This sin is unforgivable.

307
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,850
Please don't forgive me—

308
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,760
I don't deserve to be remembered."

309
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,100
It's me!

310
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,610
Get away from me!

311
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,750
Good morning, Miss Fang!

312
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,160
There's a call for you—

313
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,960
your grandfather is in trouble.

314
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,650
No, don't!

315
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:51,370
Here, let me try.

316
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,620
I'm not asking for your help.

317
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,290
I'm not helping you either—

318
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:57,950
my feet just happen to be free.

319
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,390
Let me try.

320
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,690
You...

321
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,670
Oh no!

322
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:37,710
In a hurry?

323
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,990
Leave your scooter here.

324
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,350
I have my transport—I can give you a ride.

325
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:48,030
I really didn't mean to!

326
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,110
Your scooter's just too beat up—

327
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,730
I only used normal force!

328
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,080
I don't care what kind of force it was!

329
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,210
Just ride faster!

330
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,030
It's uphill here—

331
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,220
it's exhausting.

332
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,120
I'll go in first then. Thanks!

333
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,580
What?

334
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,790
You think I'm scared of you?

335
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:12,600
I'm not scared at all!

336
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,660
You still wanna go?

337
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,210
Enough already!

338
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:17,080
Alright, Grandpa,

339
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,460
that's enough. Sit down now, please.

340
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,250
Still talking tough?

341
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,210
Come on, stop it!

342
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
How old are you
and still getting into fights?

343
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,640
It's fine.

344
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,410
At least Grandpa recognized me today,

345
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,410
and no one's hurt.

346
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:27,940
Why are you here?

347
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,370
They called me,

348
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,930
saying you never showed up.

349
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,210
Why are you here?

350
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,790
My scooter broke down—he gave me a ride.

351
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:36,990
This is your grandpa?

352
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,780
He looks so young!

353
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,830
-Thank you.
-Why are you still here?

354
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,850
You should go do your own thing—

355
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:43,850
no need to worry about me.

356
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,460
How will you get back if I leave?

357
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,420
I've got nothing going on anyway—

358
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,420
I can wait for you.

359
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,460
Just go back when you're told!

360
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,330
I'm here—

361
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,710
I'll give her a ride home later.

362
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:51,170
Thanks.

363
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,940
I'm off duty today—

364
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,550
do I still have to listen to you,

365
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,800
Counselor?

366
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,580
Young man, come here.

367
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,430
Come here.

368
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:05,130
What's wrong?

369
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,340
I need to trim this hair of yours.

370
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,940
Who cut it?

371
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,710
It looks awful.

372
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,380
Really?

373
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,260
That bad?

374
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,430
I thought it looked kinda dashing…

375
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,170
Grandpa, really,

376
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,910
don't trouble yourself.

377
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,210
Relax,

378
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:30,850
sit still.

379
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,260
Grandpa.

380
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,310
Maybe just give him a buzz cut?

381
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,040
You can cut more—

382
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,710
it's fine.

383
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:39,710
Grandpa, just a little trim, okay?

384
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,080
Why worry so much?

385
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,090
You'll see

386
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,390
how skilled I am in a bit.

387
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,780
Got you now!

388
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,080
Tell me,

389
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,880
where were you gambling this time?

390
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,630
Gambling?

391
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,210
Grandpa, how did you know?

392
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,580
How could I not know?

393
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,960
You unfilial son,

394
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,080
all you do is gamble!

395
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,580
-Grandpa!
-Come back!

396
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,580
Stop hitting me, I won't do it again!

397
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:15,870
Grandpa!

398
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,460
You leave your wife and Jieyu
for me to support—

399
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:18,960
have you no conscience?

400
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,000
What wife and Jieyu?

401
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,210
You've got the wrong person, right?

402
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:21,830
On your knees!

403
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:22,580
What are you—

404
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,460
Kneel down!

405
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,600
Grandpa, I'm sorry, I admit it,

406
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,710
I was wrong! Stop hitting me!

407
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,960
Stop! I admit it! I was wrong!

408
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,160
Did you just admit it?

409
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:29,710
I was wrong.

410
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:30,590
Admitting means nothing!

411
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,550
A gambler's hands—

412
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,330
even if you chop them off,
he'll still find a way to bet!

413
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:34,080
-Today, I'm definitely gonna—
-Grandpa, don't!

414
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,960
Grandpa, you've mistaken him.

415
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,760
This is Jieyu's friend, Zhiyao.

416
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:37,970
Yijie.

417
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:38,890
Zhiyao.

418
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,710
Sorry,

419
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,170
I hit the wrong person.

420
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,130
-Right.
-I hit the wrong person.

421
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,460
I mistook you for someone else. Really…
this old mind of mine is so muddled.

422
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,360
Zhiyao,

423
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,960
Jieyu's new friend, Zhiyao.

424
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,710
Yijie.

425
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,290
You're Yijie, right?

426
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,380
That Yijie—

427
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,330
I watched him grow up.

428
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,080
That's me.

429
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,170
Grandpa!

430
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:08,990
All he does is gamble!

431
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,540
-Take that!
-Wait, Grandpa!

432
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,330
Sorry, Grandpa,

433
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,580
I'm Yijie! Grandpa!

434
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:14,310
Grandpa!

435
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,830
I'm beating him to death today!

436
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:16,580
He is Yijie.

437
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,830
Yijie?

438
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,830
Yijie? Nonsense!

439
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,460
It's him!

440
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,830
No, Grandpa,

441
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,460
he's Jiang Yijie!

442
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:28,900
Yeah, Grandpa!

443
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,980
Grandpa, Yijie—

444
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,450
the one who does judo.

445
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,240
I… What's wrong with me?

446
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,050
It's fine.

447
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,480
It's nothing, really.

448
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,210
Is Grandpa getting worse?

449
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,830
He mistakes me for someone else
almost every time now.

450
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,460
He's losing control—

451
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,540
these days, he mixes up

452
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,420
everyone except me.

453
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,330
Miss Fang,

454
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,170
do you come take care

455
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:58,080
of Grandpa even after working so late?

456
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,830
Not every day—

457
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,580
just when I can.

458
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,650
I'm scared that one day
he'll forget me too.

459
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,210
He won't.

460
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,780
I think he will.

461
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,440
I want to be mentally prepared.

462
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,960
I remember one time,

463
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,760
he laughed so happily telling us

464
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,180
how he tricked the two of us

465
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,580
into cleaning the barbershop
with just one ice pop.

466
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,830
But when he turned and saw me,

467
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,920
he froze—

468
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:31,540
only then realizing I'd already grown up.

469
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,570
You two were that easy to fool?

470
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,280
You leaving? I'll walk you out.

471
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:45,220
I… want to stay
with Grandpa a bit longer.

472
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,150
You two go ahead.

473
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,410
Let's go.

474
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:58,290
Go on,

475
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:58,790
bye.

476
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,010
Where to?

477
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,340
Give her some space, alright?

478
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:06,000
This way.

479
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,880
What did you do
on your day off today?

480
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,000
I went with Miss Fang to see her grandpa.

481
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,920
That was fast!

482
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,760
You've actually got a romance subplot now?

483
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,130
I just ran into her

484
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,880
and gave her a ride, that's all.

485
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:28,210
Sounds like
you were meeting the parents already.

486
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,210
Miss Fang's grandpa has dementia—

487
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,560
he often forgets people around him.

488
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,490
I think I might have misjudged her.

489
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,860
Juggling prison work

490
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:40,230
and taking care of her grandpa

491
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,870
must be exhausting.

492
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:44,960
Miss Fang said

493
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,540
her grandpa struggles

494
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:49,040
to hold onto even the happiest memories,

495
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,540
while Zhang Zixu is desperate

496
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,280
to forget the good parts of his past,

497
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,410
drowning himself in pain instead.

498
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,310
I've been thinking about

499
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:00,250
how I could help her
with Zhang Zixu's situation.

500
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,500
Oh, Gao Zhiyao—

501
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,170
did you fall asleep facing the ocean?

502
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,820
Why meddle so much
in other people's business?

503
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,470
Go memorize your legal codes!

504
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,850
I'd like to,

505
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,700
but how can I focus
with you two eating instant noodles

506
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,100
and chatting right here?

507
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:21,120
Actually, I've always
liked Zhang Zixu's songs.

508
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,750
His lyrics are really warm,

509
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,480
and working here now,

510
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,800
I relate to them even more.

511
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,210
Even today, there are still

512
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:31,430
plenty of fans in his fan group
cheering him on—

513
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,620
he just cut off all contact
with the outside world,

514
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,220
so he probably doesn't know.

515
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:37,020
His fan group?

516
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,080
What's it called?

517
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,610
Try searching

518
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,490
with the name

519
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:42,660
"Nine Days".

520
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,260
Okay.

521
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,580
You said "Nine Days"...

522
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,920
How do you spell that?

523
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,750
N-i-n-y.

524
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:56,820
D-i-y-s.

525
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,630
D-i-y-s...

526
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,380
Nine Days.

527
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:04,080
N-i-n?

528
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,460
Nine Days.

529
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,210
It's not D-i-y-s.

530
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:09,710
It's D-a-y-s.

531
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,140
Is this it?

532
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,460
Yes, that's it.

533
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,850
Good thing your name is Wang Zhongwen,

534
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:14,850
not Wang Yingwen—

535
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:16,940
or this would be downright embarrassing.

536
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,800
At least Wang Zhongwen
gets to eat instant noodles.

537
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,520
Is Miss Fang not in?

538
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:50,370
Right, she's out.
Anything I can help with?

539
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
No, it's nothing.

540
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,350
Senior,

541
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,690
Inmate 1453 has a fan group—

542
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:04,950
not sure if this helps?

543
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,760
Yeah, this is it.

544
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,080
Look, lots of fans have left messages

545
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:08,750
saying his songs

546
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:09,960
got them through hard times.

547
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,420
Never thought you'd care
about inmates too.

548
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:14,760
And you know what? Many fans mentioned

549
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,670
that even after he was imprisoned,

550
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,290
people still support him—

551
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,790
he just never gets to see it.

552
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,190
That's exactly my point.

553
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,980
Didn't expect you to be
as sharp as I am, Senior!

554
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,140
Thanks, junior.

555
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,110
Let me borrow that.

556
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,050
Hey, do you remember that one song of his?

557
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:28,870
Which one?

558
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:30,000
Hold on...

559
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,360
What are you doing?

560
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,840
He's yelling again.

561
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,260
Zhang Zixu, calm down!

562
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:58,420
Stop yelling!

563
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,070
Did anyone call the social worker?

564
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,420
I called ages ago!

565
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,480
Zhang Zixu!

566
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,870
This is insane!

567
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:07,960
Transferring him just like that—

568
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,330
who wouldn't lose it?

569
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:10,000
Shut up, will you?

570
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,210
Stop meddling!

571
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,030
Zhang Zixu!

572
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,540
We're just following procedure!

573
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,670
Calm down,

574
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,820
let's talk this through properly!

575
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,920
We need to restrain him if necessary!

576
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:19,830
Look at him—

577
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,400
what if he tries to kill himself again?

578
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,730
But the social worker still needs to come!

579
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,170
Zhang Zixu, calm down!

580
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:26,000
Where's Miss Fang?

581
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,310
The social worker is preparing documents,
and she will be here soon.

582
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:27,890
Director,

583
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:28,910
we have an idea to reach him.

584
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,830
Let us in, we just need to buy some time.

585
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,710
What do you mean by "letting you in"?
What are you talking about?

586
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:33,960
Wait, we need to go in!

587
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,960
Let us in!

588
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,180
-No!
-Director!

589
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,830
It's against regulations. Absolutely not!

590
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,330
Come on, Director, let us try.

591
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:40,830
He's going to hurt himself at this rate.

592
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,020
We know how to calm him down.

593
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,770
Please, just let us in!

594
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,960
In his current state? You want to go in?

595
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,890
We can handle it!

596
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:48,990
Miss Fang is on her way,

597
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:49,870
really!

598
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,020
Trust us.

599
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,050
Let us try!

600
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:53,670
Let's try.

601
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:55,460
Fine, give it a try!

602
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:58,830
But if there's any danger,
restrain him immediately,

603
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:59,580
understood?

604
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,860
Be careful in there!

605
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:03,510
Zhang Zixu, calm down!

606
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,140
No one will hurt you.

607
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,620
We just want to talk.

608
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,420
Zhang Zixu,

609
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,930
don't be so agitated.

610
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,210
We're here to help you.

611
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,480
Please calm down.

612
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:18,430
Wait, I kinda forgot the dance moves.

613
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:19,610
It's fine!

614
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,290
Shun, music!

615
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,750
Why are they playing music?

616
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,240
Are we really going to dance?

617
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,120
Yes!

618
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,750
We'll use his music to connect with him.

619
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,130
Head up,

620
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:55,770
then two claps to the chest.

621
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,340
What are you doing?

622
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,160
Upper left,

623
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,750
good, same thing.

624
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,280
Five, six, seven, eight...

625
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,670
Slide down...

626
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:17,670
Yeah, then...

627
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:35,360
Good job!

628
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:49,080
Have you had enough?

629
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:49,760
Zhang Zixu!

630
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,960
Are you laughing at me?

631
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,830
Zhang Zixu, calm down!

632
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,830
Stop the music!

633
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,760
Are you mocking me?

634
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,030
-No. Calm down, Zhang Zixu.
-Mock all you want!

635
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,210
We're here to help you!

636
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:58,210
Was our dancing that bad?

637
00:30:58,210 --> 00:30:59,340
Should we try again?

638
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,580
What's going on here?

639
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,330
Go ahead with the transfer!
What kind of mess is this!

640
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:04,510
Miss Fang. Wait. Miss Fang!

641
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:05,910
What are you trying to do?

642
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,360
Zhang Zixu, I'm sorry.

643
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:14,740
I couldn't stop your transfer.

644
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,500
But we have something to show you.

645
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:22,110
No, this is not the time!

646
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:22,740
It's okay.

647
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,710
Trust her!

648
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,430
Look,

649
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:35,290
this breakfast shop owner says

650
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,630
he needs to hear your songs

651
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,830
to find the motivation to open his shop.

652
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,130
And this one—

653
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,460
this kid's father really liked you,

654
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,080
so he sang your song for him

655
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,320
on Father's Day.

656
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,670
And this couple—

657
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:56,340
they met at a bus stop humming your song

658
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:58,790
and ended up getting married.

659
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:05,000
What the hell is the point
of showing me this?

660
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:08,010
I killed someone with my car!

661
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,640
I killed someone with my car!

662
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,260
Haven't you had enough?

663
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,830
I'm just like you said—

664
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,830
a worthless waste of space!

665
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,330
I'm nothing!

666
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:21,500
I'm sorry

667
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,980
for losing control that day.

668
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,320
I know you're overwhelmed right now,

669
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,680
but I need you to know
that many people still love you,

670
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,300
still care about you,

671
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,070
and want you to keep living.

672
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,580
Mr. Zhang,

673
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,340
you're unbelievable.

674
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,810
You're really something else.

675
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:50,460
You killed my brother in that accident

676
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,390
and haven't apologized even once.

677
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,920
What gives you the right?

678
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,210
Could you please

679
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,330
talk to Zhang Zixu for me?

680
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:00,330
Miss, I already
told your counselor before

681
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:02,080
not to come back.

682
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,160
Your visit is only causing me
more distress.

683
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,560
I'm sorry, I know this is intrusive.

684
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,960
If you know, then please leave.

685
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,860
I'm sorry, but I...

686
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,860
I really need your help.

687
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,830
Anything you say...

688
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,460
-even just a few words...
-Why should I help you?

689
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,460
Please leave!

690
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,330
Anything will do.

691
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,960
I desperately need your help.

692
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,830
I'm begging you,

693
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,080
please! Please!

694
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,020
Please!

695
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:29,410
What right do you have?

696
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,580
You're the one who killed my brother!

697
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,460
What gives you the right?

698
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,330
You never even came to apologize!

699
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,160
Are you too scared to face it?

700
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:43,780
You'd better stay alive, because I...

701
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,760
I want you to spend every moment
in prison

702
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,290
thinking about my brother!

703
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:51,040
I want you to come apologize
to him every year

704
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,640
until the day you die!

705
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:46,949
Keep this suicide note.

706
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:50,510
I hope you never open it again.

707
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:03,240
You're not alone.

708
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,650
I'll be with you.

709
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:11,970
Me too!

710
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:13,680
And me!

711
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:15,960
Me too!

712
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,040
You won't?

713
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,890
I will too!

714
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,140
What are you all "me too"-ing about?

715
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,270
I don't know either.

716
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:35,710
Promise me

717
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,880
you'll be okay

718
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,730
in the new environment.

719
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,180
Can I ask one thing?

720
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:54,320
I want to start facing who I am—
Zhang Zixu.

721
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:32,440
Miss Fang,

722
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,780
you were so cool that day,

723
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,000
saying you'd face it all with him.

724
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,660
You were pretty cool too, you know.

725
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,910
I was the one who originally
pushed him over the edge.

726
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:48,280
My approach was wrong too.

727
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,880
Facing your own mistakes

728
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,090
isn't easy.

729
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,870
Since when did I become so wise?

730
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:17,830
Senior.

731
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:28,100
Look, the latest handout.

732
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:29,380
Do you still think

733
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,040
our workshops are pointless?

734
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,640
[The Power of Positivity in Music]

735
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,740
So...

736
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,590
can I get your autograph later?

737
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:50,610
Sure.

738
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:59,210
You went to see the victim's family?

739
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,430
But I was turned away.

740
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,930
So nothing came of it.

741
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,330
I didn't expect you had such initiative.

742
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,210
Respect.

743
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,070
Yeah, I guess

744
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:20,830
those few days I was pretty decent.

745
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:21,690
I... I

746
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,460
approached her about twice,

747
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,330
really wanting
to understand the situation,

748
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:26,970
so I was genuinely serious about it.

749
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:28,970
But that younger sister was fierce.

750
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:30,720
How did you manage it, then?

751
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:33,750
Maybe I came across more sincere.

752
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:35,090
And me?

753
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,580
I went twice!

754
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:40,290
Your attitude might have been a bit...

755
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,350
slick.

756
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,750
Slick?

757
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,160
Hold on, how was I slick?

758
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,520
Jun, am I slick?

759
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:49,770
Hello?

760
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,380
Oh, yes.

761
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:55,620
Okay, got it.

762
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:56,880
Good,

763
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:58,910
that's great!

764
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:00,500
What's up?

765
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:03,630
Chief says Zhang Zixu's transfer
is canceled!

766
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,900
Looks like the warden changed his mind
after reading the report.

767
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,830
Let's head over.

768
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,130
Wait, sorry,

769
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:10,580
I still really need to know—

770
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,710
exactly how was I slick?

771
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,560
It doesn't matter.

772
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,980
Your dad just outdid you
in the coolness department!

773
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:14,730
Let's go!

774
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,220
Thanks!

775
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,740
What are you doing?

776
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,940
Leave it to me.

777
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:26,850
Here, give it to me.

778
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,750
You go sit down.

779
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:29,810
Why did you come back?

780
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:31,210
Don't you have work tomorrow?

781
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:32,090
I do!

782
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,970
Then why come back?

783
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:36,360
Here.

784
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,020
Whoa, that's a lot.

785
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,510
You never thought it was a lot
when you were little.

786
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,220
It's fine,

787
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,170
you take all the beef—

788
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:43,370
leave the rest for me.

789
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,420
How are things?

790
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,410
How's the prison work going?

791
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:53,560
Are you happy there?

792
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,830
What is that supposed to mean?

793
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,150
Look—

794
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,370
since you're in there anyway,

795
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:04,920
just focus on doing your job properly.

796
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,190
And take the chance
to let your injury heal.

797
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:07,180
Once your leg's better,

798
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,510
you can do karate again,

799
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:09,670
alright?

800
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,830
I don't want to.

801
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,310
You don't? Why?

802
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,480
Are you really giving up?

803
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:20,300
My buddies are either studying
for the bar exam

804
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,830
or working full-time jobs.

805
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:23,640
What future is there in karate?

806
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:27,450
But

807
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,210
after all that training—

808
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:31,650
wouldn't all

809
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,940
that effort go to waste

810
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:34,970
if you don't achieve something with it?

811
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:36,570
Alright, let me ask you this—

812
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:38,470
how long can you

813
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,160
really last in the prison job?

814
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:48,180
I'll cut some more side dishes for you.

815
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,610
We can't stay here long.

816
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:19,930
We only have time for one cigarette.

817
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,610
Come on here.

818
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,500
Why so far away?

819
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:53,960
Come closer!

820
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,640
What, you don't wanna keep this job?
