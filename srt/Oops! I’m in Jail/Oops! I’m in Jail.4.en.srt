He's even getting special treatment
from the administrators.

13
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,470
If I didn't know better, I'd think
he was an officer on an inspection tour.

14
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,390
He thinks he's here on a campaign.

He's just an assistant,

If you've got something to say,
you have to tell us!

161

scare people like this?

What's going on?
You're really stressed, huh?

163
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,050
Is it because of that Assistant Chen?

and it'll pay off.

169
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,170
Okay?

170
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,150
Let's switch then. How about that?

171
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,610
Well, I never signed up
to be anyone's slave.

172
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,240
Just ignore him!

173
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,710
Why did you even
heat up his visitor's food?

174
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,110
Just take it in directly!

175
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,260
Did he share any with you?

176
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,780
I wouldn't eat it anyway!

177

179
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,830
Then why don't you grope him back, huh?

180
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,160
Grope all you want then!

181

If it's really unbearable,

182
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,140
you should report it to Director Xiao.

183
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,190
Telling Director Xiao won't help.

184

185
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,800
specifically through Chief Hu.

00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,180
He's clever, I'll give him that—

188
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,670
finding a rookie to boss around

189
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,960
who wouldn't dare squeak.

190
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,710
Plus, he's got a chief backing him up.

191
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:42,070
It's not about bossing me around.

192
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,760
Inmate 7234 requested me specifically

193
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,880
because he likes me.

194
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,470
He heard I want a full-time position

195
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,720
and told me to follow him,

196
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,370
said he'd help me.

197
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,740
But after I started,

198
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,620
he started groping me every day.

199
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,190
If I refuse him,

200
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,910
he threatens

201
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,330
to have me fired.

202
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,580
Where does he grope you?

203
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,540
Pretty much everywhere.

204
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,020
Seriously?

205
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,550
I'm actually reviewing his
open prison application right now.

206
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,140
So,

207
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,570
did Inmate 7234 do something
to Zhongwen?

208
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,130
Through the curtain, it looked like

209
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:05,960
Inmate 7234 was groping him.

210
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,310
But I can't be sure, you know?

211
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,620
It's just that Zhongwen's reaction

212
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,680
seemed really off.

213
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,880
But Zhongwen didn't say anything?

214
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,540
Well, I asked him!
He said nothing happened,

215
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,690
but I could tell he was really scared.

216
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,490
And Xiaohui told me

217
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,650
Chief Hu has been giving Inmate 7234
special treatment lately—

218
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:27,540
he even specifically requested Zhongwen
as his custody guard.

219
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,600
Another one abusing his privileges.

220
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:45,620
[Review Result:
Open Prison Application Denied]

221
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,990
[Ineligible]

222
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,370
Denied? Why?

223
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,290
I'm not sure either, to be honest.

224
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,620
I'll find out more.

225
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,470
What exactly is going on now?

226
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,000
Assistant Chen, please don't put me
in a difficult position.

227
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,710
About your application being denied...

228
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,880
is it possible that it's because...

229
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,910
Black Tea: 3 bottles.

230
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,610
Could it possibly be because

231
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,250
your recent conduct has been a bit too...

232
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,850
Well, you know
how people talk around here.

233
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,080
Did he do anything to you just now?

234
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,130
Tell me the truth, did he?

235
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,560
Reporting, Sir.

236
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,170
Assistant Chen isn't feeling well

237
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,270
and needs to go to the Health Division.

238
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,270
What's going on?

239
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,040
It's... dizziness.

240
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:07,990
Low blood sugar.

241
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,880
Low blood sugar?

242
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:14,470
Okay.

243
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:25,050
Is it your kidney that's hurting?

244
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,780
You'll see once you're inside!

245
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,530
Wa, come on. Have a smoke.

246
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,220
What's this for?

247
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,110
Health Division is right ahead.

248
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,130
Open the door.

249
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,580
I want to go in first to have a smoke.

250
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,410
Look, a pet!

251
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,610
I wanted a cat.

252
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,610
What's this? Cat food?

253
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,100
Cats are really hard to get in here.

254
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,240
Look at this goldfish!

255
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,440
Its eyes are so big.

256
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,620
It's watching you.

257
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,980
So ugly...

258
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,580
If you have something on your mind,
you can talk to it.

259
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,690
It won't tell anyone.

260
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:21,580
Right?

261
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:22,860
Tiantian.

262
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,650
He's calling you inside. Hurry up.

263
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,210
Wa, I'll take that as your accepting it.

264
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,850
Actually, there's something

265
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,080
I need to ask of you.

266
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,510
Could you please talk to Inmate 7234

267
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,500
and tell him to stop harassing my buddy?

268
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,880
Assistant Chen?

269
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,440
The COs from your batch
are all so handsome!

270
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,300
Which one is it?

271
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,150
This is the first time
I'm hearing this story.

272
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,150
How come you never got that benefit?

273
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,750
I have self-respect.

274
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:01,370
Wa.

275
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,470
Wa,

276
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:17,560
could you do this for me? Please.

277
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,300
Inside here,

278
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,670
you mind your business,
and I'll mind mine.

279
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,970
He doesn't cause trouble for me,

280
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,830
and I won't cause trouble for him.

281
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,210
Tell your buddy:

282
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,310
if this isn't for him,

283
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,910
he should just go home early.

284
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:40,740
Boss!

285
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,410
I've been so good to you,

286
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,020
and you stab me in the back?

287
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,110
What are you doing?

288
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:00,940
Inmate 7234.

289
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,220
Make another sound,

290
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,800
and I'll have you fired immediately.

291
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,579
Your wife can forget about her exam too.

292
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,740
Zhuang, go outside and keep watch.

293
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,490
Yes.

294
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,050
Come here.

295
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:24,930
Come here!

296
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,020
Constipated?

297
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,910
Nah, I'm just thinking about Zhongwen.

298
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,220
Same here.

299
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:55,540
But what can we do?

300
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,330
At our level,

301
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,800
if we file a complaint,
no one will listen.

302
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,750
We just have to wait it out.

303
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:09,650
It's Inmate 7765.

304
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,130
Inmate 7765!

305
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,550
Why are you here all by yourself?

306
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,870
I just went to the Health Division.

307
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,070
I'm heading back now.

308
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,610
Was that too hard?

309
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,540
Sorry.

310
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,380
Sorry, let me check

311
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,650
if you're hurt.

312
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:27,560
Are you okay?

313
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,050
Are you alright?

314
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,670
Wait, wasn't Zhongwen

315
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:39,130
supposed to be guarding
you and Inmate 7234?

316
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,030
Zhongwen, where are you right now?

317
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,580
This is Zhiyao to Health Division.

318
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,580
Is Inmate 7234 currently
receiving treatment there?

319
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,550
This is Shun;

320
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,460
Inmate 7234 is not
in the Health Division.

321
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,460
Freeze!

322
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:00,770
So where exactly is Inmate 7234?

323
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:01,970
I don't know.

324
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,250
I'm going back.

325
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,870
Zhongwen, where are you? Can you hear me?

326
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:10,520
Zhongwen, are you with Inmate 7234?

327
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,010
Respond if you can hear me!

328
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,040
Take your hands off!

329
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,510
Just for a second.

330
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,080
Come on.

331
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,180
Zhongwen!

332
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,510
Wang Zhongwen, where are you?

333
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,060
Please! Don't!

334
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,310
Zhongwen, where are you?

335
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,570
Respond now if you can hear me,
Zhongwen!

336
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,260
Help!

337
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,920
Officer! Help me!

338
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:41,010
Help! Sir! Help!

339
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,420
He attacked me!

340
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,000
Look at him,

341
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,330
he's so turned on... he's got a nosebleed!

342
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,790
It's terrifying!

343
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,850
Look, his nose is bleeding.

344
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,210
Sir!

345
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,140
I'm so scared.

346
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,930
Save me, Sir!

347
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,500
He was trying to sexually assault me!

348
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,380
When I refused, he hit me!

349
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:05,000
Why are you doing this to me?

350
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,130
Hello?

351
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,390
Okay, are his injuries any better?

352
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,480
Okay.

353
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,130
And has he calmed down now?

354
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,630
Okay.

355
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,180
That's not good.

356
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,460
Don't let him make a scene outside.

357
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,030
Okay? Please.

358
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,880
Alright, you calm him down first.

359
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,580
I'll be right there.

360
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,080
Okay, thanks. Bye.

361
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,470
Alright.

362
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:41,110
Now he wants a medical exam
to sue you. What do we do?

363
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,670
Chief, you have to believe me.

364
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,890
-I really...
-How can I believe you?

365
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,280
You want me to believe

366
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,770
someone would bang their own head

367
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:49,830
against a wall?

368
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,610
Is that it?

369
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:53,210
But he really did smash his head
into the wall himself!

370
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,840
-Chief, I believe Zhongwen.
-I know,

371
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:56,780
Senior.

372
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,250
It's not that I don't trust our own guy.

373
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,310
Right now, he's accusing him,

374
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,410
and he's accusing him back.

375
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,430
It's not that I don't trust him,

376
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:05,760
but I can't wrongfully accuse
Assistant Chen either, can I?

377
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,050
I'm going to the Health Division.

378
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,620
Just tell them exactly what you saw.

379
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,120
-Chief.
-What now?

380
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,330
Inmate 7765 was accompanying

381
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,460
Inmate 7234

382
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,790
to the Health Division.

383
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,600
He says he saw something.

384
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,000
Great! And?

385
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,650
What did you see? Tell us!

386
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,460
You saw it, didn't you? Speak up!

387
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:27,790
Well...

388
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:32,250
Assistant Chen was dizzy

389
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,860
and disoriented,

390
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,440
so he wandered towards the workshop.

391
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,500
Then this CO followed him in

392
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,870
and told me to leave.

393
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,760
That's when I saw this CO

394
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,850
grab Assistant Chen's head
and slam it against the wall!

395
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:46,880
Director, he's lying!

396
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,310
I never grabbed his head!

397
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,650
Wait. Okay, let him finish.

398
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,170
They must have coordinated their stories!

399
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:51,640
Continue.

400
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,540
After I saw that, I got so scared

401
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,890
I just ran off.

402
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:55,850
I don't know anything about

403
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:57,310
what happened after that.

404
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,120
I didn't want any trouble.

405
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,140
Zhuang Xianzong,

406
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:00,990
I'm warning you.

407
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:03,180
Lying through your teeth
can get people killed!

408
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,060
I'm telling the truth.

409
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:07,040
Are you sure about this?

410
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:07,830
Yes.

411
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:09,180
Alright. I understand.

412
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,390
Senior, can I have a word?

413
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,470
Is what you said true?

414
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:19,330
It's true.

415
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,960
Senior, what should we do?

416
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,200
Discipline him or force a resignation?

417
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,200
What's your call?

418
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,420
But Chief,

419
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,210
you can't believe his pack of lies!

420
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:28,670
I know.
Alright, let's leave it here for now.

421
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,220
I need to go calm Assistant Chen first,

422
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:31,970
okay?

423
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,760
This must not leak outside
under any circumstances.

424
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,690
Go and make that clear to everyone.

425
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,560
You're not buying his story, are you?

426
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,630
Zhuang Xianzong.

427
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,040
Did Chen Yihua put you up to this?

428
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,250
Director, no—

429
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:49,700
it's true!

430
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,080
True?

431
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,960
Are you happy now,

432
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,380
after screwing over a CO like this?

433
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,540
If I find out you lied,

434
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,380
you're dead.

435
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,940
Take him back.

436
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,330
Move!

437
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,720
You'd better think carefully!

438
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,080
Is what they said true?

439
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:21,110
I heard it's already settled.

440
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,670
Inmate 7234 agreed not to escalate this,

441
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:25,580
but on one condition:
he must be transferred to the open prison.

442
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,670
And Zhongwen... has to be reassigned.

443
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,640
It means they're accepting
Inmate 7234's version of events.

444
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,380
Let's escalate this up the chain

445
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,750
and convene a gender equality meeting
to investigate thoroughly.

446
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,420
Escalate it? He's connected and powerful,

447
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,380
and he even has
Inmate 7765 giving false testimony.

448
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,420
Sending Zhongwen away now would

449
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,500
probably just lead
to the same outcome, wouldn't it?

450
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,300
The key is that we need evidence.

451
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:46,750
Without it, all our talk is meaningless.

452
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,810
But how are we supposed to investigate?

453
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:49,270
There are so many cameras.

454
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,280
We'll track Inmate 7234's movements.

455
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,420
I refuse to believe
we can't find something.

456
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,420
I'll go pull the surveillance footage.

457
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,820
You should get some rest.

458
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:09,450
Zhongwen.

459
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,850
I bought you braised trotters with noodles

460
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,580
to help you settle your nerves.

461
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,940
Why are you packing your stuff?

462
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,170
It's just a few days of suspended duty.

463
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,300
It's no use.

464
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,170
I'm definitely getting fired over this.

465
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:21,290
Nonsense!

466
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,920
We're all on your side, okay?

467
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,980
Does anyone want this mattress?

468
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,750
I'll sell it for 3k.

469
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:36,450
You drooled all over it.
I'll give you 2k for it.

470
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,860
Let me think about it.

471
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:47,400
Look,

472
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:48,990
how cute is Ningning?

473
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,830
What are you going to tell her today?

474
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,080
"Daddy got fired"?

475
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,560
It would break her heart.

476
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:56,260
How about this:
leave Ningning with us for now.

477
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,360
Just treat this suspension

478
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,460
as a vacation.

479
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:00,180
Rest up, spend some time
with your daughter.

480
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:00,750
Okay?

481
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,360
If you really leave like this,

482
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,690
it means you admit
that you have done this.

483
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,020
Right!

484
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,920
And if you just bail,

485
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,780
it'll mess up our whole schedule!

486
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,980
You idiot—I'm wearing flip-flops!

487
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,090
Will we really find a way?

488
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,870
If there's truly no way,

489
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:29,300
then this guy here will still find one.

490
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,750
We will, we'll find a way.

491
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:35,100
Everything's going to be alright.

492
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:47,790
Stop worrying and come on!

493
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,290
Enjoy the braised trotters with noodles.

494
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:51,040
It wasn't easy to get this.

495
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:52,980
I walked really far—

496
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:56,380
the food from this place
is amazing, you know?

497
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,130
Thank you.

498
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,540
Want me to heat them up for you?

499
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,540
No, it's fine.

500
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:39,050
How are you doing?

501
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,790
Come, Wa. Let me help you.

502
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,540
I need to ask you a favor.

503
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,670
Could you look into

504
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:27,500
why Inmate 7765

505
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,830
is committing perjury?

506
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,770
Does he have leverage over him?

507
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,420
What could anyone have over him?

508
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,790
He's dirt poor.

509
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:35,690
He'll do anything

510
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,020
for anyone who pays him.

511
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,420
Just for money?

512
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,020
I don't have a lighter.

513
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,020
I do.

514
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,670
My buddy's being accused
of sexual assault.

515
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:50,400
There's no conscience in this!

516
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,630
Who has it easy in here?

517
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,030
What's conscience good for?

518
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,810
Buying instant noodles or toilet paper?

519
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,630
Then I'm really begging you
this time, Wa. Please.

520
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,380
Please, I'm begging you!

521
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,640
I've told you:

522
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,360
he doesn't cause me trouble,

523
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,500
and I won't cause him any.

524
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,510
This isn't about causing him trouble.

525
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,500
It's about getting him to tell the truth.

526
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,880
My buddy is getting destroyed
by him right now,

527
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,280
and we're out of options!

528
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:14,310
S-Squat down!

529
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:14,770
Yes.

530
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,330
It's okay. Get up.

531
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:24,150
Sorry about that.

532
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,250
I was too worked up just now.

533
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:29,820
Well...

534
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,530
Here, have this pack
of cigarettes, alright?

535
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:35,000
And if you want the cat,
I'll find a way to make it happen.

536
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,130
You're giving me a cat now?

537
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,860
So it can eat my fish, is that it?

538
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,250
My fish is doing just fine!

539
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,420
I just think it looks lonely now.

540
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,750
Can you get another one in here for me?

541
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,960
Are you stupid?

542
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,690
Alright, I'll figure out a way
to get you another one.

543
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,000
We actually caught Inmate 7765

544
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,140
outside that day.

545
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,130
He was totally acting as a lookout.

546
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:54,300
Who was he keeping watch for?

547
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,630
Inmate 7234, of course.

548
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,900
My buddy was really
getting ruined by him.

549
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,930
Please, Wa, will you help us out?

550
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:08,920
Check in with Zhuang.

551
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:09,720
Yes.

552
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,280
As for Assistant Chen...

553
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,630
Well, that's a matter for you officials.

554
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,530
As for me...

555
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:22,210
You get it, right?

556
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,290
[Warden's Office]

557
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:51,470
Sorry, Warden—

558
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,630
I mean, greetings, Warden!

559
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,760
What are you sneaking around here for?

560
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:57,990
Sir, I have a matter

561
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:00,320
I'd like to request your assistance with.

562
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,380
Gao Zhizhuo?

563
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,250
It's Gao Zhiyao.

564
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,660
Oh, it's you.

565
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,510
Get inside.

566
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:55,380
Gao Zhiyao,

567
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,680
heading to work?

568
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,130
Senior,

569
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:01,750
still here at this hour?

570
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:04,550
Yeah. What did you get?
Is that a late-night snack?

571
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,340
Yeah, a late-night snack.

572
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,120
What kind?

573
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:13,250
Fish ball soup.

574
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,910
There's fish ball soup around here?
Since when?

575
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,630
This...

576
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:20,870
Uh...

577
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:23,850
This...

578
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,470
After I finished

579
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:27,130
the fish ball soup,

580
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,330
I passed by an aquarium and bought this.

581
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:30,320
Yeah.

582
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,550
Well, last time in your office,

583
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:32,850
I saw you keep shrimp.

584
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,030
So I bought a goldfish.

585
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,450
Didn't you just say fish ball soup?

586
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:43,500
The soup was the snack. Right.

587
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,550
The goldfish is cute.

588
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,360
They eat a lot and poop a lot too.

589
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:49,940
When you change the water,

590
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,690
remember to pay attention
to the temperature.

591
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:53,220
Thanks for the tip, Senior.

592
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,430
The shop owner has told me about it.

593
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,320
Well... if that's all,
I'll head to my post.

594
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:23,510
Ahua, take good care of Arhui, okay?

595
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:12,250
Sir, I want a taste of it, too.

596
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,980
Senior, please let me go out.

597
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,980
There's a physical altercation
at Dorm R1.

598
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,770
We request backup.

599
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:48,560
Shui received. En route.

600
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,160
This is Zhiyao.

601
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,990
I'm also heading over to assist.

602
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,130
If it was you calling for backup today,

603
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,950
and everyone else just half-assed it
and left you hanging,

604
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,010
how would you feel?

605
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,700
I know you're innocent.

606
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,860
But if this is the attitude
you're going to have,

607
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,980
even though I'm on your side,

608
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,380
I'd still have to ask
for your resignation.

609
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,710
Because this is the only way I,

610
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,570
as the Director, can protect you.

611
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:31,760
Director,

612
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,530
then what should I do?

613
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:38,270
I really need this job.

614
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,630
If you truly want to keep working here,

615
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,030
then hold your head high.

616
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,630
Up, I said!

617
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:57,139
Zhongwen,

618
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,520
only you can solve this yourself.

619
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:02,780
No one else can do it for you.

620
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,210
Stop relying on others.

621
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,580
Isn't Inmate 7234

622
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,830
just an executive assistant
of a councilor?

623
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:13,970
If we find the evidence,

624
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:15,220
we can take him down.

625
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:16,670
But if you want our help,

626
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:18,470
you have to help yourself first.

627
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,460
Tell me now.

628
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,370
Yeah, just got home.

629
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:32,430
Sweetie, it's Daddy!

630
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,730
What are you watching, sweetie?

631
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:35,920
-A cartoon?
-She's just brushing you off.

632
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,850
The cartoon is still
the most important thing to her.

633
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,780
She just wouldn't

634
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,470
nap at all today.

635
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,380
I'm literally exhausted.

636
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,060
Honey,

637
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:49,670
perhaps we should find a nursery.

638
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,750
At this point,
we can only send her to a private nursery.

639
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,550
That's an extra 10k a month!

640
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:54,550
But wait,

641
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,670
if this continues,

642
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,550
what if you don't pass your exam?

643
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,620
Can we please just drop this?

644
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:03,590
We've been over it.

645
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,000
Oh, and don't forget

646
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,750
to transfer the rent tomorrow, okay?

647
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,020
Also, I found that lotion

648
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,440
the doctor recommended

649
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,630
for her online

650
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,500
for cheaper.

651
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:17,000
Got it.

652
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,830
If we need that lotion,

653
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:20,290
just go ahead and order it.

654
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,250
Alright,

655
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,750
I'm going upstairs to study.

656
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,200
Get some rest soon.

657
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,680
-But I still want to spend time with...
-Bye.

658
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,630
Counselor,

659
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,960
what are you doing here?

660
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,810
I thought there was
a disciplinary meeting for us.

661
00:36:58,810 --> 00:36:59,260
Yes,

662
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:02,640
your memory serves you well.
Please, have a seat.

663
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,520
Take that seat there.

664
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,530
Chief Hu.

665
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:15,920
we're here to discuss the case

666
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,640
of Inmate 7234,

667
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,500
who is suspected of sexual assault
and harassment

668
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,700
against our Custody Division colleague,
Wang Zhongwen.

669
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:23,940
Wait...

670
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:25,880
Have you got it all wrong?

671
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,400
I...

672
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:29,080
I'm the one who was assaulted!

673
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,130
Is that so?

674
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,880
Because I heard

675
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,600
Chief Hu is giving

676
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:36,000
Inmate 7234 special privileges
for his thesis—

677
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,670
even letting him choose

678
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,920
his favorite OC

679
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,880
to be with him,

680
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,260
allowing him to grope

681
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,750
and even sexually assault them.

682
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:43,680
If word of this got out,

683
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:46,770
which of you do you think
would be thrown under the bus first?

684
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:49,170
I'm not quite sure I understand
what you're referring to.

685
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:51,490
This requires evidence, doesn't it?

686
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:52,580
I have evidence.

687
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,520
I can testify.

688
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,500
I am here to accuse Inmate 7234,

689
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,430
legal name Chen Yihua,

690
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:06,630
of repeatedly using my job as leverage
to threaten me,

691
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,000
groping

692
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,250
my body—

693
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,360
including my private parts—

694
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,020
and threatening
to make me take my pants off.

695
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:15,880
Wang Zhongwen,

696
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,850
do you realize what you're saying?

697
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,730
The statements you just made

698
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:23,600
carry legal consequences—
are you aware of that?

699
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,760
I am aware of that.

700
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:29,130
So regarding the materials
about Inmate 7234

701
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:30,920
ghostwriting the thesis for Chief Hu,

702
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,450
I've already made backups.

703
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,930
These are the exact questions
for your oral defense.

704
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:36,310
Don't worry.

705
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:38,210
I'll write down all the answers

706
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:39,220
and everything for you.

707
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,690
All you need to do is memorize them.

708
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:43,550
The content is just copy-pasted
from other papers,

709
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,480
only changing some parameters.

710
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,720
So you've got no proof after all,
just as I thought!

711
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,020
But when you assaulted me that day,

712
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,270
I did have a witness!

713
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:54,690
Gao Zhiyao!

714
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:55,410
Yes!

715
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,580
Zhuang Xianzong,

716
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,660
tell us everything you know.

717
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,840
I swear,

718
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,600
I saw it with my own eyes.

719
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:17,790
Assistant Chen was all over this CO.

720
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,080
Don't you dare lie!

721
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:22,540
That's not the story you told last time!

722
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,170
That's right. Watch your mouth.

723
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:25,910
Tell us everything you know.

724
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,910
Assistant Chen

725
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,640
would constantly touch this CO's body.

726
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,280
He would grope him everywhere.

727
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,780
And that day in the workshop,

728
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,970
he even pulled his pants down

729
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,290
and groped his genitals!

730
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:40,220
Shut your mouth!

731
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:43,320
Say another word and you can forget
about your low-income benefits!

732
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:43,820
And you—

733
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,640
so what if I touched you
a couple of times?

734
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,770
What's the big deal?

735
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:48,640
Did you ever say "no"?

736
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,770
If you didn't want it,
you should've spoken up!

737
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:52,050
Weren't you enjoying it anyway?

738
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:53,310
What nonsense is this?

739
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,470
You're full of tricks, aren't you?

740
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:04,720
I'll take those emotional outbursts

741
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,510
of yours as an admission of guilt.

742
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,740
You provoked

743
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,050
those statements!

744
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:11,030
Can that even be used as evidence?

745
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:18,120
I've reviewed all the surveillance footage
from the compound.

746
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,980
You were always conscious
of the camera locations,

747
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,250
but everyone slips up eventually.

748
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,200
We also have the evidence you asked for.

749
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:32,880
Just so you know,

750
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,140
we'll hand all of this over
to the police.

751
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,140
Warden.

752
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:41,800
Warden.

753
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:47,130
There's something
I'd like to ask your help with.

754
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:50,940
How's the situation coming along?

755
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:52,850
He admitted it.

756
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,280
I got it recorded.

757
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,330
Hand it over.

758
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,500
Chen Yihua,

759
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,320
your violations have been confirmed.

760
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,900
According to regulations,
disciplinary action must be taken.

761
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:07,420
Chief Hu.

762
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:07,900
Yes.

763
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:09,390
What's the procedure now?

764
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,660
Director Xiao,

765
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,980
have 7234 transferred
to the disciplinary cell immediately.

766
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:14,600
Yes, Sir.

767
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:16,490
Director,

768
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:19,090
Zhiyao and I can handle the custody.

769
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,560
Keep acting tough!

770
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,400
Go ahead, act all tough!

771
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,530
You'd better

772
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,680
watch your back.

773
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,000
Inmate 7234, you're being moved

774
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,460
-to the disciplinary cell.
-Don't touch me!

775
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,420
I know your name now.

776
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,210
What are you laughing at?

777
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:42,020
You'll be stuck as a director for life!

778
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:44,640
I'm going to sue you
and your son until you're ruined!

779
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,770
Pack your stuff. You're cleared to go.

780
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:49,380
You okay?

781
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,180
What the hell!

782
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:50,760
My...

783
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,190
my foot! You stepped on my foot!

784
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,520
It hurts! My feet!

785
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:58,980
Let go!

786
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,270
Are you all blind?

787
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,340
He stepped on my foot!

788
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,480
What's wrong? What happened?

789
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,670
He stepped on my foot!

790
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:04,820
He stepped on my foot!

791
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,950
Did any of you see it?

792
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,600
No? See? No one saw it.

793
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:08,520
Warden!

794
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,600
Warden, didn't you see that?

795
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:14,090
Take him away.

796
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:15,880
Zhiyao,

797
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:17,390
I'll handle this.

798
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,980
I need to go to the Health Division.

799
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,220
Inmate 7234, move it, now!

800
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,630
My foot is killing me!
I need the Health Division!

801
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:22,690
Get me a phone call!

802
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:23,500
Take him.

803
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:25,400
I need to make a call!

804
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:26,770
I'm going to sue you into the ground!

805
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:28,020
You're all finished!

806
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:30,090
You won't even know what hit you!

807
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:31,140
And when it happens,
don't you dare come begging to me!

808
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,410
It won't do you any good!

809
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:34,210
Get away from me! Don't touch me!

810
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,000
Shrimpies.

811
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:50,590
What are you doing?

812
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:53,850
I just added a few new shrimps.

813
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:54,920
Shrimpies?

814
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,170
There's one that looks exactly
like Director Xiao!

815
00:42:58,170 --> 00:42:59,170
Which one is it?

816
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,880
That one! The black one,

817
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:03,130
the big one.

818
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,250
Then which one am I?

819
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:10,050
I haven't decided yet.

820
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,720
Is there one you like?

821
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:14,610
The orange one.

822
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:16,460
That one?

823
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,660
Okay! Then from now on,
we'll call it Fang Jieyu.

824
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:29,000
I brought you some favorite snacks.

825
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:29,930
You're welcome.

826
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:32,010
Why are you so nice?

827
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:33,460
No reason, really...

828
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:34,470
I just wanted to thank you
for having my back

829
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:36,330
and for standing up for Zhongwen.

830
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:39,060
It was nothing,
we're all in this together. Here.

831
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:46,430
But you know what I'm curious about—

832
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:47,760
how did Zhiyao

833
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:49,250
get Inmate 7765 to talk?

834
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,550
You'd collude with that kind
of person for money?

835
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:00,050
You have no conscience.

836
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,370
Wa,

837
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:04,440
I know I was wrong.

838
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:05,810
I'm sorry.

839
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:12,800
You have a daughter.

840
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:14,930
That's right.

841
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:17,730
What does she do for a living?

842
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:20,030
She was in a car accident before.

843
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:21,750
Her leg isn't so good now.

844
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,540
She hasn't been able to work
for a long time.

845
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:27,000
What about her hands?
Are they affected too?

846
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:31,570
I covered your allowance

847
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:32,560
for you.

848
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:33,990
As for your daughter,

849
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:36,290
tell her to see my sister
at the salon tomorrow.

850
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:38,550
She can work as a foot massage therapist.

851
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,400
Legit work.

852
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:42,880
Is that okay?

853
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,580
-Thank you, Wa!
-And, listen—

854
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:48,440
about some things…

855
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:51,380
If you saw it, say you saw it.

856
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:54,720
If you didn't, say you didn't.

857
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:56,860
Don't run your mouth.

858
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:58,250
Understood?

859
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:00,220
Understood, Wa.

860
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,140
Wa… is there anything I can do for you?

861
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,270
Well then...

862
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,480
Why not help our little darling here
have some fun?

863
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:32,380
What are you doing?

864
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:33,910
What the hell are you doing?

865
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:35,600
Isn't the point to make it happy?

866
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,000
We were talking about the goldfish!

867
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,500
Catch ten bugs every day
to feed my goldfish.

868
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,630
Can you do that?

869
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:41,630
You're crazy.

870
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:42,720
Thank you, Wa.

871
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:43,680
Thanks a lot, Wa.

872
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,430
Thanks!

873
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:45,870
Thanks a lot!

874
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:51,370
[Mona Bar]

875
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:52,130
Cheers.

876
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:52,720
Cheers.

877
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,880
Thank you, Zhongwen,
for the awesome feast!

878
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:55,500
Jiajun,

879
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,920
without you guys,

880
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:59,540
I'd have been fired long ago.

881
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:02,910
"You guys"? Yu Jiajun didn't do a thing!

882
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:03,880
I've got love and support, okay?

883
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,630
Here we go, dish is served!

884
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,720
Come on, eat it while it's hot.

885
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:09,460
Thanks.

886
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:11,430
What's the celebration today, handsome?

887
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:13,950
Celebrating...

888
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:15,000
well, that's hard to say.

889
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,730
Celebrating continuing to be
corporate slaves!

890
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:19,630
Corporate slaves!

891
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:20,630
Mona Wu.

892
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:21,240
What?

893
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:23,010
My keychain is missing.

894
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:23,880
The keys?

895
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,380
Maybe they're still in the kitchen?

896
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:26,990
Xiaohui!

897
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:28,050
Hi.

898
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,000
What are you doing here?

899
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,170
I'm helping out here.

900
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:31,470
This is my sister's bar.

901
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:32,300
Your sister?

902
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:32,750
Yes.

903
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:34,380
This is my sister, Mona.

904
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:36,120
Nice to meet you, Ms. Mona.

905
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:38,780
Mind if I ask—are you two
not related by blood?

906
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:40,300
Excuse me?

907
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,970
Maybe you should find out who I am first.

908
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:44,100
I'm on good terms

909
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:46,040
with every single officer and higher-up

910
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,630
in your correctional facility,
from top to bottom.

911
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:49,530
What does your Director Xiao call me?

912
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:50,280
Ms. Mona.

913
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:52,580
What does Chief Hu call me?

914
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:53,240
Ms. Mona.

915
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:56,040
What does your warden,
Jiang Guocheng, call me?

916
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:57,170
Ms. Mona.

917
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,050
So, what should you call me?

918
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:00,020
Auntie Mona!

919
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:03,930
Auntie?

920
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:11,450
Oh no...

921
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:17,630
Xiaohui.

922
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:21,220
Don't worry about it.

923
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:23,430
Enjoy your meal.

924
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:24,460
Was it my fault?

925
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:25,130
Yeah.

926
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:28,550
It's alright, come on,
eat up while it's hot.

927
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:31,050
Here, let me get some for you.

928
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:33,130
Have this—drumstick, chicken wing.

929
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:42,500
Hello?

930
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:44,000
Mom.

931
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,780
I know. I'll come back.

932
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:52,790
Gao Zhiyao?

933
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:57,270
What?

934
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:58,220
You all...
