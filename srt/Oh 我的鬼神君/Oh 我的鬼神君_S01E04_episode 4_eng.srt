1
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:22,300

2
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,260
 Oh My Ghostess

3
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,080
Brace yourself.

4
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,760
I'm going. Come at me. Come!

5
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,250
 A lot of ghosts will probably stick to you.

6
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:01,370
 The ghosts here will be no joke.

7
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,120
Gh...ghosts, there are no ghosts.

8
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,380
That stalker, that one.

9
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,060
Who is it?

10
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,410
Ah! Move that away, you're blinding me!

11
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,170
Na Bong Seon?

12
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,920
What are you doing?

13
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,470
What?

14
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:17,980
 Today's Special: Oh My Ghostess 
 Episode 4

15
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,600
You were going to break in and sleep here?

16
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,100
Not exactly "break in." Let's just say it's for one night.

17
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,970
If you didn't get caught, you were going to keep staying here two, three nights, weren't you?

18
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,290
Well, that is a little,...

19
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:39,000
But I really have an unfortunate situation, you see. Money is also a problem.

20
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:43,370
I'm not really in a position to decide as I like on a place either. Can't I somehow stay?

21
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:46,240
- You can't.  
 - Why? Why not?

22
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,300
I'll just be sleeping as if I were dead, and I'll leave before people get here.

23
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,390
But, still, you can't! Seriously.

24
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:56,540
Would you like it if someone's butt was on the table you eat at, and they sleep on it, too?

25
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,380
This is a restaurant--not a hotel!

26
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,890
Well, that is true, but

27
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,320
if I go now it means the only place to go is the subway station.

28
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,460
Go sleep at a friend's.

29
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,710
-I don't have any friends.
-Then go sleep at a motel.

30
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:15,760
You go there with a man, what fun would that be alone?

31
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,240
You, seriously.

32
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,670
So, let it go just this once.

33
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:26,600
Think of it as helping the homeless.

34
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,040
Oh, Chef....

35
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,440
Just this once.

36
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,820
Can't I?

37
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:46,920
I try acting cutesy once and he gets angry?

38
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:52,500
Where can I go now? I'm so desperate.

39
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,560
When this happens,

40
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,490
which way should I go, try to guess which way to go?

41
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,320
Ding, dong, dang. Professor Chuk Chuk.

42
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,900
That's the one!

43
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,310
  Traditional Korean Food

44
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,420
Agh, father's drinking again.

45
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,830
He can't be healthy if he continues this.

46
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:34,780
As expected, the best cooked eggs are eggs steamed on a stone plate.

47
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,360
Ah, this looks yummy.

48
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,450
Oh, exactly my type.

49
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,260
You're here?

50
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,990
 The sauna is a really great place.

51
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,090
 Honey!

52
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,810
Honey, let's go somewhere else.

53
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,350
Damn, it was about to be good.

54
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,660
Who is it? This young lady ate it all by herself.

55
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,040
What is this?

56
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,370
This is already her second time. She must be insane.

57
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,440
All that fits in that stomach?

58
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,860
Does her stomach have a hole in it?

59
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,160
 Five? What is it?

60
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,660
  You should drink some water!

61
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:01,510
Can a person really eat this much?

62
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:06,770
Weren't you just chastising me for possessing someone?

63
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:10,810
Hey, do you think it's easy to be able to eat memorial food?

64
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:14,160
There are more and more ghosts, but fewer memorial tables.

65
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,900
Would I do that if I didn't have to?

66
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,660
Would I possess such a skinny girl to fill my stomach?

67
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,850
But I don't think I'm as bad off as you.

68
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:29,430
Don't even talk about it. Actually, I'm locked up.

69
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,860
Locked up?

70
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,660
Oh my, you were caught in someone with the right frequency, weren't you?

71
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:41,370
What are you going to do? I heard if you're not careful you can be trapped forever!

72
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:47,190
Of course! That's why I'm an assistant in a kitchen right now.

73
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:50,650
But, it isn't all bad.

74
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:54,120
It's kind of fun acting like a person since it's been so long.

75
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,240
And actually, I met my father.

76
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,220
And I think I'm getting my memory back.

77
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,890
What if you want to keep living this way?

78
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:06,750
No! Why would I when I know I'll become a demon after three years?

79
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,850
Exactly! You cannot treat evil spirits lightly.

80
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,160
Everything bad happening in society

81
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,220
such as shortages, crime, kidnappings, and severing are all done by demons.

82
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,490
They're the ones who go around possessing people!

83
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,500
I know that, too. That's why I'm worried.

84
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,630
I'm glad to find and see my father,

85
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:29,840
but I still need to end my virginity and dispel grudges.

86
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,930
So I can go up!

87
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,400
But finding a man full of stamina

88
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,910
is harder than picking out stars in the sky.

89
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:39,800
Have you ever seen a man with stamina before?

90
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:46,910
 Don't you think she's crazy? It's already been two hours.

91
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,250
Why are there so many crazy girls at the sauna?

92
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,700
Sheesh, she's strange.

93
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,170
Ah, this is so heavy.

94
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,860
I couldn't sleep because of that damn couple next to me!

95
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,400
Couldn't they just get a motel or something!?

96
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,700
Officer Choi.

97
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,690
You're going to work early.

98
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:10,450
Yes.

99
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,740
What is all that?

100
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,390
What?

101
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:17,840
Ah! This! I won this... from those claw machines!

102
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,620
Ah, yes, that.

103
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,850
Ah! Those.

104
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,370
Right?

105
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,770
With that, I...oh, thank you.

106
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,260
I'll carry it for you.

107
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,790
But where are you going?

108
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,470
Thank you for being a ramen friend.

109
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,970
Otherwise I would have eaten alone.

110
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,350
But you should go home and eat rice, why...

111
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,770
When I finish up, I crave ramen.

112
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:51,150
But Eun Hee doesn't like me eating ramen, so I sometimes secretly eat it like this before I go home.

113
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:54,420
But she must love you a lot.

114
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,420
Who, Eun Hee?

115
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,460
Let's see,

116
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:03,190
well, I think so.

117
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:07,750
But when did you get married? Did you think she's the one right when you saw her?

118
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:12,640
And did Eun Hee like you first? Or did you chase her first?

119
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,870
Of course, I chased her first.

120
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:23,460
Bong Seon, you must have been very interested in us all that time.

121
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:27,240
Ah, a little.

122
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,400
As long as you're happy.

123
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,170
There...

124
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,160
Where is it?

125
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,090
Thank you.

126
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,210
 Why is he so considerate?

127
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:56,000
 If he's like this, I can't empty my heart.

128
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,440
Aren't you eating?

129
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,590
Ah, no, I'm eating.

130
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,570
It's probably hot!

131
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,870
It's very hot.

132
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:09,130
- I'm sorry.
- Eat a little at a time.

133
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,260
Bong Seon, you're a bit late.

134
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,900
Oh this? I won this from a claw machine.

135
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,250
Anything else you're curious about?

136
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:09,230
No, go ahead and change.

137
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,560
What's wrong with ramen?

138
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,720
I mean ramen is also food.

139
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,860
It's not like you eat it daily or live for thousands of years.

140
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:25,380
Furthermore, people who eat organic goods fall ill often and contract colds easier.

141
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,390
That's just what I think.

142
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,710
I must have over done it yesterday... my mouth tastes like sewage!

143
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,840
Cream is off limits today. If you talk about cream...

144
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,880
Trash can, trash can.

145
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,430
Here, here, here.

146
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,380
Are you okay?

147
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:54,490
You were goofing around without any fear yesterday, geez.

148
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,360
Do you want some water?

149
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,590
I think I'll even throw up water now.

150
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:01,260
If I mix together drinks again,

151
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,020
I'd really be your younger brother.

152
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,110
Oh! I'm sorry, I'm a little late!

153
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,210
A little?

154
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:14,110
This youngest one, do you think you're the only one who had a work dinner or drank?

155
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:17,280
I'm not that late, what's the matter, Oppa?

156
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,510
Oppa? Oppa? Why would I be your Oppa?

157
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:22,270
Did my mother give birth to you? How would I be your Oppa?

158
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:26,460
No, it's just that yesterday you told me to start calling you Oppa.

159
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,850
You're saying that I told you to call me Oppa? Last night?

160
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,090
-Yes
-That's ridiculous!

161
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:33,260
Hey, I can't stand you.

162
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,980
You're not supposed to remember what you do while drunk.

163
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,650
That's etiquette, isn't it?

164
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,460
Yeah, of course.

165
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,770
Good morning!

166
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,260
You came, Chef?

167
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,720
Are the ingredients prepared?

168
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,950
Hey, Min Soo.

169
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,280
Yes?

170
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,050
How much did you drink last night?

171
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,540
A little much.

172
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,770
In moderation.

173
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:03,210
I told you to watch what you are drinking so it doesn't affect you the next day. Dong Cheol, you should take care of the sauces today.

174
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:03,730
Yes, Chef.

175
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,940
You manage the ingredients.

176
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,170
We've missed the deadline.

177
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,970
What is that?

178
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,490
Oh, so cute, my friend's baby.

179
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,520
He just turned one and he's running around.

180
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,530
How cute.

181
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,410
He isn't that cute.

182
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:39,050
I can't stand babies and animals. You can't communicate with them.

183
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:42,480
You'd adore a niece or nephew the most if you had one.

184
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,010
Do you want to have one?

185
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,000
Of course, I want one.

186
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,450
But I keep thinking this lately.

187
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:58,900
He's not giving me one because I want one so badly.

188
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,340
Should we drink some coffee? Aren't you craving it?

189
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,530
I'll go brew it, stay here.

190
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:07,810
Oh, what?

191
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,520
 You always answer like that.

192
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,190
 "Oh, what?" Really takes the wind out of people, you know?

193
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,490
Why are you so cranky in the morning?

194
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,620
You stayed up all night again, didn't you?

195
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,170
 You're a ghost.

196
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,130
 Can you make some time to come over today?

197
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,450
To the broadcast station? Why?

198
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:24,810
 We need to film more cuts, besides the highlight, to make the preview.

199
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:27,290
 Oh, yeah. With Bong Seon.

200
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,040
Na Bong Seon?

201
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,460
Can't I go alone?

202
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,840
Me, why?

203
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,670
This car is really nice.

204
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,740
I slept at the sauna last night.

205
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,700
I don't know why there were so many dates, my eyes were so tainted.

206
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,160
I didn't ask.

207
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,780
I'm just saying.

208
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:00,180
But you know that scorched rice dried pollack soup?

209
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,990
Wasn't the timing so perfect for it?

210
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,400
People all think it was your idea.

211
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,810
Don't give it too much thought.

212
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,780
The broadcast already aired, and it wasn't that obvious.

213
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:13,710
If you are trying to get something out of it, it's already over. The end.

214
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:18,400
Seriously, you are so petty.

215
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,640
The filming won't take long, it'll be done in an hour.

216
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,370
Before, when we filmed the title shots,

217
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,550
we were going with the imagery just like last time.

218
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:35,490
You don't have to say any lines, so don't be nervous and cook comfortably.

219
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:38,420
-Bong Seon, you, too.
-Yes.

220
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,300
What is it?

221
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,100
I cut myself.

222
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,230
Ah, sheesh! You should be careful!

223
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:48,230
Why are you so clumsy?

224
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,320
Hey, this is my finger.

225
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,820
If someone saw, they'd think I was stabbed.

226
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:58,740
So, I'm just saying to be more careful and less clumsy.

227
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,850
PD Lee!

228
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,800
I heard you were up all night.

229
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,660
-Hello.
-Hello.

230
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:08,400
You should get some rest, taking naps, too. You're working again right away?

231
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,410
Didn't you say you were going on a business trip to China today?

232
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,550
Ah, that's tomorrow.

233
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,170
Is there anything you need?

234
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,870
I don't like going back and forth in the duty-free shops.

235
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,860
But if you want, I can buy you a present.

236
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:25,200
I'm fine. Just take care of your wife's.

237
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,740
Wife? Wife's?

238
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,230
Why do I have to buy her present? I give her all of my salary.

239
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,480
Don't be like that and just tell me, designer labels...

240
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,320
or at least similar to those, I can buy them for you.

241
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,800
No, on second thought, do you want to come to China?

242
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:45,300
I'll arrange a room and wait, I don't mean anything else, seriously, just think...

243
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,690
Oh, Sunbae!

244
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:50,560
How do you keep flirting with me without getting tired?

245
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,540
With this effort, you would have been able to cheat with other women many times.

246
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,480
I know. There isn't a man like this anymore.

247
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,520
We were in the middle of talking.

248
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,930
You don't seem to have any manners.

249
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,810
Yes,

250
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:08,570
I'm sorry. I beg your pardon.

251
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,570
How scary.

252
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:20,020
Yes, Director, I'm in the next meeting room. I'm on my way.

253
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,150
Why doesn't he have any manners?

254
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:31,460
Don't mind him. He's always like that.

255
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,870
You worked hard, Chef Kang. Bong Seon, you, too.

256
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:35,980
Yes.

257
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:39,350
But, Bong Seon, I think you were made for the camera.

258
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,160
You are so good at acting.

259
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,490
There is another person who is better at that.

260
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,410
- Who?
- What are you talking about?

261
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,190
Nothing. Just something like that.

262
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,440
PD Lee!

263
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,370
Yes, Sunbae?
-Did you happen to see my car keys?

264
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:54,610
Car keys?

265
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,150
I didn't see them. Did you lose them?

266
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,530
Where did they go?

267
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:03,290
I remember parking and putting them in my pockets.

268
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,280
Where did they go?

269
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,770
It's my wife's birthday today and we have plans to go out to dinner.

270
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:11,020
Ah, there's even a flower bouquet in the car.

271
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,130
Let's go together!

272
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,390
Oh.

273
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:17,890
Hey, I'll buy chi(cken)-beer. Eat before you go, Seon Woo. Bong Seon, too.

274
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,600
I'm sure you're hungry since you didn't eat lunch.

275
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,420
-Chi(cken)-beer sounds good.
-What are you talking about?

276
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,900
We have to get to the restaurant.

277
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:30,510
Oh, Chef Kang. The owner needs to leave the restaurant at times to give the workers a chance to breathe.

278
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,330
Just eat before you go! I'm hungry, too.

279
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,190
Oh, you're hungry?

280
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,370
Yeah. I didn't get to eat lunch either.

281
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:39,520
I'll be there after stopping up by my office. Do you want to wait for me at the pub in the front?

282
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,110
Okay.

283
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,880
You like PD Lee, don't you? She's not just a friend, is she?

284
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,340
What?

285
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,630
I could tell everything earlier.

286
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,140
You like her as a woman.

287
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,360
What are you saying?

288
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,980
We've been friends for how many years.

289
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:09,290
If you are going to keep chirping nonsense, just leave.

290
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,980
Okay.

291
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,900
If seems like...It's here!

292
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,290
What?

293
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,860
Then what is this? Huh, huh?

294
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:23,110
I know this not to be yours. Then whose could it be?

295
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,830
What are you doing? Give it here.

296
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:28,690
I'm not sure. I don't know if you have the right to ask for this.

297
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,570
You're not even its owner.

298
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:34,390
Actually, I saw everything earlier. You sneaking this.

299
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,690
Ah, ah, I get it.

300
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,950
Why are you like this, so carelessly?

301
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:43,330
There's no point in stealing this right now.

302
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:47,720
Earlier that Sunbae or whatever, you were mad that he was sticking to PD Lee like gum, right?

303
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,150
That's why you did this, this, on purpose, right?

304
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:53,740
What are you talking about? You're writing fiction. Give it here!

305
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:57,150
Hey! Why are you doing this? Someone who should know better.

306
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,740
What?

307
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,490
It's a negotiation. For you to allow me to sleep in the hall.

308
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:09,900
Where did you learn such awful behavior?

309
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,900
I don't think this is the right timing for you to act like this.

310
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:17,610
If she found out you took this on purpose, PD Lee would think of you so strangely.

311
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,570
This is a crime. Stealing.

312
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,000
What?!

313
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,420
I'm sorry. I was talking with the staff.

314
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,820
But why is everyone standing? Did you order the chicken?

315
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,530
Yes, we ordered it.

316
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:33,370
We should eat, we should eat. It's going to taste so good!

317
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,840
- The chicken here is good.
- That's right.

318
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,400
Why aren't you eating? You've only been drinking water. Are you on a diet?

319
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,880
No, what diet? I'm eating.

320
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,700
Indeed, chicken is the winner.

321
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:56,660
But, you know that Sunbae or whatever he is, did he find his car keys somehow?

322
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,980
No, in the end he had to call someone.

323
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,700
He was going on and on about how much he had to spend.

324
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,100
He should take better care of it, whose fault is it?

325
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:08,620
Seriously, if he wasn't my Sunbae, he's the type I'd want to...  He's a little immature.

326
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,200
He looks that way.

327
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,760
But I don't blame him for getting upset. You said he had to pay a lot.

328
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:21,940
But is there a possibility that someone did it deliberately? Someone who resents him?

329
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,680
Even then who would deliberately do that? So childish.

330
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,520
That's right, it is childish. It's extremely childish.

331
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,100
Could I get some more water please?

332
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:37,730
Since earlier it seems like there is something stuck here in my pocket.

333
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:41,360
Oh, what is it?

334
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,800
It's just a gum wrapper.

335
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:49,330
It seems like there is something else here. There's something.

336
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:52,510
Something big and heavy,

337
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:58,030
- Hey! 
 - Hm? 
 - Earlier, didn't you say you needed to use the restroom?

338
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:00,210
- Hm? Yeah, I did. 
 - Then let's go.

339
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,070
I'll show you where it's at.

340
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:06,210
- I'll be right back. 
 - Okay.

341
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:11,410
What is it? Oh my, oh my!

342
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:14,570
Hey, are you going to keep goofing around?

343
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:18,930
What did I do?

344
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:23,150
Do you actually think this is a card you can play? What are you going to do if I say I just found it?

345
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:26,030
Even if you found it, it's strange that you still have it until now.

346
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,270
When someone is running around like crazy trying to find this.

347
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:33,530
It's not like we didn't see it. Doesn't it look suspicious?

348
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,170
If you have nothing else to say, I'll just go.

349
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:42,330
Wait a moment. Wait a moment... Seriously...

350
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:47,190
You...

351
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,430
It's just until you find another room.

352
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:52,940
Of course. You don't need to say it twice.

353
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,720
Even if you tell me to stay longer, I can't stay.

354
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,690
No! Give me the key.

355
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,490
Ah, the key.

356
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:07,430
But you're not going to go back on your word, right?

357
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,190
Am I you?

358
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,390
This turned out well.

359
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,290
That, that, that...

360
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:21,710
Since when have you liked her? Love at first sight?

361
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:25,910
If that's not it, at some point when you didn't even realize it was happening?

362
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:30,410
So why don't you confess? PD Lee is single you said.

363
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:36,070
I mean, if you're certain of your feelings, having been married once isn't a big deal these days.

364
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:38,630
Just go for her!

365
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:41,970
Why are you saving your heart? If you save it, it just becomes poop.

366
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:46,370
If you hem and haw, some worthless guy will come and...

367
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:48,710
Shut your mouth, or you'll die.

368
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,610
Ah, that charisma.

369
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:53,290
Find a place to stay quickly. I can't stand you for too long.

370
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:58,110
That temper. He must really like her.

371
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:04,520
Of all people, getting caught by Na Bong Seon. What is this, so embarrassing?

372
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:07,840
Seriously!

373
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,610
And now what is that?

374
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,480
Such a good thing as this.

375
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,560
Undoubtedly, whether you're a person or ghost,

376
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:35,480
you have to take advantage of every opportunity.

377
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,700
Are you doing something?

378
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,650
Ah, Chef! Fried rice.

379
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:42,270
After eating just chicken, I had a craving for rice.

380
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,530
I figure I stir up this instant rice.

381
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:49,790
Chef, would you like a taste? It smells amazing.

382
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,250
You go ahead and eat a lot.

383
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,910
Do you really not want any? Even when ghosts eat and die will have colorful outward appearance, they say.

384
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:57,330
Hey, turn down that music. The volume is so loud.

385
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:59,970
It looks really good.

386
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,670
Hey, where are you coming in? Get out.

387
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:19,210
But still when the aroma is throughout, how can I eat alone? Just have a taste.

388
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:22,670
Oh, so this is how your room looks.

389
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:25,990
It's not as clean and tidy as I thought it'd be.

390
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:29,110
You even raise a dog? So totally unexpected.

391
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:33,190
It's noisy. And don't you know I don't eat rice? Hurry up and leave. And take this.

392
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:36,690
So why not? Why does a Korean person not eat rice?

393
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:39,610
Did you get sick after eating rice a long time ago?

394
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:42,930
None of your business! You're bothering me, hurry up and leave.

395
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:47,810
Ah, ah, since I made it, if you change your mind, eat it or not or whatever.

396
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:52,430
Ah, thank you! Good night! Bye!

397
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:59,970
She's definitely not normal, seriously.

398
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:05,650
Sorry, sorry. Sorry.

399
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:08,410
She couldn't even make eye contact before.

400
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:10,700
 As goodwill...Will it kill you to just accept it as goodwill?

401
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,070
  -"Na na?" (informal speech)
- Na na yo? (honorific speech)

402
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:14,590
  Ah, this is nice.

403
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:17,820
 This a negotiation. For you to allow me to sleep in the hall.

404
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:23,510
How can a person change so suddenly? It's a mystery.

405
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:36,290
Is it good? You're crazily eating it, just nuts over it.

406
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:41,240
It's just food.

407
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:48,830
What an array of music styles, seriously.

408
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:51,200
Where did she find such...?

409
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,510
Was it too cold inside the car?

410
00:27:56,510 --> 00:28:00,560
I should get the air-conditioner fixed.

411
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:06,550
Today was a really long day. A long day.

412
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:04,290
Seriously!

413
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:08,260
- Hey! Hey Na Bong! 
 - Yeah?

414
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,480
Are you conducting in your dream or something?

415
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,580
Hurry up and wake up! It's time for the others to get here.

416
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,180
Hurry up and get ready.

417
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,780
It will cause a misunderstanding.

418
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:24,540
With my memory coming back, these dreams.

419
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:31,330
Hey, Bong! What's up? You're at work early and even cleaning.

420
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:34,630
My eyes just opened really early today.

421
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,120
Bong?

422
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,680
Why are you like that? Did you sleep outside?

423
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:43,460
-No, I didn't.
-Hey, Bong, you didn't go home last night, did you?

424
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:46,320
-It's the same clothes as yesterday.
-It isn't.

425
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,200
I don't know how you guys have the time to talk like this with the abalone box inside.

426
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,440
Chef, did you go to the market at dawn? You're so diligent.

427
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,540
What's with flattery mode so early in the morning? Just get ready to open.

428
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,420
Yes, Chef.

429
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,820
Be more careful, please.

430
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:10,220
Yes. I'll keep it a secret. A secret between you and me~

431
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:14,070
Carefully, carefully, carefully...

432
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:16,480
Carefully, I can't get caught.

433
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,660
Oh, the stress. My head hurts, too.

434
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:26,280
I think I'm getting a cold. They say that dogs don't even catch a cold in the summer.

435
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:41,730
Allex...Marche, Marche, Fente!

436
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:45,050
Wow, our sous chef's form is amazing.

437
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:48,350
I thought we're in Korea National Training Center (Taereung). Look at this, right here.

438
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,630
Look at these lean muscles.

439
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:55,570
You're not from a shaolin temple, right?

440
00:30:56,570 --> 00:31:00,770
Wow, Bruce Lee is here! Bruce Lee!

441
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:03,970
Hey, hey, hey, look at this. Look at this. Look at this.

442
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:09,310
These fine muscles are no joke, right? They're like muscles earned from being in actual fights, right?

443
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:13,370
It's different from muscles that you get from working out in the gym.

444
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:16,570
Sous chef, there aren't any chives.

445
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:21,170
Chives? Oh that's right, Chef said it got left out of the order and to buy some.

446
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:24,210
We need chives because our special is a Manila clam pasta.

447
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,590
Should I at least go to the market now and buy some?

448
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:29,570
Cordon, you should get some lessons on flexibility from somewhere.

449
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:33,910
Are chives the main menu? Do you need to put some on top of the Manila clams?

450
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:36,270
What are you saving the green onions for?

451
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:40,710
You are so smart.

452
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:42,510
Should I get the green onions ready, Sous chef?

453
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:46,110
This is what they call being spontaneous. This is why experience is important. Got it?

454
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,630
Yes, Sous Chef.

455
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:49,270
- Ji Woong.
-  Yes.

456
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:52,010
What about the green onions?

457
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,810
Today, on top of the Manila clams,

458
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:59,190
what do you think of putting green onions on top in place of the chives. I think the variation would work.

459
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:01,510
You didn't buy the chives today, did you?

460
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:04,690
-No, Chef.
-Good job.

461
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:08,330
Someone who cooks uses just anything with the same color?

462
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:13,070
Why don't you go pick some weeds and use them? Where did she go?

463
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:18,630
Yes? What is it? Do you have thing to tell me, like a secret?

464
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:23,810
Please tell her to go buy some chives.

465
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:27,670
Be quiet and go hurry up and buy some chives.

466
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:30,310
Chives? Yes.

467
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:32,550
- Hurry! 
 - I'm going!

468
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:37,460
Where is the chives store?

469
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,930
Chives?

470
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,620
- Ahjumma.
- Yes?

471
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,350
I want to make bean sprouts soup.

472
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,840
Give me about 2 dollars worth of the bean sprouts.

473
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,390
They look nice.

474
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:54,050
Not this, but this next to it. The ones that are short and have long roots.

475
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:56,130
These are used for soups.

476
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:59,980
It's been a while.

477
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:03,160
The long ones like these are used for steamed monkfish.

478
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,400
Oh, is that right?

479
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,450
You must have good eyes since you are a famous cook.

480
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:10,440
Thank you.

481
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,040
It's nothing.

482
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:16,950
I don't know if you feel burdened because I didn't mind my business.

483
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:19,970
No, what do you mean I feel burdened?

484
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,810
But you must be here to buy ingredients too.

485
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:24,890
I'm not here to play.

486
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,660
You must have bought lot of things.

487
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,950
Yes, this and that...

488
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,590
Do you want my help?

489
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:33,310
You will feel burdened by this too, right?

490
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,150
It's here.

491
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:39,230
Thank you. Here is the two dollars.

492
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:41,480
Oh, yes.

493
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:43,710
- Good bye.
- Thank you.

494
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,060
Come in.

495
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,420
Thank you.

496
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:53,170
Wait a moment.

497
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,650
Have this.

498
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:02,850
I'll drink it since you gave it to me.

499
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:07,110
I don't feel burdened by something like this.

500
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,770
I got it, so stop.

501
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:13,030
I'm sorry.

502
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,280
About what?

503
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,720
You are saying that you felt hurt by my words.

504
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:26,060
You hold grudges for a long time, like someone I know.

505
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,880
Who?

506
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,690
My daughter.

507
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:33,070
She had a easygoing personality and was like the leader.

508
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:36,050
When she got angry, she held grudges for a long time.

509
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:41,350
She wanted to get a perm. I told her to go later since we're busy, but she got angry.

510
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,990
What's the big deal with the perm? I should have just let her get it when she wanted to.

511
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:55,000
Whenever I see you, I keep talking about my daughter. I'm sorry.

512
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,640
I felt bad

513
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:01,530
that you weren't going to come back because of what happened.

514
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:06,510
Why would I not come? I would at least come to eat.

515
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,490
Give it to me. I will put it back.

516
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:13,330
Do you still drink a lot of alcohol?

517
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:17,290
When I'm bored, I just drink alone for a snack.

518
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:21,720
This can't do. Drink with me from now on.

519
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,270
Don't drink alone.

520
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:24,010
What?

521
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:27,880
Even if you say that this is burdensome, I can't let this go.

522
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,970
You can only drink soju with me.

523
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:32,840
Okay? Promise.

524
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,720
Stamp.

525
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:38,390
I don't know if that's possible.

526
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:40,110
But okay, for now.

527
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:43,080
You promised. So you have to keep it.

528
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,030
We are drinking buddies now.

529
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,360
Okay, I got it.

530
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,910
You should go now.

531
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:50,030
Chives.

532
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,780
- I'll be on my way.
- Be careful.

533
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,280
Okay.

534
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,210
  Korean Food

535
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:06,650
You are here again? Why did you come today?

536
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:10,290
If you don't like that, go help out your father.

537
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:12,390
Fine, tell me honestly.

538
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:15,010
Does it look like my father has something?

539
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,640
You must think he's a rich man.

540
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,320
No, you are totally wrong.

541
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,590
We pay rent here, just barely.

542
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:25,290
Seriously! Do you only have poop in your head?

543
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:27,070
Bad!

544
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,110
Bad?

545
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:32,100
Don't talk informally to me. Do you want to die?

546
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,250
This bastard, seriously.

547
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:39,940
Why do you keep stopping by our house then?

548
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:42,800
Is it perhaps me?

549
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:46,020
It's me, it's me.

550
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,270
No wonder.

551
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:51,740
I really don't like hurting girls,

552
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,360
but it seems like I'm going to make another one cry.

553
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:01,710
- Two specials for Table 6. Just one vongole pasta, right?

554
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:04,490
Min Soo, make the special.

555
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:09,430
Dong Cheol, bake the vongole.

556
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:13,000
Why me? Are you not feeling well?

557
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,640
Why did you catch summer cold, when dogs don't even get it?

558
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,990
Go in and rest. We will do it.

559
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:20,790
Look at how sick you look.

560
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:25,250
Once this is done, clean up and prepare the ingredients for the dinner.

561
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:26,880
Yes, Chef.

562
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,610
Take out the shiitake mushroom and put it back in the refrigerator.

563
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:32,650
Yes, Chef.

564
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:37,240
Control the water in the dough. Since it's summer, think about the temperature.

565
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,520
Yes, Chef.

566
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,940
And salt...

567
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:45,470
Go in and rest. We will take care of it.

568
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,060
Open up the back door to send out the virus.

569
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,860
It seems like you have a fever too.

570
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,510
Isn't it better to go to the hospital?

571
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:57,290
I have medicine. I just have to sleep after eating it.

572
00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:01,850
Then you should just rest today and let Min Soo take care of the dinner.

573
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:03,760
Let me see.

574
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,110
I'll leave it in your care. Close out the POS (point-of-sale register)at the end of the day.

575
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:48,570
What?

576
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:51,920
 Again. There you go again with "what". I'm going to just hang up.

577
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,210
Okay, I'm sorry. What is it?

578
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:55,810
 Did you catch a cold?

579
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:58,520
 Why is your voice like that? Your voice is gone.

580
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,150
Yeah...

581
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,250
 You were okay yesterday.

582
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:10,090
 Did you eat medicine? Do you want me to buy you some porridge?

583
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:12,620
Can you come?

584
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:15,090
  No, I have so much editing to do.

585
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:19,910
  The Director looked at the edited version and kept saying that the colors are too dark or the lighting isn't good enough.

586
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:22,760
  What does he expect us to do now?

587
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:27,880
  So we are changing next week's set, so filming is going to be delayed for around two hours.

588
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,120
  But are you really sick?

589
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:34,360
No, no. I got it then.

590
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,220
Okay, hang up.

591
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:03,630
They must have gone somewhere else. That's a relief.

592
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:07,810
But this place is the most comfortable.

593
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:13,260
But is Chef really sick?

594
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,670
It's not good to eat medicine on empty stomach.

595
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:18,580
Should I get him porridge?

596
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:21,960
No, why would I?

597
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:27,760
Minding other people's business is also a disease. I'm so tired.

598
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:43,410
Chef, are you very sick?

599
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,870
Chef.

600
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,770
He must really be sick.

601
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,730
Chef.

602
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:02,820
Hey, Chef.

603
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,460
Hey, Chef!

604
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:08,470
You should at least eat porridge and then eat medicine.

605
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:11,810
If you have an empty stomach, you can't get better.

606
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:13,380
Chef.

607
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,900
Look at how he's sweating.

608
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,290
He has a fever too.

609
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:24,640
What should I do?

610
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:30,000
Chef, try the porridge.

611
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,260
Chef! He's awake!

612
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:36,130
Chef! I brought porridge.

613
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:40,130
Eat this...  Eat this and eat medicine again.

614
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:43,370
I'll leave it here so eat it.

615
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:46,860
  and if something happens, call me, okay?

616
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,160
What is it?

617
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:59,000
Does your head hurt?

618
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Should I bring a wet towel?

619
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,150
What is this?

620
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:44,970
What?

621
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:46,610
- What is this?
- What do you mean?

622
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:49,080
How are you here? How did you get in here.

623
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:53,960
I brought some porridge for you,

624
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:58,220
but suddenly you did that to me. Don't you remember?

625
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:05,420
- Get out.
- What?

626
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,020
Get out.

627
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:15,330
- I just thought that it would hurt if you eat medicine on an empty stomach.
- Get out quickly.

628
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:17,660
- Get out quickly.
- Why are you like this all of the sudden? What is this?

629
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:20,930
- Get out quickly.
- Why are you like this? My shoes!

630
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:22,830
- Wear these.
- I can't understand this situation.

631
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:25,060
- Get out quickly.
- Wait a moment. Why are you like this?

632
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,810
Oh my, oh my, oh my...

633
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:32,250
He is the one who did it! Why is he getting mad at me?

634
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:33,930
Wait a moment.

635
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:36,590
I just did it with him, right?

636
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:38,900
But why is he unaffected?

637
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:44,490
How can I...

638
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:47,540
Kang Seon Woo, you crazy bastard.

639
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:52,560
- What is it? 
- Are you okay?

640
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,220
What?

641
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:58,280
Is your heart racing, or your temperature dropping

642
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,270
so you are freezing... Are you okay?

643
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:03,220
I'm okay, I'm okay. Just leave. Please just leave.

644
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,790
- Are you okay?
- Just leave!

645
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:07,140
Are you really okay?

646
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:11,010
You are really okay, right? There is nothing wrong with your body, right?

647
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:13,300
Oh my! You are really okay?

648
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:16,870
Open the door.

649
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:24,540
Ahjumma, just 10 minutes. I will find someone. Just give me 10 minutes!

650
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,590
I'm right, right?

651
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:28,820
I think you're right.

652
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:30,850
That's right! It seems like it, right?

653
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:33,190
I found my virile man!

654
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:36,520
I can be done being this dreaded virgin ghost and leave!

655
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,530
Aigoo!

656
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:06,030
Hey, Bong!

657
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:07,500
What are you doing?

658
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,410
Do you want to throw me away too?

659
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:11,540
Oh, I'm sorry.

660
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:15,230
It's fine. It feels nice and cool.

661
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:17,140
I'm sorry.

662
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:20,920
But is Chef not awake yet? Shouldn't somebody go see him?

663
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,220
He wasn't feeling well yesterday.

664
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,650
That's right. I will go up and check on him.

665
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:26,270
No, I will go up.

666
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:28,560
Chef! Did you go to a market?

667
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,140
You should have just skipped for today. You're not even feeling well...Give it to me.

668
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:33,830
That's fine. The meat came today. Just get that.

669
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:36,080
Chef, are you feeling okay?

670
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,550
I'm fine.

671
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:40,580
It doesn't seem like you are just fine. Your condition looks great.

672
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,170
It seemed like you were dying yesterday.

673
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:44,920
Did something good happen overnight?

674
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:48,250
What do you mean?

675
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:50,660
Just go outside and get the meat.

676
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:22,510
What?

677
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:26,270
Why?

678
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:30,490
Okay, I admit it. Yesterday...

679
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:34,410
It was my mistake. I'm sorry. It's my fault.

680
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:36,400
What is?

681
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:40,460
What happened yesterday.

682
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:43,950
I was high on medicine and felt drowsy...

683
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:48,530
Anyways, it was my mistake, so I will apologize.

684
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:54,180
I don't want things to become awkward, so

685
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,110
don't put too much meaning behind what happened.

686
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:59,920
Nothing changed between us, okay?

687
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:20,680
- What are you doing? 
- Wait a moment.

688
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,030
- Why did you come in here?
- Wait a moment.

689
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:23,930
- Why are you like this?
- Wait, don't wear this.

690
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:25,220
Why are you like this?

691
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:27,690
- Are you crazy?
- Wait a moment.

692
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:29,780
Hey, hey!

693
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,760
- Wait a moment.
- Hey!

694
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,530
Are you really crazy?

695
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:36,290
Yes, yes. Just think that I'm crazy. That would be easier for you.

696
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:38,480
This, seriously!

697
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,690
I have a favor to ask. Can you do it for me?

698
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:43,840
I really want you to do it for me.

699
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,200
A favor?

700
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,560
What favor?

701
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,240
With me...

702
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,440
Just do it with me, just once.

703
00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:01,070
Dang it!

704
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:05,130
Work faster! It's raining.

705
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:11,310
What?

706
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:13,370
Yes, what you are thinking about right now.

707
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:15,710
What am I thinking of right now?

708
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:18,810
Why are you asking me that? It's not like you don't know!

709
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:20,500
You, seriously!

710
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,560
Wait a moment. You are an adult, and this kid...

711
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:28,030
No, I'm an adult. And yesterday was like a sample!

712
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:30,520
So under our agreement,

713
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:34,370
so let's just do it once... It's really not a big deal!

714
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:37,500
Be quiet! I think you are really crazy.

715
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,040
- Go to a hospital right. Get out. 
- No, wait a moment.

716
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,240
Come out!

717
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:45,050
I didn't finish talking! Just once!

718
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:47,920
Chef, just once!

719
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,500
I really have a reason.

720
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,630
I don't even expect twice. Just once! Just once!

721
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:54,500
Seriously!

722
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,960
What are you?

723
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,330
Do you think this situation makes sense?

724
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:01,910
How does a girl like you have no pride? Do what?

725
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:04,390
Yes, I don't need pride or anything like that.

726
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:06,450
So just close your eyes once

727
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:10,360
and just once... It's not like you will use up your body by doing it just once.

728
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,680
Wow, look at the way she talks.

729
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:16,120
What are you? Were you always this kind of person?

730
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,640
- Are you a gold digger? 
- No.

731
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,120
Did you plan to come at me yesterday?

732
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,440
No! That's not it!

733
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:26,330
Yes, I already know that you like somebody else.

734
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:28,430
But let me just ask you this favor.

735
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:32,020
Can you just think of it as a present? Just once, once!

736
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:36,380
Hey, why didn't you clean the dishes well? Na Bong, hurry up!

737
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:40,510
Chef, seriously, just once. I really ask you.

738
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:42,770
- Dishes...
- Just once!

739
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:45,420
Please...

740
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,830
Why is she asking Chef?

741
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:49,520
Is she asking him to pre-pay her?

742
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:54,490
- Is she asking for a vacation?
- Chef's expressions are weird.

743
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:58,500
- Please.
- Slice the potatoes thinly.

744
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:02,660
Just once!

745
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:06,400
Just once!

746
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:17,410
Try this pancake.

747
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:23,010
I brought this pancake... Oh my, the cushion is so nice.

748
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:26,020
The chair over there is so hard.

749
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:30,350
This place is so nice.

750
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:32,790
Wait a moment! Wait!

751
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:36,650
I wanted to eat the pancakes together!

752
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:40,640
Wait a moment!

753
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:51,490
Be quiet!

754
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:54,860
Be quiet! Just once!

755
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:57,450
Be quiet!

756
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:30,400
- You surprised me!
- Just once!

757
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,180
- When did you get in here?
- A while ago.

758
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:33,780
Really?

759
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:36,580
Then sleep here.

760
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:40,290
I will sleep somewhere else.

761
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:43,320
- Chef, Chef, Chef!
- I will.

762
00:51:48,790 --> 00:51:51,530
What does he expect me to do by myself?

763
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:58,670
Who is it?

764
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:05,060
Is it Seon Woo? Why are you here so late at night?

765
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:06,280
 Please open the door.

766
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,370
Oh, oh, okay.

767
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:10,510
What's up with him?

768
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:15,080
Oh.

769
00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:18,950
Son! You should have told me that you are coming today.

770
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:22,210
I would have brought out the bed sheet and clean your room.

771
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:25,000
You always sleep at the store and never came home.

772
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,940
This can't do.

773
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:29,210
Ow! Mom!

774
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:30,820
I have to open the window.

775
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:32,590
I'm just going to sleep and leave, so don't worry.

776
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:34,320
Did you eat? Are you hungry?

777
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,720
Do you want me to make you something?

778
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:40,510
Oh, I can't cook.

779
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:44,640
Then sleep. If you need anything, let me know.

780
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:50,920
- What?
- Sleep after washing up.

781
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,730
Mom!

782
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:55,750
I just want to sleep.

783
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:58,580
Okay.

784
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:05,740
- Oppa is here?
- Yeah.

785
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:09,570
What's up with him? He may stop by, but never slept here.

786
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:12,240
That's right. Isn't it strange?

787
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:16,690
Even if I was dying, he just stayed at the restaurant.

788
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:19,050
How is he at the restaurant now?

789
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:22,720
Just that his condition isn't great.

790
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:28,760
Mom, don't you know what time it is?

791
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:34,410
Oh, it's me, Jo Hye Yeong.

792
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:36,880
Wake up.

793
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,220
It's about my son.

794
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:43,750
He is doing something that he never done before.

795
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,570
Really?

796
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:49,960
That's right. He doesn't have to be there in person, right?

797
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,440
Okay, I got it. I will go tomorrow.

798
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:53,830
Okay.

799
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:56,020
Is it that Seonbinggo person?

800
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:57,080
Yeah.

801
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,950
I think we have to hold an ancestral memorial service.

802
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:04,880
Why does it bother me that he is attracting ghosts? He already has a difficult life.

803
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,190
Come with me tomorrow.

804
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:09,240
Me too?

805
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:12,680
We can ask about the baby too. That's good. Let's go.

806
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:16,440
Just tell Oppa that you are going to a hospital with me.

807
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:20,200
No.

808
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,500
It's a ghost.

809
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,880
Okay, I got it, so take care of your business well.

810
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,130
Don't worry about me. Okay.

811
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:41,440
Eun Hee must be late.

812
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,500
Where did you sleep yesterday?

813
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,720
Why do you care where I sleep?

814
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:48,410
It's not that I care, but I'm just curious.

815
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,510
I can be at least curious about that.

816
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:52,460
Be quiet.

817
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:55,850
I'm going to sew up your mouth.

818
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:02,110
That man isn't easy. I have to do something quick.

819
00:55:02,110 --> 00:55:06,550
Hey, Bong! I think you should clean the lounge. The floor is really dirty.

820
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:07,900
Oh, okay.

821
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:10,410
Bong?

822
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:12,820
Why is your face so red?

823
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:13,880
Did you drink in the morning?

824
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,040
No.

825
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,700
Do you have a fever?

826
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:22,220
Hey, you have a fever! You must have caught a cold.

827
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:26,740
Cold? Me? No way.

828
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:34,970
Darn it.

829
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:36,440
Darn it?

830
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:39,320
Oh, that's right. He gave it to me!

831
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:41,310
What? From whom?

832
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:47,030
There is a person. A man with a lot of energy. He never did it for me, but only gave me a cold...Seriously!

833
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:49,130
He has no conscience.

834
00:55:49,130 --> 00:55:50,850
Who is that man?

835
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:52,490
I don't know.

836
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:56,190
Does she have a relative with the last name Yang? She doesn't have a relative.

837
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:58,250
But what did he not do for her?

838
00:55:58,250 --> 00:55:59,940
I don't know.

839
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:06,320
But that Yang man didn't do what Bong asked him and gave her a cold instead.

840
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,820
That's not right.

841
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:12,910
I don't know who he is, but he is so shameless! That bastard.

842
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:14,610
Hey, Bong.

843
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:16,690
Why is your face like that? Did you have a drink?

844
00:56:16,690 --> 00:56:21,390
No, I caught a cold. I got it from someone.

845
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:24,380
Do you need money?

846
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:25,580
What?

847
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:27,870
It seemed like you asked Chef to pre-pay you.

848
00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:32,630
If it comes to it, ask me. I will let you borrow some money less than one thousand dollars.

849
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:38,420
That Cordon.... I want him.

850
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:43,740
What should I do? Should I try again?

851
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:46,520
  Bodhisatva's House

852
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:56,270
Wait, the ancestral memorial service is effective, right? You said your condition wasn't good nowadays.

853
00:56:56,270 --> 00:57:01,410
It doesn't matter. I just have to try my best.

854
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:06,420
The spirit is the one who does it for me, so don't worry.

855
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:09,670
Okay. I only trust you.

856
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:12,870
You should trust me.

857
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:17,160
Why are there so many types of bills? You should have just brought fifty dollar bills...You probably brought the right amount of money.

858
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:18,070
It's right.

859
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:23,370
Then I'll find an another date.

860
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:27,460
Give me your husband's Four Pillars of Destiny. It's been three years since you married him, right?

861
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:28,980
Yes.

862
00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:34,460
The hospital said it's possible, but she hasn't been able to get pregnant.

863
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:37,260
I got her herbal medicine and everything.

864
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,430
This is too cold.

865
00:57:40,430 --> 00:57:42,930
It's cold? You should turn off the air conditioner.

866
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:45,920
Not me! Your husband's Four Pillars of Destiny!

867
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,730
He is the only island outside far away from land.

868
00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:53,550
Since he is blossoming up high in the mountain, there is no one looking at him.

869
00:57:53,550 --> 00:57:57,300
Since he is getting rained on in bad weather, all the petals are falling off.

870
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,470
This is strange.

871
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:01,630
What is?

872
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:05,580
No matter how much I look at this, it says that he will live alone his whole life. How did he get married?

873
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:09,240
He doesn't have any parent luck or children luck.

874
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:13,060
His life is so lonely and difficult.

875
00:58:13,610 --> 00:58:17,070
How did he meet such a good woman?

876
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:20,870
So are you saying that she can get pregnant or not?

877
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:26,060
Why are you so skinny? Eat some food!

878
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:30,570
Get your mind together and endure with the strength of food.

879
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:34,580
Why are you bringing up food while looking at Four Pillars of Destiny?

880
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:41,720
I'm hungry. Let's eat. How about boodae stew?

881
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:53,150

882
00:58:56,790 --> 00:59:00,320
Yes, we'll go over after taking care of one civil complaint at a neighborhood alley.

883
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:03,680
That dog... You didn't get bitten, right?

884
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,460
Yes, I'm okay.

885
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:09,340
If you get hurt, Chef Kang will murder me.

886
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:13,010
He loves his brother-in-law.

887
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:16,550
Because of that dog, I can't patrol. Let's go.

888
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:24,270
  Second-hand Shop

889
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:41,720
He locked it? You think I didn't expect this?

890
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:46,980
I came prepared. I'm so sweaty.

891
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:49,090
I first have to go to the tiger's cave.

892
00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:54,340
I have to go in first to eat or be eaten. That way something can happen.

893
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:59,160
But why isn't this working? I saw in movies that this worked well.

894
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:00,700
I think a bobby pin will work better.

895
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:02,910
I don't have a bobby pin.

896
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:12,690
Wait a moment... That's not it.

897
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:16,150
- Arm, arm, arm! 
- Come over here.

898
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:18,190
This kid, really!

899
01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:23,870
You are too much. They said that guys can do it even without liking that person. Why are you acting so expensive?

900
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:28,250
I told you that I have a reason.

901
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:31,060
Fine, tell me. What is the reason?

902
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:36,540
I really can't tell you yet.

903
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:40,190
So I will tell you when the crucial moment comes.

904
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:44,440
What promise? You can't think of anything because you are trying to make up something all of the sudden, right?

905
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:48,370
I'm really warning you. If you keep doing that, you can't work here.

906
01:00:48,370 --> 01:00:51,430
I can't make any scandals at work. Stop dreaming.

907
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:55,600
Is it because of PD Lee? If so, I will keep it a secret.

908
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:58,930
I got a cold because of you! See, I'm telling the truth!

909
01:00:58,930 --> 01:01:04,130
That's enough...Seriously, try to come into my room again. I will chase you out.

910
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:09,850
Just touch it once! I'm not kidding! I'm going to die. It really hurts.

911
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:15,270
I'm not lying. It's so hot. It's so hot.

912
01:01:15,270 --> 01:01:18,240
How can he be so cold?

913
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:21,340
The freezer...

914
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:37,740
  Seon Woo, how are you feeling? If you are feeling better, call me.

915
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:44,780
What is this? Why isn't this coming out?

916
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:48,760
Huh?

917
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,070
I'm getting so hot, seriously.

918
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:06,720
I've never been this hot for a long time.

919
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:11,340
It's so hard. I can't do it anymore.

920
01:02:48,370 --> 01:02:50,340
Ow, my head.

921
01:02:58,830 --> 01:03:03,600
Was there a malfunction? Why is it like this?

922
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,870
  So Hyeong

923
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:18,490
It keeps getting in my head. Is she really sick?

924
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:26,290
What? Did I just come out?

925
01:03:32,530 --> 01:03:35,780
What? I really came out.

926
01:03:40,330 --> 01:03:43,580
This is a shitty timing.

927
01:03:46,810 --> 01:03:49,770
Hey! Na Bong Seon!

928
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,210
Hey! You, seriously!

929
01:03:58,210 --> 01:04:02,980
Hey, hey! Bong Seon! Get your grip together! You were serious?

930
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:07,770
Hey! Get your grip together! Na Bong!

931
01:04:07,770 --> 01:04:12,220
Na Bong Seon!

932
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:17,170
Na Bong Seon! Wake up! Hey!

933
01:04:35,230 --> 01:04:39,480
 Oh my Ghostess 
 ~Preview~

934
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:41,770
  Oh My Ghostess 
 Preview

935
01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:45,690
  I look weird, and I don't remember but people keep saying

936
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:47,290
  I did something...

937
01:04:47,290 --> 01:04:49,460
  She doesn't have anywhere else to go...Where did she go?

938
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:52,160
  I took her to the hospital and paid for the fee. How can I be nicer to her?

939
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:55,020
  What's the point if he is right in front of me? I can't even touch his fingers.

940
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:56,870
 I was taking her from the resident protection center to the police station and

941
01:04:56,870 --> 01:04:57,770
  I brought her back.

942
01:04:57,770 --> 01:05:01,190
  Unlike her usual self, she began to talk a lot or have sexual curiosity.

943
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:02,710
 Oh, that's right. Sexual curiosity.

944
01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:05,030
  Na Bong Seon!

945
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:10,650
  Don't come out in front of me! Just leave me alone!
