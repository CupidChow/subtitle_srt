1
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,000
 Oh My Ghostess

2
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:19,990

3
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,050
 Episode 16

4
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,020
Look at all the dust.

5
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,540
For someone who courts deities, the place of worship is so dusty.

6
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,380
Even if I'm punished thousand times, it wouldn't be enough.

7
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:57,500
Dear deities, I've committed a sin.

8
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,300
- Unni. 
 - Wait a second.

9
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,560
I have to change it or redo the interior. To start anew.

10
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,450
Unni.

11
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:13,360
Why do you keep calling me when I'm trying to beautify the environment?

12
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,540
Today is the day.

13
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,820
The day it will be three years for me.

14
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,100
I have to say goodbye and leave.

15
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,540
I know, girl. I have eyes to see the calendar, too.

16
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,380
Unni, you're now the best in eternal truth.

17
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:38,380
Because of me you've lived liked the most wretched of beggars, now your business will do well.

18
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:43,720
Of course. Finally I can be rich and sit on a cushion made of money.

19
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:50,120
Do you feel free and easy? How does it feel?

20
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,640
Well, I've resolved my resentment...

21
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,640
it's only that I have lingering attachments.

22
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,640
In this world, is there a cool ghost without any lingering attachments?

23
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,860
Please go up safely. You worked hard.

24
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,380
Be well.

25
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,360
Go safely. Since I'm getting old,

26
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,260
tears come even if I'm not sad.

27
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,440
Go safely.

28
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,730
Why are you doing that?

29
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,890
Oh, today is the day.

30
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,860
The rice is ready. Go eat.

31
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,480
Yes, Father.

32
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:15,220
It's because if I prepare it in advance like this, I wonder if she'll come a little earlier.

33
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,560
Yes, hello?

34
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,340
Ah, yes, I'm Shin Soon Ae's father.

35
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,460
The police station?

36
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:40,620
She was going to report a hit-and-run accident that she witnessed, but Choi Seong Jae who committed the hit-and-run,

37
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,440
caused her to die.

38
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,060
So, so, what you mean is,

39
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:54,120
what you're saying is that my Soon Ae,

40
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,180
-Soon Ae didn't commit suicide?
-Yes, it was murder.

41
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:04,860
I'm a bit ashamed to tell you this now, but the suicide was set-up so well to be certain.

42
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,680
Elder sir, are you okay? Hey, Detective Shin!

43
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:37,040
How...

44
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,520
How scared must you have been?

45
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,890
I didn't even know that.

46
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,140
 Ahjussi!

47
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:51,180
 I'm always sorry and thankful to Officer Choi every day.

48
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,910
Your father,

49
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,760
Your father was so stupid,

50
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,060
to the enemy who killed his daughter,

51
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,000
fed him warm meals...

52
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,120
Are you okay?

53
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,060
Ahjussi! Ahjussi!

54
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:36,230
But my grandmother can't get used to me. She said my voice has gone up and that it doesn't sound like me.

55
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:41,260
She kept insisting that I was possessed again by the same ghost from before.

56
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:46,160
So in order to certify that I'm her granddaughter, I had to recite even our address.

57
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,500
Isn't my grandmother really funny?

58
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,900
Why? Can you not believe it either? Am I too noisy?

59
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,680
Don't try so hard. I'm much better now.

60
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,180
Really? Are you really okay now?

61
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,440
To a certain extent.

62
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:07,940
At first, I couldn't accept reality.

63
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:12,240
But I have to pull myself together because I have Eun Hee and my mother.

64
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,540
And for you, you have me.

65
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,380
-I'm going to protect Chef.
-My goodness!

66
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,960
Now you even know how to boast.

67
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,160
Well, a boast apprentice sprouted from the bravado master that's all. But I still have a long way to go compared to him.

68
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,200
Goodness. You've grown a lot.

69
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,420
I raised myself a tiger. A tiger.

70
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,100
Wait a second.

71
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,280
What is this?

72
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,320
Oh, Kyung Mo.

73
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,020
Father.

74
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,000
The door is wide open, where did he go?

75
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,100
I heard this owner collapsed again.

76
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:01,100
I know. I saw his son running out. What's going on?

77
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:05,560
Life, I tell you...

78
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,520
I should have stopped him when he was going to the police station.

79
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,380
You're an idiot. Good-for-nothing glutton.

80
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:17,980
Why are you alive? You should just go and die!

81
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:22,290
Kyung Mo, it's not your fault.

82
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:26,240
Doctor, how is his condition?

83
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,860
Shock is like a poison to a cirrhosis patient.

84
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,460
On top of that when he fainted, he had a stroke.

85
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,680
I think you should prepare yourselves.

86
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,080
Hey, hey.

87
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,580
Father, it's because of me, isn't it?

88
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,180
You were shocked because of me, weren't you?

89
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,160
I'm such a bad daughter.

90
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,720
I hurt you so much when I died.

91
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,660
Even when I'm dead, I'm only causing you shock.

92
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,280
I'm sorry.

93
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,960
I'm sorry.

94
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,320
I was wrong a hundred, a thousand times, so please wake up.

95
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,880
Please wake up, Father.

96
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,940
-He's in arrest.
-Prepare the paddles.

97
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,180
Father. You can't! Father!

98
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,620
One, two, three!

99
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,780
Please save him!

100
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,580
250 joule.

101
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,420
Father!

102
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:06,220
One, two, three!

103
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,160
Nothing.

104
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,580
Father.

105
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,460
You can't, Father.

106
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,760
My Soon Ae.

107
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,460
You can't pass here.

108
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,100
You can't go.

109
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,320
Soon Ae.

110
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:52,560
Father, you have to stay longer. What about Kyung Mo?

111
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,820
Stay longer before you come.

112
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:00,220
Watch Kyung Mo get married. And see your grandchildren.

113
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,920
And let's meet again after that.

114
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:09,160
When we meet later, let's live happily then.

115
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,100
I'll be born as your daughter again.

116
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,600
Soon Ae.

117
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,910
Father, Father.

118
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:08,090
Doctor! My father opened his eyes! Nurse!

119
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:10,970
Over here.

120
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,250
 -He just now opened his eyes?
-Yes.

121
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,290
 Check his breathing and pulse.

122
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,010
 Hospital

123
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:26,430
I told you to go eat.

124
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:30,910
I'm fine. Will I die if I eat a little late today?

125
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,360
I'm fine now.

126
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,030
Go eat and come back. Why starve yourself?

127
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,160
I said that I'm fine.

128
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,700
I'm not going to leave your side by even one step.

129
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:53,100
Father. But, I really thought you were going to die this time, and I resented Noona a lot.

130
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:59,200
I felt like she was taking you from me because she was lonely.

131
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,940
It's the opposite of that, kid.

132
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,560
 What?

133
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:12,380
 Your sister saved my life.

134
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:16,260
Soon Ae sent me back here.

135
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,840
What are you talking about? Did you dream?

136
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:25,530
 I'm not sure.  If it was a dream or what. It felt so real.

137
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:32,800
She doesn't appear even in my dreams, but she appeared just like she was.

138
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,990
She told me to come back later.

139
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:46,070
To watch you get married and see my grandchildren. And then to come.

140
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:51,320
She did? I better deep bow to her out of gratitude.

141
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:57,100
I'm not sure if it's because I saw her even in that way,

142
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,460
my body even feels refreshed and my mood is better, too.

143
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:09,880
When today is that day. I couldn't even prepare a memorial table.

144
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,320
What did I do right?

145
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,440
She'll understand.

146
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:19,060
Father, I'll do better now.

147
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:23,290
I am going to try living diligently now. You'll be really shocked.

148
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:27,160
My goodness, please do that.

149
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,150
It's good even just hearing you say that.

150
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,150
You came?

151
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,920
Hi.

152
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:51,240
It's today. The day that it becomes three years.

153
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,190
Then,

154
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,290
I have to go now.

155
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,510
Thanks, Na Bong Seon.

156
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,240
I'm really sorry, too.

157
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:21,850
I think it was fate you coming to me.

158
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:25,850
You solved the mystery of your death.

159
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:29,140
And I got one step closer to Chef.

160
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:38,830
Chef's heart is in pain, but he learned the truth about Eun Hee's accident.

161
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,240
I guess so, after hearing it.

162
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:53,110
You, too. You're no longer the hunched over Na Bong Seon.

163
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,800
You got a lot stronger.

164
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,390
You'll live well.

165
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:11,840
Watch over me from above. I'll live the best I can.

166
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,450
Okay.

167
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:18,920
Love a lot while you can, Na Bong Seon.

168
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:27,160
I'm going to go up and meet a more amazing man than Chef and live for a thousand years.

169
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:32,220
It must be nice. I envy you.

170
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:51,630
Wait a second. What about Chef? Aren't you going to say a last goodbye?

171
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:58,180
Why? He doesn't even recognize me.

172
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,580
Here.

173
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:09,600
Possess me. This is your last time.

174
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:19,500
No. I don't want to see him a last time.

175
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:25,110
This is my last time lending my body to a ghost, too.

176
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,310
Hurry.

177
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,410
No, I don't think this is right still.

178
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:48,550
I have to get ready to open the restaurant. I can't keep it closed it too long.

179
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,600
 Will you be okay? Shouldn't you take some more time off?

180
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,770
I think it will be better working.

181
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:56,950
I'm thinking of sending Eun Hee and my mom to the US.

182
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:01,860
To get some tests done and to use that excuse to visit there.

183
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,520
 Good job.

184
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:09,270
 Seon Woo, call me whenever you need. I'll buy you a drink. I'm your good friend, aren't I?

185
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:13,710
Okay, thanks, So Hyeong. I'll call you.

186
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,800
You came?

187
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,350
Is Ahjussi doing better?

188
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,760
Why are you staring at me, you're embarrassing me.

189
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,070
Chef.

190
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,960
What is it?

191
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:50,930
Do you feel really down because of Ahjussi?

192
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,410
Why is your hand so cold?

193
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:06,290
You're right. It's me, Chef.

194
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:22,090
Bong Seon, Na Bong Seon wanted me to say my last goodbye to you.

195
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,000
I see.

196
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:35,040
I don't know what to say.

197
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,540
You don't have to say anything, Chef.

198
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,340
Thank you.

199
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:56,280
I received so many gifts from you.

200
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:05,660
The things I weren't able to do when I was alive. Those feelings.

201
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:12,790
And also, I was really happy here.

202
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,160
I don't have any more regrets.

203
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:24,890
Me, too. I'm thankful, too.

204
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:29,640
For letting me learn the truth of my sister's accident.

205
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,480
And I'm sorry.

206
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:38,590
For causing you to die because of it.

207
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:43,260
No, Chef. It was my fate.

208
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,940
Be happy, Chef.

209
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:06,040
Farewell, Shin Soon Ae.

210
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:36,580
♫   Memories I want to forget, moments that I want to remember    ♫

211
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:44,810
♫  Everything is disappearing   ♫

212
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:52,030
♫  Sometimes those that are forgotten say those were good memories  ♫

213
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:58,740
♫  I wonder if that might be the case   ♫

214
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:07,830
♫  Those people whom I really loved   ♫

215
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:16,050
♫  The warm air that remains on my fingertips   ♫

216
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:24,460
♫   Those that made me feel warmth in my heart  ♫

217
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:32,810
♫   I don't want to lose those memories  ♫

218
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:42,740
♫   Another day's sun rises and time passes  ♫

219
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,400
♫   Yesterday is buried with today's life  ♫

220
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:49,340
♫   Yesterday is buried with today's life  ♫

221
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:58,770
♫   I am also forgotten and disappearing  ♫

222
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:07,300
♫   That's how everything leaves.  ♫

223
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:18,240
So you're leaving now, you poor girl.

224
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:24,550
Okay, don't look back and just go, girl.

225
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:29,530
Hwoi! Hwoi!

226
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:37,240
It would be good if we could depart saying goodbye, knowing when we'll die.

227
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,430
But life doesn't work that way.

228
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:45,670
So we have to live earnestly each day knowing how precious it is.

229
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:50,930
You lived more diligently than anyone else.

230
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:53,580
I know that for a fact.

231
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:58,260
Go safely, Shin Soon Ae!

232
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:05,070
You lived a good life, Soon Ae!

233
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:10,270
Oh, these rotten tears.

234
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,110
How will it be any fun living without that girl?

235
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,320
Oh, it's me. Why?

236
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,920
 Dearie, where are you? I'm feeling down and want to have some soju.

237
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:44,690
Oh, as it so happens, I feel a bit down, too.

238
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,880
Let's have a drink. Where are you?

239
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,940
I'll be right there.

240
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:53,070
Yeah.

241
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,350
I'm out right now.

242
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:06,900
Hey, hey, hey! Hurry up! Clean up these floors!

243
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,060
Look at these tables! Wipe these down!

244
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,920
I'm so happy!

245
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,920
What's with him?

246
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,480
I'm definitely a workaholic.

247
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,520
It was driving me crazy not being able to work for a week.

248
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,230
You weren't crazy because you weren't able to work.

249
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,320
It was because you couldn't use that mouth of yours.

250
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,550
What are you saying about me?

251
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,750
Tickles, it tickles.

252
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,810
Okay.

253
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:33,060
Hey, in any case, I missed you.

254
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,070
-Come here, Ji Woong. 
-Why, why, why?

255
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:37,630
Hey, seriously!

256
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,320
I like being able to come and work, too.

257
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,640
Hate is still an attachment, I think.

258
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,120
Sous Chef. I had a dream. I dreamed about you.

259
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,720
Oh, you're so cute. So cute.

260
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,180
Since my charm is lethal, I'm femme fatal.

261
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,230
Sheesh!

262
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:58,440
Anyway, the one I'm most happy to see after coming back together is She-Bo...I mean, da-Bong!

263
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,130
Yes? Did you call for me?

264
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:04,190
Yes, yes, Your Highness. We called for thou.

265
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,960
 We're just saying it's good to be back.

266
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,030
Now that the restaurant is full, it makes us boys happy.

267
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:12,590
I feel like I can live again after returning.

268
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:16,940
Oh, but there is so much to clean, maybe because it was vacant. The floor is really dirty, too.

269
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:22,360
Why is it so noisy? Come here, come here. Use this.

270
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,100
My friend sells vacuum cleaners. So I bought one.

271
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,670
You don't need to wash it and it's automatic so it's easy to use.

272
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:30,580
Use this one from now on, and don't waste your energy.

273
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,310
-Yes, Chef.
-Ooooooh.

274
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:37,050
Oooooooh. It's blinding my eyes to watch this.

275
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:41,550
There was a time when Chef only had eyes burning for me.

276
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:44,510
I don't think there was ever such a time.

277
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:47,730
There wasn't? There really wasn't? I can give you everything.

278
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:49,920
Hey, hey!!

279
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,640
You're so gross!

280
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,190
Oh man!

281
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:57,700
Seriously!

282
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:01,810
If only Eun He were here, it would be really fun.

283
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,090
Yeah.

284
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:09,100
3T, one Shrek and two spicy seafood noodle soups. 4T, one clam and two escargot.

285
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,100
7T, one Shrek and one Bulgogi eggplant pasta.

286
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,950
Min Soo, you do Shrek and Dong Cheol, you take spicy noodle soup.

287
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:18,780
I'll do escargot so Joon, you cover. Ji Woong, get the eggplants ready.

288
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,650
- And Bong. 
 - Yes.

289
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:24,150
You can make the bulgogi eggplant pasta. What you made last time was tasty.

290
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,890
Yes, Chef. I copy that!

291
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,010
Yes, sir!

292
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:31,720
-Fire!
-Fire!

293
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,560
Bulgogi eggplant past is ready.

294
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,490
Here, let's see.

295
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:45,690
Oh, I feel it, I feel it.

296
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:53,680
Wait, wait, wait!

297
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,150
There you go.

298
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:59,050
Wait, wait, here.

299
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,110
Yes.

300
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:12,580
Shrek pasta and Bulgogi Eggplant pasta are here. Enjoy.

301
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,450
Yes.

302
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,880
 It's good, try this.

303
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,430
 Is it good?

304
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:23,850
It's pretty good.

305
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,960
 Right? Let's trade.

306
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,320
Why don't you order one.

307
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,760
Yes, manager.

308
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,950
Yes.

309
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,800
 Ah, yes.

310
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,920
Awesome, awesome.

311
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,100
 A cooking competition?

312
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,750
You know that I don't do judging.

313
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:56,820
Those with more experience and authority should do it.

314
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,410
Yes, I can be modest from time to time, too.

315
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,990
Yes, I'll see you next time.

316
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:07,950
Ah, director. Is it possible to still register for that cooking competition?

317
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:14,370
If you tenderize the meat like that it'll lose texture taste.

318
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:15,810
Ah, I see.

319
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:18,670
Relax your wrist. That's right.

320
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,090
There you go.

321
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,470
Why? Is it too hard?

322
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:27,560
No I'm fine. But aren't you tired?

323
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:31,540
I'm fine. The competition is right in front of our noses. There's no time to be tired.

324
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:34,380
Take a short break and we'll work on the sauce.

325
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,680
Competition?

326
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:41,260
Didn't I tell you? You're going to a competition. A cooking competition.

327
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:44,420
Me? What cooking competition?

328
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,420
The Right Food Cooking Competition.

329
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:51,130
It's a small competition. I signed you up for the experience.

330
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:53,300
I don't expect any prizes, so don't feel any pressure by it.

331
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,860
No, but still, without even discussing it with me...

332
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:01,140
Like you'd agree to go if I discussed it with you. You'd 100% say you weren't ready.

333
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,220
Ah, a competition.

334
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:06,980
Sometimes instead of being cautious this kind of head-on troublesome events are better.

335
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,410
That's how you can gain experience you can hang on to.

336
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:11,000
I guess that's true, but still.

337
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,290
What's the use in talking?

338
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:15,330
But a competition so suddenly?

339
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,830
Here.

340
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,400
What is this?

341
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:23,600
Don't ask and just open it. If you open it, you'll see right away.

342
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,530
 B.S. ❤

343
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:33,610
Chef!

344
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:37,230
Oh, there you go falling for me again! You've fallen again! I seriously.

345
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:41,660
What can be done? I'll just have to lock my door again.

346
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,190
Thank you, Chef! I'll really do my best.

347
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:47,300
Doing your best is a given.

348
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:51,780
Who knows? This knife might be magic and you could win.

349
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,840
Try holding it properly.

350
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,000
There you go. It fits perfectly in your hand.

351
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,980
Yes.

352
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,290
Chef Na Bong Seon.

353
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,880
Yes, I like it.

354
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,960
I think it's pretty good.

355
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,560
-It is pretty good, but...
-Did you do this heart?

356
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,990
Of course, I did it? Who else would it be?

357
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:10,350
I'm so touched.

358
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,420
Yeah, it's obvious you'd be touched.

359
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:16,730
Anyway, work hard since I prepared it for you.

360
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:19,530
This...this is the sheath.

361
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,120
Oh, Bong buh-da Bong! Are you scared?

362
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,920
Are you nervous?

363
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,260
Hey Ji Woong, Bong's pupils are wide open.

364
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,190
Hey, Bong-Bongie, look at me.

365
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:37,560
Don't be scared. It wont be different than our kitchen.

366
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:41,340
Hey, Bong! If you go and be all "I'm sorry, I'm sorry!"

367
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,720
and act like an idiot, then you're Kang Seon Woo's student.

368
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,340
But, let's say, you do well. You win a prize.

369
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:51,140
Then you're Heo Min Soo's student, okay?

370
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,260
Yes, I'll try my best.

371
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:56,730
Hey, Bong. Here.

372
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,200
Eat it before you eat, you'll be less nervous.

373
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,920
One is for the guy waiting outside in the car. He is a nervous wreck this morning.

374
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,050
Yes. I'll be back.

375
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:08,230
You can do it!

376
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,980
Come quickly, we'll be late. What is that?

377
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,800
For me not to be nervous.

378
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,150
Is there only one?

379
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:17,400
Then, I'll eat one of them.

380
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,810
Stop it! Stop.

381
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:23,290
♫ It's okay. It will turn out fine.

382
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:26,860
♫ You have dazzling oppa.

383
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:30,220
♫ It's okay, It will turn out fine.

384
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:34,320
♫ We believe in you without a doubt!

385
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,070
-Okay.
-I'll be back!

386
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:38,910
You can do this!

387
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,900
 Right Food Cooking Competition

388
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,400
It's pretty big here.

389
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,380
It is big.

390
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,310
Oh, Bong Seon, find your spot.

391
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,160
Yes.

392
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,660
Hyung Woo Bin.

393
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:57,550
-What brings you here?
-Have you been well?

394
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:00,620
Do you know him? He's a famous chef.

395
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:03,080
My kitchen assistant is competing.

396
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:06,230
One of yours enter the competition?

397
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,820
-Na Bong
-Yes?

398
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:11,120
Don't be nervous. Just do as you always do. Just like always.

399
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,740
Yes, Chef.

400
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,100
-Did you take your medicine?
-Yes.

401
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:18,000
Oh, I took the medicine that Joon gave us. Why am I so nervous?

402
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,340
I'm fine, Chef. Even if I don't do well this time, I can just do better next time.

403
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,720
For better or worse, you allowed me to do this for the experience.

404
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,650
That's right. So don't feel any pressure, got it?

405
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:33,410
You understood well. And I'll be sitting over there.

406
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:38,140
-If in the middle of it, you're shaking too much or it turns white in front of you, look at me.
-Yes, Chef.

407
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,600
-Where will I be?
-Over there.
-Okay.

408
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,290
Yes?

409
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:45,670
-What about your knife?
-Right here.

410
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:48,370
-Inner peace. I can do this!
-You can do this.

411
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:50,870
Please go sit down. So I can get ready.

412
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:53,870
Oh my goodness. Just go.

413
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:56,870
I'll look for you.

414
00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:01,560
The teacher is more nervous than the student. This is crazy.

415
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,520
Hello.

416
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,880
Just a little, a little, a little.

417
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:38,080
Just a little more salt.

418
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,470
Now.

419
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:50,290
She's doing well.

420
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,480
Is it bean noodles?

421
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:05,690
What are the ingredients?

422
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:09,410
The ingredient is yellowed overripe cucumber, and this is cold yellow cucumber cream pasta.

423
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:11,690
Oh, yellowed overripe cucumber? Cold yellow cucumber cream pasta.

424
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:16,810
Since I was young, my grandmother made yellowed overripe cucumber salad with vinegar.

425
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:20,860
She'd put it in bean noodles, too. But there are people who can't eat flour.

426
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:23,470
This is a pasta that they can enjoy as well.

427
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:26,540
Oh, that's unique.

428
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,650
Thank you.

429
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:50,220
That concludes the announcement of all the encouragement awards.

430
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:55,290
Now remains the announcement of third, second and the first place winners.

431
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:59,840
To these winners, along with monetary prizes, there are supplies as benefit.

432
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,900
We'll begin by announcing the third place.

433
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:10,380
The third place winner is the Cold Yellowed Overripe Cucumber Cream Pasta talent, entry number 7, Na Bong Seon.

434
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,550
What? Uh, what?

435
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:13,910
 Did he just say Na Bong Seon?

436
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:17,320
 Na Bong Seon, please come to the front.

437
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,310
Wow!

438
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:24,080
Yes, please come out here. Congratulations.

439
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,530
Yes!

440
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:29,120
Thank you!

441
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,230
Thank you.

442
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,600
Thank you.

443
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,650
Chef!

444
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:37,490
You did great!

445
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:41,510
Na Bong! You did so well.

446
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,860
You little thing.

447
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,340
This will be quite a keepsake.

448
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:49,440
Yes, but, Chef, did I really get third place? Did you have a hand in it?

449
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,730
Why would I pull any strings?

450
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:54,400
I could have had a hand in helping you win.

451
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,400
But I'm not someone who would do that for a woman.

452
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,960
I mean, it's because I can't believe it.

453
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,760
Believe it. You won third place.

454
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,030
Yes, Chef.

455
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:12,920
I inquired with Hyung on the juding panel, he said it tasted good and the cooking skill was good.

456
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,840
But more than anything, they loved your story that went into your dish.

457
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,990
Really?

458
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:19,720
You truly are my student.

459
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,650
Yes, thank you, Chef!

460
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:26,000
I'm so proud of you I could die. You did well.

461
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,320
Ha!

462
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:40,280
They put in some effort.

463
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,320
It's pretty.

464
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,800
Congratulations, Na Bong Seon.

465
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,670
Congratulations!

466
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:50,360
 Our Youngest of our kitchen!
Na Bong Seon
Congratulations on your cooking competition prize

467
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,610
Thank you!

468
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:55,090
Oh!

469
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:59,380
These punks! Hey, don't do this kind of stuff!

470
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:02,770
Hi, hi, hi. On such a great day!

471
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:06,590
Just because you got some cream on you.

472
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:11,620
Na Bong! You're great. It was worth raising you.

473
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,010
Who him? I was the one who raised you.

474
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:18,010
Her grandmother is the one who raised her. Why is everyone trying to take credit?

475
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:19,690
Congrats, Bong!

476
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:22,360
-Thank you!
-Hey!

477
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,890
Did Bong save the country?

478
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:27,290
What's with all the touching?

479
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:30,770
Our chef is the embodiment of jealousy. Embodiment of jealousy.

480
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:33,640
In any case, how much was the prize? $1,000?

481
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:38,460
$2,000?
-The prize amount isn't the important thing. It's the fact that they'll send you to study abroad.

482
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:41,680
Isn't the prize for studying abroad up to third place?

483
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,510
 Studying abroad?

484
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:45,520
What is this?

485
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:49,410
Can you get me a tis-tis-tissue?

486
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,900
Why didn't you tell me?

487
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,340
What?

488
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:59,960
That starting with third place, getting picked to study abroad.

489
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,050
-Because I might not win?
-Of course, kid.

490
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:08,020
Who would have known you'd get third place in your first competition?

491
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:11,020
You're a turn-around icon.

492
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:15,100
I told you just to not embarrass yourself, but you go and win third place.

493
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:18,220
I'm confused, if you're complimenting me or not.

494
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:22,540
Of course, it's a compliment.

495
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:27,920
You really did well, Na Bong Seon. Come here.

496
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:30,470
Chef.

497
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:37,870
So, what are you going to do? I'll go along with whatever you decide.

498
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:41,950
You don't necessarily have to go abroad to cook.

499
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:47,280
If you want to gain experience here, I'll help you do that.

500
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,830
If you want to go and learn, I'll send you off in a cool manner.

501
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:06,170
Chef, can I really go?

502
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,470
You want to go?

503
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:19,720
I want to go for the experience.

504
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:25,030
Studying in a bigger world and working part-time.

505
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:28,000
Slowly from the beginning, step by step, on my own.

506
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,480
Are you sure you'll be able not to fall for them at first sight? They'll be pretty aggressive.

507
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,050
I won't fall for anyone at first sight.

508
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:35,870
I-I-I-I don't know. I don't think I can do it.

509
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:39,350
Because women keep clinging to me.

510
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:43,200
So, actually, that's my biggest worry, too.

511
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,110
Oh, Chef.

512
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:51,130
 I should have said I wasn't going.

513
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,740
What should I do?

514
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,720
Ah, Chef.

515
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:05,920
Is he mad?

516
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,760
Oh? This?

517
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,100
You have to at least put this on.

518
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:15,840
You know that Europeans really like Korean women. If you follow them because they're clinging to you, you'll be in big trouble because of this necklace.

519
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,230
I'll stand up since our heights match.

520
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:20,330
Sit down.

521
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,980
Come here.

522
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,510
There.

523
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:52,920
Ah, what am I going to do? I already miss you even when you're in my arms.

524
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,220
That's what I mean, Chef. I'm worried about that, too.

525
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,030
Chef, are you crying?

526
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:07,020
No, I'm not crying. I'm just overwhelmed with emotion.

527
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:11,550
What are we going to do?

528
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,970
 Two years later.

529
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:33,560
Customer  313. your numerology results are in.

530
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:39,800
There are men overflowing in your daughter's life. She's fated to meet a thousand men.

531
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,430
A thousand?

532
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:46,340
Then can my daughter get married within the year?

533
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,750
What are you talking about?

534
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:53,110
Her fate is that she'll have to date 1000 men. Understand?

535
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:58,460
If she dates a man this year, she'll have to meet 999 more.

536
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:01,880
Your daughter has old maid ghost written all over her.

537
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,880
Old maid ghost?

538
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,100
Oh, then what am I going to do?

539
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:15,570
What else? You have to get a talisman.

540
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:21,640
If you don't get one, she'll have to date men her whole life and even have to date them on the other side.

541
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:27,070
Yes, then I need it. Please give me two.

542
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:32,760
Okay, then let's settle the payment. And after I confirm the deposit, I'll write you the talisman.

543
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,370
You can communicate with our office manager to pick them up.

544
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:41,250
You can use courier service too. If it's the mountain region of Jeju Island we can send it there too.

545
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:46,440
Then, since I have to monitor the TV at this time.

546
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:55,690
Seobinggo channel!

547
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:59,180
 Hello. This is Seobinggo who specializes in performing exorcism of evil spirits.

548
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,110
I have to monitor this.

549
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:05,230
I heard you are very skilled Bodhisattva,

550
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:08,920
you even appear on TV.

551
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,770
Naturally, since I'm a star Bodhisattva.

552
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:17,870
Actually, there probably isn't anyone in Korea who chases out evil spirits better than me.

553
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:24,690
I think instead of a talisman,  exorcism might be more effective.

554
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:31,050
Exorcism? Then let's do  exorcism.

555
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:34,250
Please just unequivocally kill them.

556
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:36,220
There are no two ways about it.

557
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:40,290
You know that Bingo-Bingo-Seobinggo is more expensive, right?

558
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:43,770
What's money?

559
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:48,160
I'm going to find the evil spirits! Bingo-Bingo-Seobinggo!

560
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:52,700
Seobinggo!

561
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,110
Bingo, bingo, Seobinggo!

562
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:56,660
Hey, let's quickly get ready!

563
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:01,430
Hey, hey, Ji Woong! Ji Woong! Ji Woong, for sauces,

564
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:04,100
you have to stir it in one direction.

565
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:10,140
How is it that you're the same as you were 2 years ago and can't upgrade? Are you 386?

566
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:12,930
That's why your girlfriend gets stolen.

567
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:16,060
Who? Who stole her?

568
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:20,350
She's not stolen yet. Why are you dousing vinegar? So annoying.

569
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:24,630
It's because I envy you.

570
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:30,500
Hey, Cordon punk. The meat keeps getting thicker and thicker. Is your mom and dad here?

571
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:33,190
Are you going to pay for the meat?

572
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:36,430
But if the steak is too think, you don't get the texture. Don't you know that?

573
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:40,990
I don't know, I don't know. I don't know at all.

574
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:44,280
Our Dong Cheol hyungnim,

575
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,600
What now?

576
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:50,600
You're doing too well. Too well. You look like the chef now.

577
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:54,660
But why isn't that Sous Chef who is supposed to start today not here yet? Skipping out on the first day.

578
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:57,840
I heard he studied abroad like Joon did.

579
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:02,130
I don't know if it's studying abroad or he is glamorous.

580
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:08,750
I'm someone who was never once late even working under that fussy Kang Seon Woo.

581
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:14,350
How can a Sous Chef put on his apron later than the Chef?

582
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:21,970
When that punk gets here, I'm going to make him pee just by hearing my name.

583
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:26,810
 He's here. He's here.

584
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:43,790
I'm the Sous Chef who is supposed to start working today.

585
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,790
Who are you?

586
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:50,330
It's nice to meet you. I'm Edward Seo.

587
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:54,240
My goodness, okay, okay, okay. I'm this restaurant's chef Heo Min Soo.

588
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:58,220
But the restaurant is a bit small.

589
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:01,120
I thought it was a big restaurant.

590
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:06,880
Well, I don't think it's that small.

591
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,750
You're not the owner chef, are you? I understand that Chef Kang Seon Woo is the owner.

592
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:15,790
Then, are you a salaried chef?

593
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:19,470
That's right. That's right, that's right. But come here.

594
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:23,520
The fact that Chef Kang Seon Woo entrusted the restaurant to me,

595
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,520
means that I have tremendous talent.

596
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:30,710
Wow. In any case, it's true that you're a salaried chef.

597
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:34,330
That's right. Since I receive a salary, I'm a salaried chef.

598
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:35,480
Don't forget that.

599
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,140
I won't.

600
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:40,850
Hey, hi.

601
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:42,540
Hello.

602
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:43,570
 How old are you?

603
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:46,020
-23 years.
-23?

604
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:46,960
What are you doing later?

605
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,850
It looks like our Sous Chef is trying strange... should we meet the others?

606
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:53,180
Come here.

607
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:55,320
Whoa. Hey! Whoa!

608
00:46:57,150 --> 00:47:00,280
You're not going to get all awkward and do the "Please look after me."

609
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:03,140
"Let's get along." and get all tacky.

610
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:06,800
That's right, that's tacky. If you've seen their faces, that's enough of an introduction, right?

611
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:11,400
That's right. It's not 1988. We don't do that kind of stuff.

612
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:20,650
 He's cool. He's so cool.

613
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:23,030
I think I'm going to totally fall for the way he cooks.

614
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:26,860
Is cooking all about putting on a show? What a show-off?

615
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:30,210
Isn't he bad luck? Bad luck? Total bad luck?

616
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:35,350
But I don't think it's all a show. I tasted it earlier and it was really good.

617
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:37,930
That's right. He cooks well and is adjusting well.

618
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:43,430
 He was born with it.  He's the king of savvy.

619
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:46,080
Chef Heo. I think this calls for udon noodles, please check one more time.

620
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,730
When you're done with that, do you want to cover the squid pasta over here?

621
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:49,860
Yeah.

622
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:54,310
It's not like Chef Heo is not busy. Something as simple as pasta, why don't you take care of it yourself?

623
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:02,360
Is that so? Okay.

624
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,230
Hey, I like you. What's your name?

625
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:07,390
I don't want to tell you.

626
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:09,210
The chopsticks are burning!

627
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:12,010
-You miss Chef Kang, don't you?
-Yeah.

628
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:14,140
- Should we go have a cigarette? 
 - Yeah, let's go.

629
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:16,800
Wow, have you seen this before?

630
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,780
2T, one bulgogi pasta, two steak rice cake.

631
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:24,810
Speak softly. It's the size of a booger here and I can hear everything.

632
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:28,440
If you're going to cook anyway, who are you saying that for?

633
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:34,490
You're supposed to do it this way. Are you going to argue?

634
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:38,780
This is a lesson. Didn't you want to learn properly and go help your father?

635
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:44,270
Exactly! For filial duty, I've been enduring it as much as I can, but I don't think this is right.

636
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:46,380
Why leave a perfectly fine restaurant and open this hole in the wall?

637
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:51,680
Geez, you've got a long way to go.  Just go and cut the vegetables.

638
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,920
When is he ever going to learn?

639
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,970
 Seon Woo!

640
00:48:55,970 --> 00:49:00,620
You sure do come early. When did I open this place?

641
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:05,090
I'm sorry. I've been busy with specials and all.

642
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:07,380
It's pretty. And quaint.

643
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:08,860
Isn't it? Isn't it nice?

644
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:15,070
You've still got it, Kang Seon Woo. Opening a Korean fusion restaurant?

645
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:18,700
My respect for that adventurous spirit. Here.

646
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:20,570
My goodness.

647
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:22,570
I didn't want to buy a plant.

648
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:25,210
Thanks, you have good sense as always.

649
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:28,900
I came with someone. He'll be here once he parks the car.

650
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:29,890
Who?

651
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:33,150
A guy. We've been dating for just over a month.

652
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:34,760
Really?

653
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:39,080
That's big news. Congratulations. How does he look, I'm really curious.

654
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,390
Take a look.

655
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:43,450
So Hyeong.

656
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:50,310
Uh, uh, yes, it's nice to meet you. I'm Kang Seon Woo.

657
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:54,240
Ah, I heard a lot about you from So Hyeong. I'm Yoon Chang Sook.

658
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:58,730
Yes. Have a seat over there.

659
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:03,760
Aren't you surprised?

660
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:08,220
I was so surprised at first, too. I thought Chang Gyu had a twin.

661
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:12,280
I'm really shocked. He really does look like him, it's amazing.

662
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:15,420
He has a good personality, too. As good as Chang Gyu.

663
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:19,300
Oh yeah. What about Bong Seon? Do you keep in touch with her often?

664
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:23,370
Of course. She calls morning and night, it's so bothersome.

665
00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:28,090
Still, be nice to her. How difficult she must be all alone in Taji.

666
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:34,170
Oh my, this is really pretty. Is this Eun Hee's work?

667
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:40,640
Sorry, sorry. I'm late, aren't I?

668
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,740
No, it's okay, Mom.

669
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:46,660
Professor Park was insisting on going along that it took forever to make him drop the idea.

670
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:51,860
Why? I like Professor Park. He's kind and only has eyes for you.

671
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:54,830
I think he's the most decent man you've dated so far.

672
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:58,730
No thanks. I can't stand the attentive, sunflower type.

673
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:03,150
He takes care of everything from one to ten, it's making me so sick of him.

674
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:05,300
Did Son-in-law...

675
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,560
This is a flower I haven't seen before. Is it new?

676
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,350
Oh, celosia.

677
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:16,660
The outside might be rough, but the inside is really soft. Isn't it pretty?

678
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:22,560
I'm not sure. I don't like anything prettier than me.

679
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:27,930
The meaning of this flower is unfading love. Forever love.

680
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:35,090
-Is anything forever? 
-We'll be late. Let's go, Mom.

681
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:36,960
Okay, okay. Let's go.

682
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,690
Let's go. We're going!

683
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:41,790
 Yes!

684
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:55,760
Eun Hee, isn't it better if I go with you?

685
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:00,790
No, I want to go alone today. You can go with me next time.

686
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:04,680
- Okay, I understand. Be careful. 
 - Flower.

687
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:09,670
Oh, the flowers. There.

688
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:11,020
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

689
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:13,940
- Be careful. 
 - I'll be back.

690
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:24,550
Thank you.

691
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:32,430
Seong Jae.

692
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,740
Eun Hee.

693
00:52:38,910 --> 00:52:42,060
How do you feel? You look even better today.

694
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:44,960
Maybe because you're coming today,

695
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,870
I woke up early and was humming.

696
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:51,040
Really? That makes me feel good.

697
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,340
Careful, careful. What is this?

698
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:56,520
It's your gift for today.

699
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:00,070
Isn't this celosia?

700
00:53:00,070 --> 00:53:02,250
You know celosia?

701
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:07,530
I brought them because they said bright colors would help put you in a good mood. Do you like them?

702
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:12,370
Of course. I like all the flowers you give me.

703
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:19,560
Did I like flowers before, too?

704
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:23,340
No. I don't think you were very interested in them.

705
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:30,760
Then it must not be the flowers that I like, but you.

706
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:38,160
Probably so. You were really... good to me.

707
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:45,350
How long did we live together?

708
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:47,260
Three years.

709
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:50,950
Three years.

710
00:53:53,750 --> 00:54:00,640
Honestly, I don't remember it, but I'm sure I was happy.

711
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,550
That's what I think.

712
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:10,630
I have to get my memory back quickly.

713
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:15,550
Aren't you frustrated with me, too?

714
00:54:15,550 --> 00:54:19,450
No. I like you like this, too.

715
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:24,030
So, don't try so hard to get your memory back.

716
00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:26,930
Here.

717
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:30,150
Geez.

718
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:35,990
Is Na Bong Seon cheating? Isn't this too much?

719
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:40,730
In the beginning, she used to send pictures and everything, but now there's nothing.

720
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:43,730
It seems like she has another man, doesn't it?

721
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:48,650
No? No? It's not yet.

722
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:53,550
Bong naturally looks young, so foreigners will think she's a kid.

723
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:57,290
How could anyone see her as a woman? There's no way.

724
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:07,030
How could men not fall for this? Men aren't going to be seduced by this?

725
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:10,430
Huh? When she's this pretty?

726
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:16,210
Her face is glowing.

727
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:21,230
Ah, seriously, I sent her for nothing! Acting all cool for nothing!

728
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:23,960
Agh! Seriously!

729
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:28,580
Please call me. Call me, please.

730
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,310
♫ Na Bong.

731
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:37,660
♫ It's for real.

732
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,470
♫ I really miss you.

733
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:46,350
Ah, I shouldn't have sent her! I shouldn't have let her go!

734
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:49,710
There are tons of men there.

735
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:54,550
She doesn't call. Please call.

736
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:57,370
I'm really going to cry.

737
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:03,100
I'm the only one who cares.

738
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,560
She doesn't like me. I'm the only who is doing the liking.

739
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:10,720
Here it come. 1T, two spinach Shrek and one chicken salad.

740
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:13,540
And 3T, three Papillote and two soup of the day.

741
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:16,970
5T, three snow steaks and two salads. Here we go.

742
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:18,620
We copy that!

743
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:20,760
-Fire!
-Fire!

744
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,530
Fire!

745
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:26,770
Hey, hey, hey. Were is that guy, Alfredo, when we're busy as hell?

746
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:28,350
I know, I haven't seen him since earlier.

747
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:31,320
Alfredo says he still has jet lag, so he's sleeping.

748
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:33,870
He says he's taking a self-regulated breaks.

749
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:36,010
This thoughtless...

750
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:39,260
How could such a bum exist?

751
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:43,680
Is it such a big deal having had foreign water?

752
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,470
Change him. Change the Sous Chef.

753
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:47,580
Go take care of the customer.

754
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:49,520
Sheesh.

755
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:52,840
Welcome! Table for one?

756
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:55,640
One...?

757
00:56:58,210 --> 00:56:59,500
Bong!

758
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,540
Sunbaenim.

759
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:05,680
Oh!!

760
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,530
Bong Seon's here!

761
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:08,750
 Hey, Joon!

762
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:12,580
 Bong Seon's here! Na Bong is here!

763
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:15,280
 Bong!

764
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,850
 Na Bong!

765
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,830
Bong is here!

766
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:20,260
When did you get here?

767
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:23,340
When did you get so pretty? I can't recognize you!

768
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:26,030
You're a new Bong. New Bong.

769
00:57:26,030 --> 00:57:28,410
Did you get here today? Did you finish your studies well?

770
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:31,010
Seeing that luggage, did you come here right after arriving?

771
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:33,730
Yes, slowly one at a time!

772
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:37,710
Hey, Bong! You bad Bong!

773
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:39,200
Wow, Chef!

774
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:44,350
Why didn't you keep in touch? When I saw you, I was going to...hug you!

775
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:50,720
Bong, Bong, Bong, Bong, Bong, Bong!

776
00:58:02,330 --> 00:58:05,490
Welcome! My goodness!

777
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:08,710
Who is this? Isn't this Bong Seon?

778
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:11,510
Yes, have you been well?

779
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:16,480
Wow, I thought I'd have a welcome guest after the dream I had.

780
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,880
It's really great to see you. When did you arrive?

781
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:23,290
Today. Have you been well? How is your health?

782
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:26,460
Well, getting old brings all sorts of things.

783
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:29,650
But I've practically quit drinking lately.

784
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:33,840
Really? That's great! That's wonderful.

785
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,680
Wait a second. I should give you something since it's been so long.

786
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,990
No, Ahjussi, I just stopped by for a moment.

787
00:58:38,990 --> 00:58:42,230
I have somewhere to go, so I'll come back again later.

788
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:46,670
Even if you tell me not to come, I'm going to come and go as much as I please.

789
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:50,480
My goodness. Will you have time to do that when you'll be busy?

790
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,650
You'll be even busier since you've gone and studied.

791
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:54,470
There will be so many places who want to hire you.

792
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:57,730
No, it's still happy hour for me.

793
00:58:57,730 --> 00:59:00,850
I'm going to take my time and look into places to work.

794
00:59:00,850 --> 00:59:04,510
I'd totally like it if you'd hire me part-time until then.

795
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:07,020
Really? Can I do that?

796
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:10,450
Of course, but you have to pay me well.

797
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:13,470
You can't just pay me with yogurt drinks.

798
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:16,350
Okay, okay. I'll pay you plenty.

799
00:59:16,350 --> 00:59:18,540
Yes.

800
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:23,040
♫

801
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,920
What is this? Hey, how many kg of shrimp did you order?

802
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:27,850
10 kg.

803
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:29,990
Why 10 kg?

804
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:34,710
I told you to order 1 kg that looks like 10 kg. When did I say to order 10 kg?

805
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:37,370
It's so confusing, why do you write down stuff like that?

806
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:42,270
It's hot out, what am I going to do with all this shrimp?

807
00:59:42,270 --> 00:59:43,850
I don't know.

808
00:59:43,850 --> 00:59:47,730
-If it's such a waste, take it out of my pay.
-There isn't that much in your pay.

809
00:59:47,730 --> 00:59:49,860
How many times is this?

810
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:54,160
Never mind. What do I expect from a guy who buys large bowl (bagaji) when I asked for short-necked clams (bajirack).

811
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,220
If you can't trust me, then hire someone else!

812
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:58,400
- I'm quitting now. So whatever. 
 - Again. Again.

813
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,830
Hey! You...

814
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:07,200
What time is it? 3:30. Why does he always quit at 3:30 every day?

815
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:15,810
What is it? He's not coming to get me? Is he trying to play push-pull games with me?

816
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:18,360
Kang Seon Woo, hurry up and come out. I'm really going to quit.

817
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:21,340
One, two, three...

818
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:24,520
Okay, he's not coming to get me. What should I do?

819
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:27,460
Do I have to beg forgiveness?

820
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:29,410
I don't know.

821
01:00:39,570 --> 01:00:43,510
Na Bong Seon!

822
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,050
Shin Kyung Mo, have you been well?

823
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:48,890
How long has it been?

824
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:51,450
You didn't keep in touch, you bad girl.

825
01:00:51,450 --> 01:00:53,010
 Shin Kyung...

826
01:00:57,990 --> 01:01:00,700
I have to go buy shrimp.

827
01:01:18,990 --> 01:01:25,330
Here. This is a menu item. Tell me what you think or whatever.

828
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:28,860
If you've studied, then you should know how to make detailed taste appraisal.

829
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:32,840
Oh, how did you think of using rice? That's amazing.

830
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:35,320
I'm  more amazed.

831
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:39,540
How could you suddenly come back without even telling me?

832
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:42,700
How many months has it been since you've been in touch?

833
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:47,220
-And what's with that look? It doesn't suit you.
-Why?

834
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:50,290
Did I change that much? Am I that awkward?

835
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:54,130
No, not that you've changed, it's just a little unfamiliar.

836
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:55,360
This?

837
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:57,280
-Try tasting it.
-Yes.

838
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:01,070
Mmm.

839
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:29,120
The meat is tender so it has a good taste from texture. But I think it's not uniformly cooked.

840
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:31,160
There's medium and there's rare.

841
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:35,820
And also, the sauce is good because it isn't overpowering.

842
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:39,890
I feel like it's a little lacking with just perilla leaves and onions.

843
01:02:39,890 --> 01:02:45,370
I wonder if the crunch of something like bean sprouts mixed in would liven it up.

844
01:02:45,370 --> 01:02:48,740
I was thinking of adding bean sprouts, too.

845
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:52,010
You must have studied hard. I give you that.

846
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:55,360
Of course, I ranked fifth while I was there.

847
01:02:56,590 --> 01:03:00,900
So you didn't call me because you were studying so hard.

848
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:02,040
Chef, are you upset?

849
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:08,220
Upset? Hey, I was busy, too. So much so that I didn't have time to contact you either.

850
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:12,400
I thought I would want to come back.

851
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:14,980
What?

852
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:18,310
I missed you so much.

853
01:03:18,310 --> 01:03:23,580
I missed you so much that I thought if I heard your voice, I would  want to come running back.

854
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:28,260
So I didn't call you on purpose. I held myself back the best I could.

855
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:34,790
I missed you so much.

856
01:03:34,790 --> 01:03:36,600
Chef.

857
01:03:38,350 --> 01:03:42,500
Good job. You did well. You did well.

858
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:46,720
You really did well. Come here.

859
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:48,770
Good job. You did well.

860
01:03:48,770 --> 01:03:51,790
-Did I do well?
-You did well. Come here.

861
01:03:51,790 --> 01:04:00,300
♫   Oh, just stay. Come closer to me. Stay her.     ♫

862
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:04,210
♫  Stay by my side like this.   v

863
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:06,050
-Isn't it too tiring on you?
-It's not tiring at all.

864
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:08,190
-Are we going to stay like this?
-Of course we are.

865
01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:11,070
-Really?
-Yeah.

866
01:04:11,070 --> 01:04:12,660
Can I kiss you one more time?

867
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:15,960
Of course, of course.

868
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:25,450
I missed you.

869
01:04:27,790 --> 01:04:31,250
So, what are you planning to do now?

870
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:35,550
If you don't have any plans, you could work with me.

871
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:39,180
Oh? Are you trying to recruit me?

872
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:42,650
I have some place I agreed to work for the time being.

873
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:43,860
-Really?
-Yeah.

874
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:45,100
Where is it?

875
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:48,120
Somewhere. I'll tell you in time.

876
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:52,060
It's exactly the same.

877
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:58,640
Stalker! It's been so long! Have you been well?

878
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,500
You became a dad.

879
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:04,330
 This is bringing tears to my eyes. Seriously.

880
01:05:04,330 --> 01:05:06,440
 I think you're happier to see Stalker than me.

881
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,420
Stalker.

882
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:10,900
Being jealous for no reason.

883
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:13,860
Jealous? Seriously.

884
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:15,930
Hey, I'm Kang Seon Woo.

885
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:21,570
You're Na Bong Seon and even after two years, nothing has changed. I'm Kang Seon Woo and you're Na Bong Seon. Who are you calling jealous?

886
01:05:21,570 --> 01:05:24,280
Hey, and would I be jealous of a dog?

887
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:27,800
You are jealous.

888
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:33,020
-My cute Chef.
-Wait, wait!
-This is going to make me want to do it.

889
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:36,220
Why are you... are you really Na Bong Seon?

890
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:37,920
Are you again...?

891
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:41,650
No, I am really Na Bong Seon.

892
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:46,040
This girl, really. You learned such naughty things abroad.

893
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:48,630
That's not good. You better not be like that.

894
01:05:48,630 --> 01:05:52,530
I can't? I better not be what, Chef?

895
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:55,320
-What?
-I seriously...

896
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:58,540
This girl... this won't do. Let go.

897
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:00,330
-Let go for a moment.
-Oh, seriously.

898
01:06:00,330 --> 01:06:04,290
-Okay, fine.
-Be careful.

899
01:06:05,810 --> 01:06:07,210
Today is D-Day.

900
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:08,460
Chef!

901
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:10,310
 Hey, hey. Come over here.

902
01:06:10,310 --> 01:06:14,420
 Why, why, why? Oh, oh. Isn't this it? This isn't it?

903
01:06:14,420 --> 01:06:18,580
 Ah, ah, no, it is. You better be prepared. Come here.

904
01:06:18,580 --> 01:06:22,550
 Oh, oh, Chef! Why am I in such trouble?! Oh, what's happening?

905
01:06:22,550 --> 01:06:24,240
 Hey, shhhh.

906
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:27,810
 Chef, but can't we turn out the lights and do it?

907
01:06:27,810 --> 01:06:30,640
 I guess it's normal to turn out the lights, isn't it?

908
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:33,430
 Oh no!

909
01:06:39,290 --> 01:06:42,810
1T, three Papillote. 4T, two potato soup.

910
01:06:42,810 --> 01:06:44,560
5T, two Carbonara. Let's do it.

911
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:46,030
Copy that.

912
01:06:46,030 --> 01:06:51,700
-Now, fire!
-Fire!!

913
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:54,940
 Welcome!

914
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:56,920
-Two customers here!
-Yes!

915
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:59,380
Have a seat over there!

916
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:00,500
 We're ready to order!

917
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:05,050
Two scorched rice soups coming out.

918
01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:07,810
Enjoy.

919
01:07:07,810 --> 01:07:12,360
 I thought you only had one daughter, but you had a second one, too?

920
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:14,930
Yes, this is my second daughter.

921
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:17,170
She came from studying far away. Isn't she pretty?

922
01:07:17,170 --> 01:07:20,330
Yes, she's very good looking.

923
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:22,910
Enjoy!

924
01:07:22,910 --> 01:07:26,360
A curry and bulgogi rice bowl is coming out.

925
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:31,940
 The seasons changed like it always had and life returned to normal.

926
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:36,620
 But that summer, because of the girl who came and went like a midsummer dream,

927
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:42,850
 we learned how to love. And by fate, we came to realize the importance of people in our lives.

928
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:48,940
 And as she directed me, today I love myself fully.

929
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:53,620
 And also I love him.

930
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:59,190
