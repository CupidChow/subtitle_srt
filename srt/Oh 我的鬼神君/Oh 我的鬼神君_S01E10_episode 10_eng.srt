1
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:06,710
 Oh My Ghostess

2
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:27,130

3
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,270
 Oh My Ghostess

4
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,810
We're here.

5
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,310
Ah, wait. Wait a second.

6
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,040
Can't we just stay like this for a moment?

7
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,620
Let's sit over here for a moment.

8
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,620
Do you like this?

9
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:15,630
Yes, it's so nice.

10
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,640
See? Isn't it nice just holding hands?

11
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:26,970
I want to do this slowly with you.

12
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,090
No matter how delicious or expensive a food is, you'll get indigestion if you eat it too quickly.

13
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:35,880
And worse than your body getting sick, it's more scary for your heart to get sick. Do you understand?

14
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,140
But, you know, time...

15
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,500
what if you don't have much time left?

16
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,390
Why wouldn't you have much time left?

17
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:54,380
It's not like you're going to die tomorrow. Since you don't have a response, you're just saying anything.

18
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,570
Why? Do you want to scold me again?

19
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,340
I seriously want to scold you.

20
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,940
This won't do. Let's hurry up and go inside.

21
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,140
-Oh! Five more minutes.
-Not even five minutes.

22
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,600
-No.
-Then just one more minute!

23
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,660
Just one more minute. Let's be like this for just one minute.

24
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,180
Yes,

25
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,350
I said I didn't drink!

26
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,800
I'm at the restaurant to give your brother some cream-filled buns.

27
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,850
He's liked these since a long time ago.

28
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,670
I don't know, I may get abused for this.

29
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:33,210
I'll be there after giving this to him. Okay, okay.

30
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,480
I'm getting nervous for nothing.

31
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,940
He's not my child, he's my master.

32
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:47,300
While holding hands like this, again you'll be like, "shall we do it."

33
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,120
Do you like me that much?

34
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,180
Yes, I do.

35
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,300
Even your hands are so warm.

36
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,310
No, my hands aren't that warm. It's because your hands are cold.

37
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:03,420
Why are your hands so cold? Maybe you don't have good blood circulation.

38
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,270
Do I have to start feeding you stuff like goji tea?

39
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,630
Oh! Why is it so dark here?

40
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:12,210
Hand, hand, hand!

41
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,340
Seon Woo...

42
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,720
Hello.

43
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,600
Oh, you were out here.

44
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,140
What brings you here at this hour, Mom?

45
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,830
Oh, I was at Taesun, since it's been so long,

46
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,800
and I remembered that you liked their cream-filled buns.

47
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,400
But why are you here at this hour, Bong Sook?

48
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,850
What? I..It isn't Bong Sook, it's Bong Seon.

49
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:36,560
Oh, is it? This or that.

50
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,750
What were you doing at this late hour?

51
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:43,210
I asked you to do something, didn't I? It's fine now, you can go.

52
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,020
Wh-wh-what?

53
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,490
You can go home now.

54
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:50,070
Ah, yes, then I'll be going. Please stay for a while.

55
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,220
Yeah.

56
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:56,530
I asked her to get something, but they didn't have it.

57
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:00,700
She was looking everywhere for it until now.

58
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,830
What?  What is it?

59
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,850
Are you hard up lately?

60
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,090
How else could you?

61
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:13,510
Look at her status and size. Don't even think of trying to fool me.

62
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:17,240
I might not have a clue about the kids in my department lending out money,

63
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,510
but when it comes to when they have eyes for each other,

64
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,120
I'm right on. I'm an expert on that area.

65
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,010
I'm right, aren't I? There's something going on with her, isn't there?

66
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:29,330
What would there be, Mom?

67
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:32,840
It's really been a long time since I had these cream buns.

68
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,040
Changing the subject. But what's with the dog?

69
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,830
Oh.

70
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,970
You're using protection, aren't you?

71
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,660
Son, you have to use protection. Hmm?

72
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,830
Mom!

73
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,540
You're not?

74
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:55,150
Oh! That scared me, seriously!

75
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,210
I didn't do anything wrong, so why is my heart racing?

76
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:03,880
If it wasn't because of that ahjumma . .  .

77
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:16,430
 Oh my Ghostess 
 ~Episode 10~

78
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:20,780
Kids these days are so scary. If you mess with the wrong person,

79
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:24,400
you'll see what I mean if she has bad intentions.

80
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,030
Seriously, it isn't like that, Mom.

81
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,810
Okay, let's say it isn't.

82
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:31,260
Not just saying that it isn't. It really isn't.

83
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,880
Okay, then.

84
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,650
Work is difficult, too. You need somewhere to release yourself, being a young man.

85
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,510
It's not good for you if you don't.

86
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:43,070
But, since your outlook this year isn't good, use protection no matter what.

87
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,870
Mom, please!

88
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,770
Do you really want to talk about this with your son?

89
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,940
What's there not to say? It's much better than having an accident.

90
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,850
Go in, Mom. My head hurts because of you.

91
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,980
Okay, kid. I'm leaving even if you tell me not to.

92
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,630
And don't jump to conclusions by yourself.

93
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:08,210
I get it! Eun Hee and you, everyone keeps nagging.

94
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,380
When you were young, you were quiet to a fault.

95
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,230
Sleep well, punk.

96
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,430
Go safely!

97
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:21,290
I'm going. I'm going, see?

98
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,910
 Na Bong Seon

99
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,450
 My mom left.

100
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,980
 I'll be there as fast as a bullet. Hwideedeek

101
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:57,940
Hwideedeek? When did you start being so cute?

102
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,050
Chef!

103
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,680
Ah, you startled me!

104
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,400
Sorry! What about your mother? Isn't she thinking something weird?

105
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,240
Of course she's thinking something weird. Very. Because you are weird to begin with, to anyone who sees.

106
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,980
I explained it well to my mom, so don't worry.

107
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,880
That's good.

108
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,950
Let's go in and really rest now.

109
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:23,200
You must be tired from playing your heart out with all those men today.

110
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,870
Oh, I slept well at the motel so I'm okay.

111
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:29,930
Ah, suddenly I'm getting mad again.

112
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,040
From now on, don't even say the "mo" in motel in front of me, understand?

113
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,420
Yes. Motel.

114
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:38,830
Hey, seriously! Get up, I'll drop you off.

115
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,090
Ah!

116
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,210
Where's your home?

117
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,400
-It's over there.
-Oh.

118
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,560
You're taking me home?

119
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,310
Yeah. Here.

120
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,620
We're here!

121
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,190
Take care.

122
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,630
No, the man is supposed to drop off.

123
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,210
Ah, I will, I will.

124
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,750
Hey, what, do you want to stay up all night doing this?

125
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,040
Get down. Okay, we'll go in on one, two, three. Got it?

126
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,890
Yes.

127
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:06,670
What is this...one, two, three!

128
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,940
Oh, look at this. Now, one, two, three!

129
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,810
Ah, good night!

130
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,530
Okay.

131
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,760
She's so cute.

132
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,180
Sleep well, Na Bong Seon.

133
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,830
I'm home!

134
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,690
You're here quickly.

135
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,170
Did oppa refuse to let you in again?

136
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:31,200
Then, do you think he welcomed me with both arms open?

137
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,800
Oppa likes you. He's just not used to showing it.

138
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,380
I know that, too. He's my son, you think I wouldn't know that?

139
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,910
Wait, Eun Hee.

140
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:40,930
Yes?

141
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:45,840
You know the girl assistant who works in the kitchen at Sun Restaurant?

142
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,570
That Bong Sook girl.

143
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,880
It's Bong Seon.

144
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,420
This or that. How is she?

145
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,090
Does she have complicated relationships with men?

146
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:58,610
No, she's not like that. She's so cautious.

147
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:02,900
If she were any more cautious, she'd gobble up a man.

148
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:07,700
You should learn to read people better. Don't look at everyone so positively.

149
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,770
I'm going to go wash up.

150
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,910
Why are so many people curious about Bong Seon these days?

151
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:48,620
What do you think you're doing when you're a ghost? It's driving me crazy.

152
00:09:55,510 --> 00:10:02,220
So what? I'm just feeling what it's like to be in love. Can I not do that either?

153
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,390
What are you doing here?

154
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:21,760
Oh! I'm bored. So I went here and there.

155
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,230
Why? Can you not sleep again?

156
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,860
No, I'm thirsty.

157
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:34,390
I don't see ghosts lately. So I think I'm getting some sleep.

158
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,770
Oh, really?

159
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:41,010
I think it's all because of you, Unni.

160
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,750
It feels weird. After hearing you call me Unni.

161
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,040
It is, isn't it?

162
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,040
I didn't know I'd be calling a ghost Unni.

163
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,460
Why are you mumbling by yourself in the middle of the night?

164
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,240
What? Oh.

165
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,990
It's nothing.

166
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,680
-You can't sleep?
-What?

167
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,900
Is it because it's too hot?

168
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,150
What? Yes.

169
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:09,320
This won't do.

170
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,800
Come over here.

171
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,550
Come inside.

172
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,510
-Sit down.
-Okay.

173
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:28,940
Okay. Since I didn't throw this away and saved it, it's now useful.

174
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,720
It will get better if you turn this on to sleep.

175
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,370
Also, sleep with the door open, since you can suffocate.

176
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,620
Yes, Chef.

177
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,060
Okay. That's it.

178
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,400
-Should I try turning it on?
-Yes.

179
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,980
The air doesn't feel cool. Why is that?

180
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,710
Why is it doing this? What's wrong?

181
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:04,210
I think the propeller is on backward.

182
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:15,500
Did you know I was putting it on backward? Why didn't you tell me?

183
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,190
No, I just saw it now. I'm sorry.

184
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:24,900
I'm not someone who can't fix machines, but I'm a little out of my mind because I just woke up from my sleep.

185
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,140
It was on backward.

186
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,340
There. Let's see.

187
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,270
Oh, it feels cool.

188
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:48,600
You're sweating.

189
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,700
Here.

190
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,190
See? It's cool.

191
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,640
Yes.

192
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:16,670
Why is the weather baking hot already. It's making me crazy.

193
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:20,990
But it's still better in the hall. Later, thinking about being in the kitchen,

194
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:24,820
owhhh, I really hate summer!

195
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,050
We wrestle with heat from the weather and heat from the fire.

196
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:32,510
Today, we have to accept defeat, it's going to be over 30 °C.

197
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:37,110
Hey, hey, but still. There are good things about summer.

198
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:40,070
While working in the kitchen, we can look over

199
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:44,790
and see the girls wearing booty skirts and their legs.

200
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,180
We have to give prizes to those magnificent sisters.

201
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,520
Of course, that's healing for us.

202
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,850
Be careful. If you keep that up, you'll be taken away for sexual harassment.

203
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,270
They're the ones wearing the booty shorts, did we tell them to?

204
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,900
Hey, are you cleaning with your mouth?

205
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,510
Starting in the morning? Do it quickly and conserve your energy.

206
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,640
Yes, Chef!

207
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,330
Eat this.

208
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:18,950
Isn't this ginseng?

209
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:21,300
Your strength isn't that great.

210
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,100
It's hot today and there are a lot of reservations, so it's going to be hell.

211
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,980
Before you get exhausted, think of it as a supplement and eat it.

212
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,320
Is it difficult only for me? Eat it together.

213
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,700
No, no, I'm okay.

214
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,900
Actually, this is better medicine for me than that.

215
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,610
Why are you being so mushy?

216
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,900
You sure do like this.

217
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,700
-Na Bong!
-What?

218
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,330
-This corn syrup...
-Go answer the phone.

219
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,050
Someone was asking for you.

220
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,330
Me? Who?

221
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,270
Who is it?

222
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:05,080
We won't need two, right? I wonder if we got the proportions right.

223
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,800
Six...

224
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,210
Oh, bitter. Yes, Hello?

225
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:20,540
 Bong Sook? This is Jo Hye Yeong.

226
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,900
 Don't ask me anything and just answer.

227
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,120
 Quickly give me your birthday including the time.

228
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,700
Who is this?

229
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,410
 I said not to ask any questions. Just answer me now.

230
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:36,480
It's April 14, 1984 at 2 a.m.

231
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,390
But who is... Hello?

232
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:42,650
What is this?

233
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,680
But I gave her my real birthday.

234
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:48,880
This is someone who's already dead.

235
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,470
What are you talking about? It's someone who's alive with eyes wide open.

236
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:56,610
I'm telling you it's not. Her life ended while she was still young.

237
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,750
But who is it?

238
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,860
That's strange.

239
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:07,330
Bong Sook or something. A girl who works at my son's restaurant.

240
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,610
Oh, this pen isn't coming out since earlier.

241
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:16,010
Where did I put the ballpoint pens? Why are you asking about her?

242
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:18,700
Actually, it's been a long time

243
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,310
since I got these cream buns that my son likes and brought them to his apartment.

244
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:25,190
But, my goodness, at that late hour,

245
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,840
my son was with her!

246
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,660
Really? What were they doing?

247
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,450
What do you think they were doing?

248
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,370
-The two of them were on the wooden bench,
-On the wooden bench,

249
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:37,500
they were stuck together and in the middle of talking.

250
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,200
They were in the middle of talking?

251
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,270
But this kid was so flustered as soon as he saw me that he was spouting gibberish.

252
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,680
Is that suspicious or not?

253
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,550
I'm 100% right when it comes to those feelings.

254
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,340
No matter how I think about it, it's suspicious.

255
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:56,950
Could it be that the dead flowerbed in the dream, could it be her?

256
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:02,790
But I have one more thing for you. Look at her for me. I want to check in advance.

257
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,900
Look at her. What about her?

258
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:13,650
Her first marriage can end in a parting.

259
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:19,460
But she has loyalty, and strong ability to keep livelihood.   If the dark clouds clear up, there's a rainbow.

260
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,430
Really?

261
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:25,840
If she gets an exorcism and meets the second one, she'll live well, with a match made in heaven.

262
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,080
But who is she?

263
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:34,650
Just someone. Someone my son is friends with.

264
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:47,180
You're busy, aren't you? These are the best years of your life.

265
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,620
If you only work, when do you find time to date?

266
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,780
You'll have to get married, right? You're not going to live alone forever?

267
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:57,710
I know. Isn't my life a little pathetic?

268
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:01,560
Are you dating anyone?

269
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,580
No, not yet.

270
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:08,490
Something must have happened to all the broadcasting guys' eyes.

271
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:14,010
I wonder if the men are intimidated because you're up there.

272
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:19,460
In all honesty, women must seem a bit dense in order to seduce men.

273
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:23,180
I'm a professor of dating, you know.

274
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,290
I'll have to get some advice from you later.

275
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,560
If you wish.

276
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:32,600
But what kind of men do you prefer?

277
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,220
For example,

278
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,500
do you not like guys like my Seon Woo?

279
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,480
Even though he can be difficult, he's also genuine.

280
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,220
I know that. But Seon Woo doesn't see me as a woman.

281
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,380
PD Lee, but you see Seon Woo as a man?

282
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:50,960
Of course, he's alluring. You know women are weak when it comes to men like him.

283
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,490
That's what I mean. So that means that you're not completely disinterested in Seon Woo.

284
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:00,990
It's Seon Woo who isn't starting the engine like a man.

285
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:03,430
Right?

286
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,150
I guess.

287
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,040
-Hello!
-We're here.

288
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,020
Oh, hello!

289
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,240
Hello!

290
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,910
You should go, you'll be late.

291
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:25,790
But where is Hyungnim? I should say hello before I go.

292
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:31,820
 ♫Without any feelings of dislike...

293
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:37,870
♫When generously giving love...

294
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:43,690
 ♫Millions of millions of blossoms blooming...

295
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:47,440
 ♫Longing for that beautiful-

296
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,200
 You came?

297
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,350
♫ Longing for that beautiful-

298
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,010
 Officer Choi!

299
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,290
-Bong Seon,
-Hello.

300
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,730
You're here?

301
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,670
-Yes, Hyungnim.
-Should I give you something cold to drink?

302
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,060
No, I have to get going.

303
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,160
You should have a glass. Are you alright?

304
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,810
What? Oh, I'm fine.

305
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,660
 Your shoelaces are quite unique.

306
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:24,490
 Ah, these? Is it Bong Seon? That restaurant gal.

307
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,130
 She tied them for me.

308
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:31,330
 When generously giving love...

309
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,410
 BREAK TIME
15:00- 17:00

310
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,990
Hey, Cordon, aren't you hungry?

311
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:48,100
Do you want some of this seafood stir fry?

312
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,340
I stir-fried some leftover ingredients, but it tastes okay.

313
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:55,110
Here, give me your chopsticks.

314
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:07,290
You were fooled, right? You really thought it was seafood stir-fried, right?

315
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,470
Oh, I'm dizzy.

316
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,570
Ah, that dummy.

317
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:17,420
Hey, don't they teach you this at Cordon? Do you want me to make you a spicy seafood stew with the leftovers?

318
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:21,130
I'm being serious asking you this.

319
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,930
Isn't he going backwards? Backwards?

320
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:25,710
He's not even grade school level,

321
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,350
he's a preschooler. A preschooler.

322
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,360
Oh my bright and untainted one.

323
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,160
Seriously bright and untainted one. Nice.

324
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,080
I'm going to the Garak Market. Who wants to go?

325
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,010
Oh, me! We can get shaved ice, too.

326
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:40,530
You have to check on the food ingredients. Chef can't be unattended.

327
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:43,110
-Oh, then I'll go.
-Aren't you marinating the meat?

328
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,760
-Ah.
-Today's special is seasoned steak.

329
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,330
-Ah, then it's been a long time since I've...
-You, punk,

330
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:52,600
you have to confirm the reservations and prepare the stocks.

331
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:59,530
This won't do since Joon has to roll the noodles. I'll have to take useless Na Bong Seon.

332
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:01,760
Na Bong Seon, come out.

333
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,870
Ah, that's right.

334
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:07,590
Since I'm the most useless person in this place, I should go.

335
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:10,970
You're the one who said not to make it obvious.

336
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:12,690
What did I do?

337
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:15,850
We're going to buy groceries now. It's official work.

338
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:18,110
Ah, yes.

339
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:20,870
But, Chef, can't you drive with just one hand?

340
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,960
It's kind of cool when men do that.

341
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,630
Cool? Yeah, right.

342
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:34,480
Ah, because you wanted to do this?

343
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,490
Using your head just to do this.

344
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,950
It's a good thing you're just focused on my hand. If like before,

345
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:44,050
you came after me wanting to do it, it would be hard to handle.

346
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,620
What are you doing? Get a hold of yourself.

347
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,200
I like this.

348
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,470
Me, too. I'm telling myself to get a hold of myself even if I like it.

349
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,030
With mangoes,

350
00:22:56,030 --> 00:23:01,060
if you press the stem and it's soft and tender, it's ripe. And at the stem,

351
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,630
if it smells sweet, it's good.

352
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:07,380
Soft and tender, and sweet like Chef.

353
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:11,530
Stop that when it's not warranted.

354
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:15,030
Ah, your bride is overflowing with cuteness.

355
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,870
And the groom's outlook is bright.

356
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:20,050
Right? Isn't the outlook good for my groom?

357
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:25,360
I have a knack for recognizing fortunes of people while I've been at this market.

358
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,930
Just looking at you, it's a daughter.

359
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:29,460
You'll have a pretty daughter.

360
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,100
You're so cool.

361
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,650
I bet the two of you can really heat things up.

362
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:36,080
Oh, what is this?! We haven't yet.

363
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,490
There seems to be nothing this ahjumma won't say!

364
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:43,430
Oh my, Ahjussi! Did you come to buy groceries?

365
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:46,910
-Bong Seon, are you here for groceries, too?
-Yes!

366
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:49,460
Ah, the ahjussi I told you about at Ki Restaurant.

367
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,720
This is our Chef.

368
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,240
Ah, I get to meet someone this famous.

369
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,060
It's nice to meet you.

370
00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:01,820
I heard from Bong, I mean, I've heard a lot about you from Bong Seon.

371
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,570
Oh, please give this to me. Give this to me.

372
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:04,810
No, it's okay.

373
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,980
Please give it to me. You're probably not completely recovered.

374
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,010
You should have brought Gyeong Mo.

375
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:12,480
No, he's more of a bother.

376
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,520
He just uselessly complains how heavy it is.

377
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,580
This won't do. It's heavy, come back in our car.

378
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,800
No, I can just take the bus!

379
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,210
No, it's too heavy. It's okay!

380
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,140
It's the same neighborhood, just take our car.

381
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,880
Isn't it okay?

382
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,270
Actually it isn't her car, it's my car.

383
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,300
I was going to take you back anyway.

384
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,160
It's on the way, so I'll take you.

385
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,280
I'm so sorry, what can I do?

386
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,760
Not at all.

387
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,620
Please give it to me, give it to me.

388
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,290
No, no, leave it. Leave it.

389
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:55,540
It's heavy.

390
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,850
My goodness.

391
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:06,320
You even drove me back, but I have nothing to offer you.

392
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,300
Wait just a moment.

393
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,540
At least have one of these.

394
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:15,470
Ah, yes, yes. Thank you.

395
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,540
Go ahead.

396
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,760
The restaurant is too shabby, isn't it?

397
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,850
It doesn't even compare to your restaurant.

398
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:35,130
Not at all. It's quaint and just right.

399
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:39,920
The taste of downtown Seoul is this kind of longstanding restaurant.

400
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:44,190
Business used to be quite good, but after my daughter left,

401
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,730
it looks like this. And there are fewer customers.

402
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:48,370
Your daughter...

403
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:52,970
She left us three years ago.

404
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,980
Ah.

405
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,970
Ahjussi, I put everything away inside.

406
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:02,910
Oh my gosh!

407
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:05,930
I meant to clean up.

408
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,980
Why the hose?

409
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,890
It was hard bringing the water to clean.

410
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,940
I was going to try connecting a hose.

411
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:16,040
But it isn't so easy because the faucet is inside the kitchen.

412
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:20,770
It would be easier to clean if you were able to connect a hose.

413
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:29,380
You should just leave it.

414
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,790
It's difficult and I can just hire someone to do it later.

415
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,280
It's simple.

416
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,360
Is it really simple?

417
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,940
Of course, I can do this with my eyes closed.

418
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:42,040
Ah, we should just hire someone and save your energy.

419
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,000
Why spend money on this?  It's a waste. It'll be done soon, just wait.

420
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,480
-The screwdriver.
-Okay.

421
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,170
I think it's the other direction.

422
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:04,610
The screwdriver was in wrong.

423
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:09,010
Wow! It works really well!

424
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:12,340
Hey, what did I tell you? Didn't I say it was simple?

425
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,260
My goodness, I put you through so much trouble.

426
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:18,310
Look at how you're sweating. I feel so bad.

427
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:20,800
I'm not sweating because it was difficult.

428
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,180
It's just because it's hot out.

429
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:27,230
Ah, I don't have anything else to offer.

430
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,980
But have a bowl of rice. I'll get it ready right away.

431
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,950
No, no, I should get going.

432
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:35,430
No, no! It's because I feel so sorry and thankful.

433
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:39,790
Ah, no, Chef doesn't eat ric...

434
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:42,390
Then, if you prepare it, we'll enjoy eating before we go.

435
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:46,490
-Okay, then sit for just a bit.
-Yes, thank you.

436
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,000
You don't eat rice though.

437
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,930
I don't eat it, but it doesn't mean that I can't eat it.

438
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:57,790
Why? Does it not suit your taste?

439
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:04,590
Ah, no. I'm just savoring it as I eat. It's so delicious.

440
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:07,880
Yes, please eat a lot. I have plenty of rice. Bong Seon, too.

441
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,320
Yes.

442
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:21,640
Oh! Na Bong Seon!

443
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:25,830
Hey, punk. Are you coming back from the game room again?

444
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:28,930
This is my son.

445
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:31,270
We've met before?

446
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:35,410
But what are you doing here? Mr. Star Chef?

447
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:37,480
Hey, hey, hey, don't even talk about it.

448
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,180
He drove me back from the market. He also connected the hose.

449
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:44,400
There's nothing that he can't do.

450
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,080
You should have left it, I was going to take care of it.

451
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,030
But why are you going around together?

452
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:55,030
You don't seem like someone who would go around with a kitchen assistant.

453
00:28:55,030 --> 00:29:00,150
Well, I'm not the type to split hairs over whom I go grocery shopping with.

454
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:03,900
You're cultivating a relationship that's below your level. Is that it?

455
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,560
You're so cool. Bravo!

456
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,110
This brat...

457
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,210
Please have a seat this way.

458
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:19,540
Why are you so late?

459
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,530
-The car broke down.
-There was an accident.

460
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:25,040
There was an accident? There was.

461
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,760
There was an accident.

462
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,740
What was it? Wasn't the traffic backed up?

463
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,510
It was backed up and then right then, my car broke down.

464
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:34,080
What can I do? I'll have to get it fixed. That's why. I'm going in.

465
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,430
Me, too.

466
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:37,600
Four Shreks, two Montbleu.

467
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,550
Did you understand me when I said two escargots..

468
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:43,930
Why are you so late? There are customers backed up...

469
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:46,290
Read the order.

470
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:49,680
The noodles are coming.

471
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,310
Why? Are you not feeling well?

472
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:54,360
No, my stomach's just a little upset.

473
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,160
Did you eat something that's causing indigestion? Your complexion is very white too.

474
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,420
No, it's bearable.

475
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,240
Bring some more Shrek pesto.

476
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,610
Yes.

477
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:08,650
Min Soo, are there a lot of orders left?

478
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:12,350
Once Shrek and snails go out to 8T, it'll be almost over. Are you still not feeling well?

479
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:15,860
-Yeah, a little. Can you finish up?
-Yes, Chef.

480
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:20,300
Chef, how about eating something more?

481
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:26,620
No, no. My mother said that when it's unsettled, that you have to keep eating and push it out.

482
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,920
What do you know? What do you mean push it out?

483
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,240
Chef, Chef, do a handstand. A handstand.

484
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,210
It's the best when I have indigestion.

485
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:36,100
A handstand? Just go and cover.

486
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,940
You have to do this! Do this!

487
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,790
Hey, you punk!

488
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:44,140
Ow, it hurts.

489
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,100
I'll take care of myself, just finish up.

490
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,580
Ow, now my front and back hurts.

491
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:51,220
Go on in, Chef!

492
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,900
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay. No, I'm not okay.

493
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,340
I know, so why did you eat two bowls of rice?

494
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:02,290
Give me your hand. You have to do this. Like this.

495
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:05,150
Hey, aren't you going to do things right?

496
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:07,400
I'm sorry, Chef.

497
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,250
-You should be sorry.
-I'm sorry!

498
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,770
- Have to prick- 
 - Wait a minute.

499
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:03,380
Ah, you startled me! I didn't even poke you yet!

500
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:07,820
You...  you know how to... do this, right? You're not just poking me anywhere, are you?

501
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,570
Were you fooled all your life?

502
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,750
Of course! Since I was little, if anyone in class said they had indigestion,

503
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:16,720
I was the one who'd stand them up and poke then.

504
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,740
Ah, if you do this, I have to start all over!

505
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:24,690
So, it's because I never saw you do this, that I don't know... OW!

506
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:28,340
Oh my, let me see, let me see. You really do have indigestion.

507
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,980
The dark blood is really...

508
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,750
Turn around.

509
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,710
How do you feel? Does it feel like it's going down?

510
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:37,770
I think it might be.

511
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:40,930
So why did you eat so much of the rice you don't even like?

512
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:43,050
Two bowls at that!

513
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:45,740
I mean, he gave me another bowl saying I was eating so well, what could I do?

514
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:48,090
It's because you were acting like you liked it.

515
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:50,580
Is it because you have good manners or are you just stupid?

516
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,930
It's because I have good manners, kid!

517
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:56,390
Am I supposed to say I'm not eating it when an adult gives it to me?

518
00:33:56,390 --> 00:34:00,580
And I felt bad for that elder.

519
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:04,880
I don't know if it's because his daughter died first, but there was such sadness in his eyes.

520
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:09,230
An elder like that happily offered it to me,

521
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,850
how could I tell him I wasn't going to eat it?

522
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:18,470
What is that look in your eyes? That glistening.

523
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:21,370
You just fell for me again, didn't you?

524
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:24,360
Fall for you? What are you talking about?

525
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,030
Just wait here. I'll go buy some medicine at the pharmacy.

526
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:29,300
-What? Now?
-Yeah.

527
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,920
No, let's go together.

528
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,700
The patient can stay seated.

529
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,860
I'll be right back. I'm really, really okay.

530
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:38,940
-It's not dangerous at all.
-Let's go together.

531
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,420
What if the ghosts come out?

532
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:44,290
Seriou...

533
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,730
Ghosts.

534
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:49,210
Let's go together.

535
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:52,370
How do you feel? Do you think you're feeling better?

536
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:54,940
Yeah, I'm not sure if it's the medicine or the finger prick,

537
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,660
but it's very comfortable now.

538
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,310
That's a good thing.

539
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:02,170
If that's the case, pyonngg!

540
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:05,690
Ah, sheesh! What, this?

541
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:06,770
No.

542
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:10,320
You can't wait that little bit?

543
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,240
Oh! Chef, let's go play on that playground over there.

544
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,160
It will help you completely digest. This turned out well!

545
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,430
Wha-what playground? Are you a kid?

546
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:21,720
Hurry up and come here!

547
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,360
Chef! It will help you digest.

548
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,030
Eh? Eh? Eh? Catch me if you can!

549
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:30,920
What tag? So childish.

550
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,690
You can't get me!

551
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:37,210
Hey, look here.

552
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:40,230
Ahhh! You can't get me!

553
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:42,200
Hey! Hey!

554
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,340
You're not stopping there?

555
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,880
I'm seriously going to....

556
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,360
Ah!

557
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,160
-Hey, hey, hey!
-Ow!!

558
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,690
-It hurts!
-Are you alright?

559
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:57,130
-I'm okay.
-That's why I said. Try getting up.

560
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:00,360
-Ah!
-Come sit over here.

561
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,050
Let me see.

562
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:05,210
Ah! I told you not to do this.

563
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:07,390
-Goofing around.
-I'm fine.

564
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:11,420
I got it.

565
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,950
You scared me.

566
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,590
What?

567
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,290
Because I like you.

568
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:52,170
What?

569
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:57,840
I like you so much, Chef. So much.

570
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,990
Chef, did you know this?

571
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:25,740
Lately, I'm doing so many things I didn't get to before.

572
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,550
Like what?

573
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:34,330
Holding hands and walking with someone I like.

574
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:36,520
And riding a bike together.

575
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:40,240
Just hanging out at a playground like this.

576
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,870
These are all things I didn't get to do before.

577
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:46,760
Ah, I didn't even have time to dream it.

578
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:51,130
I was busy, but I also wasn't in a place to be able to.

579
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:53,440
What else weren't you able to do?

580
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,680
There's a ton of stuff.

581
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,640
I haven't been to a theme park.

582
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,500
I haven't been to Namsan.

583
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:04,550
Ah, I've never been on a cruise ship, too.

584
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:07,660
And a trip,

585
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:11,560
our MT was probably my first time, after growing up.

586
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,080
-Really?
-Yeah.

587
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:18,110
What were you doing not doing those things until now?

588
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:21,750
Ay, I was busy just trying to survive.

589
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,520
Thanks, Chef.

590
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,440
For letting me do all those things I wasn't able to do.

591
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,600
Okay. Let's go on a trip.

592
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,250
Eh?

593
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:45,440
I said let's go on a trip. Overnight.

594
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,640
You wanted to go before.

595
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,010
After the store closes, we can leave on a train.

596
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:52,020
And just come back the next morning after having fun.

597
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:55,120
Let's go. Of course I'd like going overnight.

598
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,540
But why did you suddenly change your mind, Chef?

599
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,840
You freaked out over going overnight.

600
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,570
In case I might attack you.

601
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:05,190
-It's okay.
-What?

602
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:13,910
 I said I want to go with you now. Overnight. On a trip.

603
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:20,670
I'm not holding back.

604
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:23,850
You better be warned.

605
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:28,480
But then you better not be unable to sleep,

606
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,640
because you're so happy. Uncultured-like.

607
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:44,120
Do I have to make reservations ahead of time?

608
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:49,760
Or do I just go and casually do it there?

609
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,400
She'll see through me if I make reservations ahead of time.

610
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,530
Calm down, calm down.

611
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,840
This is pretty. This is really pretty.

612
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,550
This looks okay, too.

613
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:08,350
The bed is pretty. The bed is.

614
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,700
The bed is pretty.

615
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:37,410
Oh my gosh!

616
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:40,840
It's me, Unni. I scared you, didn't I?

617
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:47,710
Ay! You! In case anyone didn't know you were a ghost!

618
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:50,570
Sitting there in the middle of the night.

619
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:52,760
You sure know how to scare a person.

620
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:57,180
I came because I wanted to talk to you, but you were sleeping.

621
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:11,550
What? What's wrong?

622
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:19,610
Chef...  Chef wants to go on a trip overnight.

623
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:22,080
Overnight?

624
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,840
Hey! Then this is your chance.

625
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:31,410
A man and woman going on an overnight trip means it's a given.

626
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:33,240
That's why.

627
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,180
What do you mean that's why?

628
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:37,770
What on earth are you saying?

629
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:39,960
Say it so that I can understand, girl!

630
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:43,560
I don't know myself either, why I feel this way.

631
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:48,840
Tomorrow I might be able to release the vexation that I've been hoping and hoping for.

632
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:52,820
But I don't feel happy.

633
00:41:52,820 --> 00:42:01,360
Unni, I like Chef so much.

634
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:07,810
The things he says to me, the way he looks at me,

635
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:10,280
even the feeling I had when he held my hand.

636
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,880
Those are emotions I wasn't able to feel once when I was alive.

637
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:17,910
It was so warm and it felt like my heart was becoming mushy.

638
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:21,140
-Surely you're not...
-I know that, too.

639
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,930
I'm not Na Bong Seon.

640
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:26,850
I'm only borrowing her body, but . . .

641
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,620
but, I'm so upset.

642
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:37,360
Why didn't I feel these things not even once when I was alive?

643
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,580
After dying, and it's just to release my vexation at that . . .

644
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:42,870
You get a hold of yourself.

645
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:46,010
Do you know what's the most dangerous thing to ghosts like you?

646
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:48,420
It's precisely those emotions.

647
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,490
You'll mistake yourself as human,

648
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:53,680
and hurt and be sad and be happy,

649
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,880
and then you'll start to feel greed.

650
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,370
Even if you remain as an evil spirit,

651
00:42:57,370 --> 00:43:00,800
you'll want to live mixed up with people, that desire.

652
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,110
But evil spirits, that's a different thing.

653
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:06,300
Ghosts like you

654
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:09,910
possessing people's bodies is completely different than that.

655
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:11,890
They will never rest eternally.

656
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:13,800
They attach themselves to those who are gloomy and dark,

657
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,580
they go around doing evil and making trouble.

658
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:22,260
Remain firm,

659
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,110
and release your vexation.

660
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:27,320
Go to a better place. Quickly.

661
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:33,570
The more time passes, you'll only be hurt, girl.

662
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,560
My goodness.

663
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,340
Tomorrow's reservation team is for sixteen.

664
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:58,860
-Yes, Chef.
-Check it over.
-Yes.

665
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:07,900
Hey, Na Bong. Today, we're going to finish up quickly, so just know that.

666
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:13,460
Why isn't there any response? The words don't come out because you're so pleased?

667
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:18,360
I guess so. It must be because I'm so happy that the words don't come out.

668
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:21,160
-I'm going to go down for a moment.
-Where?

669
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:24,540
Transport Restaurant. I'll be right back.

670
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:29,980
Is there honey over there or what?

671
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:32,900
She has a lot of love to give.

672
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:37,140
Hey, Chef, should we go drinking after work since it's been so long?

673
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:41,080
Because I used your card before. If you treat the first round, I'll take the second.

674
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,560
I can't, I have plans.

675
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,660
Isn't it just the meetings of the chefs?

676
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,180
Okay, fine. I'll treat both rounds.

677
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:49,240
I said I'm not going on the first round or the second, so you guys go by yourselves.

678
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,860
I got it. I got it. I will buy sheep intestines.

679
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:55,200
I said I'm not going!!

680
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:00,340
You really can't understand. I said I'm not going! Even if the sky splits in two, I'm not going, so go by yourselves!

681
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:02,740
Quit the nonsense and go clean that up now.

682
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:15,420
- He gets mad even if I say I'm buying the drinks. 
 - Are you really going to buy grilled sheep intestines?

683
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,300
 He says he's not going even if the sky splits into two!

684
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,580
I said I'm not eating!

685
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:23,480
Are the sheep intestines round two or three?

686
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:26,040
He's not going to go!!

687
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,000
You're here?

688
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,500
Yes, I'm here. Is it more comfortable to clean now?

689
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,620
It is.

690
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:50,320
If you do this, it makes it easier when the orders come in quickly.

691
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:57,760
It is. I didn't know this and every day just went about haphazardly.

692
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,200
Thank you.

693
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:05,000
And also, these extra plates, since most customers ask for them, so

694
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,040
I think it would be good to leave them on the table, Ahjussi.

695
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,460
You're so strange today.

696
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:16,640
It feels like I won't be seeing you for a while. Are you going somewhere, Bong Seon?

697
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,600
What? No, that's not it,

698
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:23,500
but I think I'll be busy and won't be able to come for a while.

699
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:27,400
Ahjussi, you have to take care of your health. Stop drinking,

700
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:31,520
and make sure to exercise regularly.

701
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:37,000
 You really are strange today. Okay, I understand. I understand.

702
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,120
 I'll listen to everything you say.

703
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:47,700
 Father, I might not be able to see you again.

704
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:53,280
 Stop thinking about me now, and you have to live happily with Gyeong Mo, Father.

705
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,140
Enjoy.

706
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,960
Did you get some contribution money? I thought it's hard earning money because you lost your supernatural powers.

707
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,240
What's with the beef ribs today?

708
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,320
Don't ask and just eat. It's because I feel sorry.

709
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,520
What are you sorry about?

710
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:16,420
I told you not to ask. If you knew, we'd both feel bad.

711
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:19,500
Okay, I'll eat...

712
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:29,660
You're not planning to wrap things up here and go somewhere, are you?

713
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:36,020
You better not do that! It was so hard finding a girlfriend like you. If you do, I'm really going to cry then.

714
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,000
You like me?

715
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,680
Of course, I like you. I already told you.

716
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:47,140
That men are disgusting.

717
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:49,160
Um.

718
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:55,700
Okay, fine. I like you, too.

719
00:47:55,700 --> 00:48:00,260
It's not like he'll be worn out from one encounter. It's leery only because it's with a ghost.

720
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:05,790
It's an experience that money can't buy that's all.  It's  nothing to lose, but rejuvenating.

721
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:08,780
Rejuvenating? What are you talking about?

722
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:12,800
Oh, there's something like that. Let's eat.

723
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:18,580
You took care of most of the orders, right? Let's stop taking orders.

724
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:22,680
Already? It's just past 8:00.

725
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:28,540
It was really hot out. If you stay in front of the fire on a day like today, it will be really hard on you.

726
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:32,860
We need days like today to help us keep going, right?

727
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:33,960
Finish up.

728
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,180
Yes, Chef!

729
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:41,280
Something is strange between them.

730
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,750
I'm going to go up first and get ready. So wrap up here and come up. We'll leave when we're ready.

731
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:47,500
Chef, are we really going on a trip today?

732
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:52,900
Of course, we're going! Why? Are you so excited you'll die?

733
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:58,240
Yes, I'm so excited. I'm not sure if this is real or a dream.

734
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,000
Yes.

735
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:15,300
Fine, I should go, what else can I do? Am I going to stay here for a thousand years as an evil spirit?

736
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:18,940
There's no reason not to go, Sin Soon Ae. You're going no matter what.

737
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:23,700
You're going to go and release that three year old vexation.

738
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:28,420
It's a historic day. It's so exciting!

739
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:34,480
Oh, what am I going to do, seriously?

740
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:40,000
No, no. What are you doing? Pull yourself together. Sin Soon Ae,

741
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,300
why else was I here until now? I have to go no matter what.

742
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:47,320
Let's go.

743
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:51,240
Oh, okay. I should go.

744
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,780
Chef!

745
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:04,660
I mean, why did you drink so much starting this early in the evening?

746
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:11,280
On a day like today. Okay, just stay right there and don't move.

747
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:17,100
My mom is already wasted, she's driving me crazy.

748
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,780
She wants you to go, Chef?

749
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:22,640
Yeah, I think I have to go.

750
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,160
Ah. Okay.

751
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:29,820
Let's do this. I'll quickly go and take my mother home.

752
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:36,190
Let's meet at Yongsan station at 9:30. Since there's a 10:00 ITX, we'll have plenty of time. Got it?

753
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:27,640
 Let's start like this.

754
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:35,980
 And let's go slowly together for a long, long time, Na Bong Seon.

755
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:34,210
Oh, Son! Come here!

756
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:36,130
Mom, you weren't drunk?

757
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:39,710
Did someone say I was drunk? I only said I had a drink. This is only my third glass.

758
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:42,890
Earlier, you were slurring with your speech and out of your senses.

759
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:45,470
Who? Oh, PD Lee! Over here!

760
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:48,350
-Oh, Professor.
-You're here?

761
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:50,870
I didn't know Seon Woo would be here, too.

762
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:53,910
What is this, did you call So Hyeong, Mom?

763
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:57,170
I haven't see PD Lee in a long... Sit, sit, sit.

764
00:53:57,170 --> 00:53:59,890
Ah!

765
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:04,890
I just forgot I was meeting professors for a seminar. I have to go first.

766
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:09,710
The two of you drink together. Here.

767
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:14,170
This is a Shil Hotel couples' spa gift coupon.

768
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:18,550
The two of you go together. The two of you. I'm going first. Please give us some new glasses here!

769
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:19,950
-Mom!
-Professor!

770
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:23,490
Have a good time! I'll take care of the check.

771
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:29,750
I'm sorry. Sheesh.

772
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:35,990
The professor is so cute, using such obvious tactics.

773
00:54:36,890 --> 00:54:41,250
Actually, I wanted to talk to you. Let's go somewhere less suffocating.

774
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:43,090
Oh,

775
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:51,510
I wanted to come back to this campus with you.

776
00:54:54,410 --> 00:54:59,730
Actually, before I dated Chan Gyu, I saw you first.

777
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:08,870
Strangely, I kept thinking of you, but you didn't seem to pay any attention to me at all.

778
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:17,230
Lately, I keep thinking that it's because I'm so used to it, it was so comfortable,

779
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:19,990
that I didn't realize how I felt.

780
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:20,810
You know, So Hyeong . . .

781
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:26,560
I'll say it first. If I hear you first, I don't think I'll be able to say what I want to.

782
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,890
I'll go first.

783
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:36,370
I found myself a good person.

784
00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:43,770
In the end, you beat me to it. You bad guy.

785
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:47,850
I think I know who even if you don't tell me.

786
00:55:49,870 --> 00:55:53,570
I just got rejected by you, didn't I?

787
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:57,050
I think so.

788
00:55:57,050 --> 00:55:58,510
Ay,

789
00:55:58,510 --> 00:56:02,610
it's embarrassing. It's so embarrassing.

790
00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:07,010
How am I supposed to face you now?

791
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:09,510
Oh!

792
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:19,810

793
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:38,010
I'm sorry, Chef. But still, I don't think it's today.

794
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:42,790
I can't go like this.

795
00:56:43,850 --> 00:56:50,430
I know I'm being greedy, but just for a little while. Hmm?

796
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:53,330
Just a little while longer, Chef.

797
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:04,990
Chef!

798
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:11,660
Chef, are you back? Chef?

799
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:17,020
Is he still waiting at Yongsan station?

800
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:22,880
Chef! Are you not inside?

801
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,360
Chef!

802
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:29,200
Na Bong!

803
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:33,440
Chef! Did you wait long?

804
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:39,800
-I'm really sorry. I did something unforgivable. You waited long, didn't you?
-Huh?

805
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,720
You forgot your cellphone, didn't you?

806
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:48,020
I kept calling but you didn't answer, so I couldn't talk to you. Do you know how upset I was?

807
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:55,960
Why aren't you saying anything? Are you mad? Are you very mad?

808
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:59,880
No, well, more than being mad,

809
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:03,440
what happened? Why didn't you come?

810
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:08,720
Well, it's a long story. Did you eat?

811
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:12,660
Here. For you VVIP.

812
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:15,840
Special entree. Sirloin steak.

813
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,720
It looks like it was snowed on. It's really pretty.

814
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,620
Next is the cocktail.

815
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:25,940
This is the first time seeing this, isn't it?

816
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:27,300
Yes.

817
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,840
I made that recipe. I will tell you later.

818
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,820
Yes, Chef.

819
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:38,040
Please shake it.

820
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:49,260
-This is a romantic cocktail. For couples. 
-Wow.

821
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:56,740
Just as the wine melts the cotton candy in an instant, it means that I will melt your heart in an instant.

822
00:58:56,740 --> 00:59:00,120
Oh, the cocktail is sexy indeed.

823
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:04,440
You should feel honored.

824
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:08,320
Do you think it's common for me to cook for just one person like this?

825
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:11,180
Yes, I'll consider it an honor.

826
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:12,950
Here.

827
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:19,600
It's really delicious. The meat totally melts in my mouth.

828
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:22,220
Of course, who cooked it?

829
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:26,480
Tell me whatever you want to eat. I'll make it all for you.

830
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,960
Really? But what I want to eat isn't your specialty.

831
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,540
What is it?

832
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:38,720
Stir fried blood sausage and tripe. Oh, I really love that!

833
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:42,460
Why is the stuff you want to eat just like you?

834
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,920
You  haven't tried it before, have you? You probably can't, can you?

835
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:49,320
Why couldn't I? What is there I can't do? I'll make it for you.

836
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,720
Really?

837
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:57,880
If I promise you that, will you forgive me for what I did wrong today?

838
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:59,870
Well, mostly.

839
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:04,920
I'm really sorry. You probably had your hopes up.

840
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:15,080
Instead, I'll make you feel as if you went on a trip.

841
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:17,700
-What?
-Really.

842
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:34,160
Americano, on the menu.

843
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:38,040
I'm probably better than most baristas.

844
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:47,000
It's really good. Do you have a barista degree or something?

845
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,480
No. I just followed the instructions.

846
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:58,440
How is it? Doesn't it feel like we're really on a trip? Is there anything big about a trip?

847
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:03,360
Pitching a tent and pretending we're camping, as long as it feels like a trip, it's a trip.

848
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:06,880
I guess so. It does really feel like we're on a trip.

849
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:10,740
This is nice.

850
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:17,780
I saw So Hyeong earlier. Mom had called her.

851
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:25,820
And I told So Hyeong that I have someone good for me.

852
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:36,640
It was an emotion I dragged along for such a long time.

853
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:41,380
But I felt so relieved after cutting it off.

854
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:46,500
So what I'm saying is . . .

855
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,420
you have to take responsibility for me now.

856
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,580
If you leave me, you're dead.
