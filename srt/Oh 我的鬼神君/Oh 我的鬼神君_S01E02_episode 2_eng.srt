1
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,950
 Oh My Ghostess

2
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:14,900

3
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,360
 Oh My Ghostess

4
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,670
Oh, it's nice to meet you too.

5
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,510
- Give up the key, and stop joking around.
 -What?

6
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,630
Give me the key!

7
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,190
What key?

8
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:01,610
Seriously, where is it?

9
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:05,340
 This person, seriously!

10
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,010
Chef.

11
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,970
Are you all right? You're not hurt.

12
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,720
You...you...are you nuts?!

13
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,960
Hey, even though you quit, this behavior as if you've got nothing to lose is not right.

14
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,640
 What's this? Did I make a mistake?

15
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,170
Maybe she is drunk. She doesn't smell like it, though.

16
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,080
You...quickly tell the chef you're sorry.

17
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:45,550
 Chef? His name is Chef? He's not a foreigner.

18
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,730
Just give me the key.

19
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:54,780
What's this about a key...

20
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,130
Oh, this?

21
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,150
Bong Seon, are you alright? You're not sick or something?

22
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,900
Seriously, Na Bong Seon, you're amazing. You're awesome.

23
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:13,350
 This is not working. I better get out quickly.

24
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,650
 Huh? What's going on?

25
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,420
Hey.

26
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,720
 - If you go doing that too frequently, then by mistake~
- Wait a minute.

27
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,180
 you end up meeting a person who matches your frequency, then you~

28
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,590
 By chance...

29
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,730
 can be confined in there and might never come out.

30
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:34,450
 Per chance, this girl?

31
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,890
Darn it?

32
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:41,260
 No, I have to get out. If I get trapped in here, it'll be hard to get out.

33
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,800
 I have to get out!

34
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,320
Hey, Bong Seon!

35
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,420
- She fainted.
- What's the matter?

36
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,600
- Bong Seon!
- She fainted suddenly?

37
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,000
Let's lay her down.

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,270
Massage, massage.

39
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,060
Bong Seon?

40
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,570
 Today's Special
Oh My Ghostess
Episode 2

41
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,320
Seriously.

42
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,430
Is she putting up a show or

43
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,830
if she really fainted, I can't tell.

44
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:23,020
Still, shouldn't we call 911?

45
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:28,290
Her breathing is normal and the color of her complexion seems to have come back. I think she is going to be all right.

46
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:32,830
I was freaking scared. Maybe she has some chronic illness.

47
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:38,360
 Darn it. I gained consciousness but should I open my eyes or not?

48
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,190
Hey, doesn't she have insomnia?

49
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,490
Maybe she is like this because of her medicine?

50
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:48,440
- Then, is she intoxicated on drugs?
- That must be it, otherwise it doesn't make sense.

51
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,350
Hey, did you see that? That hip throw...

52
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:57,300
 Jeez, this is hopeless. It doesn't look like it'll be easy to get out of this body.

53
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:03,430
 Oh! That's nice.

54
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,270
 Oh, isn't this totally bath full of men?

55
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,000
 It's not going to be as bad as I thought.

56
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:14,400
She is licking her lips. Is she dreaming?

57
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,000
Yup, she is dreaming.

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,510
She is fine. She doesn't have to go to the hospital.

59
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,220
Hey.

60
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,720
You can wake up now.

61
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,740
I saw you sneaking in a peek earlier. So stop it.

62
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,960
You caught me.

63
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:54,830
I'm alright I said. Except for being embarrassed.

64
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,030
It'll sting if it touches water.

65
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:03,330
- What are you going to do with Bong Seon?
- What do you mean?

66
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:07,930
She's the one who wrote the letter and left. I'll have to send her off when she awakes.

67
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,430
She didn't leave because she wanted to. Didn't she get pushed out?

68
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:16,010
Whatever. That might be the best thing for her life.

69
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:19,100
No, I don't thing it's the right time yet.

70
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:25,860
If you send her out there when she is not ready, people who are weak like us wouldn't be able to endure it.

71
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,500
Are you alright Bong Seon? You don't need to go to the hospital?

72
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,290
- You guys talk.
- - Talk about what, between the two of us?

73
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:43,400
Where are you going?

74
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:59,490
Did you do some sports? Like Hapkido....forget it.

75
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,750
Are you alright?

76
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:10,860
Excuse me... earlier, I think I made a slight mistake.

77
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,290
What? You  think  you made a mistake?

78
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:19,770
No, that's not it. I mean, I made a mistake.

79
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:23,510
I'm not in the best condition, so I think I was a bit out of it.

80
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,660
So, it would be great if you would forgive me this once.

81
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,100
Sit down.

82
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,000
Na Bong Seon.

83
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,570
When you left like that, it wasn't an easy decision to make, right?

84
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:50,460
But, you're asking for forgiveness right now, does that mean you're not ready and want to stay here?

85
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,100
Yes, well...probably.

86
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,340
Then, why did you leave? Because of what I said?

87
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,000
Yes, yes. That's it. That.

88
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:11,790
Alright, I understand. Then let's do this. I'll give you one month as a grace period. You decide during this period.

89
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:15,640
If you will dedicate your life to this kitchen or not.

90
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,270
Okay! No matter what, deal!

91
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,760
Now that we've reconciled, let's do well.

92
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:30,600
You're not in your right mind yet. Heol.

93
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,740
Ah, darn it. That guy really keeps on nagging.

94
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,250
He looks fine but...

95
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:41,400
What's up with this girl's character? What am I supposed to do?

96
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:47,750
 How bizarre, the kitchen doesn't seem unfamiliar.

97
00:07:54,570 --> 00:08:00,300
Wow, this is a magnet. How interesting.

98
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,290
I always wanted to do this.

99
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,750
What are you doing at someone else's spot? Go to your spot!

100
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,770
My, my spot? Where? Here?

101
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:25,250
You're still not back to normal? Your spot is in front of the dishwasher.

102
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,090
Dish washing...

103
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:32,640
- Dish washing...
- Dong Cheol, where did you put the duty log?

104
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,660
In the storage...

105
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:38,450
I told you to put things back where it belongs. You don't listen at all.

106
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:42,460
Min Soo! Check how many raw noodles are in the fridge instead of making a show later at peak time.

107
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,230
Yes, Chef.

108
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:51,910
Seriously, that darn nagging. Hey, Bong! Check how many raw noodles are in the fridge.

109
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:56,630
Why should I do that? Didn't he order you to do it?

110
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,700
"Didn't he order you to do it?"

111
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,130
She's gone totally wacko. Na Bong Seon!

112
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:05,550
- Oh my! I got startled. Why are you screaming?!
- What is wrong with you, really?!

113
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:08,430
Are you really nuts or what?

114
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,490
What's wrong with you?

115
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,960
Well...

116
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,300
That's not it...

117
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:21,080
I'm still not back to my normal mental state. I'll go wash my face.

118
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:31,210
Ah, darn it. Seriously.

119
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,750
Just what is this girl's character?

120
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,520
I have to roughly copy her. Ah, I seriously can't get used to it.

121
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,550
You should have worn something else. The laces keep on getting loose.

122
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:43,420
I know, right? I was out of my mind in the morning.

123
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,520
Should I quickly go over and bring another one?

124
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,750
Don't bother, it's all for show anyway.

125
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,310
 I thought he was a jerk, but he's nice to his sister.

126
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:55,220
 I guess he's not a completely bad guy.

127
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:01,590
What are you doing? It's busy yet you're not going in.

128
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:05,960
 As expected, he's not a good guy. I have to be alert.

129
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,390
The special for Table 1 didn't come out yet. Please hurry up.

130
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:22,240
Ah! Who folded this? Min Soo, is the special not ready yet?

131
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,740
-Hurry up! Hurry!
-Yes, Chef!

132
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,330
Take the pumpkin salad with you.

133
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:29,660
Table 3, 2 specials and 2 stew pastas.

134
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,370
Really. This restaurant must be a jackpot.

135
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,110
No matter how much I wash, the number of dishes doesn't decrease.

136
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:42,980
Damn it! Why am I suffering?

137
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,690
Min Soo, get in here. This won't do. Dong Cheol, come in here and cover.

138
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,130
Yes!

139
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,120
 -Hey Cordon! 
-Yes!

140
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,820
-Yes 
 - Prepare the mise en place!  The mise en place.

141
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,960
Yes, I understand!

142
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,480
Na Bong Sun, don't you see the dishes piling?

143
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,190
Yes! I'm washing them right now.

144
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,410
It's so hot.

145
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,830
 Oh my...

146
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,140
Hey, Bong, why don't you get out?

147
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,950
I don't want to move.

148
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:12,210
You're really crazy.

149
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:20,080
 Oh my god...

150
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,720
Hey, Na Bong. Come here and clean the floor.

151
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,250
Sauce spilled.

152
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,870
Yes. I cleaned it.

153
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,120
Woah!

154
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,410
Hey, Na Bong Seon!

155
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:41,730
If you're going to order me around, say it in one setting! Why, what?

156
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:46,420
Don't you know that you have to wipe the floor with a dry rag? Is it one rag a day today?

157
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,890
Perhaps, are you taking revenge?

158
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,530
Are you purposely trying to make me fail?

159
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,280
No way...

160
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:59,840
If I take revenge, I would break a few ribs for taking revenge.

161
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:04,780
Hey, Na Bong Seon, did you perhaps hurt your head?

162
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,370
I'm totally flustered right now.

163
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,430
I'm so busy.

164
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:13,900
Hey. Hello? I'm working right now so-

165
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,930
Where?

166
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:20,280
That doesn't make sense. Assault?

167
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:25,580
I just pushed the Ahjumma because she talking trash about blog or something.

168
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,610
How is that an assault?

169
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:30,430
Officer, is this an assault? This?

170
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:34,420
I understand the situation, but you've been charged and she needed to be hospitalized for 3 weeks.

171
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:38,700
Hospitalized for 3 weeks? I really can't believe this.

172
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:43,440
Hyungnim! You've worked hard.

173
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,620
I talked with Eun Hee. What happened?

174
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,370
I mean... This...

175
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:57,560
Really? What about Oppa? Talk well with them.

176
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,370
You can leave work early.

177
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:04,390
Ah, yes. Leave. Hurry up and leave.

178
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,600
Come here, come here.

179
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,430
Hey, this, this finally exploded.

180
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:16,390
I knew something like this would happen. People should moderately be arrogant.

181
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,940
No matter what it is, once you cross a line, only the insufficient ones are the bad ones.

182
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,260
It's true that he's well off.

183
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:25,280
Can you really say that in this context, you Cordon punk?

184
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,000
Anyway, this being an assault is a bit too much.

185
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,150
That's right. Seoul people are really scary.

186
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,990
How can they sue over such a small issue?

187
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:37,540
So, did someone hit someone?

188
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,440
Did Chef, or whatever he is?

189
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,460
It happened because of you.

190
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:49,000
Wow... You're going to ignore it in this situation?

191
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,600
That's right, right? It happened because of me, right?

192
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,070
These days my body is a bit unbalanced.

193
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:01,200
Bong. What are you touching right now?

194
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:08,470
I have a lot of affection so I have a tendency to be adhesive to people.

195
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,310
Sorry.

196
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,610
I was curious about this since before. Why are there so much of this?

197
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:26,110
Do you all together run with this? Huh?

198
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,280
Just because.

199
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,400
She's strange. Strange...

200
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:39,390
- Hey. 
 - What is it?

201
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,720
Yeah.

202
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,870
Hey, but isn't Bong a bit weird?

203
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:50,800
She's Bong Seon for sure, but she doesn't seem like Bong Seon.

204
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,990
But it's not like she's not Bong Seon. It's very strange.

205
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,650
There's this kind of saying.

206
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:03,250
Like Bong Seon, but you who is not Bong Seon, you.
(Copying the lyrics from Some by Jung Gigo x Soyu)

207
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,700
Her way of talking is the most weird. It's not how she talked originally.

208
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,730
That's right.

209
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:12,600
Look at that. If a guy who doesn't even care about others notices it, then it's a done deal.

210
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,970
Why is she like that?

211
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,910
Did she mentally receive something like a shock from causing a fire yesterday?

212
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,990
There's something like that. Something that comes out in dramas.

213
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:25,070
They have a bunch of different personalities.

214
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,770
- Multiple personality disorder. 
 - Right. Muliple personality disorder.

215
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:30,760
Do you think she has that? Maybe we didn't know before.

216
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:36,550
Or does she have anger control disorder?

217
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,720
I saw not long ago in television,

218
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,620
if you get that, then your eyes would flip back and commit things like murder. That's on the TV.

219
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:48,130
That's right, Hyung. Look at the murders caused by noise complaints between neighbors.

220
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:53,480
A place where there's more stress, there's more psychopaths.

221
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:59,100
They receive nagging, and keep on receiving, and after they receive it,

222
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,470
they explode! And they stab and poke!

223
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:05,710
Stay still.
-Why is this so bended and short?

224
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:09,730
Bong received a lot  .

225
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:14,120
If you think about all of it piling up, she'd probably want to kill all of us.

226
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,980
No way...

227
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,380
That's right.
-No way.

228
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:27,320
This is totally a samurai knife.

229
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,230
There's even an initial. They can certainly tell which knife is their's.

230
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:34,450
Is there something to do?

231
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:39,110
Should I try?

232
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:44,600
It's fun.

233
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,760
This. Who's is it?

234
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,410
This works really well. It's a total masterpiece!

235
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:55,790
Hey, hey. Wait, wait. Why don't we talk after putting down the knife.

236
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:58,240
But, if I stab someone with this, do they die?

237
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,500
They die. They die.

238
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,720
Why are they like that?

239
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,730
I'm going crazy. Really. Should I countercharge?

240
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,650
No, there's no point.

241
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:26,860
The power blogger is not a normal ahjumma.

242
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:29,340
She said that she won't settle even if you give her one thousand dollars.

243
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,910
Really.

244
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:35,400
Why don't you think that you've been bitten by a crazy dog and apologize?

245
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:41,000
What apology? I'm pissed off that I'm bitten by a dog, so why should I?

246
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,650
But you're a public figure.

247
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:47,520
What about a public figure? Is being a public figure a sin?

248
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,570
Why does that have to be a weakness?

249
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,240
Let's go to court then.

250
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,780
That's good.  I want to see her give it a try.

251
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,780
It's not something to do according to your emotions, Hyungnim.

252
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:02,650
Humans are originally emotional animals. If poop is dirty...

253
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,240
Isn't that Chef Kang Seon Woo?

254
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,140
 I will make sure not to make it like that.

255
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,940
Isn't he pretty hot these days.

256
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:14,860
But can we really leave when Chef didn't come? It's uncomfortable.

257
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,570
Eun Hee told us to leave. We should leave if she tells us to. It's bothersome if we stay.

258
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:22,080
Anyways, she's probably embarrassed. It's not even a good thing.

259
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,930
Something that should have been exploded just exploded.

260
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:29,780
I see it this way. I was actually pissed that our chef was too well off.

261
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,530
It's true that he's well off.

262
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:35,410
In the context, I don't think that's what I meant.

263
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,130
Why do you hit me?

264
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:40,110
Sorry.

265
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,940
Why are you looking?

266
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,530
Please go out! Please!

267
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:46,170
Then where do I wash up?

268
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:49,860
Close the door?
-What are you looking at?
--Hurry up and go out!

269
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,220
Yes. Sorry. Yes.

270
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,380
Excuse me.

271
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,960
My instinct was correct. These guys...

272
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,320
This idiot.

273
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,020
Hey, Bong! You, Bong! When did you even shower before going  ?

274
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:11,060
I feel like today is a bit more hot.

275
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,380
But what is that stare?

276
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:25,060
Have strength. It's okay. Do people care about those things these days? Right?

277
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,890
Fighting!

278
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,310
What?

279
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,830
It's because she saw it for a moment!

280
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:38,500
My pride hurts. My pride hurts!

281
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,750
Let's go together!

282
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,690
You don't go this way.

283
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:47,070
It's this way today. For sure.

284
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,000
Why are you like this?

285
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,460
What? What is?

286
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,520
You're weird all day long.

287
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,920
What is it? Do you think a lot after going out and coming back?

288
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,030
What?

289
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:05,740
Did you decide to change all the day because you didn't like to suffer?

290
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:11,500
Well, that too, but should I say it's like an overall concern about life?

291
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:16,070
But I don't think it's something to talk about standing...

292
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:21,080
Should we go somewhere else and refreshingly have some beer...

293
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,820
Call?

294
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,540
Let's go.

295
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,190
Let's go.

296
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:33,140
For a moment. Let's go there and rest for a moment.

297
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,460
I don't want to. I'm going to go home.

298
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:40,070
One hour. Just for one hour. I won't even touch a finger.

299
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,810
I'm going to sleep at home!

300
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:44,640
For a moment. Thirty minutes. Ten minutes.

301
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,360
Taxi!
-Excuse me!

302
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:53,330
To Yong San.

303
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:57,390
Bong, I'm leaving!

304
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,550
Darn it! What's with that guy?

305
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:04,110
Made me hot and bothered for nothing again.

306
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:08,140
Is he drunk? Or does he not see me as a woman?

307
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,250
Such a country girl...

308
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:17,490
She's like this, so how can I do my business?

309
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:21,190
How could I possess this kind of girl?

310
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:25,660
Hopeless.

311
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:31,410
Where is her home?

312
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,080
What is this?

313
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,010
Hello?

314
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:43,140
 Yeah. Room number 305.

315
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,080
 This is the student dorm. When are you going to vacate the room?

316
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,700
Student dorm?

317
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:51,380
Is this a place where a person lives?

318
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:54,900
Then it's no better than being a ghost.

319
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,710
Look at this. What is this?

320
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,770
What are you looking at?

321
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:06,280
This girl, this girl. She attracts a lot of ghosts.

322
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:13,350
What is this? Look at this. With fragrance.

323
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:19,360
Why is the sword so big? Aigoo... Wow...

324
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,570
She's totally Lee Soon Shin.
(Lee Soon Shin: Korean general)

325
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:32,010
So furious!

326
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:36,850
This is finally happening to me... This damned ahjumma.

327
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:41,500
What is this? What blog is it? Let me see.

328
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,040
 Noodle restaurant Sun. I'm reporting the violent chef.

329
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,800
What? Irrational service.

330
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,290
And irrational food?

331
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:55,590
"Using fame and assaulting-"
I'm really going crazy.

332
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:59,880
An author has come. An author has come.

333
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:05,130
Who is irrational? Really. this riles me up.

334
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,320

335
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,610
 Name: I Love Strawberries

336
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:22,720
I am a person

337
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,640
who personally really likes Sun Restaurant.

338
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:31,360
This seems to be slander.

339
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,060
That place has pretty good service.

340
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:44,090
I personally think that making a mistake of generalizing over emotions

341
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:51,320
is... not right.

342
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,780
Not right!

343
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:57,330
Let's write another comment.

344
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:01,880
 Name: I Love Choco. The noodle dishes are...

345
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,110
 He's good looking.

346
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:11,830
Are you coming to work now?

347
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:14,650
Yes. I went to meet Mi Sook Unni for a moment. Sunbae, are you leaving now?

348
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:19,480
Yeah. Meeting. Hey, hey. It would have been horrible if we casted Kang Seon Woo.

349
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,170
Why?
-Why are you asking why?

350
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:24,900
He's number one in the search rankings for assault.

351
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,290
You should know about it. Check it.

352
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,900
Assault? Just a moment.

353
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:33,500
Yes, Reporter.

354
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:38,830
That report isn't true.

355
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:43,000
It's not even true so how can you discuss it. There's no discussion to begin with.

356
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,240
I'm just now going to do an interview. Yes, yes. I'm going to hang up.

357
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,270
Aish.

358
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:52,750
Oppa. Mom is a making a fuss. She says that after the article was released, it's only a matter of time before the issue gets bigger.

359
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,530
Isn't it better to settle now?

360
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:58,150
It's fine. If I was going to, I would have earlier.

361
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,170
But still, Oppa...

362
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:02,610
Don't answer Mom's calls today. Just turn off your phone.

363
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:08,930
Thing are becoming so dramatic just because of one post on the internet.

364
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:13,120
It's not that. Wouldn't it spread to all of us if something goes wrong?

365
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,830
That can happen just like that. I think we'd have to stay put as if we're dead today.

366
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:21,420
I will also die if I stay quiet.

367
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,200
Seriously...

368
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,480
Go to the hospital. It seems to be severe.

369
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,910
Ah. This Cordon...

370
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:29,910
Hey, spark. spark.

371
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:34,430
Hello! Good morning! Hello.

372
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:35,620
Isn't she crazy?

373
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:39,400
Why? Why? Why? Is today some day?

374
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,310
Why is everyone so serious?

375
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,970
Why are you so bright all of a sudden?

376
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,340
Why? Why?

377
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:47,650
I have to change. Aren't you going to leave? Should I just change in here?

378
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:49,600
What?

379
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,710
I heard that the chef hit a person. There was an article.

380
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:55,880
Really? Wasn't he a chef that came out on TV?

381
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,130
Why would he hit a person? Is he a gangster?

382
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,060
That's what I'm saying.

383
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:05,180
Hey, Dong Cheol. Have we recently been on a long standby like this?

384
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,920
There hasn't been.

385
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,920
Mass communication is amazing. The lack of customers is so obvious.

386
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,680
The restaurant won't go out of business, right?

387
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,720
Well, a small leak can sink a great ship. You never know.

388
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,620
If I had known it would be like this, I would have saved some money beforehand.

389
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,460
How nice would it be to set up my own restaurant and be a chef?

390
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:29,130
Look at our Chef. He comes in here wearing black by himself everyday going "Dishcloth dance!"

391
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:29,940
Aish.

392
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:33,550
"Oil baptism!" "White dragon resurrection!"

393
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,960
You're doing a show.

394
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,840
Too much showing off makes you a crazy bastard.

395
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,050
Why didn't you clean up the flour in the storage? Do you guys want to put food in a pig pen?

396
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,430
-Yes, I'm sorry. 
-Sorry.

397
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,710
You're making me nag.

398
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,860
-Sorry. 
-Yes. 
-Yes, Chef.

399
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,460
-Hey, Na Bong Seon.
-Yes, Chef.

400
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:55,940
Drain the oil from the hood. Don't get it clogged. This too.

401
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:59,010
I always have to say something for you guys to understand.

402
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:03,790
He's totally sensitive.

403
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,870
Excuse me.

404
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:09,800
Yes, just a moment.

405
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,680
Yes, customer.

406
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:20,360
The pasta is too watery. Could you boil it down?

407
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:26,080
This is a soup pasta, so it's supposed to be like this.

408
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,920
Honey. She says that it's supposed to be like this.

409
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,570
It tastes bad.

410
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:35,470
Everyone has a different taste, so boil it down.

411
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:38,970
Also, put in some more mussels.

412
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:42,280
How is it a seafood pasta if there are so few mussels?

413
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:47,370
Excuse me? I don't think there are a few. Look at this, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6-

414
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:50,340
If we ask for them, give them. Okay?

415
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,480
Is being rude like this the concept here?

416
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:59,230
Because they're learning under a chef who hits people, the employee discipline is in a serious mess.

417
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:03,520
Yes, customer.

418
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,850
That bad guy, really.

419
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:10,380
He's showing off because he's with his girlfriend.

420
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,280
Because the owner's situation is not good,

421
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:19,050
I'll do it for you.

422
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:23,500
Seems like his original temper.

423
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,870
What are you doing right now?

424
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:33,880
Pardon? Ah. That customer wants the soup to be almost boiled down.

425
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:37,730
So what are you doing?

426
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:40,460
Why are you getting mad?

427
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,770
I already told you that the customer wanted me to make it almost dry.

428
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:49,170
So do you see this hot pepper paste? I'm going to put this in and boil it down.

429
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,910
Why would you throw that away? That's such a waste.

430
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:57,110
Did you know that if you put red pepper paste in the soup, it would be mushy?

431
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,760
Who are you to touch my cooking?

432
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,410
Are you a chef? Are you the owner?

433
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:10,780
I'm sorry, Chef. I acknowledge my mistake.

434
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:15,720
But those people kept on nitpicking on anything and saying that that the chef is violent.

435
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,590
I was doing it because I thought of you.

436
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:20,530
Who are you to worry about me? Someone like you.

437
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:22,990
Darn it! Can't I worry a bit because I'm just me?

438
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:25,810
And why are you so twisted?

439
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:29,350
Can't you just accept good will as it is?

440
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,390
-What?
-Can't you, Sir?
 (She used informal speech earlier and now, she changed it back to formal)

441
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:36,560
Wow. You...

442
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,680
I...

443
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:46,190
You... Seeing you today and yesterday, it looks like you took my advice the wrong way.

444
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:49,960
For now, you're banned from the kitchen. Do only what I tell you to do in the hall.

445
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,510
Don't form your own judgment. Don't think on your own.

446
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:57,190
Are you really crazy?

447
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:03,020
I want to hit him just once.

448
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:08,630
Really. Why is he so rude? It's hard to be that rude.

449
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,310
Annoying.

450
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:21,510
Try to roughly adjust to them. The situation is already bad as it is.

451
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:26,910
There's nothing bad about it. If you trip while running, you can just give that excuse and rest.

452
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:30,070
Because there's no customers, I have lots of time and it's nice.

453
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:38,820
Ah, yes, Officer. I was going to call you anyway...

454
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:42,690
Excuse me? Settlement?

455
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:46,810
 You didn't know? Your mother met the plaintiff and

456
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:50,740
 I heard that she apologized and gave her the settlement fee.

457
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:54,140
You surprised me.

458
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,650
What's the matter at this time?

459
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:00,420
With whose permission did you settle? Why, Mom?

460
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,870
You came because of that?

461
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:08,140
Why did you do that? Why did you get involved in my business?

462
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:11,560
Then what could I do? You said you wouldn't settle.

463
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:15,540
There are so many comments on the article. That woman meets with different reporters and says stuff.

464
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:19,260
It was only a matter of time before you hit the bottom. How could I stay still as a mother?

465
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:23,680
As a mother? I'm about to cry, really.

466
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,310
As a mother, you never even made me a proper meal.

467
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:29,170
You didn't come until dawn, making your child shiver and cry.

468
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:32,850
And now you're saying you're a mom? Mom, I'm 33 years old.

469
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:37,070
I don't need you anymore. You should have been good to me when I needed you.

470
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:41,350
Fine. I was too young, I was busy studying, eating and living.

471
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:44,250
I felt sorry that I couldn't play the role of your mother, so I wanted to at least do something now.

472
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,850
Do you really have to come here and do this?

473
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:47,020
I guess I was raised wrongly.

474
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:51,520
Fine, you rotten child. Let's live our lives the way we want. Let's do that.

475
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,620
Please.

476
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,700
You bad guy. You bad guy. You bad guy.

477
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,920
Ah, that hurts! Mom!

478
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,400
No matter how much I did wrong, I'm still your mother.

479
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,750
Because you're like this, you hear that you're a rude guy. Did you know you bad guy?

480
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:18,340
Hello.

481
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:23,110
Okay. He's not my lover! He's my kid.

482
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,940
I told you to carry around the talisman.

483
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,360
This year is unlucky so I asked you to carry it with you, didn't I?

484
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,510
Gossips like that go around because you're not listening to your mother.

485
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,000
Did you know, you conceited guy?

486
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,910
Why are you talking about the talisman?

487
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:39,820
Shut up. The settlement money was $5000. Transfer it to my account.

488
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,580
-$5000?
-Right.

489
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:45,490
She gave me a discount because she was my fan. You don't even know.

490
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:47,500
You're so conceited.

491
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,300
Okay, send me your bank account number. I'll send it.

492
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:57,280
Ah, really.

493
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:01,170
She sent it fast. Okay, let's figure it out quickly.

494
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,410
What? I'm short on money.

495
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:10,450
Ah right, it's payment day today.

496
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:18,010
Give me a discount of ₩800,000.

497
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:21,450
It's not that. I don't have money because it's payment day today.

498
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:24,930
Or you can confiscate and stuff or whatever. Bye.

499
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:30,780
Aish. This brings down my image.

500
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:33,780
Why, ahjumma?! Why?!

501
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,640
So Hyeong.

502
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:42,350
I totally forgot to call you. Today and yesterday was,

503
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:44,390
a variety of things.

504
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:48,890
I know. I considered going alone, because you're in a complicated situation.

505
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:51,240
You did well. You did well. You did well.

506
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:55,670
The number of customers got way smaller. I have a lot of time.

507
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:58,320
Are you okay, or are you acting okay?

508
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,900
I'm okay.

509
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:07,090
It's for the best. I've been abnormally busy all this time. You know how great I am.

510
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:10,070
Okay. Then let's just say you're okay.

511
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:13,150
Come out on my program. The recording is next week.

512
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:16,610
What? What program?

513
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:19,680
What broadcast in this situation?

514
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:23,270
I'm asking you this because of the situation.

515
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:27,510
Don't you know standard tactics? Frontal attack.

516
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:31,730
Come out and confidently do the broadcast. I want you to explain.

517
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:35,690
If you hide at a time like this they'd think that you're really guilty.

518
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:37,500
Fine.

519
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,250
It's a survival show so you can also demonstrate your skills.

520
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:45,210
It's a variety concept, so it will be good for your image.

521
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,430
You're good at talking.

522
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:50,620
Of course. I'm good at talking.

523
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:57,940
But, what is it? Isn't casting over?

524
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,410
We casted Chef Yoon Se Shin.

525
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:01,730
Chef Yoon Se Shin?

526
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:04,130
I know. His level isn't right.

527
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:06,260
The class is different.

528
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:11,110
Right now, it's not hard to use an excuse to cancel him. Leave that to me.

529
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,450
Still, I don't think that's it.

530
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:18,910
I'm only waiting one day. It can't be longer.

531
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,590
Have you been well, Chang Gyu?

532
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:28,050
I came together with Seon Woo. He said that he missed you.

533
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:35,650
You did? You're so kind. I should hate you to death.

534
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:37,070
Why are you like this again?

535
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,760
Sorry.

536
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:44,540
Seon Woo. There's the lyrics to a popular song that goes "Treat   when   still around".

537
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:47,250
There's something like that.

538
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:50,120
I don't find that funny at all.

539
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,740
I should have been good to him when he was here.

540
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:09,230
Hey, look at this. He doesn't fall from 5th place in the search rankings.

541
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,530
Isn't he at the level of a celebrity at this point?

542
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:15,140
There are more than 500 comments. It's awesome.

543
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,000
He's even gotten a nickname.

544
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,950
Kang Seon Woo - Kkang Chef! It's a shortening of gangster chef.

545
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:25,310
People really have nothing to do. This witch-hunt is a real problem.

546
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:31,830
Hey, the witch hunt is not the problem here. It's the society that incites it.

547
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:36,510
If they get stressed and have nowhere to vent it out, they do it there.

548
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:41,100
Even if you work hard, people only recognize the first place.

549
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,710
They have to wipe the well-off, rich guys' butts.

550
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:47,880
The least they can do is comment. Where else can they vent?

551
00:36:55,120 --> 00:37:00,630
So, I'm not saying that I did that.

552
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:06,040
Hey, didn't I bring my charger earlier?

553
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:11,920
Anyway, the person who made that nickname hit the bull's eye. Gangster Chef.

554
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,360
He has an ability to hit people with his words.

555
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:19,450
Chef, you came.

556
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:23,250
You, really.

557
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,890
Chef, could I use the restroom?

558
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:27,890
You told me to ask before doing anything.

559
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:31,860
Do as you wish. Don't talk to me from now on, okay?

560
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:44,660
Hyung, hyung. My friend works at Marco's restaurant, and he told me that Marco is really excited.

561
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:48,370
He said you were wrong for doing the program and what face do you have to go.

562
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,980
He should just do well himself.

563
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,230
Originally, he's round and lack in this  .

564
00:37:55,230 --> 00:38:00,670
Is that the only thing he lacks? He lacks skills too.

565
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,800
This won't do.

566
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,980
That pig. So annoying.

567
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:21,250
He's doing all sorts of things.

568
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:25,640
He's excited?

569
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,520
 So Hyeong

570
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,720
Hello? What? Is this So Hyeong?

571
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:53,550
Hey, I pressed the wrong speed dial number.

572
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:56,160
Did you get to the broadcasting station well?

573
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,750
Next week-

574
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:05,130
I'll go out.

575
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:12,300
Next week, I'm going to have a recording for broadcast.

576
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:16,260
I wasn't thinking of it, but my friend kept asking me to.

577
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:19,520
I need a second chef. Min Soo, do you want to do it?

578
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:21,700
Me?

579
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,180
What's wrong? Dong Cheol?

580
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,350
Yes, Chef. Thank you.

581
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:26,480
Ah, really.

582
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,680
I'll be the second chef.

583
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,240
- Okay, you do it.
 - Yes, Chef.

584
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,170
That day, we'll only have lunch.

585
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:37,160
Yes, Chef.

586
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,380
Chef, don't I have to get special skin treatment?

587
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,510
Yeah, you don't have to get it.

588
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,200
Yes, Chef.

589
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,590
It's not even like looking for Mr. Kim in Seoul.

590
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:58,430
Because of that virgin ghost, I can't even do business. What am I doing here?

591
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:07,790
That surprised me. Alright.

592
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:10,340
I'm looking for her right now.

593
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:16,630
It's not like seeing ghosts is a sin. I'm going crazy because of that wench.

594
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:27,230
Yes, hello. It's Seonbinggo.

595
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:33,350
Yes, Bodhisattva. Professor Kim recommended you to me. I'm Jo Hye Young.

596
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:36,030
Yes, it's because of my son.

597
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:42,160
I'm a bit far from Seobinggo-dong, so could you come here?

598
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,200
Travel fees?

599
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:50,920
I'll give you travel fees.

600
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:56,030
Yes. Yes, give me a text message.

601
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:03,990
She must be good if she's asking for a lot of money.

602
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,240
Owner Oppa. One more bottle of soju.

603
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,680
Yes.

604
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:17,330
Why are you alone today? What happened to the person you were with last time?

605
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:21,770
Oh, my ex-boyfriend? We broke up two months ago.

606
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:34,900
It might be because I'm not dating, but I feel lonely.

607
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,950
Lately, I've been worried about my son.

608
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:42,730
My son has bad luck this year.

609
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:48,340
I worry so much for him. He doesn't even know.

610
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,030
Children are all like that.

611
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,370
Truthfully, I was a failure as a mother.

612
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,980
I had a son through an accident,

613
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:08,030
and I lived with him and had a daughter as well. But the children's father has left already.

614
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:13,530
I left my daughter to my aunt's so I could study.

615
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:19,570
I was never able to feed them a proper meal. I didn't even go to my son's graduation.

616
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:25,060
How lonely he must have been? Because he met the wrong mother.

617
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,930
Yes.

618
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:36,120
Owner Oppa, are you a bachelor?

619
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,460
Are you in your thirties? Your forties?

620
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,470
Will the broadcast be okay? If something goes wrong-

621
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:46,480
Don't worry. Don't worry.

622
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:51,220
Don't you know how I do broadcasts? They're all dead. Those 1 million antis.

623
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,250
Mom.

624
00:42:54,250 --> 00:43:00,170
Chef Kang! My smart son. Bring me a bottle of wine.

625
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,200
Bring it quickly.

626
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,900
Eun Hee, come here.

627
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:07,640
Stop it.

628
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,790
No, one more glass.

629
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:14,350
No, no, no. Mom, let's go.

630
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:16,570
-We're done drinking? 
-Yes, we're done drinking.

631
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:18,720
Eun Hee.

632
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:24,100
He sent me money today. His settlement fee.

633
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:27,160
He doesn't ever give me allowance.

634
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,580
Eun Hee. Should we go for a second round?

635
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,110
Let's not go for a second round, but let's go to the car.

636
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:34,000
No. Eun Hee, let's go for a second round.

637
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,680
Go to the car. We're almost there. Quickly.

638
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,340
-We're almost there? 
-Get in, Mom.

639
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:40,900
Here. Oh!

640
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,250
We should have called Seong Jae.

641
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:45,720
What do we do?

642
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:49,340
I'll move the car quickly.

643
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:53,550
Why do you keep on putting shoes in the room?

644
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:58,950
If she's weak with alcohol, she shouldn't drink.

645
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:02,980
She acts conceited and strong. She's always acting.

646
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:07,410
Is being conceited hereditary?

647
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:10,580
What are you?

648
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:16,300
What are you? Don't follow me. You don't have an owner?

649
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:21,620
I don't like dogs. I'm not the type to give food to strays.

650
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,680
What are you?

651
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,640
Here.

652
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:34,700
Is it good? You're eating well.

653
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:39,790
I told you not to follow me. You're not a stalker...

654
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:44,450
Ah, seriously. Even a dog is a big fan.

655
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:52,280
I took you in and fed you today because I didn't have a choice, but tomorrow would be a stretch.

656
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:56,440
I can't take care of you. Okay?

657
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,240
You're eating well.

658
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:04,680
Here. That's it. Up to here.

659
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,490
I've extended my possession like this and I should be seducing men...

660
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:15,070
How is the front and the back the same?

661
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:20,330
As expected, whether you're a human or a ghost, a moment's choice is very important.

662
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:23,380
What is it?

663
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:38,110
That policeman...

664
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:47,920
 Where have I seen him? He doesn't seem unfamiliar.

665
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:52,090
 Was he a man that I seduced when I possessed someone? That's not it.

666
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:54,760
-What to do? 
-What happened?

667
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,960
-They must have died. 
-They died.

668
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,870
-Really? 
-How did this happen?

669
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:03,320
What to do?

670
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:08,660
The policeman is so cool.

671
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:11,210
My heart is racing.

672
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:13,600
Really...

673
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:17,200
He's my style.

674
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:33,550
No. Does it make sense that this tasteless kimchi tofu soup is ₩5,000?

675
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:35,770
The only side dishes were kimchi.

676
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:39,310
You should have said before you ate. Does it make sense that you're like this after you ate it all?

677
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:42,930
No, it's fine. Okay, just go.

678
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:43,940
-Father. 
-It's fine.

679
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,760
It's fine.

680
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:49,550
Hello.

681
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:51,890
-Is there anything wrong? 
-No.

682
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:55,780
No, it's not that I won't pay.

683
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:59,240
I'm just saying that it's a bit expensive for how it tastes.

684
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,150
Thank you.

685
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:05,720
I should never come here again.

686
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:10,070
Father, don't be like that. If you give food without receiving payment, what will we live off of?

687
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:13,290
Well, what he said wasn't wrong.

688
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:16,200
I'm sorry, Police Officer Choi. Sit down.

689
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:22,920
I told you we should go somewhere else.

690
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,350
What should I get you?

691
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:26,520
Give us two kimchi tofu soups.

692
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:29,120
Yes, just wait a moment.

693
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:41,060
You know that the mission will be opened during the recording, right? That's the concept, so please understand.

694
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:44,080
Of course. It's all about being real these days.

695
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:48,890
But can I get two more security guards in the back?

696
00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:50,990
There's a guy who uses his fists here.

697
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:55,020
Don't worry. I don't hit anyone bigger than me.

698
00:47:55,020 --> 00:48:01,400
Chef Marco, your size is perfect for this show. Your body is so real.

699
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:04,480
Darn it.

700
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,290
Chef, I have to go pee.

701
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:16,070
Go quickly.

702
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:22,790
You jerk. You jerk. I think you left your mind at the karaoke room yesterday.

703
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:33,920
Bong, it's me. Could you bring my Chef's knife?

704
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:39,140
What? Chef's private knife? Just wait a moment.

705
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,970
It's right here.

706
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:52,940
 Kang Seon Woo. Born in 1983...

707
00:48:56,630 --> 00:49:01,990
How old are you that you already have a son that's over 30 years old?

708
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:06,190
It just turned out that way.

709
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:10,060
It's strong. This isn't usually this strong.

710
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:14,900
Right? Everybody says he has a fate filled with yang energy (bright and masculine) and ghosts stick to him.

711
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,690
So that's why you had tens of talismans written for him?

712
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:20,680
How did you know? I was so upset.

713
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:25,210
What's the point of making all of those? That bad guy rips all of them up.

714
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:29,470
Just looking at his birthdate won't do. I'd have to see his face.

715
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:32,320
-Pardon?
-About a person's fate,

716
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:36,130
It's decided by how that person is living.

717
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:39,150
It's all written in the face.

718
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:45,900
Let's see... You've lived a hard life, but you got to do everything you wanted to do.

719
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:49,660
Your face is bright. You can't live without men.

720
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:52,740
You're into younger guys, right?

721
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:57,280
Oh my. That's amazing. You can see all that in the face?

722
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,850
Please come to his restaurant one day and have a look at my son's face.

723
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:03,610
I'll let you know where his restaurant is.

724
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:08,480
If I go somewhere when I'm already out, the fee quadruples.

725
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:17,480
It's here.

726
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:20,630
The place is good.

727
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:25,310
 Why is that Unni here? Wait, that's not it. I'm Na Bong Seon right now.

728
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:26,820
Hey, Na...

729
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:38,160
Why doesn't she greet someone after seeing them? That's strange.

730
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,840
Let's go in.

731
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:44,610
Can you shave off my jaw here?

732
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,730
What the? Why did you come here?

733
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:51,670
The Sous Chef asked me to bring your knives. Is that not it?

734
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:55,820
That bastard. I told him to take care of things well.

735
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:59,000
Now that you're wearing make-up, you look so-so and awkward.

736
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,080
What?

737
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:03,410
It's a joke. It's fine. It looks pretty.

738
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:05,180
It's really interesting.

739
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:10,850
Why isn't he coming after creating this mess?

740
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:15,330
 Ahjussi, I am a cast member. My pass is inside the room.

741
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:18,060
So what program?

742
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:22,030
-What is the PD's name? 
-I just heard it, but I forgot it.

743
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:26,950
Okay, okay.

744
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,710
Open it for me.

745
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:36,540
You can't. Get a visitor's pass, or just leave.

746
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:39,340
PD-nim.

747
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:47,070
Ah, really. I have to go. I have to go. I have to go.

748
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:52,850
Why? Is there a problem? We're going to go into the shoot right now.

749
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:56,110
Min Soo isn't coming. This crazy guy.

750
00:51:56,110 --> 00:52:01,220
You have to go in now. There's no time.

751
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:07,070
Hey. Isn't she one of your employees? I think I've seen her at your restaurant.

752
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:10,700
You can take her. Seon Woo, there's no time. Quickly, okay?

753
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:12,420
I'll request of you.

754
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:17,130
Don't do anything. I'll do everything on my own.

755
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:19,900
You always tell me not to do anything.

756
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:24,710
That's quite nice.

757
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:26,360
Before the mission comes in,

758
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:29,910
let's hear about our chef's resolve.

759
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:30,950
-Yes. 
-Chef Kang Seon Woo.

760
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:33,680
I don't need to say anything long.

761
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:38,190
These hands are not for hitting people, but used for cooking.

762
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:42,360
Using the broadcast, Kang Seon Woo

763
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:45,050
is subtly making an explanatory remark.

764
00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:47,100
I won't be subtle and just say it.

765
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,130
Yes.

766
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:50,780
There are times when not everything you see is true.

767
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:56,230
Only my conscience and his conscience will know the truth, under the circumstances that he has a conscience.

768
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:57,210
Yes.

769
00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:00,330
Now we are curious about what that truth is.

770
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:04,250
It would be nice if we will have a time to hear that later on.

771
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:09,440
Without further ado, the randomly chosen mission.

772
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,900
We'll reveal it now.

773
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:14,550
 Mission

774
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:17,220
It's this. A breakfast prepared by a mother

775
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:23,450
for a son who got wasted drunk after receiving an enlistment notice.

776
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:29,650
Experts' taste war. Chef vs. Chef. It will start now!

777
00:53:57,470 --> 00:54:00,450
Because we now have ten minutes left,

778
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:04,460
we will personally have a look to see which stage of the cooking process they are at.

779
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:07,480
Yes, our Chef Marco...

780
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:10,750
Is he already in the last step?

781
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:13,850
He is elegantly putting the food on the dish.

782
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:15,160
Yes.

783
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:17,980
Chef, I think the rice is burning.

784
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:55,900
What are you doing?

785
00:54:57,130 --> 00:54:59,190
What are you doing right now?

786
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:02,060
Dried pollack soup with crispy rice crust.

787
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:03,210
What?

788
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:05,810
Dried pollack soup with crispy rice crust.

789
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:11,940
I don't do that these days, Driver.

790
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:13,020
Really?

791
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:14,330
Yes.

792
00:55:14,330 --> 00:55:18,150
I came here because I wanted to eat that.

793
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:22,720
I quit driving and not long ago I started again.

794
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:26,600
I remembered this restaurant's pollack soup.

795
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:32,000
But I don't see your daughter. Did she go somewhere?

796
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:37,880
Yes. She left for a moment.

797
00:55:39,070 --> 00:55:41,740
Should I just make it with pork?

798
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:45,490
Two dishes that are quite different are prepared.

799
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:46,540
Yes, that's right.

800
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:50,530
First of all, let the panel judges taste them first.

801
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:51,790
Come in.

802
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:55,210
Let's taste Chef Marco's dish first.

803
00:55:55,210 --> 00:56:00,480
Now. Please taste Chef Kang Seon Woo's dish.

804
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,900
Yes. Compared to Chef Marco,

805
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:09,300
Kang Seon Woo prepared a simple breakfast.

806
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:13,060
Let the two chefs competing,

807
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:15,510
try the dish.

808
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:24,250
Yes. The chefs

809
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:26,490
would probably be satisfied about their dishes because they made it.

810
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:28,770
They would first feel pride.

811
00:56:28,770 --> 00:56:30,760
Yes.

812
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:36,880
Congrats on your first win. I think it's also been recorded well.

813
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,820
That's a relief. You've worked hard.

814
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:41,820
But more than I thought, a Korean cuisine is a good idea.

815
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:47,280
I worried if after you randomly picked the mission, I wondered if it'd be a disadvantage to you. Since you don't like rice.

816
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,880
Just because I don't like it, I can't do it.

817
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,920
Chef, Chef.

818
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,950
I'm sorry.
-What are you doing?!

819
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:58,810
Forget it. The recording finished well.

820
00:56:58,810 --> 00:56:59,900
Sh-... Ah...

821
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:04,130
But I think Bong Seon, from before, should come out for the next recording.

822
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:08,260
Pardon? Why? I was going to do it.

823
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:13,630
I already know that, but it wouldn't be good if the assistant changes.

824
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:16,870
You can't... You can't. She's just an assistant.

825
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:21,170
It's really heavy to move supplies. She's so small so she can't.

826
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:24,910
I'm sorry. Please move. I'll pass by.

827
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:30,240
Hyung, Hyung.

828
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:33,230
Hyung. Hyung, this doesn't make sense.

829
00:57:33,230 --> 00:57:35,900
Why would Bong be in a broadcast?

830
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:41,470
Hyung. This isn't right. Can't you please talk nicely with the producer?

831
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:43,310
The bus already left. You fell into the trap you made.

832
00:57:43,310 --> 00:57:45,420
How did I fall into my own trap? I don't understand.

833
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:49,740
There's nothing left, right? Then we just have to clean up.

834
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:52,460
That, that.

835
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:54,440
Na Bong Seon.

836
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,960
Yes?

837
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,100
Come back to the kitchen.

838
00:57:59,100 --> 00:57:59,880
What?

839
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:04,170
Are you deaf? Come back to the kitchen starting tomorrow.

840
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:07,460
Kitchen? Okay, then.

841
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:11,380
I understand. It's because you're thankful for today's broadcast, right?

842
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:14,450
Thankful, no way. Why are you holding my arm?

843
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:16,680
Go, so I can park the car.

844
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:22,210
You are thankful. He has some pride.

845
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:24,540
 Noraebang

846
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:27,450
At least today was worthwhile.

847
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:31,660
It's interesting. How did I think of that idea in that moment?

848
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:34,060
Dried pollack soup with crispy rice crust.

849
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:36,880
Was it something I liked?

850
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:41,140
How much did he drink?

851
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:49,180
Look at him.

852
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:53,360
What if he faints like that?

853
00:58:57,850 --> 00:59:01,720
His face is totally ruined!

854
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:05,990
Uncle!

855
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:07,870
Young man!

856
00:59:07,870 --> 00:59:12,610
You shouldn't be like this here! It's dangerous here.

857
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:16,070
Aunt is going to catch you!

858
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:20,200
So meddlesome.

859
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:34,610
There is Dad.

860
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:50,880
 The recipient cannot be reached so...

861
00:59:54,850 --> 00:59:58,240
Uncle, I did as much as I can.

862
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:03,500
What?!

863
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:06,280
Why am I so humane right now?

864
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:10,790
Uncle, please get to your senses!

865
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:12,570
I'm really going crazy.

866
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:16,640
Mom! Mom! Ah, really!

867
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:21,750
Really! Please walk correctly! Please!

868
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:23,560
You're really going to die!

869
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:27,580
Really! You'll die because of me!

870
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:30,190
We're almost here.

871
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:31,340
Aigoo.

872
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:33,360
Miss Bong Seon!

873
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:34,790
Why are you here?

874
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:35,630
Yes.

875
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:37,480
Gyeong Mo!

876
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:39,150
Do you know him?

877
01:00:39,150 --> 01:00:40,240
What's wrong with you?

878
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:43,830
He was so drunk that he's knocked over there.

879
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:47,120
Gyeong Mo! Where did you drink so much?

880
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:50,710
Ah, really. Sit down.

881
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:52,000
Miss, sit here.

882
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,760
No.

883
01:00:55,950 --> 01:01:00,390
Ahjussi, this is Officer Choi.

884
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:06,460
Gyeong Mo must be really drunk. A lady brought him when he was sleeping in the streets.

885
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:10,000
Yes. Yes.

886
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:13,060
Ah... Yes, come.

887
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:15,380
Yes, come safely.

888
01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:18,240
Then, I'll be  .

889
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,970
Wait for a moment, if you have time.

890
01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:20,900
Pardon?

891
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:23,090
Ahjussi wants to greet you.

892
01:01:23,090 --> 01:01:27,170
It's okay. It's not much.

893
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,290
Then, still sit down. I'll give you a cup of coffee.

894
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:32,430
Yes. Yes...

895
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:33,440
Is black fine?

896
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,180
Yes.

897
01:01:37,090 --> 01:01:37,940
Yes...

898
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:38,940
Gyeong Mo.

899
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:41,730
 Did he know him?

900
01:01:41,730 --> 01:01:42,620
Gyeong Mo, wake up.

901
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:45,810
 He's fine. He has a charm.

902
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:48,280
 If he only wasn't a police, I would-

903
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,460
You've been working hard. My son, where is he?

904
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:52,640
Welcome.

905
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:57,620
Aigoo, this guy.Gyeong Mo.  Gyeong Mo, wake up.

906
01:01:57,620 --> 01:02:01,960
Wake up. Gyeong Mo.

907
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:05,150
This rascal, where did he drink?

908
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:08,480
Gyeong Mo. Sin Gyeong Mo.

909
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,280
Wake up. Wake up!

910
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,350
Gyeong  Mo!

911
01:02:13,350 --> 01:02:15,910
 Hey, hurry up and wake up.

912
01:02:15,910 --> 01:02:17,860
 Wake up. We have to do business.

913
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:20,180
 Father, would he wake up if you do it like that?

914
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:22,170
 Wake up.
-Hey, Sin Gyeog Mo, you're not going to wake up?!

915
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:24,370
 Hey, wake up!

916
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:25,620
 Wake up, you rascal!

917
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:28,270
 Don't hit me!
-Why do you sleep in the daytime like it's nighttime?

918
01:02:28,270 --> 01:02:29,440
 You're not going to wake up?

919
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,020
 I'm going to leave.

920
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:33,570
 You rascal! Look at the way he talks. I should just-
-Hey, hey.

921
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:35,700
 Did you hit me with that?
-Why do you hit his head?

922
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:38,510
 Look at the way he talks back. Should he act like that?

923
01:02:38,510 --> 01:02:40,350
 Ommo! Look at him. Let's fight.

924
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:42,230
 Don't fight.

925
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,050
 I'm busy. I'm busy.

926
01:02:47,050 --> 01:02:49,280
 I understand!

927
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,060
  One bulgogi stew in an earthenware and three pollack soup!

928
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:54,280
  Soon Ae, one bulgogi stew and three pollack soup!

929
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:57,480
  Yes, one bulgogi stew and three pollack soup!

930
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:59,700
 I'm going to die from being busy!

931
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:04,530
 No, you must not! You should at least give us food and die!

932
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,820
 I think we're going to die from hunger.

933
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:11,350
 I won't starve you to death so wait a bit.

934
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:15,290
Gyeong  Mo, come back to your senses.

935
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:19,140
Hey. Gyeong Mo. Ah, really!

936
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:21,680
Ah... What should I do with him?

937
01:03:23,730 --> 01:03:25,270
Father...

938
01:03:25,270 --> 01:03:28,130
 Soon Ae, when do you want to go grocery shopping?

939
01:03:28,130 --> 01:03:32,280
 Soon Ae, should I buy you some pain relief patches. Is your back okay?

940
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:35,350
 Aigoo, Soon Ae, let's eat too.

941
01:03:35,350 --> 01:03:39,990
 Hey, Soon Ae. Aigoo, Soon Ae.

942
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:41,980
 Soon Ae!

943
01:03:50,110 --> 01:03:59,910

944
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:15,950
 Oh My Ghostess

945
01:04:15,950 --> 01:04:19,890
 Why did I die after leaving all these good memories?

946
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:22,400
 Living once and dying once,

947
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,940
 I should've dated and two-timed or even dated three people at once.

948
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:29,920
 You're really sick, aren't you? You can't even look me in the eyes before. What's wrong with you?

949
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,280
 I think my face has gotten red. How silly.

950
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:36,060
 Use this.

951
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:39,580
 For a few days, some of the kitchen supplies keep on disappearing.

952
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:42,020
 A lot of ghost could stick by.

953
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:44,400
 Wait.
-Me?
