1
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,410
 Oh My Ghostess

2
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,770
 Park Bo Yeong

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,300
 Jo Jeong Seok

4
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,730
 Im Joo Hwan

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,690
 Kim Seul Gi

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,070
 Oh My Ghostess

7
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:42,890
Unni!

8
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:46,270
I will catch you today!

9
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:50,860
Seriously! I said not today!

10
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,580
I can't get caught!

11
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,210
Darn it, I'm going to get caught if I continue like this.

12
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,380
Taxi! Taxi!

13
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,390
Here!

14
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:19,740

15
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,040
Do you really want to die?

16
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,510
What time is it now?

17
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,390
Am I someone who should be waiting for you?

18
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,170
No,

19
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,720
I-I-I'm sorry, Chef.

20
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,910
You don't have a fever so what's the matter, again?

21
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,750
Are you depressed? That's your favorite song, I'm sorry.

22
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,370
No, uh, well,

23
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,630
yes, a little.

24
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,030
Are you saying that you are or not?

25
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,290
Never mind. Let's just get going.

26
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,730
Manic or depressed, we should go eat what we had planned to.

27
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,070
Yes.

28
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,180
Excuse me, Chef.

29
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,510
What?

30
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:55,400
La..st time, that recording. The flour. Did it turn out okay?

31
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,370
Of course, it did.

32
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,320
Do you want to show off? That you made up for your mistake?

33
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,200
Ah, no, that's really not it.

34
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,630
Truthfully, the bean flour idea wasn't bad for being resourceful.

35
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:13,900
But if too much bean flour is used, it won't bind and it will just crumble.

36
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,330
Why else would they use the phrase that a household becomes bean flour to refer to becoming nothing.

37
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,060
You should know something in order to show off.

38
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,380
Yes, I'm sorry. I'll keep it in mind.

39
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,490
-Okay, keep that in mind.
-Yes, Chef.

40
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:27,110
Find the route on your cell phone. Granny's Pancake House in Hongjaedong

41
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,000
Yes, Chef.

42
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,840
Is she gone? She's gone, isn't she?

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,340
Seobingo or Dongbingo, her power of deduction is pretty good.

44
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,690
How did she make a connection between me and Na Bong Seon?

45
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,770
I almost got caught. Ug, it makes me sick.

46
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,750
I got you!

47
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,930
Don't even try calling me Unni.

48
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,370
I don't like this! Unni?

49
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:11,560
You're giving me a headache!

50
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,470
I know you're just putting on a show.

51
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,820
Okay, okay. Ow, it hurts, it hurts!

52
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,060
Come here!

53
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,170
Do you know how much I spent in taxis because of you?

54
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,820
Ah!

55
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:31,500
 Episode 7

56
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,220
A meal isn't just something to eat...

57
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,010
-Enjoy
-Yes, thank you.

58
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:42,870
It's not just something you eat. Like music or art, it's an important way of life.

59
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,990
Do you know who said that?

60
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,670
-Uh, Chef?
-Wrong.

61
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:51,210
-I guess you could think that.
-I'll do it.

62
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:55,190
But, it isn't me. Leonardo Da Vinci.

63
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,440
So like appreciating music or art, he's saying to eat while savoring it.

64
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,030
Which oil did they use, what is in the batter, and in the seasoning,

65
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,890
think about what went into it. Reflect on the process instead of just eating it.

66
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,860
Yes, Chef.

67
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,090
In the kitchen, we are like the orchestra conductor. Understand?

68
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,000
Yes.

69
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,710
I'm the one who came up with that. Aren't you surprised? Doesn't it give you goosebumps?

70
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,950
Yes, you're so cool, Chef.

71
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,200
Have I ever not been cool? Try eating some.

72
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,710
How is it? Is there anything you feel?

73
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,350
The texture is very crispy.

74
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,560
Why do you think that is?

75
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,580
Some kind of starch?

76
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,750
If you use starch now in the rainy season, the batter will become soggy.

77
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,630
The secret is onions.

78
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,210
Onions?

79
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:57,400
If you grind up onions, it soaks up the moisture and makes it crispy.

80
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,920
You can use the onions as you would frying powder.

81
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,220
Yes.

82
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,090
Without any artificial additives, and just with natural edible materials,

83
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:09,660
you can make a variety of textures. If you want something chewy, then use potatoes.

84
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,880
And if you want something soft, then add milk to the flour.

85
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,930
 You leave the sauce to a kid like her?!

86
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:18,430
If you want a full-bodied flavor, then sesame...

87
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,910
-Are you spacing out?
-No.

88
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:25,370
You're listening to a high quality lesson that you can't even buy with money.

89
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:28,140
Yes, I know, Chef. Thank you.

90
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,010
If you want a full-bodied flavor, what do you use?

91
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:32,900
Ses--sesame oil.

92
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,750
Please have some.

93
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,400
Oh, it's hot.

94
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,530
Everything is good here except for the parking.

95
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,120
Can you not walk even with your eyes open?

96
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,820
I'm sorry, Chef.

97
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,290
Improve your physical strength, kid.

98
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:56,840
You're always so frail, that the kids push you around and call you, Bong, Bong.

99
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,600
Why can't you speak up?

100
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:03,080
-What?
-I'm not Bong! I'm Na Bong Seon! Confidently.

101
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,790
Yes, Chef. I'll keep it in mind.

102
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,660
-Okay, let's go, Bong.
-What? What?

103
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,770
I can do that. Just me.

104
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,610
Yes, Chef.

105
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,440
Oh, it's so cool.

106
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:25,300
♫ This day that I can't fall asleep, this night sure is long ♫

107
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,080
What's so cool about that? Don't you watch any of the audition shows?

108
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,200
There are plenty of kids like that.
♫   Now that you are next to me   ♫

109
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,440
 Hurry up and come! I'm tired.

110
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,020
Ah, yes. ♫   Now over and over  in your memories   ♫

111
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,020
 Hurry! 
-Yes!

112
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,600
-Come in!
-Unni, Unni, Unni!

113
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,540
I'm so exhausted because of you.

114
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,090
Unni, untie me.

115
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,450
It's only a matter of time before I can release my vexation, I'm saying.

116
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,850
You've got to be kidding me. It's not like blowing your nose.

117
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,230
You think releasing the vexation of a ghost is that easy?

118
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,110
That's not it. Listen to what I have to say.

119
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,200
I've prepared the whole table.

120
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,330
I just need to put the spoon on it for it to be game over.

121
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:08,030
Yeah, right. What table? With what resources could you prepare

122
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,950
a table?

123
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,340
You found a virile man?

124
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,560
Yeah, that's what I said!

125
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,890
Going into Na Bong Seon's body wasn't just a coincidence.

126
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:23,320
Because it's darkest at the base of the lamp, he was in front of my nose.

127
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:28,350
Then are you talking about that Chef at Yangpaldong?

128
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,800
You sensed it, didn't you? He's my virile man!

129
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,770
Ah, no! You can't! You can't, girl!

130
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:39,540
-Why not?
-His mother is my regular customer.

131
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:42,500
I became friends with that woman.

132
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,900
What does it have to do with me?

133
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,240
What ghost in this world releases their vexation taking someone's circumstances into consideration?

134
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,430
Even if that man was your son, I could knock him over!

135
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:52,850
Ah, what son? What? I'm a virgin!

136
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,530
And it can't be that family's son! I said it can't, girl!

137
00:08:55,530 --> 00:09:00,310
Why not? He's not even your son, why are you trying to protect him? You're not that type of character...

138
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,030
Character...

139
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:06,770
You took in a lot, didn't you? From his mom.

140
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,840
How much did you get? How much?

141
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:13,210
Get what? If I said you can't, you can't!

142
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:18,740
Hey, I'll just send you, so go.

143
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:24,320
It would be nice if you could attain nirvana and leave, but what can be done if it doesn't go as you wish?

144
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:30,390
I'll prepare a nice ceremony to send your spirit off to heaven.

145
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,850
Rite to heaven?

146
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,690
I don't want to. I'm scared.

147
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:41,030
I heard there is pain and suffering. The kids say it's a misery like gaining weight.

148
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:44,860
It's just for a moment. You just have to endure that moment, girl.

149
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,790
I don't want to! I'm not going to do it! I told you I don't want to!

150
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,900
I'm not doing it!

151
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,950
I should just cut your belly!

152
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,810
I'm not even a late night snacker. What am I becoming for this student in my life?

153
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:07,430
I'm sorry, Chef.

154
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,690
Sorry, again. I can't say anything.

155
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,260
Good night, Chef.

156
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,560
I don't know, if I can have a good night or not.

157
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,260
Who knows if you'll come and jump me in the night. Go to sleep then.

158
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,330
Yes, Chef.

159
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,490
Wait a second.

160
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,260
I played guitar in the past.

161
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,120
Who's never held one before?

162
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,370
I can play ten times better than him. So much better than him.

163
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,670
What, like this, what?

164
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,410
♬ Like a sweet cappucino,

165
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:44,780
♬ You're my angel.

166
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:48,290
♬ Would you know how I feel?

167
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:53,180
♬ I'm not sure. I don't know.

168
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:59,900
♬ Your endlessly clear eyes,

169
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:06,690
♬ I long for you, my one and only.

170
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:15,110
♬ Give me your chocolate,

171
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:21,540
♬ Give me your vitamins. You are

172
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,740
♬ Sweet and sour, my endorphins.

173
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,590
♬ Give me your chocolate,

174
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:35,410
♬ Give me your vitamins,

175
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:40,480
♬ Together with you forever.

176
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:47,730
♬ Together with you tonight. Ooooh.

177
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:58,750
♬ Together with you. Forever.

178
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,130
Na Bong Seon! Wake up call!

179
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,170
 -Yes, yes, yes? 
-Hurry!

180
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,830
 Just a moment!

181
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,430
-Ye--yes, Chef? 
-What time is it? Why do you sleep so much?

182
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:35,460
-I'm sorry.
-A cook shouldn't sleep a lot.

183
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,980
-There's so much work to do early in the morning.
-Yes.
-Hurry up and come out, so we can exercise.

184
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,590
What? Exercise?

185
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:43,680
I told you yesterday. That you need more strength.

186
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,840
If you want to peel garlic in the kitchen, you have to increase your strength.

187
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,540
See, since I exercise diligently. 2-3 times per week..

188
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,710
You're so cool.

189
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:55,870
If you work hard at it, it'll strengthen your muscles, and improves your mental health.

190
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,270
Hurry up and come out.

191
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:01,610
Ah, exercise clothes...just a moment.

192
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:08,110
You can't ride a bike?

193
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,800
No, I can't.

194
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,510
What did you do when you were young? Not riding one. Isn't it just basic?

195
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,630
I tried to learn,

196
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:22,780
but I'm not so athletic.

197
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:26,470
Then, I have mine, why would I rent one?

198
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,880
You should have told me sooner that you couldn't.

199
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,530
It doesn't even need a license.Driver's license too...

200
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:35,230
You don't have to pass a license exam. Why can't you ride one?

201
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:37,040
Why can't you ride one?

202
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,490
It's so cool.

203
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,060
You're holding on, aren't you?

204
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,140
Yeah, I'm holding on.

205
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:51,470
When it goes to the right, turn to the left. If it goes to the left, then turn right!

206
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,880
- Are you understanding this?
- No.

207
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,750
You're constantly going towards the left.

208
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,780
-Are you trying to go up the stairs?
-I'm sorry.

209
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,160
-You have to go this way.
-Yes.

210
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,720
Just a moment.

211
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,200
I'm sorry.

212
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,460
Let's try it again.

213
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:15,350
I'm trying to do well.

214
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,020
But it's not working.

215
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,140
Should I keep going?

216
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,560
-To the left.
-That's too far left!

217
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,590
In the middle, yes, the middle. Now right. Go.

218
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,820
Left, left.

219
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,510
Are you okay?
Ow, my arm. Ow.

220
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:36,880
Teaching you is harder than the National Bike trekking.

221
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,280
I'm sorry, Chef.

222
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,770
Ah, I'm short 200 won.

223
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,450
You think we can't get it, don't you?

224
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:49,090
-Should we go?
-No, there's a way.

225
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,020
This is what they call life's experience. Life's tip.

226
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:01,990
-Yes.
-You sure are learning a lot from me. But I'm still short 100 won.

227
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,740
100 won?

228
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,490
We can get one and share it.

229
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,410
Here, 100 won.

230
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,710
-Have you tried that before?
-No.

231
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:18,550
-Is that your first time?
-Yes.
-Is it really the first time?
-Yes, I'm trying it for the first time.

232
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:21,820
Since the teacher is quick, the student is also quick.

233
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,650
It's good that we're quick.

234
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,430
-Here.
-Thank you.

235
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,290
It looks good.

236
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,790
Where did my seat go?

237
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:45,160
What are you doing?  Hey!

238
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,550
Oh,..th..th... Oh, Ch..ch..chef!

239
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,760
Oh no!

240
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:55,040
Chef!

241
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,900
Stop right there!

242
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:01,330
Ah!

243
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,280
He sure is fast.

244
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,920
Hey, hey!

245
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,710
Hey, ahjusshi! Just a moment!
-Move!

246
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,550
-You can't! You can't!
-Let go of me!

247
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:48,210
Hey, hey! Aren't you letting go of me? Please let go of me!

248
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,980
I'm really sorry!

249
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,750
What is this? Hey, what is this?

250
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,910
What did you do?

251
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:04,210
-I bit him.
-Good job. Come here!

252
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:07,920
Why are you doing this?!

253
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,440
You've been going around stealing seats and in the end you got caught.

254
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,210
How surprising!

255
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:18,100
Because of you, all the neighborhood people's butts.

256
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,690
Thank you, Chef!

257
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:22,040
 Hurry up and go!

258
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,160
How did you catch him? He is a repeat offender, that bum.

259
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,080
-It wasn't me, but Na Bong Seon caught him.
-What?

260
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,810
She couldn't do it with her strength, so she bit his thigh. It was scary. Really.

261
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:35,840
Ah, no, Officer. I just bit him slightly.

262
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,730
In any case, it's true you caught him by biting him, Bong Seon.

263
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,780
I guess so.

264
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:44,780
Thank you. He was giving us such a headache. I'll buy you a meal sometime.

265
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,710
Ah, no. What meal? I'm okay.

266
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,170
See, kid? Since you're exercising with me,

267
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,550
your muscles are improving and your grip is getting better.

268
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:59,340
The two of you go exercising together, too?

269
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,580
Well . . .

270
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:06,070
No, ah. Her strength is lacking, so she can't hold a frying pan.

271
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:08,380
-Ah,
-So it's training.

272
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,010
You must be busy. Go on inside.

273
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:13,130
-Go safely, Hyungnim
-Yes, take care.

274
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:15,730
Bong Seon, go safely, too.

275
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:24,480
Did they leave? What's with the two of them?

276
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,500
Chef Kang isn't someone who would exercise with someone below him.

277
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,680
Yeah, I know.

278
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,380
I understand taking her around with him while doing the broadcast.

279
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,700
I'm a little surprised.

280
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,660
A little? It's a lot.

281
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,220
Right?

282
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:52,240
Please give me one iced Americano.

283
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,510
It's 4,300 won.

284
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,930
Here.

285
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,940
Na Bong!

286
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,050
Ah, Chef.

287
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,150
Come here and eat some of this.

288
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:08,180
What? No, I'm fine.

289
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,890
What do you mean you're fine? You didn't eat breakfast.

290
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,660
Hurry up and grab a fork.

291
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:17,810
It's a cake I really like, so I don't normally share, but I'm making an exception.

292
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:19,310
Yes.

293
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,860
How is it? Isn't it really good?

294
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,490
Yes, it's delicious.

295
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,330
You're smiling several times today.

296
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:37,180
How nice is that? It's perfect.

297
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:40,080
You don't overreact. And there's no "I'm sorry" or hunching over.

298
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,710
A person should have a middle ground.

299
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:47,590
I'm very pleased with you today, Na Bong Seon.

300
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:50,680
You even caught the thief, Wow!

301
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,380
I know you like it.

302
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:57,030
Seon Woo!

303
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,470
Hello.

304
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:01,760
Oh, So Hyeong. What's up?

305
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,960
What else? I came to see you.

306
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:20,850
You said you had an Americano, right? Here's a latte.

307
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,780
So, Bong Seon is using the storage room?

308
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,730
Yeah, just until she finds a room.

309
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,970
The kid is a little skinny and not too healthy.

310
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,520
She said she got kicked out of the student dorms, so I felt sorry for her.

311
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,910
What's going on with Kang Seon Woo who clearly draws a line between personal and professional life?

312
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,750
She's part of my family.

313
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,620
And it's a bit embarrassing to call it a room.

314
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,420
She's just spreading a blanket in the storage to sleep there.

315
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:50,120
Who said anything? Why do you keep making excuses? It's suspicious.

316
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,360
What do you mean suspicious?

317
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,340
But what's up, stopping by in the morning.

318
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:58,880
Just because. I was buying coffee in the cafe and saw the cake you like.

319
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,940
But I'll just take it back. You were eating one earlier.

320
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:05,120
No, leave it. I'd be thankful.

321
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,100
I eat bread three meals a day.

322
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:13,010
Oh! Hello!

323
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:14,990
Oh, yeah.

324
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:18,690
- We'll be back again in ten minutes.
 - Yes,yes, keep up with your chat.

325
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:20,530
Why? Where are...

326
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:22,490
Hey, don't overreact!

327
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:26,710
We can go out and do public exercise or play hopscotch...

328
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,990
It feels like we're disrupting the nice mood.

329
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,950
Be quiet! Just get ready to open.

330
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,690
Should we?

331
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:33,770
Have a nice time.

332
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,770
Geesh.

333
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:41,030
I should get going. I have to go to the station.

334
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,590
Go then.

335
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,590
I'll eat it well.

336
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:48,030
There's no one like a friend. Thanks.

337
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,730
Oh, yeah. I'm going.

338
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:52,710
Okay. Oh, your coffee.

339
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,990
Take care!

340
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:59,220
That person was PD Lee, wasn't it?

341
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,850
Ah! Is that your first time seeing PD Lee?

342
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,970
It's been a long time since she's been here, so I guess it could be.

343
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:08,050
She's so elegant. Is it because she's a Seoul woman?

344
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:11,030
Someone like her standing there, saying, "Cue! Cut!"

345
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:15,390
I think it would be so sexy! It'll be so exciting.

346
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,630
If you're going to get excited, hey, hey,

347
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:19,320
women should be like in a time-honored custom of,

348
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,970
"Ohhh, Oppa!" They need to have that cutesy-ness.

349
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:25,990
I don't think so. A woman like that should be aggressive.

350
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:28,890
A woman should be a little refined like that.

351
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:34,150
A career woman like that would seem more sexy, like in the middle of the night, I think she'll take the lead...

352
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:37,650
Oh, stop that! I'm going to start imagining things starting in the morning!

353
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:43,740
That's good, imagining is very good. Imagining, muuaahhh!

354
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:47,450
Hey. An imagination, you know,

355
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:52,950
it's something that is particularly necessary for a man who doesn't have a girlfriend in reality or is lonely.

356
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,030
Right, right.

357
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,600
Do you know what I like imagining the most?

358
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,050
-What is it?
-What, what?

359
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:59,270
Stay over on that side.

360
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,430
What are you doing?

361
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:06,010
Stay there. Stay there for a moment.

362
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:08,630
-Ay! Seriously!
-What are you doing?

363
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:11,050
Pervert! You pervert!

364
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:11,930
Hey, come here!

365
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:14,450
I'm scared!

366
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:17,750
Let go! I don't want to!

367
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,270
I said this was all for your sake!

368
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:22,190
You don't need to do it for me.

369
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:25,690
Let me just go up my way, please!

370
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,990
Stop that!

371
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:30,390
That's why I've left you alone until now, girl!

372
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:33,990
So what? Were you able to release your vexation?

373
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:36,070
You went running through inflexible men.

374
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:38,450
Fine. Let's say you did find your virile man.

375
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:41,010
Did that virile man say, "sure," and that he'd do it with you?

376
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:43,910
What if the few months you have left just passes you by?

377
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:47,330
Are you going to become an evil spirit and fight with me? Do you want that to happen, girl?

378
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:49,770
I'll succeed. All I have to do is succeed.

379
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,490
I said things were going well.

380
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:55,510
Don't make me laugh. It isn't such a simple and easy task.

381
00:24:55,510 --> 00:25:01,470
Even though this world seems to be reckless, there are many more people who protect rationality.

382
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,130
Agh! Ah!

383
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:09,630
Dear spirit! All living things must die.

384
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:14,390
Everything that's born must die, but

385
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:18,910
this pitiful soul is wondering around.

386
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:21,280
I'm scared! I don't want to do this!

387
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,450
Dearest god, with this soul with lingering regrets. God as my witness...

388
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:30,450
Unni!
- So she can be reborn in the land of paradise...

389
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:36,330
Amitabha!

390
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:40,910
I don't want to! I don't want to!!

391
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:53,230

392
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,970
 I know you like it.

393
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:17,690
Hey, PD Lee So Hyeong!

394
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:21,510
Your derrière is a killer.

395
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:23,890
Why are you at it again from early in the morning? Are you frustrated with work?

396
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:25,890
No, it's a habit.

397
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:30,070
When I see sexy women, this vernacular just pops out (needs to keep talking about it). Isn't this talent too?

398
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:33,050
Be careful. You'll get sued for sexual harassment at this rate.

399
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,630
My goodness, you're a bit irritable today.

400
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:38,350
You're more alluring that way.

401
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:42,830
Stop being like that. Date some guys while you can.

402
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:49,330
I know a guy who has amazing qualifications. He's interested in you. And he happens to be single.

403
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:50,930
I'm fine. I'll kindly decline.

404
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:55,150
You're at the prime of your life, you should be dating while you can.

405
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:58,450
Is this because of Kang Seon Woo by any chance?

406
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,410
Do you have something going on with him?

407
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,570
What would I have going on with him?

408
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:08,570
The staff all say that about you and Kang Seon Woo. That the way Kang Seon Woo looks at you is different.

409
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:11,410
They said it didn't seem like the two of you were just friends. No?

410
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:14,550
It isn't. We are really just friends.

411
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,030
Really?

412
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:19,410
Then do it. It would be a waste to see you go to someone else.

413
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:22,730
What do you think? Set it up? Should I do it?

414
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,690
I'll see.

415
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:27,330
You'll see.

416
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:31,690
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

417
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:36,750
Hey, how about getting crab soup and soju after work today? I heard about this really good place.

418
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:40,230
I have a crab allergy.

419
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:43,330
-Ah, it's so itchy! So itchy!
-Then you sit out.

420
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:44,030
What about you?

421
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:48,150
-My mother decided to suddenly come down.
-Your mother, just stop it, stop it.

422
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:51,990
Didn't you mother come down the day before yesterday, too?

423
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:55,650
Did your mother go back and is coming up again or is she many people?

424
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,570
You didn't say crabs, did you?

425
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:58,870
I did say crabs?

426
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:01,350
Crabs? Of course, we should eat crabs.

427
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,050
My mother probably hasn't left yet.

428
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,510
Wait a second.

429
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:07,830
Hey, are you going to keep pulling this kind of tricks?

430
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:11,310
I should just...

431
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,630
Oh?

432
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:17,790
Ah, I nicked a knife because of you!

433
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:18,790
Hey.

434
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,650
Isn't that Chef's knife?

435
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,890
It's mine. What are you tal...

436
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:28,870
I'm ruined. I'm ruined. He is going to throw a fit.

437
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:32,890
How could you use Chef's knife? He hates people touching his knife!

438
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:35,790
Did I know it was Chef's knife? I just grabbed anything.

439
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:38,430
What are you going to do about this?

440
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,810
Shoot.

441
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:45,330
Hey, hey, Bong, Bong, Bong, Bong. Keep a lookout.

442
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:51,430
He's not here yet.

443
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,990
Look, look.

444
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:03,490
H-h-he's coming!

445
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:04,650
Are the crabs fresh?

446
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:05,510
Yes, Chef!

447
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,190
Those are pincers. Take the dirt out of the gills well.

448
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,550
Yes, sir.

449
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:13,170
Why is my knife out?

450
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:14,990
Did someone use my knife?

451
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:18,990
That's..well, while I was sharpening my knife, I did yours, too.

452
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:25,590
Why would you sharpen my knife?

453
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,470
-It got shorter.
-That wouldn't be.

454
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:31,170
No, it got shorter by 1 mm. Min Soo, bring me your knife so I can compare.

455
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:34,750
Yes, Chef. Will you give me my knife?

456
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:38,850
Why do something I didn't even ask you to?

457
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:41,830
Oh, So Hyeong..

458
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:47,890
Agh, this one's a new one. A new one. Why does he have such good eyes?

459
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,310
What? Is something the matter?

460
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,410
No.

461
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:56,250
I was editing the recording from last time. The one that got cut off because of Bong Seon.

462
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:59,650
I put them together so it wouldn't be obvious, so not to worry.

463
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:02,110
Why would I worry?

464
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,370
You called to report that to me?

465
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:05,730
Yeah.

466
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:08,890
I also settled the matter with Bong Seon being the assistant. With the CP.

467
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,510
 So don't worry about it.

468
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,650
Okay, that's good.

469
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:16,690
I got it. Thanks. Let's talk later.

470
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:17,570
Hey, Seon Woo.

471
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,150
What?

472
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:22,910
You know that Sunbae you saw at the station last time?

473
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:26,850
He wants to set me up with a hoobae he knows who is interested in me.

474
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:27,790
Should I do it?

475
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,590
A blind date?

476
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:36,030
Ye..ah, do it. It wouldn't be a bad idea to meet him.

477
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:36,850
Do it?

478
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:38,450
 Yeah, do it.

479
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:42,390
You say that so easily.

480
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:45,410
You're telling me to do it, aren't you? Okay, I see.

481
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:49,010
I'll try it.  I can't die without ever dating, right?

482
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:51,150
 Okay, I'm hanging up.

483
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,950
Are you okay?

484
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,970
Does it sting a lot?

485
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:15,930
I'm sorry.

486
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:19,230
I didn't do it on purpose.

487
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:21,730
Something must have happened to me at that moment.

488
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:23,610
Because I really didn't want to, I must have gotten worked up.

489
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:25,710
It's an evil spirit.

490
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,650
Huh?

491
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:33,330
That energy you had in your eyes during that moment was an evil spirit.

492
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:36,850
Evil spirit?

493
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:42,890
There isn't much time until it is three years from your death, right?

494
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:47,750
It's the evil spirit slowly taking over your energy.

495
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:52,150
And in your excitable state, it popped out without you even realizing it.

496
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,210
I don't know either.

497
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:59,750
What am I to do with you?

498
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,570
Aihoo, it's really rotten.

499
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,650
You want me to taste all of these?

500
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:14,070
Yeah. I put it here for you to taste.

501
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,820
You simply used them while cooking.

502
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:19,890
Have you ever thought about what flavor they each hold?

503
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:23,930
For example, look at all the salts that I laid out.

504
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:27,350
They taste different for each region and company.

505
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,310
You have to distinctly know that,

506
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:32,390
in order to be make a perfect dish. Taste it.

507
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:33,790
Yes.

508
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,360
It's salty.

509
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,930
Don't just think it's salty, stupid.

510
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:50,840
Roll your tongue around slowly... and distinguish the salty, sweet, bitter, and spicy tastes.

511
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,070
Is there a sweet taste in salt?

512
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,870
Of course.

513
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:58,710
That's why we're having this class right now.

514
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:01,540
Try it. 
-Yes.

515
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:08,870
If you remember this taste well right now,

516
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:13,650
you know which salt to use when you cook.

517
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:16,370
Yes. 
-The olive oil too.

518
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,410
The same goes for that, too.

519
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:22,830
Distinguish when the oils were pressed.

520
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,430
Yes.

521
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:53,200
If you're able to understand the cooking ingredients, no matter where or when,

522
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,050
you can make the perfect dish that you want. Here.

523
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,650
What is this, Chef?

524
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:03,730
Ginger tea.

525
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:11,050
After you taste all this, drink this last. It'll settle down your innards and your mouth will be refreshed.

526
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:13,930
Okay? 
-Yes, Chef.

527
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:18,190
I'm going to leave now. Taste everything.

528
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:21,330
Yes. 
-Tomorrow I'm going to ask you about everything.

529
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:23,550
Yes, Chef.

530
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:43,630
 Sorry
We're CLOSED

531
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:54,940
Bong Seon. 
-Hello.

532
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,350
Are you leaving right now? 
-Yes. 
-It's late.

533
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:59,830
Ah, you must be making your rounds.

534
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:05,390
I'm done now. I have to go, finish up, and leave.

535
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:06,650
Have you eaten dinner?

536
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:09,310
Huh? No, not yet.

537
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:12,150
You must be hungry. Look at the time.

538
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,310
I'll buy you a late-night snack.

539
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:15,570
Huh? No, I'm okay.

540
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:19,910
Come on, let's go eat. It's better than eating by yourself at home.

541
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:25,970
I just have to report back. Do you know the food tent at the intersection? Do you want to wait for me there?

542
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:27,770
I'll see you later.

543
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:30,330
Yes.

544
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:35,770
Ah, why isn't Na Bong Seon checking it? She's not even busy.

545
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:39,790
She could be busy. She's even doing a show.

546
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:44,510
She's not even the main character, so what? You said she'll exercise with you today.

547
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:50,870
A person should keep their promises. She shouldn't be playing push-pull games with an adult.

548
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:55,670
She'll come by when time allows. Just because you just want to see her.

549
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:59,720
Why would I want to see her?

550
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,170
Hey!

551
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,900
Why aren't you answering my calls? Do you know how many times I called you?

552
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:16,470
Me? I think you're mistaken.

553
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:23,210
Wha..what was that? Father.

554
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:25,850
She just blew us off, didn't she?

555
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:29,410
How could she do that? Wow.

556
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:34,310
I can't believe this happened.

557
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:40,330
Has she lost it?

558
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:43,070
Okay, fine with the phone calls. But why blow us off?

559
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:46,130
Fine, say she does that to me. But what about you, Father?

560
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:49,970
Be frugal with electricity. Turn off the light over there.

561
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:57,750
She must have had a reason to do that.

562
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:01,290
Reason? What reason? Bull S***.

563
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:06,010
Even push-pull should be in moderation.  Is she trying to train her father-in-law to be or what?

564
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:09,770
And the acting was top-notch. She was totally natural.

565
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:13,750
That's true. Her expression did look as if she didn't know us.

566
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:16,570
Right? You saw her expression, didn't you?

567
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:19,310
Do we have to send her to Hollywood or what?

568
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:25,410
I'm so mad! Dad, do you want some soju today? Can you stay sober now?

569
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:29,050
I'm fine. You go ahead.

570
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:41,550
You should order something more. This doesn't seem like enough for a prize.

571
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:46,110
No, this is plenty.

572
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,990
You're quite surprising, Bong Seon.

573
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,890
What? What is?

574
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:56,810
I mean, it's something I felt since before. But it seems like you're a different person each time I see you.

575
00:37:56,810 --> 00:38:03,500
Sometimes you seem like an introverted person, and sometimes you're like a wild young lady too.

576
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:07,210
-Is that an image?
-No, no, it's not that.

577
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:10,350
My mood keeps coming and going.

578
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:13,570
Does your memory come and go, too?

579
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:16,150
Last time, you couldn't remember coming to the station.

580
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:22,470
Th...that is...I'm a bit absent-minded, that's why. I'm sorry.

581
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:29,310
I'm sorry. You didn't have to explain that far.

582
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:33,200
I must have sounded like I'm interrogating.

583
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,860
No, it wasn't.

584
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:39,190
It's just that I worry about you.

585
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:46,670
When we met last time at dawn, you looked like you were in danger. Like someone standing on the edge of a precipice.

586
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,800
It didn't seem like someone else's problem.

587
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:57,430
There were moments like that several times in my life, too.

588
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:04,060
I...actually...

589
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:09,460
No, it's nothing.

590
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:17,330
Yes, well, it's nothing. If you say it's nothing, then it's nothing.

591
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:18,770
Go ahead and eat.

592
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:22,490
Yes, yes. Thank you for the food.

593
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:32,490
Why is she so quiet? Is she asleep already?

594
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:41,290
What?

595
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:46,100
 It's been how long since your mom calls and that's all you can say, "What?"

596
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:50,590
I was caught off guard because it's been a while since you called.

597
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,990
What is it? Is something the matter?

598
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:54,010
 Yes, there is, punk.

599
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:56,370
 I'm sick.

600
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:58,530
Sick? How so?

601
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,170
Mom! Are you okay?

602
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:05,830
Oh, you're here, Son? Come in, come in!

603
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:08,110
You came right on time.

604
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:11,910
What is this? You said you weren't feeling well?

605
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:22,370
I took some medicine last night and slept well and now I feel so much better.

606
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:26,970
You know how easily my body responds to alcohol or medicine.

607
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:30,950
-You were lying about being sick, weren't you?
-You look thin. You're not dieting these days, are you?

608
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:33,210
Oppa, you're here.

609
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:35,270
I was tricked by mom into coming.

610
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:39,470
-She's always deceiving me, her acting is so..
-Quiet and eat this.

611
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,730
Do you know how much work I did since you were coming?

612
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:48,090
Try eating it. I made this with such care.

613
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:52,550
And you even burned this? I'm going to go nuts.

614
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:56,490
It's not easy to not make toast properly. Mom, you're amazing.

615
00:40:56,490 --> 00:41:00,690
What? It isn't even burned that much!

616
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:03,910
It might be easy for someone like you.

617
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:08,130
For me, seasoning a bean sprout dish is harder than getting a doctorate.

618
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:12,990
Well, yeah, well. Woooo, it's better than last time.

619
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:17,030
-Yeah, compared to last time...
-Don't even compare it to last time.

620
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,440
Seon Woo, when did you say your vacation from the restaurant was starting?

621
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:25,430
I was planning for next...next week, why?

622
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:32,570
You, this year, you have to be careful of even water. Do you know that?

623
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:36,910
Oh, right! That talisman underwear I got from Yeonchu,

624
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:40,430
-are you wearing those? You have to wear those.
-Why do I have to wear them?

625
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:42,590
Where are you looking, Professor Lee?

626
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:45,850
What's wrong? I'm your mother!

627
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:48,310
If you feel it's unfair, then look at mine.

628
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:53,230
- Look, look at mine.
- No, no! I'm not looking! Sit down. I won't take mine off and I'm not looking.

629
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:57,030
-You, something is strange with you. Are you not wearing anything?
-I'm not taking off mine and I'm not looking!

630
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:58,990
Why are you doing this?!

631
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:01,090
-Do you know how much those were?
-No, no, that's not it!

632
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:03,590
-That underwear cost 200,000 won! 
 - That hurts. That hurts!

633
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,750
Something is really strange about you.

634
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:10,060
There's nothing to eat here, but why is there so much food garbage?

635
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,530
Unni.

636
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:17,440
What?

637
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,880
Stop calling me and just talk. It's a bother to respond.

638
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:28,440
If I stay like this, I'll really become an evil spirit, won't I?

639
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:32,180
I suppose.

640
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,800
Would it be different because it's you?

641
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,600
I'm scared.

642
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,370
The rite for the passage to heaven is scary and I don't like it,

643
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:48,690
but I'm more afraid and hate becoming an evil spirit.

644
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,940
I didn't know three years would go by so quickly.

645
00:42:53,940 --> 00:43:00,420
If you would have attained nirvana when I gave you the warning, things wouldn't be this messy.

646
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:06,260
Things don't turn out well for children who don't listen to what adults tell them.

647
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:10,050
Ow, this hurts.

648
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:12,940
Do I have to disinfect it again?

649
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:19,550
It hurts? Do you have any leftover soju? Soju is the best for disinfecting.

650
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:23,570
I know that, too. Stop being like a know-it-all, girl.

651
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,450
I had some in here.

652
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:33,510
Let's see.

653
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:38,490
Is it here? I left it here, where did it go?

654
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:44,180
I keep forgetting where I put things if they're not in their places.

655
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:51,320
Am I doing the right thing?

656
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:56,980
Because feelings of dislike is also an attachment, my heart has gone soft.

657
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:04,120
I don't know. So what if it's her son?

658
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:12,780
Please just release your vexation, you poor thing.

659
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:24,300

660
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:31,990
What is this situation?

661
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:35,430
Even until yesterday, didn't things seem lovey-dovey with our Chef?

662
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:37,850
Yeah, I definitely thought so, too.

663
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:42,930
It must not be! Would she be crazy to bring a man to our restaurant then?

664
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:47,070
Who knows? Maybe she's trying to make him jealous or something.

665
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:49,450
But the mood is strange, eh.

666
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:51,890
It does seem like the Chef is somehow controlling his expression too.

667
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:55,630
What is PD Lee trying to do that she is going around with that kind of guy?

668
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:58,170
I can clearly see that he is countrified.

669
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:00,620
He is totally on a different level than our goddess.

670
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:03,790
Who goes around parting their hair in the middle now days?

671
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:11,460
And what do you mean a goddess?

672
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:15,310
Hey, looks like that are a dime a dozen on the streets of finance district, you yahoo.

673
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:18,030
Finance district? Which one?

674
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:21,530
The road to the finance district.

675
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:24,170
Like the road, is it lined with much sophistication?

676
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:26,010
Aren't you guys going to work?

677
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:27,010
Yes, Chef. Sorry.

678
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:30,210
- Is the food being made with your mouths? 
 -  No, Chef.

679
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:38,170
Hey, Min Soo. Take over this.

680
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:44,790
Oh, he is prickly.

681
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:53,170
-The restroom?
-No, I was waiting for you.

682
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:56,450
What do you think of that man?

683
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:05,090
I'm not sure. I only saw him briefly. He has a good impression. And he seems sincere.

684
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:07,070
Is that all?

685
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:15,390
And if he was set up with you, his qualifications must be good.

686
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:17,730
You should try dating him. I don't think it would be bad.

687
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:20,370
I should keep dating him?

688
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:24,630
Yeah, if you're okay with it. You can't tell after just once.

689
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:30,490
You're really okay with it.

690
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:36,950
I'm suddenly annoyed. Because I'm the only one not okay.

691
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:47,310
Oh, never mind. I don't know why I'm like this. Let's stop.

692
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:03,950
Where should we have some coffee? I know a place...

693
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:09,970
I'm sorry. But I think I have to go back.

694
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:11,070
What?

695
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:13,870
I'm sorry. I have some editing to do.

696
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:17,690
Thank you for today. I enjoyed the meal, too.

697
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:34,230
 You're really okay with it.

698
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:39,690
 I'm suddenly annoyed. Because I'm the only one not okay.

699
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:47,250
I don't want it. I don't like the rite to heaven, and becoming an evil spirit, I hate it more.

700
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:51,790
I'm going to release my vexation my way and go up. I'm going to.

701
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:56,390
Hey, Na Bong Seon!

702
00:47:56,390 --> 00:47:57,390
Grandma!

703
00:47:57,390 --> 00:48:00,350
Why are you so surprised? Shouldn't you be used to this by now?

704
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:03,270
No, no, no. That's not important. I don't have any time. I have nothing to lose right now.

705
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:04,550
What are you talking about?

706
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:06,750
I don't have time to get permission from you. I'm going to go in now.

707
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:07,870
Are you crazy?

708
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:10,610
I said I don't have any time! I said I'm about to become an evil spirit!

709
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:13,290
Hey!

710
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:16,110
No!

711
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:19,290
Hey, please! Do you want to be responsible for me becoming an evil spirit?

712
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:22,150
Wh-wh-why would I? I don't know anything about evil spirits.

713
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:25,750
You shouldn't talk like that. As a Seoul citizen, you have a moral duty.

714
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:28,470
If you know how bad evil spirits are, you can't say that.

715
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:32,610
Wa...wait! I'm not a Seoul citizen. I'm from Chungcheong.

716
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:34,990
Yeah, we're all Koreans! We're in the same boat!

717
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:36,330
I don't know! I don't know!

718
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:39,310
Hey, I'm going in!

719
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:42,570
You can't! Ah!

720
00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:45,070
Hey, stop right there!

721
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:49,230
Oh, hey! Come here.

722
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:53,150
Oh man, she is igniting my aggressiveness.

723
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:56,430
-I was athletic...
-Grandma!

724
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,390
Chef Kang?

725
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:05,670
D-d-d-don't look.

726
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:06,970
Why is Chef Kang in here?

727
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:08,990
N-n-nothing.

728
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:11,760
What is it? Do you perhaps?

729
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,120
No, it's not.

730
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,410
What's not?

731
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:18,150
J-j-just everything is not.

732
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:21,150
Hey, you do!

733
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:25,330
N-n-no.

734
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:27,410
Really?!

735
00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:32,890
Since when?

736
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:37,710
You liked him this whole time? By yourself? One-sided crush?

737
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:41,810
You're really something.

738
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:45,590
That's why you put up with all that abuse.

739
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:47,980
Now I get it.

740
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:50,590
Usually unrequited love is my area of expertise.

741
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:56,770
Hey, Na Bong Seon. This actually turned out for the best.

742
00:49:56,770 --> 00:50:00,490
Since it turned out like this, let's help each other out.

743
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:08,870
Kang Seon Woo. That man who thinks he's so great. I'll make him yours.

744
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:11,190
What do you mean by that?

745
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:15,590
It's obvious with your personality you won't approach the Chef.

746
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:19,390
And there's no reason for Chef to notice you first.

747
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:23,270
I will seduce him for you.

748
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:24,510
Why?

749
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:28,190
Why else? I'm a virgin ghost. In order to release this vexation,

750
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:31,550
I need a virile man. Chef is that virile man.

751
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:34,460
So I can release my regret and leave this earth, a

752
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:39,270
nd you and Chef can oooohoooh. We'll both win-win. How about it?

753
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,920
But still, that's a little...

754
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,850
This isn't a "but still, a little" you frustrating girl!

755
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:47,810
Do you know who Chef Kang likes?

756
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:50,610
He likes PD Lee. From a long time ago.

757
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:54,290
But PD Lee is single. It's only a matter of time for a man and woman to have eyes for each other.

758
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:59,710
One wrong move, and Chef Kang is gone! That won't do, that won't do.

759
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:04,790
And also, well, I need to bring this up now,

760
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:08,950
but isn't the fact that you're next to Chef all thanks to me?

761
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:11,970
You know my personality. Going at him no matter what.

762
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:15,630
There's no man who doesn't cave after ten times.

763
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:21,210
And Chef seems to think of you dearly these days.

764
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:23,490
But still.

765
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:29,220
But still, that's not right. I don't want to get Chef that way.

766
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:32,570
Why not? Would it bother you that much for me to release my vexation using your body?

767
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:35,210
This isn't the time for you to be so picky.

768
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:38,190
You have to make Chef Kang your man.

769
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:40,850
No. But still. What's not right isn't right.

770
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:46,290
Hey, Na Bong Seon! Miss Na!

771
00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:48,670
That dummy!

772
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:55,030
If it were me, I'd be so glad to just do it. She is too conservative.

773
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:06,290
I'm so hungry, I can't even pray for long.

774
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:14,990
There's three of them. I have to make it through this week on that.

775
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,690
I'll just eat half.

776
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:27,710
Why is she calling now?

777
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:32,910
I sent the ghost to her son, so I don't think I can face her for the time being.

778
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:38,690
Yeah, it's me.

779
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:41,040
Dearie? What are you doing?

780
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,650
Uh, me, I'm just here.

781
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:48,830
I want some pork ribs and soju, but don't want to eat alone.

782
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:51,070
Ah, pork ribs?

783
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:58,550
But what can I do? I'm fighting a cold today.

784
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:02,690
I think I'll just have to rest today.

785
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:07,850
Oh, really? That's too bad. I really wanted to see you today.

786
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:12,090
 Okay, take care of yourself. I'll call you soon.

787
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:15,290
 Hanging up.

788
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:21,590
I'm so hungry and can't even mooch a meal. This is rotten.

789
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:26,190
Why of all those men does the virile man have to be Kang Seon Woo?

790
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:32,410
Sheesh. Is this dreaded girl releasing her vexation or what?

791
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:36,120
My goodness.

792
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:39,760
Why today are there no stars in the sky?

793
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:43,360
 I know. It's really dark.

794
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,760
 My heart feels dark, too.

795
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:52,370
 If I become an evil spirit when three years pass, I won't be able to recognize you, Father.

796
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:53,820
 What will I do?

797
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:55,820
It's so hot.

798
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:58,760
Is autumn going to come?

799
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:02,260
 That autumn is scary, Father.

800
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:07,500
 Why am I wondering around instead of going to the afterlife like the others do?

801
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:11,500
 Is being a virgin such a vexation?

802
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:22,280

803
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:26,590
This time it's tomatoes. Start by taking off the stem.

804
00:54:26,590 --> 00:54:28,510
Yes, Chef.

805
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:31,310
Stop! Stop!

806
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:34,980
Because tomatoes are soft, if you hold the knife long like that and the knife slides in,

807
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,690
-  where will you get hurt? 
 - Oh.

808
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:39,650
-Your left hand will be hurt, right?
-Yes.

809
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:42,610
Look here. Hold the knife.

810
00:54:42,610 --> 00:54:44,740
-Don't hold it long like that.
-Yes.

811
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:47,810
- Hold the knife on the back up here really short.

812
00:54:47,810 --> 00:54:50,190
-Like this.
-Yes.

813
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:54,770
Hold my hand like you're holding the knife. Hold it.

814
00:54:56,370 --> 00:55:00,990
Good. Like this.

815
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:04,350
Turning it with your left hand.

816
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:08,570
-Okay?
-Yes.

817
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:12,070
Half the battle in cooking is knife skills.

818
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:16,430
Okay, enough for today.

819
00:55:16,430 --> 00:55:19,130
-Clean up.
-Yes, Chef.

820
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:21,570
Go on in.

821
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:51,130
What is this? Is this So Hyeong?

822
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:54,510
It's Kang Seon Woo!

823
00:55:58,010 --> 00:56:01,630
You, oh, did you drink a lot?

824
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:03,470
Have you been drinking with that guy until now?

825
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:06,870
No. I drank alone.

826
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:11,630
I was so mad that I drank by myself.

827
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:15,450
I'm not in the best mood today.

828
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:18,270
You're really drunk. I'll take you home.

829
00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:21,930
No, no! Wait a second.

830
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:25,570
I didn't come here to have you bring me home.

831
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:32,230
I'll just ask you one thing since I'm already embarrassed.

832
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:38,550
Are you really okay? Even if I'm with another man?

833
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:42,490
Watching you with that assistant who means nothing,

834
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:48,130
watching you being worried or concerned about her, makes me jealous.

835
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:52,170
But you're not like that? Not in the slightest?

836
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:56,530
Why are you suddenly doing this, So Hyeong?

837
00:56:57,430 --> 00:57:02,030
Yeah, that's right. That's what makes me mad.

838
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:05,420
Why am I suddenly being like this?

839
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:10,730
Okay, let's say I'm like this. But what about you?

840
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:14,770
You didn't think of me as just a friend, did you?

841
00:57:14,770 --> 00:57:16,570
Right?

842
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:20,110
So Hyeong.

843
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:12,990
I don't know why living like this is so hard.

844
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:16,910
Living is hard. Being dead is hard.

845
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,350
Why is life like this?

846
00:58:18,350 --> 00:58:26,290
What's so hard? You said you found your virile man. You haven't made any progress after kissing him?

847
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:29,750
Hey, you don't have any time! You should just skip everything and go right in for it.

848
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:35,690
You know when a woman jumps a man while he is walking down the stairs, then all politeness goes away.

849
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:41,690
It's all useless. I can't possess the one the virile man has a heart for.

850
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:47,890
And the one I could probably possess is resisting saying I can't use her body.

851
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:51,070
So, are you giving up?

852
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:53,010
I don't know either.

853
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:57,710
I might have to.

854
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:07,390
I really wanted to do it once.

855
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:13,270
What's easy for others, why is it so hard for me?

856
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:14,570
Even after dying.

857
00:59:14,570 --> 00:59:20,610
Hey, even while living there are things that don't go the way you want. What can you do?

858
00:59:20,610 --> 00:59:23,550
If it's hard, just tell Seobbingo to send you off.

859
00:59:23,550 --> 00:59:26,350
It's better than becoming an evil spirit.

860
00:59:26,350 --> 00:59:31,450
The ritual  for passage to Heaven will be extremely painful, don't you think?

861
00:59:32,590 --> 00:59:36,650
Would it be comparable to a kidney stone?

862
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:41,070
I'm not sure. I heard it's less painful having a baby.

863
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:02,570
 Pleased to meet you. I'm Na Bong Seon.

864
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:35,010
 Do you know who Chef Kang likes? He likes PD Lee. Since a long time ago.

865
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:40,330
 One wrong move and Chef Kang is gone! That won't do! That won't do!

866
01:00:50,790 --> 01:00:54,230
Hey, Ghost! I have something to say to you!

867
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:56,910
Why aren't you here when I'm looking for you?

868
01:00:56,910 --> 01:00:58,830
Hey!

869
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:02,610
I really have something to say!

870
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:09,970
Where did you go? Hey! Ghost!

871
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:16,370
I don't know... do the ritual to Heaven or becoming a demon...

872
01:01:16,370 --> 01:01:20,430
I'll become something, I suppose. Darn it!

873
01:01:29,730 --> 01:01:31,850
It's Na Bong Seon!

874
01:01:33,810 --> 01:01:36,270
I was looking for you.

875
01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:41,090
Me? You were looking for me?

876
01:01:41,090 --> 01:01:43,570
You. I was looking for you for a long time.

877
01:01:43,570 --> 01:01:48,810
Why? You even set fire to chase me away not so long ago.

878
01:01:48,810 --> 01:01:52,970
Why would puritanically stubborn Na Bong Seon come looking for me now?

879
01:01:54,730 --> 01:01:57,630
I'll permit you to come into my body.

880
01:01:58,310 --> 01:01:59,590
Huh?

881
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:04,130
I'm telling you to possess me. Make Chef Kang mine.

882
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:23,610
♫ Our relationship that turned strange that we're unrecognizable ♫

883
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:30,650
♫  Like a fool it's slowly crumbling apart   ♫

884
01:02:30,650 --> 01:02:35,420
 Preview

885
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:37,130
 I really want you, Chef.

886
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:38,670
 Go for it!
Go for it!

887
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:41,870
 To rally our unity, I'm thinking vacation...

888
01:02:41,870 --> 01:02:43,850
 Just jump him!

889
01:02:43,850 --> 01:02:48,150
 I don't think it would be good to have him drink a lot. To get a thing going.

890
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:50,440
 -It's too late, isn't it? To catch the hit and run person.

891
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:53,170
Give up on that now. Eun Hee has me now.

892
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:56,130
 Why is there another unnie inside that  Unni's body?

893
01:02:56,130 --> 01:02:59,670
 What are you talking about? I don't know what you're saying.

894
01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:04,550
 Does Bong Seon have anything to do with you keeping your distance?
