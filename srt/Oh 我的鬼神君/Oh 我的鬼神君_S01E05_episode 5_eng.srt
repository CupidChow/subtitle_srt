1
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,770
 Oh My Ghostess

2
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:17,950

3
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,430
 Oh My Ghostess

4
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,300
 Episode 5

5
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,600
It seems to be a temporary shock due to high fever.

6
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,080
She should be okay.

7
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,520
She is a little malnourished, so she needs to finish getting the IV before she goes.

8
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,040
Yes.

9
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,680
Thank you.

10
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,000
She sure knows how to scare a person.

11
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,640
Where am I?

12
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,320
Are you okay? Are you alert now?

13
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,040
Ye..yes, Ch..ef,

14
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,600
But, where am I?

15
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,700
You're at the hospital, kid.

16
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,800
You lost consciousness because your fever was too high.

17
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,560
A fever?

18
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,020
Who gets a fever and is so dense not to do anything to the point of passing out?

19
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,300
What?

20
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,040
Either go to the hospital or say something.

21
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,340
I guess you did tell me.

22
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,480
Think about it from my perspective. You wanted to do it...

23
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,800
After wanting to do it you get sick with a fever, would I believe you?

24
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,180
What?

25
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,400
Hmm?

26
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,220
 July 17

27
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,980
Huh? Is it?

28
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,400
Anyway, I'm sorry.

29
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,420
The doctor said that your immune system is weak.

30
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,460
So take this opportunity to be hospitalized and get some rest.

31
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,820
I'll look into a room so just wait.

32
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,420
Where did she run off?

33
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,860
She's not even in good shape, where in the world would she go now?

34
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,580
Grandma.

35
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,380
 Yeah, Seon, what is it?

36
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,200
 Seon, are you all right?

37
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,560
No, I'm not okay, Grandma.

38
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,600
I was definitely dozing off at the bus station, but

39
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,880
when I woke up two weeks had passed.

40
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,880
And I look strange and they say my dorm room isn't mine.

41
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,760
I don't remember, but people say that I did things.

42
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,300
Grandma, I'm scared.

43
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,580
I don't know what's going on.

44
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:24,100
 My intuition was right.

45
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,560
 For some reason, when I spoke to you on the phone, it seemed strange.

46
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,140
Grandma, you spoke to me on the phone?

47
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,880
Wh..when?

48
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,680
 Listen carefully, Seon.

49
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,980
  You were possessed by a ghost.

50
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,540
Possessed?

51
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:47,020
Oh, Chef? Why are you alone? What about Na Bong Seon?

52
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,800
What? What? Is she in bad shape? Did she get admitted?

53
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,180
If not, did she...?

54
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,180
She's not here yet.

55
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,940
With nowhere to go, where in the world did she go?

56
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,980
Who? Na Bong Seon?

57
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,000
She made me so worried and...

58
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,160
So, she didn't die then, did she?

59
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,480
They say, the shocked heart after seeing a burnt child will be shocked seeing a turtle (once bitten, twice shy).

60
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,320
Because I died so suddenly, you know.

61
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,620
She probably went to a sauna or something.

62
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,200
She doesn't have any money!

63
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,780
She probably only has a cellphone in her pocket.

64
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,840
I take her to the hospital, I pay her hospital bills, how much better can I treat her?

65
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,460
Right?

66
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:26,160
It's not like I am her parent or something.

67
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,960
That is true,

68
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,040
but you could have brought her. She's probably having a total mental break down right now.

69
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,680
I don't know, and I don't care.

70
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,060
I don't know, and I'm not going to care, damn it.

71
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,340
 Oh, what a beautiful sight!

72
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:05,280
So what if a virile man is in front of me? I can't even lay a finger on him.

73
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,580
Oh, don't wear it, don't wear it.

74
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,960
 Hey, hey.

75
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,320
Perfect.

76
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,000
Oh, I'm tired.

77
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:42,120
She did have somewhere to go, and she was lying?

78
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,520
She was so scary when she was so forward.

79
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,520
Worry if she's here, worry if she's not, I don't know.

80
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,520
I can't do this anymore!

81
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:20,260
I can't be doing like this right now. I don't have time right now. I have to possess another woman and do something.

82
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:25,500
Here, here. First, the person with the highest chance of success is...

83
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,740
Ah, that woman has really strong spirit.

84
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,660
If it's become like this, then it's all or nothing. Try and try!

85
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,040
Should I give it a start?

86
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,620
Strong energy, very strong.

87
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,720
Huh? What? Why is it like this?

88
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,280
Hey, hey!

89
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,900
Did everything that I edited till now get deleted?

90
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:35,080
Sunbae, you're hungry, aren't you? Cup ramen delivery.

91
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,420
Why is it like this?

92
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,740
And what's wrong with you?

93
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,300
What is it? What?

94
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,200
Tell me.

95
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:58,400
 You have to stay very alert and protect your body.

96
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,400
 Once a ghost has rested in you, it can use your body at any time.

97
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,340
 For now, don't even make eye contact and ignore it.

98
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,400
 If it still doesn't give up then,

99
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,560
 you have to just come out strong. Open your eyes wide.

100
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:18,800
 And tell it that you're not a pushover.

101
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,180
It is up to you, Bong Seon.

102
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,880
Oh,

103
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,020
What are you doing here at this hour?

104
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:43,060
What? Well...that is...

105
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:53,570
-Coffee
-Thank you. Thank you very much.

106
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:59,230
No need to thank me. You were a ramen friend, too. To me.

107
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,500
What? A ramen friend?

108
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,940
A few days ago at the convenience store.

109
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,780
Don't you remember?

110
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:13,370
Yes, I do. I think I do. It was ramen then.

111
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:24,400
Will you be okay? Your face looks pale.

112
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:30,030
What happened? If I can help you, I will.

113
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:40,670
If it's too hard to, you don't have to tell me. But, whenever you want to talk,

114
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:43,740
call me. Okay?

115
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,830
I'll get going first. Thank you.

116
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:51,290
Let's go together. I'll take you to the restaurant.

117
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,720
The restaurant?

118
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:07,430
Hyungnim! Are you going to work out?

119
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:10,560
How are you both coming together at this hour?

120
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,440
I was patrolling early in the morning, and I saw her sitting on a bench alone

121
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,130
so from the resident protection center on the way to the police station, I brought her back.

122
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,860
-Loyalty!
-A bench?

123
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,170
Tell me you weren't somewhere on the street...

124
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,350
-First go inside.
-What?
-Go inside.

125
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,480
Thank you.

126
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:46,010
Aren't you working too hard nowadays?

127
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:49,350
You should stop working at night. You have to take care of your body.

128
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,930
Then go on. You can go.

129
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,810
 Starting now at least, be very alert.

130
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:05,490
 You have to protect your body. Once a ghost has rested in your body,

131
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,830
 it can use your body again at any time.

132
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,830
Hey, Na Bong.

133
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:15,690
Did you spend the night on the street yesterday? Did you?

134
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,140
No, that is...

135
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:24,650
This girl has no fear. What will you do if something hideous happens to you?

136
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,670
You're not even well. Why did you do that?

137
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:32,720
I told you to get admitted and rest a few days. Why did you run off?

138
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,670
What? That is...

139
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:40,270
Why is she like this? Why is she zoned out?

140
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:44,300
-Na Bong.
-S..sorry. I'm sorry.

141
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,820
My goodness. I haven't heard that in a long time.

142
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,700
I'm sorry.

143
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:28,660
Hey, Bong! Good morning!

144
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,400
-Hey, Bong!
-What...what, what is it?

145
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,130
What do you mean, what? You're suddenly pushing me away.

146
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:37,740
You're the one who liked being all touchy-feely.

147
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:42,240
No, I'm sorry. I'm sor..

148
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,210
Why is she acting like this now? Why is she ignoring me all of the sudden, making me feel awkward?

149
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:52,810
After drinking, she kept yelling oh na jib! (shortcut for "I want to go to Oppa's house tonight).

150
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,920
What does oh na jip mean?

151
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,330
Oppa, I want to go to your house today! Oh na jip.

152
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:02,080
Wow, you are so trendy. Your sense of humor.

153
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:08,700
It's great.

154
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:13,620
Today, let's be on our best. We have lot of reservations.

155
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,250
Since there are customers that we need to pay special attention to as well, Min Soo, you give us the update.

156
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,160
Ah, yes, Chef.

157
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,130
Now, there's a reservation for a party of five at 11:00.

158
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:28,010
And the party who requested a window seat, changed the time to 1:00.

159
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:32,470
Also at noon, there is a reservation for a gathering for the Canadian Ambassador and acquaintances with their spouses.

160
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:37,890
But two of those six people are vegetarians, so they asked for us to pay special attention to them.

161
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,860
Oh, but they will eat milk, cheese and eggs.

162
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:46,170
Okay, what would be good for the vegetarians?

163
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:50,080
Since it's summer, how about a tomato-based eggplant pasta?

164
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,560
Since they're foreigners, it would be good to offer crushed red pepper if they prefer it.

165
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,380
Sounds good. Let's go with that.

166
00:15:55,380 --> 00:16:00,720
And we are going to make mentaiko pasta and tenderloin. Check the condition of the mentaiko that we got last time.

167
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,420
Na Bong, what about the tablecloths that were sent to the launderer?

168
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,410
Na Bong. Na Bong Seon!

169
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:12,830
What? I'm sorry. Ye...yes?

170
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:16,620
Did the tablecloths that were sent to the launderer arrive?

171
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,960
I..I will go check. I'm sorry.

172
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,710
I'll go check quickly. I'm sorry.

173
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,430
She hasn't done that for a while, and now the "I'm sorry"s have started again.

174
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:33,630
And her dozing off is a little strange, isn't it?

175
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:37,200
It's like she went back to that hunched over self, that feeling.

176
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,000
There's really no middle ground with her. I was about to finally start liking her.

177
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,100
Is she playing with us? Being this way and then that way, by acting.

178
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,200
Be quiet. Stop talking nonsense starting in the morning. Get ready, it will be a battle today.

179
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,230
Yes, Chef!

180
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:55,870
But do you think Bong Seon is really okay? She looked pale, too.

181
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,690
 First just ignore it.

182
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:09,110
 Don't even make eye contact and don't talk to it.

183
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:17,280
You look fine now, Na Bong Seon. Are you okay? Did your fever go down?

184
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,370
Hey, you can hear me, why are you ignoring me?

185
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:27,510
You can see me. You see me, don't you? Don't you see me?

186
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:30,260
-I'm sure you see me.
-Our Father which art in heaven,...

187
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:34,630
Hey, hey, that's useless. I've conquered it during the last two years.

188
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:38,850
- Thy will be done.
- That doesn't workt, Na Bong Seon.

189
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:43,140
-I...I...I'm sorry.
-What are you doing? Hurry up and spread the tablecloths!

190
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,170
-I'm sorry.
-Na Bong Seon.

191
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:49,270
Listen to me! Na Bong Seon. Na Bong Seon, hello?

192
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:56,410
Na Bong Seon! Na Bong Seon? Na Bong Seon, Na Bong Seon, Na Bong Seon. Na Bong Seon, Na Bong Seonnnn!

193
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,030
Hey, Na Bong Seon. Na Bong Seon!

194
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:02,420
-I don't know, I don't know.
-Hey, Na Bong Seon!

195
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:06,140
-Na Bong Seon! Na Bong Seon!
-Ahhh! I don't hear you!

196
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,460
Do they have a real Italian chef?

197
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:25,930
Pardon me. The pasta is here. Enjoy!

198
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:32,310
Eun Hee, I didn't use the day of absence last month. Can you just give it to me as money?

199
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:35,340
And don't tell your brother.

200
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:39,480
Welcome!

201
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,820
Oh my god! Oh. Yeah, I'm happy.

202
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:47,000
Uh, uh, ah, vegetarian!

203
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,980
Vegetarian! Oh, salad good. Salad good.

204
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,090
Welcome, Ambassador!

205
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:59,580
-My friend, good to see you again!
-Good to see you again. Hi Jenna.

206
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,990
-Hi, nice to see you.
-Yeah, good to see you.
-My friends.

207
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:05,010
Nice to meet you. How was your trip to Canada?

208
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,100
Oh, it was great. The weather was wonderful.

209
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,070
Oh, really? That sounds good.

210
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,060
-Please get seated over there.
-Oh, you have our table?

211
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:15,420
Oh, wonderful. This is my favorite.

212
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,200
Table 3, the potato is out.

213
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,630
Table 5! Two mentaiko pasta, two tenderloin, two eggplant, one salmon salad. Joon, make the pasta.

214
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:25,980
- Got it Chef! 
- Min Soo, make the mentaiko pasta and eggplant. 
- Yes Chef!

215
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,090
I will make the tenderloin. Dong Cheol, bring out the tenderloin.

216
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:32,130
Put in two pasta portions at a time. Tie them together.

217
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,670
Na Bong! Finish washing the dishes and take charge of the dining hall.

218
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:37,800
Fire!

219
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:58,450
- Cut this more thinly.
- Got it.

220
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,150
Is it out of butane or is the torch not working...

221
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,790
-Hey, Na Bong!
-Yes, Chef?

222
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:15,510
Go to the storage and bring a butane gas and a torch.

223
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,690
Yes, Chef.

224
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,650
Butane...

225
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,950
Hey, Na Bong Seon. Don't be like that and just listen to what I have to say.

226
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:31,370
If I followed you around for this long time, you should already know I'm not an evil spirit.

227
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:36,910
Just two and a half years ago, I was just a human like you. I'm a good ghost.

228
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:39,310
Hey!

229
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:44,270
While I was in your body for two weeks, we became close. How can you be like this?

230
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:47,770
How can you ignore me completely? It's awkward for me.

231
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:51,750
 But if she doesn't give up then,

232
00:20:51,750 --> 00:21:00,210
 you have to come out strong. Open your eyes wide and let it know you're not a pushover!

233
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:07,740
Do you see me now? Yeah, isn't it nice to make eye contact like this?

234
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,340
- Don't think of me as too easy! 
- Can I ask you one more favor?

235
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:16,410
It's because I really have a situation, let me borrow your body just this once. Huh?

236
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:20,270
It's because it's really urgent. Please. Please just this once.

237
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:23,470
Ahhh! You can't! You can't ever!

238
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:26,530
Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?

239
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:30,710
You rea...really can't! Don't think I'm a pushover!

240
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:34,550
I'm never going to let you possess my body again!

241
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:38,030
-Don't come here, don't come here!
-Calm down, calm down, calm down, Na Bong Seon!

242
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:43,870
-How is your meal?
-Oh, it's great.
-Delicious.

243
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,350
Thank you. How was the steak?

244
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:49,250
-It's delicious.
 -It's delicious.

245
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,750
Thank you.

246
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,550
If I knew it'd be like this, I would've studied a bit more in English.

247
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:00,050
I look like a foreign person.

248
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:06,180
When foreigners come to the restaurant, I don't make eye contact. In case, they speak to me.

249
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:10,880
Hey, hey, hey, is it a flaw for a Korean person not to know English?

250
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,140
If they want to eat, they can use Korean. There's no need to be intimidated at all.

251
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,790
Why does someone like that not go into the dining hall once?

252
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:24,080
Who? Me? Really!?

253
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:30,080
Hey, it's because I don't have a reason to go out there. Are you saying I didn't go out there because I'm scared, Cordon punk?

254
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,650
If not, then never mind.

255
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,260
If not, then never mind.

256
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,530
This punk annoying.

257
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,370
Wait, Hyung;

258
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:40,500
don't you smell something burning?

259
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:45,460
Oh, you're right! Where is it coming from?

260
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:51,230
What is that hazy thing? Isn't that smoke?

261
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,160
Chef, Chef! A fire started, a fire. A fire started.

262
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,560
Empty this place out.

263
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,830
- Hurry!
- Please get up.

264
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:00,980
Come out quickly.

265
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,990
- Get out, get out!
- Hey, get out quickly.

266
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,850
Oppa!

267
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,530
Hurry up and leave! Go quickly!

268
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:10,670
- Everyone, get out!
- Bong Seon!

269
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,940
Hey, hey, hey!

270
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:19,080
Get out! Get out! Get out!

271
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,340
Ah, seriously.

272
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,620
Hey, why isn't water coming out?!

273
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,810
- What the heck?
- Get out of the way. Hurry, get out of the way.

274
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:28,360
- Hey Na Bong! 
 - Get out of the way!

275
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,930
Hey, Bong!

276
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,660
Dad.

277
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,040
- Yeah?
- Your mail.

278
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,750
Yeah, okay.

279
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:59,500
There must have been a fire somewhere. A fire truck came out.

280
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,580
Really?

281
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:04,790
But, I don't think it was a big fire. Since only one truck came out.

282
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,760
It would have been entertaining to see something big.

283
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:10,400
Aigo, talk about being childish.

284
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,450
Hey, punk, is that something a 26-year-old should say?

285
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:18,990
What? Fights and fires are the most entertaining things to watch.

286
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:23,040
Last time, you watched the hairdresser lady and the restaurant lady fighting, too.

287
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,010
When was I watching? I went to stop them, you punk.

288
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:29,900
Whatever. You even had eyes for that hairdresser lady.

289
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,930
What are you talking about having eyes for her?

290
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,810
I know everything. When the hairdresser lady

291
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:38,660
did my hair for free, I caught on to everything.

292
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,430
Sometimes I see you being polite too.

293
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:44,360
Ah, I don't know. I'm going to sleep. I'm tired.

294
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,480
That rascal. What is he saying?

295
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,280
Sheesh, when is he ever going to grow up?

296
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:07,880
 Ah, that won't do now. Drink with me, instead of by yourself.

297
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:22,840
Is she busy? I didn't see her yesterday or today.

298
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:44,780
Hey... HEY!

299
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:54,370
You... what exactly are you doing?

300
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:58,340
How did the fire...? My heart is burning up.

301
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:02,900
How exactly did the fire start? Hm?

302
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:09,660
What if it had been a serious fire? We all would've become barbecued pork!

303
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:15,580
- The state of this storage room... how...how much are the losses?
- That's enough.

304
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:19,130
Let me hear it. What happened?

305
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,380
Is your mouth glued shut? Chef asked you what happened!

306
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,950
Be quiet! Tell me.

307
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:32,480
I'm sorry, Chef. I'm really sorry.

308
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:42,380

309
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:52,600
Oh, yes, Doctor Hong. Yes, it's Kang Seon Woo. Yes, how are you?

310
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:58,430
Yes, I should stop by and see you more often. Yes, yes, it's busy.

311
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:03,430
It's not anything big, but I wanted to ask you something, Professor.

312
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:17,780
Hey Na Bong Seon.

313
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:25,170
You kind of did something stupid. Why light the fire there?

314
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:28,450
I didn't even do anything much.

315
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:35,170
That's why... That's why I told you not to appear in front of me.

316
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:41,150
Huh? I'm scared of you. And I'm scared of being possessed.

317
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:44,970
I'm also scared that people think I'm a different person.

318
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:49,690
I don't like it! So don't appear before me! Huh?

319
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:53,830
Please let me go and leave me alone!

320
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:08,660
What did I do? It's not like I wanted that to happen. Darn it.

321
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,080
Ah, bad wench.

322
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:18,080
Father! Have you been well, Father? It's been two days, right?

323
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,560
You haven't been drinking all this time, right? You promised me, so you have to keep it.

324
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,970
If you drink, that's cheating.

325
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,090
Oppa...

326
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:31,330
Are you really okay? You were pretty shocked, weren't you?

327
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:35,650
Yeah, I'm all right. It seems I've built up a tolerance to big events.

328
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:42,000
Leave the cleaning to the others and go in first. The leftover odor isn't good for you.

329
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,270
I'm leaving for a bit.

330
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,580
Yes, Mom.

331
00:28:55,410 --> 00:29:00,440
What? A fire? So, no one got hurt?

332
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:08,440
Oh, that startled me. Yeah, it is a relief, but. . .

333
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,400
Ah, ah, I understand.

334
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,400
- I got it, I got it. I'll call you later. Okay.
- What?

335
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,320
There was a fire? Where? The restaurant?

336
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,300
They were able to put it out quickly,

337
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,170
but things are really not good for him this year, seriously.

338
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:28,370
That's why I had you write the talisman and had the ancestral memorial service.

339
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:32,720
Come to think of it, because I had the memorial service done by you,

340
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,980
that's why there wasn't a big fire, right?

341
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,890
That's right. Of course, of course.

342
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:45,220
Thank you, Sweetie. If it weren't for you, what could of happened, seriously?

343
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,040
What is this?

344
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,340
Lecture fee came in.

345
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,310
Lecture fee?

346
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:58,210
-How much do you get for that?
-Not too much. 500,000.

347
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:04,770
I-I knew that.

348
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:10,330
But, Sweetie, about your daughter...

349
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:13,600
I think it'd be good if she hurried up and got pregnant.

350
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,860
It's not like there isn't a way.

351
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:22,260
There are things like holding a memorial service for the three gods of childbirth, for example.

352
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,990
Then, we should. How do we do it?

353
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:30,180
It's not anything big, it's something that can be done at home.

354
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,000
But the travel expenses are a little high.

355
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,860
How much?

356
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:35,760
500,000 won.

357
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,240
500,000?

358
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:41,040
That turned out well! What just came in,

359
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:44,570
I can spend it right away on you. I'll do it. Let's do it!

360
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:48,990
Oh my, I already feel like a grandmother. I feel so excited.

361
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:54,220
How pretty would a baby who takes after my daughter? With big round eyes.

362
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,440
I'm so excited.

363
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,120
Me, too.  I'm getting excited.

364
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:07,210
Chef, did you call for me?

365
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:09,580
- Get in. 
 - What?

366
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,510
Get in. We're going somewhere.

367
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,720
Where are we going?

368
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,960
Just get in! Would I take you somewhere to sell you? Get in.

369
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,890
That's weird.

370
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:39,330
Chef, I'm really sorry. For today's losses, instead of getting paid . . .

371
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:43,610
It's all right. Am I someone who goes crazy over money? Who do you see me as?

372
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:48,970
Yes, but where are we going right now?

373
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:52,530
To get some benefits for my employee..

374
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:55,540
The way I see it, you're not in a normal condition.

375
00:31:56,130 --> 00:32:00,200
Truthfully, I could ignore it. But if I leave it, later while you're working,

376
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:05,720
trouble could come. Just think of it as getting a check-up.

377
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,160
Yes.

378
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:11,930
Truthfully, this is something large corporation or foreign companies do.

379
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,930
Know that you met a good boss.

380
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:18,670
Who takes such care of an employee who sets fire to their workplace?

381
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,640
I'm sorry, Chef, really.

382
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,670
It's nothing to be sorry for, just move, I can't see the side mirror.

383
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:28,600
Yes. Excuse me, how do I...

384
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,560
Should I go further back?

385
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:37,320
It isn't any kind of special examination.

386
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:41,150
Just think as if I'm putting a stethoscope on your brain. That's all.

387
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:45,140
Here, let's take a look.

388
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:50,470
Here, breathe in... breathe out.

389
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:55,170
Breathe in, breathe out--here! How do you feel?

390
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:57,950
Huh? Just... just...

391
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:03,050
Okay, just.

392
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,210
Huh?

393
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:11,610
You're doing a good job. Now, you...

394
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,340
Are you okay, Professor?

395
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:17,130
No, magnesium, magnesium.

396
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:21,000
I was grieving for my grandmother and couldn't sleep for a couple of days.

397
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,820
I think I'm getting a tic in my eye.

398
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,970
I...

399
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:29,170
I must be crazy. I must be crazy.

400
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:32,070
Oh, this...

401
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,930
Oh, it tickles. It...

402
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:38,160
Ah, what are you doing?

403
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:42,540
 Consultation Form
 Name: Na Bong Seon

404
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:48,030
As I've stated on the phone, looking at the circumstances up to now,

405
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:50,830
I wonder if she might have bipolar disorder?

406
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,190
Bipolar disorder?

407
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:56,650
It's a manic disorder. When their emotions go up and down.

408
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:57,800
Ah...

409
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:03,240
The bipolar disorder is when there's a drastic cycle of mania and depression.

410
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,600
So during the periods of mania, she would show extreme confidence.

411
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,120
Or they talk a lot, unlike themselves.

412
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:13,390
Or also, when they can't control

413
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:15,510
their sexual curiosity.

414
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:18,370
Oh, right.  Sexual curiosity.

415
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:19,960
So, I guess there was.

416
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,510
No, no. Nothing like that.

417
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:26,810
And when the depression comes, they're very down.

418
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:30,830
I wonder if her current state is the depression.

419
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:36,400
So what I've seen all along is the side of depression.

420
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,390
She was like this all along.

421
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:43,830
Also, there are cases when they continue in one emotional state without a set cycle.

422
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:47,330
It comes and goes. It's unpredictable.

423
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:49,350
My goodness.

424
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:55,870
And earlier, it appeared that she was experiencing hallucinations.

425
00:34:55,870 --> 00:35:01,200
Did she happen to get a big shock or stress from somebody lately?

426
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:16,090
 Did she happen to get a big shock or stress from somebody lately?

427
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:20,140
 I-I'm sorry, Chef. I should've been more careful.

428
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,840
  Do you know why I don't like you?

429
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,640
  What?

430
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:28,120
 Oh, seeing how you were yesterday and today, it looks like you took my advice wrong.

431
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:31,230
 For the time being, you're prohibited from the kitchen and just do what I ask you to do in the dining hall, okay?

432
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:34,700
Ah, I didn't know she was sick.

433
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,420
Of course she'd be stressed.

434
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:39,800
 In any case, she'll need continuous observation.

435
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,090
 I'll prescribe medication for her, so have her take that.

436
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:44,870
 Don't leave her alone if at all possible.

437
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:47,040
 If the manic episodes continue to repeat,

438
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,130
 in some extreme way,

439
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:51,950
 it can come out in impulsive behavior.

440
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:58,440
We've only been cleaning all day today.

441
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,040
All because of one person.

442
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,370
- Hey Bong. 
 - Yes?

443
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,540
Did you and Chef go somewhere earlier?

444
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,460
Eh? Uh, that...

445
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:10,440
Did you get scolded? Did he take you somewhere and beat you?

446
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,560
Is chef a thug? Would he hit a girl?

447
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,520
Don't say anything if you don't know.

448
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:18,150
How much are the losses? He's someone who would hit her and more.

449
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:22,310
Look at the blogger incident last time.

450
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:24,290
You haven't gone yet?

451
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:28,790
Yes. What brings you to the break room?

452
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:30,380
The break room isn't part of my restaurant?

453
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:36,510
That's true. We were discussing god's light shining on our chef,

454
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:41,180
who sprayed the fire extinguisher on the fire today.

455
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,490
So, how can we not have respect for you?

456
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:44,550
That's a given.

457
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,400
You worked hard.

458
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,270
- Yes, Chef.
- Thank you. You also worked hard.
- Go on home.

459
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:49,230
You worked hard.

460
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:55,080
Ah, that scared me.

461
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,550
We have to be careful what we say.

462
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:59,860
Hey, hurry. Get out quickly.

463
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:04,000
Let's get out of here quickly, and while sucking on medicine let's talk about him behind his back.

464
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,200
Ah, I'm really exhausted.

465
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,360
If he used his mouth to clean, he'd have energy to spare.

466
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,160
He could even put out the fire with that mouth.

467
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,410
Goodbye.

468
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:21,240
Are you really okay?

469
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:25,660
What? Yeah. Sorry.

470
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,310
It's been a while since you said that. You've really come back, Bong Seon.

471
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,900
You really--

472
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,710
Never mind. Get some rest.

473
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:03,710
 Dorm housing.

474
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:05,390
 Search result

475
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,980
He-Hello?

476
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:16,860
Is this the dorm rental? Do you happen to have a room available?

477
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:20,870
Ah, they're all full?

478
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:23,310
Yes, I understand.

479
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,220
 Chef Kang

480
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,230
 Bring your things to the roof storage.

481
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:38,190
Why do you keep this stuff?

482
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,800
No, that's for...

483
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,810
No, no, it's okay.

484
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:47,590
You're telling me to stay here?

485
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:55,250
I moved the bulky things to the side, but you can clean it again if you want.

486
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:59,090
It's not because I'm giving you special attention, so don't get the wrong idea.

487
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:03,640
But if you collapse in the hall while sleeping like last time, it would be a headache for me to deal with.

488
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,240
But, it's just until you get a room, okay?

489
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,410
Um, Chef...

490
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:11,890
No, stop. Don't feel touched or anything. Please.

491
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:14,770
I'm afraid you'll have another manic episode.

492
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:18,130
You heard the doctor earlier, right?

493
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:21,950
Bipolar disorder is experienced by all contemporary modern man.

494
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:26,750
So don't worry about it. Make sure you take your medicine and it'll be okay. Also...

495
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:36,950
And about then, that accident, I'll say it again, but it was a mistake. I'm sorry.

496
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,990
Don't think in the extreme about it.

497
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:47,340
I hope you won't...keep any bitterness in mind.

498
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:57,660
Ah, here. It's a blanket. Totally new, never been opened. You can borrow it.

499
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:01,000
Ah, thank you.

500
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:09,250
It's kind of expensive. But don't feel too burdened by it.

501
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,170
Yes.

502
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:15,190
I don't like when things get on it. But...don't worry about it.

503
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:17,510
Yes.

504
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:32,130
 A long time ago, Father, when business was done and we'd sit here.

505
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:36,610
 Do you remember playing cards and betting for ice cream?

506
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:40,650
 Like you said, I switched card many times.

507
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:44,320
 Honestly, you knew all along, right?

508
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:48,350
 You just pretended not to know, right? Huh?

509
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:51,190
 I know everything.

510
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,990
 What are you doing, Father?

511
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:05,400
 Wedding invitation

512
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,770
 Mi Yeon is getting married!

513
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:12,540
You bad girl.

514
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:16,720
Your friend is getting married.

515
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,750
But you...

516
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:31,380
 Dad, you're drinking again?

517
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:36,220
 Stop drinking! Huh?

518
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:49,150
 Father. Huh?

519
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,890
 Dad, this is really enough.

520
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:09,110
 You'll ruin your insides.

521
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:12,850
 Or at least eat some snacks, too.

522
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,990
Omo!

523
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:53,900
Ah, it's so cushiony and nice.

524
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:10,630
She must not come again, so I should light it.

525
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:25,120
Wait, she must be hungry too.

526
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:34,420
Is it a bit bad to give her ramyun since she's feeling unwell.

527
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:36,470

528
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:44,000
Then

529
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:47,480
I'll add more meat though.

530
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:53,780
Cabbage is...

531
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:41,540
Ye-Yes?

532
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:43,930
Take this.

533
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:45,750
Yes.

534
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:53,760
W-What is this?

535
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:59,200
I had to use some cabbages and there were a lot of leftovers so

536
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:03,190
I tried it. The taste is deadly. (Meaning it's tasty)

537
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:05,520
Well, if you don't want to eat it, give it to the dog.

538
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,690
Oh...

539
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:11,480
They said that there is nothing like this to calm the soul and body.

540
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:15,250
It's not bad. Looks like you'll be able sleep well.

541
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:16,590
Thank you.

542
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:19,460
No, stay put. Stay put.

543
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:54,580
♫   Even when I carefully pass by   ♫

544
00:46:55,610 --> 00:47:01,940
♫ My heart notices even the smallest tremor ♫

545
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:10,120
♫   To this heart which was calm    ♫

546
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:15,670
 In Sunshine's recipe, there is a happiness included in the taste.

547
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:19,130
  I'm a fan. Fighting.

548
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:23,980
♫  Slowly  increasing, without my knowing, I keep watching  ♫

549
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:27,930
Is she eating it? She's probably eating it.

550
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:32,850
She's probably going crazy because it tastes so good.

551
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:38,210
But is she falling for me again because she's touched by this?

552
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:42,790
Ah, but later it will be a headache when she has another manic episode and she sticks to me.

553
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,710
I don't know.

554
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:50,980
Since I did something wrong.

555
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:54,650
There's a new comment.

556
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:56,010
  You are my sunshine

557
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,830
  Thank you.

558
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:05,630
 Your comments always gives me strength.

559
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:11,270
 Actually, I am eating cabbage porridge again right now. 
-Really?

560
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:14,520
I made cabbage porridge not long ago. Nice.

561
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:21,580
I think I somehow emotionally connect with her. I like you Sunshine.

562
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:40,820
Dad, it's a limited edition so if I go late I can't buy it.

563
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:44,750
Bastard, what kind of person buys a sneaker with 180,000 won? (About $180)

564
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:47,130
 What 180,000 won? You jerk!

565
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:51,060
It at least came out cheap. Do you think a limited edition is just limited edition?

566
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:54,990
The quantity is low, that's limited edition. That's why it's worth the price.

567
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:56,640
Ah Dad!

568
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,810
Fine. Fine. Stop the jabbering already.

569
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:00,340
 Ah, don't, Dad. Don't.

570
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:02,560
My head hurts because of you since the morning.

571
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,450
 Don't give it to him.

572
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:06,940
 Ah, Don't give it to him! You'll spoil him.

573
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:08,120
Here, 180,000 won.

574
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,900
Thank you, Dad. I'll hurry up and come back.

575
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:14,730
 That idiot. When is he going to mature?

576
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:20,560
 Dad, are you not well?

577
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,860
 I told you not to drink so much alcohol!

578
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:26,090
 Can you be alright after drinking two bottles with no food?

579
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:30,360
Aigoo... But I have to pay the utility bill.

580
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,960
There is not much left in the bank too...

581
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,560
 That's why, why do you give whenever he asks?

582
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,850
 You can't raise Kyung Mo like that.

583
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:38,950
 You always spoil him because he didn't grow up with a mom.

584
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:42,460
 What are you going to do about the utility bill when the business isn't doing well?

585
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,980
Oops.

586
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:33,700
I'm sorry.

587
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:41,980
Aigoo. Did you sleep well?

588
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:45,180
I'm usually sensitive so, so-so.

589
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:47,720
Ah... Yes...

590
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:55,420
You know that there's broadcasting today, right?

591
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:59,100
They said it will start two hours earlier, so keep that in mind getting ready.

592
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:01,240
Recording?

593
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,700
Did you forget?

594
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,900
Today is broadcast day. Friday.

595
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:07,410
Ah, broadcasting.

596
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:20,260
Chef Kang Seon Woo.

597
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:25,820
 Chef Kang Seon Woo related videos

598
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,430
Th-This is me.

599
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:40,300
What did I do?

600
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:43,990
Hello.

601
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,060
What are you doing not coming in?

602
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:50,560
I don't think I'll be able to do it. I'm sorry, Chef.

603
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:54,170
What do you mean you can't do it when we have to go in immediately?

604
00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:57,430
Did you take medicine?

605
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,650
It's okay. It's okay. I'll take all of it so-

606
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:01,870
Chef Kang, come in!

607
00:53:01,870 --> 00:53:03,720
Yes, yes, I'm going!

608
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:07,520
Just trust me. Okay.

609
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:08,530
Hurry up and come in. Come in.

610
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:10,650
It's quick by riding a bus, right?

611
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:12,710
It's fast by riding a bus.

612
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:15,330
I walked about thirty minutes after getting off the bus.

613
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:20,480
It's so refreshing to have sweat since the morning.

614
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:24,630
Really? I didn't know. I don't ride buses.

615
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:27,020
Of course you wouldn't.

616
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:29,030
You have a nice house.

617
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:32,720
No. It's an interior that I haven't done a thing with.

618
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,940
Oh, a marble!

619
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:40,490
Wow.
-You're so cute! Full of charm!

620
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:42,420
Should I give you something refreshing?

621
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:47,040
No, no. Forget it. I'll drink it later. Let's first do business.

622
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,220
Where's your daughter's room?

623
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:51,880
You came because of that, right?

624
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:54,330
I think I lost two cm of stomach fat.

625
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:55,840
Really?

626
00:54:55,840 --> 00:55:00,470
I beg the god of heaven, god of land, and the god of ancestors,

627
00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:04,220
please don't begrudge this couple's flute and lute.

628
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:08,040
Let them make a child as soon as possible.

629
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,840
Please. Please give it.

630
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,690
Aigoo, really! Stop!

631
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:16,260
The divine spirits don't like that kind of prayer which lacks soul.

632
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:18,710
Really.

633
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:21,040
Take out your daughter and son-in-law's underwear.
-Underwear?

634
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,620
I need to burn them.
-Right, underwear.

635
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:27,420
Is this your son-in-law?

636
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:31,000
Yeah. Isn't our son-in-law handsome?

637
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,930
He is handsome.

638
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:40,220
That's strange. Even the destiny was strange, but

639
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:45,020
he's the same person for sure but he's different.

640
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:48,180
Hello.

641
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:52,540
Ahjussi.

642
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:56,470
Did he go somewhere?

643
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:00,850
Ahju-

644
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:18,230
My mom got really good at nagging. Really.

645
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:20,820
Ahjussi went somewhere. Let's go somewhere else.

646
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:22,760
Let's just eat here. He's probably going to come quickly.

647
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:25,530
You said that you're hungry. Let's go someplace else.

648
00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:28,090
In front of here a new octopus restaurant opened. Let's go eat octopus.

649
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:30,300
Octopus?
-You like octopus.

650
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,380
I can't walk because it's hot.

651
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:37,030
When it's hot you have to eat spicy octopus.

652
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:52,920
Yes. After the first broadcast there were a lot of responses.

653
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:56,010
Yes. I think a lot of responses is a good phrase.

654
00:56:56,010 --> 00:56:59,040
Of course the first winner Chef Kang Seon Woo,

655
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:03,610
there was a rise in popularity with searches for the food shows of the assistants who were on the show.

656
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:05,760
The responses were very hot.

657
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,890
Yes. It was very hot.

658
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:14,060
Yes, so from this episode, in order to increase the excitement in the competition,

659
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:16,930
we kind of changed the format.
-That's right.

660
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:21,260
Today's competition concept is Tag.

661
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:22,330
- Tag? 
 - Yes.

662
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:25,870
I think there are viewers that don't know it.

663
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:29,150
We say that when we change with the opponents, we call that a tag.

664
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:31,750
As it is, the chef and the assistant

665
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:37,440
alternating in a set interval, they'll prepare the meal.

666
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:42,840
So more than ever the assistant and chef's teamwork is the key to winning.

667
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:47,030
Yes. Today's cooking competition is

668
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:54,050
going to use a can of salmon to make a healthy nighttime snack for students.

669
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:56,300
 Healthy nighttime snack for students

670
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:34,450
 Wow! It works when I practice!

671
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:37,500
 Dad! I got lucky!

672
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,480
 Dad!

673
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:47,470
 Dad! Dad, wake up!

674
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:51,340
 Dad! Dad, wake up!

675
00:58:57,110 --> 00:58:59,480
 Please, please.

676
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:03,930
 Work! Where is Kyung Mo!

677
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:12,910
 Dad.

678
00:59:16,630 --> 00:59:18,540
 Aish...

679
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:27,200
 Dad.

680
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:32,210
 Na Bong Seon. It'll work if it's Na Bong Seon.

681
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:34,020
 Na Bong Seon.

682
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:43,610
 Father.  Wait a little.

683
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:45,770
 Father, please...

684
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:49,280
Yes, that's it. The time is up.

685
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:53,030
Yes, now, please put down what you are holding as it is and

686
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:54,540
tag your assistant.

687
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:57,320
Yes, now. We don't have much time.

688
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:58,470
That's right.

689
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:00,940
Please shift. I am really looking forward

690
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:05,220
to see the assistants' skills.

691
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:08,510
 Na Bong Seon!

692
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:12,440
S-sorry. Sorry.

693
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:19,220
This... What should I do?

694
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:22,370
 Na Bong Seon. Na Bong Seon, please help me.

695
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:24,880
 Na Bong Seon.

696
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,690
 Na Bong Seon.

697
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:28,970
We'll turn it off and start later.

698
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:32,140
 Wait. We'll stop and return again.

699
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:34,220
Hey. Are you alright?

700
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:36,670
Chef, sorry. I'm sorry.

701
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:37,560
 Na Bong Seon!

702
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:39,320
Na Bong Seon!

703
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,360
Where are you going?

704
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,880
What should I do?

705
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:48,960
 Na Bong Seon! Please listen to what I have to say!

706
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,650
 My dad fainted but no one knows.

707
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:52,930
 Please call 911 for me.

708
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:56,060
I don't know. I don't know. I can't hear.

709
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:58,260
I don't know anything.
  -You're the only one who can help me.

710
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:00,030
 Please. My dad is dying.

711
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:03,140
Please don't do this to me. Go.

712
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:05,420
 It's my dad!

713
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:09,750
 It's not anyone but it's my dad.

714
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:14,290
 How can I ignore? Even though I'm a ghost, how can I just watch?

715
01:01:14,290 --> 01:01:16,550
 Please just call.

716
01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:19,110
 I'm begging you like this. Please.

717
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:22,850
Miss Na Bong Seon! Where are you Miss Na Bong Seon!

718
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:37,730

719
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:01,480
 Oh my Ghostess 
 ~Preview~

720
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:04,280
 Since I have no thought, if you're going to fire her, fire both of us like a set.

721
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:05,520
 Did she not come yet?

722
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,360
 Where did she go that she's still not back yet?

723
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:10,450
 Tada! Surprise!

724
01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:12,350
 Do you want to receive proper training from me?

725
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:15,140
 I can't do this alone because my arm hurts so much.

726
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:17,750
 Isn't he showering and totally naked?

727
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:19,650
 About Hyungnim and Miss Bong Seon.

728
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:21,910
 Were they always that close?

729
01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:24,380
 Do you have something going on with Chef?

730
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:28,920
 Today, no matter what, I have to knock over Chef.
