1
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,640
 Oh My Ghostess

2
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:41,840

3
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,500
Hey, Na Bong!

4
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,860
What are you doing, Na Bong Seon?

5
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,850
How can you disappear after saying such a ridiculous thing?

6
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:00,320
Are you doing some hidden camera thing?

7
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,220
If so, it's really not fun for me right now.

8
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,400
Do you really want to die?

9
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,640
What is it that you want to do?

10
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,470
So are you saying that you see ghosts?

11
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,910
Yes.

12
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:45,430
So when I thought you were manic, it means you were taken over by a ghost.

13
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,940
Yes.

14
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,120
So, what you're saying is

15
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,140
that I...

16
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,520
the one I was blinded by... to simply put it,

17
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,540
I was spending time with a ghost that had possessed you.

18
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,650
And I had lessons with it. And I got physical, too.

19
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,840
So, you're saying that you didn't do it, and you don't even have any recollection of it either, right?

20
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,260
Yes.

21
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,980
Well, that makes total sense.

22
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,560
Why don't you just write a scenario, you expect me to believe that?

23
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,660
Why not say that you're also a ghost? That's an awesome plot twist. That would be like Sixth Sense.

24
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,760
But why are you doing this to me?

25
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,860
Why in the world are you doing this to me?

26
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,460
Did you change your mind? Are you saying this because you want to break up with me? Just say it then.

27
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,840
And don't drive a person crazy saying absurd things about ghosts.

28
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,500
-It isn't that, Chef.
-If it isn't, then what is it?

29
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,640
It's all true.

30
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,340
The ghost that possessed me.

31
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,300
It's the deceased daughter of that Transport restaurant ahjussi.

32
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,120
I'm going to go insane.

33
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,100
Episode 13

34
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,280
 It was definitely Shin Soon Ae.

35
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,760
 Is something wrong? I'll help you if I can.

36
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,020
 I...

37
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,940
 Actually....

38
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,140
 It's nothing.

39
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,060
 Your shoelaces are quite unique.

40
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:35,320
 Oh, these? You know that restaurant gal Bong Seon? She tied them for me.

41
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,860
 All this time, inside Na Bong Seon's body,

42
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,280
Hello!

43
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,820
 Kang Soon Kyung, are you working starting today?

44
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,160
Are you feeling better?

45
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,820
Yes, I'm much better. You must have suffered a lot, covering my work, too.

46
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,860
What suffering? We only skipped days off,

47
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,820
worked overtime everyday, had nosebleeds, and died of exhaustion all the time.

48
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,940
I'm sorry. I'll treat you to a meal sometime.

49
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:18,900
What money does a police officer have? Just buy us meat. Beef.

50
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,040
I'm kidding. She is prettier because she was sick, right?

51
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,260
Yeah, don't overdo it. You look pretty.

52
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:31,880
 Yeah, rest. Don't do anything. Don't even breathe. No, breathe. Breathe.

53
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,420
It's really hot out. It's a hot summer. A hot summer.

54
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,680
That's right. On a day like this, our burning Chef-Bong couple

55
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,820
stuck together like this, you probably can't do it, right?

56
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,700
I can do it!

57
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:54,320
But why is our Chef's girl not coming?

58
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,900
But what if Bong starts treating us like

59
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,100
"You trash! You cheap shallow things!" or something like that.

60
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,400
I'm sorry for being late. I'm sorry.

61
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:08,240
How could you come now? You're only thirty minutes late.

62
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,030
-What?
-A person should be late and be human sometimes.

63
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:16,660
I can't breathe when I'm next to a perfect people, who don't make mistakes.

64
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,420
You better not be like that.

65
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,180
Yes, yes.

66
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,700
You guys, what are your eyes saying?

67
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,120
-Nothing.
-You're the best, Sir.

68
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,300
What's with the chattering so early in the morning? We have a lot of reservation today. Make haste.

69
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,560
Yes, Chef!

70
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,700
Hey, Joon!

71
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,580
Today's special is squash pasta and chicken breast as garnish, so marinate it with pepper.

72
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,440
-Yes.
-Dong Cheol,

73
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,100
slice the beef tenderloin nice and full. Don't do it like last time.

74
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,820
-Yes.
-Woong!

75
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,160
-Yes.
-We're serving the salmon raw today, so put it in the refrigerator.

76
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,240
-Yes, Chef!
-Min Soo, start with trimming scallops.

77
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,880
Yes, Chef!

78
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,480
Yes! This is the Heo Min Soo special in the kitchen.

79
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,140
We have Sun's new couple today. They're so romantic and sweet, I can taste the sweetness.

80
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:17,020
Now Bong. What do you call Chef, Bong?

81
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:21,420
Honey? Dear? Husband Kang?

82
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,180
 Bong buh-da Bong,

83
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:29,020
Bong is too embarrassed to speak. So the mic will go to Chef. Regarding kitchen assistant Miss Na Bong Seon,

84
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:33,020
when did you first feel she was a woman? Number one:

85
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:37,020
The drowsy Sexy Bong was sexy.

86
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:42,540
Number two: "I'm sorry. I'm sorry." Hunched over, Scaredy Bong

87
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,260
provoked your protective instincts. Number 3!

88
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:50,000
Is this a playground? Do I pay you so that you can play?

89
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,760
Go and check the raw noodles.

90
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:02,790
 Check the raw noodle batter and go about your work. We have a lot of work today.

91
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,770
 Yes, Chef.

92
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:18,740
Our Chef and Bong are strange, right? It's uncomfortable, right?

93
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,890
It seems like the two of them had a fight.

94
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,310
The air feels so cold.

95
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:27,210
The two of them fought 100%. They don't even look at each other.

96
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,350
I thought the kitchen was Siberia.

97
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,630
Why are you so curious about that? Someone else's personal life?

98
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:35,890
If you're not curious, then just stay out!

99
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:38,260
Seriously.

100
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:42,230
Maybe it isn't that. But last night the two of them were rolling around all night,

101
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,270
and they feel sorry towards us, right?

102
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:48,850
Right? Am I right? Great acting.

103
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,520
So they're tricking us?

104
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:55,040
Hey, I don't think so. I'm sure the mood is that they fought.

105
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:01,690
No, what I'm saying is right. She-Bong that girl is playing politics.

106
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:06,410
Going from being hunched over to having her nose in the air means she's riding Chef's back.

107
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:10,770
So we have to keep close relationship with Bong.

108
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:11,950
Close relationship.

109
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:16,890
What are you looking at, Joon! You said you weren't curious!

110
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,310
Officer Choi.

111
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:26,910
Why did he do that?

112
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,990
Why would he do that to Na Bong Seon?

113
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:33,460
Think carefully. Nothing comes to mind?

114
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:37,210
When you possessed Na Bong Seon,

115
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:40,020
did anything happen?

116
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,440
When I possessed her?

117
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:49,420
Now that I think about it, I went to Officer Choi,

118
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:53,230
and asked him to look into if Shin Soon Ae really committed suicide.

119
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,650
And after that he tried to kill Na Bong Seon?

120
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:01,510
If that's the case, it means there's some connection to your death.

121
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:07,180
Come to think about it, something was off about Officer Choi from the start.

122
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:12,060
His fortune reading is also different from his current image. His recent and old pictures

123
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,420
have strangely different physiognomy.

124
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:19,840
 There's a clouded bleakness in his eyes when I met him.

125
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,640
I'm not sure, but it might be...

126
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,630
It might be?

127
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:29,360
That Officer Choi is possessed by an evil spirit.

128
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,350
Evil spirit?

129
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:37,920
If an evil spirit gets you, they stick right to you.

130
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:44,080
Later you can't even distinguish if the person is the evil spirit or the evil spirit is the person.

131
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,640
I'm getting a feeling.

132
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:52,190
First, make sure of Bong Seon's safety and keep a close watch of Officer Choi.

133
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:57,380
If it's an evil spirit, it can see you, so be extremely  careful.

134
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,000
Okay.

135
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,550
BREAK TIME
15:00 - 17:00 pm

136
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:31,810
 Hey, I'm right.

137
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,370
-Bong, Miss Bong.
-Yes?

138
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:39,440
Tell us truthfully.

139
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,290
You didn't have a fight with Chef, did you?

140
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:46,490
The two of you went over the limit yesterday, so you're embarrassed now, right?

141
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,680
Ah, no, it isn't that.

142
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,820
-No?
-No.
-Then did you really have a fight?

143
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,880
Is Chef a pervert?

144
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,660
So was he trying to do something last night, but you didn't want to?

145
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,150
-What?
-Did he really do that?

146
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:07,150
You're supposed to consult your seniors on matters like that.

147
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:10,930
We won't let Chef know, so tell us.

148
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,080
 Na Bong Seon!

149
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,440
Come out for a moment.

150
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,620
I said to come out here. We have to go somewhere.

151
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,010
Chef, Bong is in charge of today's dinner salad.

152
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:20,780
Dinner is cancelled today. Roughly finish up by yourselves.

153
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,380
 Oh, Chef.

154
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:30,050
Wow, Chef is giving up on the restaurant, isn't he?

155
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,580
It appears that way.

156
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:35,660
What's going on? This is big.

157
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:39,850
Chef's mood doesn't look like it's a small matter.

158
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:56,200
I thought about it.

159
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,040
I think this is a manic episode.

160
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,650
I think you are hearing things and have symptoms of hallucination. This won't do. Let's go for treatment.

161
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:05,290
If it's bad, you'll get treatment. If you need to get hospitalized, then be it. I'll fix you, Na Bong Seon.

162
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:08,850
-I'm not depressed.
-Are you a doctor?

163
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:11,390
Have you ever seen someone not in their right mind say that they're not in their right mind?

164
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,280
Come in first. First go in and get treated.

165
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:17,000
It's really, really, really not that, Chef.

166
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:22,340
It  might be hard to believe, but you have to believe it, Chef.

167
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,810
I lived this way for 28 years.

168
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:30,060
My grandma is a shaman, and I have that blood and I can see ghosts.

169
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,580
This is my reality.

170
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:36,090
While I was living,

171
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:40,210
I thought about dying many times and got through it with that much difficulty.

172
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,520
Chef, I'm really sorry.

173
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,370
 Na Bong Seon.

174
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:10,320
What? What is it now?

175
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,560
Na Bong Seon, listen carefully to me. Last time when you almost got in that accident.

176
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,530
Hey, Na Bong Seon! Let's just say what you've said is true.

177
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:24,430
You're a little unique. And you can see ghosts, why not?

178
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:30,950
There are a lot of unusual things that go on in this world. But. But still...!

179
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:34,740
I can't believe that the you I've seen until now, isn't you.

180
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:41,260
Without seeing that ghost or whatever with my own two eyes, I can't believe you. No, I won't believe you. Ever!

181
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:49,130
I told him everything. To Chef.

182
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,820
Why?

183
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,680
 What?

184
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,520
Why?

185
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,000
Because I don't like this.

186
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:07,200
I don't like Chef being confused between you and me now.

187
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,850
What are you saying?

188
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:14,200
She's here.

189
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:23,160
The ghost I told you about last time. She's here.

190
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:29,240
What? To the very end.

191
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,540
Ah!

192
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:23,400
 CLOSED

193
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:33,380
- Ch-ch-chef.
 - Don't talk to me, my head is tangled that it's about to explode.

194
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:39,640
You didn't know, did you?

195
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:46,620
The ghost just possessed you as it wanted, so you didn't know, did you?

196
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:56,560
At first I didn't know. After I woke up, I was already possessed.

197
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:03,290
But, after that, I gave it permission to.

198
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:06,180
I said it could come into my body.

199
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,540
Why?

200
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,860
Why in the world did you do that?

201
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:26,800
I really...

202
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,090
want to understand you like crazy.

203
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,260
But I can't.

204
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,620
 -This is really strange here.
-It's strange?

205
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:01,000
  Yin and Yang are strangely mixed up.

206
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:06,090
 No! Don't touch me!

207
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:09,190
 No! No, I don't hear you!

208
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:12,090
 Ahhh!

209
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,370
 It's too far left! Go, left.

210
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:21,810
 I think I'm going well. Wait!

211
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,070
 You couldn't ride a bike.

212
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,470
 Why can't I ride one? I'm really good at this.

213
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,590
 I'm going. We're off!

214
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,970
 -Go slowly.
-Wooo!

215
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,010
 I'm going!

216
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,100
 Hey, hey, why the plain liquor?

217
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,600
 You'll get drunk like that, Chef.

218
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,530
 If you get drunk and get sexy, I'll want to do it again. Hmm?

219
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:02,720
 Chef, eat something with your drink. You'll ruin your insides this way.

220
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,160
I'm crazy.

221
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,580
Hyungnim!

222
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,540
Oh, Brother-in-law.

223
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:23,040
I was passing by and it looked like you. Are you drinking alone?

224
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,120
Stop now, Hyungnim. You've had a lot to drink.

225
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,400
Did I? Did I drink a lot?

226
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,300
Why aren't I feeling drunk?

227
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,870
I really wanted to get drunk today.

228
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:40,850
But even the alcohol isn't working.

229
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,420
Is it really bad with Bong Seon?

230
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,110
Bong Seon?

231
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,790
Na Bong Seon?

232
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:54,310
Yes, Bong Seon.

233
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:58,430
Brother-in-law,

234
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,840
do you believe in ghosts?

235
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:11,530
Do you believe in the existence of ghosts in this world?

236
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:16,800
No. I've never thought about it.

237
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,370
Right?

238
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:23,770
It's something no one would ever even think about.

239
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:28,390
It's so absurd.

240
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:35,110
Na Bong Seon is Na Bong Seon. But Na Bong Seon says she isn't.

241
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,810
Na Bong Seon is Shin Soon Ae then.

242
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:22,810
 Sun Restaurant

243
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:26,120
I was too much a fool, Chef.

244
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:30,500
If you became my person even in that way,

245
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,550
I thought it would work.

246
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,280
 Hey, Na Bong Seon. Na Bong Seon!

247
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:57,700
Ah, Chef.

248
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,420
Why did you tell me?

249
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,120
Why?

250
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,540
If you were going to fool me, then you should've fooled me to the end. What's the reason for revealing it now?

251
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,780
Isn't it better if I didn't know?

252
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:30,100
It's just a manic episode.

253
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,020
It would have been okay like that.

254
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,960
I couldn't deceive you any longer.

255
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,740
Why?!

256
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:45,880
Why couldn't you fool me? You deceived me just fine until now.

257
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,660
 Was it fun?

258
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,600
I who couldn't distinguish if it was you or a ghost.

259
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,880
Was it fun watching me like that?

260
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,260
No, it really wasn't like that.

261
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,320
Agh!

262
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,200
I'm going insane, Na Bong Seon.

263
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,220
A ghost?

264
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,900
Doesn't this only come out of summer special episodes?

265
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:31,920
Then who did I like? Was it you or the ghost?

266
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,860
Why did you do that? Why?

267
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,700
Because I liked you.

268
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,000
I liked you so much.

269
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,680
From the first time I saw you, I liked you so much.

270
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,700
I wanted to keep you next to me even like that.

271
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,280
I think I'm going to need some time. Go in and rest.

272
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:14,670
Hey, Seon Woo! What are you doing here at this hour?

273
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,860
I'll just sleep here and go.

274
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:19,600
Hey, hey, hey, hey. What is it?

275
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,120
Are things not good with that Bong Sook girl? Did you break up?

276
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:28,140
No, it's not that. I'm going to rest.

277
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,840
What is it?

278
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,580
He has so much charisma.

279
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:43,460
I think my son can be kind of cool when he's like that.

280
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,220
No, no, no. This isn't the time to be like this.

281
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,980
I can do this, Shin Soon Ae!

282
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:15,250
First look into Officer Choi.

283
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,960
Then tell Na Bong Seon.

284
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,750
Do it!

285
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,140
Now where did she go? I have to tell her about Officer Choi.

286
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,400
Her bag is gone, too.

287
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,560
By chance,

288
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,690
did Na Bong Seon leave?

289
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:24,600
No way.

290
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,020
Oh, I'm going to go nuts.

291
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,120
Hey, Joon! Where is the shredded crab meat?

292
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,820
I think Bong put it in the refrigerator. It's not there?

293
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:39,480
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Call She-Bong.

294
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,700
This is just wrong even as a summer cosplay.

295
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,700
Isn't being late twice in a row too much?

296
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,860
My goodness, her phone is turned off.

297
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,560
Could it be that she's quitting because she had a huge fight with Chef yesterday?

298
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:54,440
It's probably not that. She's not irresponsible.

299
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,530
Oh, Chef!

300
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:58,330
Why are you coming from that way today?

301
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:00,050
-I'll go change my clothes.
-Chef.

302
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:02,550
I'm not sure if you know this,

303
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:05,070
but Bong Seon hasn't come to work yet.

304
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:09,570
-Na Bong Seon?
-I was worried, so I called and her phone is off.

305
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:11,770
She's not someone who is like that.

306
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:14,890
I see. So get to work.

307
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:18,900
Today's special is abalone pasta, right? Take it out and prep it.

308
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,650
Yes, Chef.

309
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,350
What are you saying that Bong Seon left?

310
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:50,030
It appears that way. We thought she was just going to be late all day.

311
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:53,210
But she even cleared out her locker.

312
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:59,050
Actually, yesterday the mood didn't seem good with the Chef. I wonder if that's why.

313
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:00,910
I can't believe it. But still,

314
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:03,530
This is why workplace romances aren't good.

315
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:07,910
If something happens between the two of them, one of them has to quit. Why?

316
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:10,150
It will be extremely uncomfortable!

317
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:13,590
 But still, I don't think this is the way.

318
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:19,790
 There's really no time to be bored in this workplace. Shocking things are all lined up.

319
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:27,570
Na Bong Seon has left.

320
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:32,550
Then it means she didn't go back into that body.

321
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:37,230
Shin Soon Ae, where are you? You ghost.

322
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:47,970
 She opened her eyes. Father, she must be alive now.

323
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:51,490
Are you okay, Bong Seon? Are you alert now?

324
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,170
How did I end up here?

325
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:59,950
I found you collapsed while I was on my way for morning exercise.

326
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:05,370
I was going to report you to 911, but it didn't seem like you were unconscious.

327
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:10,870
Do you know how scared I was when I received Father's call? My legs were trembling while carrying you on my back.

328
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:15,110
You're anemic, aren't you? It's obvious you are by your pale face.

329
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:17,930
I'm sorry for being such a nuisance.

330
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:21,810
My goodness! Where are you going to go feeling like that?

331
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:28,270
Seeing your bag, it looks like you left your work, too. Am I wrong?

332
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:33,730
Regain your strength before you go. We're fine with that.

333
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:36,730
No, no. I can go to my grandmother.

334
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:39,570
Would your grandmother be happy to see you like this?

335
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:45,550
I mean, even if you go, I'm saying to go when you feel better.

336
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,450
The little thing doesn't listen.

337
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:51,330
What are you going to do if you collapse again?

338
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:56,450
Yeah, just do as we say. We owe you for everything you've done, too.

339
00:34:56,450 --> 00:35:02,330
This is the room my daughter used to use. You can stay because it's empty anyway.

340
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,930
Let's leave, so she can rest comfortably.

341
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:07,890
Why? I want to stay by her a little longer.

342
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:11,350
Get out, kid. Rest comfortably.

343
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,050
Yes.

344
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:14,950
Hurry up and leave.

345
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:07,050
Father, why are you so busy starting so early this morning?

346
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:09,970
Have you been well?

347
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:14,530
I'm really having a hard time, Father.

348
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:20,910
It's hard because of Officer Choi and also because of Na Bong Seon.

349
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:23,690
I wasn't planning to be this way.

350
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:33,030
But why the porridge? Is Kyung Mo sick? Did he drink all night again?

351
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:35,850
Ah, this kid.

352
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:40,050
You have to cut off his spending money, if you want to fix his habit.

353
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:43,130
Why? Is Kyung Mo lying down in my room?

354
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:45,130
Yes.

355
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:57,610
Why are you so startled? As if you've seen a ghost.

356
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:58,990
I'm not.

357
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:00,350
How are you here?

358
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:04,390
I made some egg porridge. Even if you don't have an appetite, you have to eat it to get some energy.

359
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:07,370
-Eat it.
-Thank you.

360
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:14,130
I'll eat it well, Ahjussi.

361
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:17,070
Okay, eat up.

362
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:25,110
My father is really caring.

363
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,110
But what happened?

364
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:31,550
I was worried when I went to the storage room and you weren't there.

365
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:37,610
It turned out like this. I had a dizzy spell and collapsed, but Ahjussi saw me.

366
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:39,690
That's a good thing.

367
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:46,450
Is it because of me, that you left Sun?

368
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:55,590
I'm sorry. I didn't think it would turn out like this.

369
00:37:55,590 --> 00:38:03,210
Actually, I did resent you briefly. But when I thought about it, it was half my fault, too.

370
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:09,730
But I made good memories with Chef, too. Why was that?

371
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:14,150
It's someone I couldn't even look at before.

372
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:18,130
You're making me feel sorry. You're too nice.

373
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:24,710
But this isn't the time to feel sorry and do this.

374
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:27,370
There's a more urgent situation that came up.

375
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:28,570
What is it?

376
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:33,050
When you were almost hit by the car that time, it was Officer Choi's doing.

377
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:37,890
Officer Choi? Why would Officer Choi do that?

378
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:41,350
I don't know either. We have to find out starting now.

379
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:47,910
It isn't good to be seen by Officer Choi, so if possible don't come out. I'll be back after checking things out.

380
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,930
Oh.

381
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,550
-Na Bong Seon.
-Huh?

382
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:59,650
My grudge might not be because I died a virgin.

383
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:15,490
Officer Choi, why?

384
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:19,330
-This is the last order! Cheer up even if it's hot!
-Yes, Chef!

385
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:23,870
Table 4, salmon salad and 2 Shrek. Table 6, tenderloin steak and a Shrek.

386
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:26,570
Table 7, mixed vegetables and 2 bean pasta.

387
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:28,850
I'll do the vegetables. Min Soo, do the Shrek.

388
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:29,690
-Joon!
-Yes?

389
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:30,970
-You do the steak.
-Yes, Chef.

390
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:32,390
Dong Cheol, take care of the salad.

391
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:34,450
Ji Woong, cover Min Soo.

392
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:36,890
-It's out!
-Yes, Chef!

393
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,010
-Hey, Cordon.
-Yes.

394
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:40,630
-Don't do the steak and help me with the arrangement.
-Yes.

395
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:42,070
Where did the lentil beans go?

396
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:44,630
Joon. Did you use up all the lentil beans I took out?

397
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:45,890
Yes, should I go get it?

398
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:47,990
Do what you were doing. I'll go.

399
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:49,230
-Ji Woong.
-Yes, Chef?

400
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:54,470
Give the customer at Table 7 more bread. He's been sucking his fingers since earlier.

401
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:03,550
It doesn't appear to affect Chef at all that Bong left like that.

402
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:07,390
He looks like he has more charisma than usual and he's in a good mood.

403
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:13,050
I have these feelings for our Bong-Bong now, and I feel a little betrayed.

404
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:16,270
I'm really disappointed in you, Chef.

405
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:22,650
The way I see it, it isn't that the Chef is totally okay. There is this feeling that I'm feeling.

406
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:24,750
What are you talking about?

407
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:27,270
I've known Chef for a long time.

408
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:32,590
He has this habit of acting like nothing is wrong the bigger the disappointment.

409
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:36,430
His gaze was like that earlier, it was sad.

410
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:13,390
Give it here!

411
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:16,190
Are you going to ask for a leave again after carrying this?

412
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:21,070
Now it feels more real, getting abused by you. Give it to me. I can do it.

413
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:23,430
Like I don't know you.

414
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:25,790
Just look at that.

415
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:28,870
How does she expect to be an officer being that weak?

416
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:31,290
How can we send you out anywhere, it will worry us.

417
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:35,230
But she said she always wanted to be a police officer, because she was weak since childhood.

418
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:38,910
She's gotten much healthier now. She was always pale because of her anemia.

419
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:42,130
She can't walk right.

420
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:44,450
 Check out Officer Choi.

421
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:49,550
 If he's an evil spirit, he might be able to see you, so be extremely careful.

422
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:56,130
Work hard.

423
00:41:56,130 --> 00:42:00,890
Ow, my legs.

424
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:07,710
Oh, she's weak. She's weak.

425
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:11,970
Then it makes me want to possess you.

426
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,590
 Officer Choi.

427
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:35,330
 -Do you have the cutter?
-Yes.

428
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:38,510
Give it here.

429
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:44,690
 Here.

430
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:46,830
 Oh, my diary.

431
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:56,950
Your diary was in the policeman's desk drawer?

432
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:01,230
Yeah, that drawer is the only one that is locked. It was strange starting then.

433
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:03,870
When I was going to take my diary, he insisted on keeping it.

434
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:08,230
If that's the case, then there is something in that diary that catches at him.

435
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:11,250
I know. What could it be?

436
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:14,590
It's your diary!

437
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:19,870
-That's right. 
-Think about it carefully. Isn't there anything you remember?

438
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:38,730
I don't know.

439
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:47,650
Having a hard time in the water and the sound of strange music. Those keep going through my head.

440
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:50,850
Okay. No need to push it.

441
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:55,510
First, get that diary out. That seems most urgent.

442
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:58,570
How do I get it out?

443
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:04,610
This amounts to a chick's pee. It's so hot out.

444
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:07,430
You're hot? Do you want me to cool you off?

445
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:13,670
Do you like if I do that?

446
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:21,050
 Chef!

447
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:22,750
You worked hard. See you tomorrow.

448
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:27,290
Chef, the hottest day is over, so if we eat some ginseng chicken and

449
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:29,530
have some bottles of ginseng liquor,

450
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:35,670
I feel like our lowered strength would start going up and flying high.

451
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:38,630
Did the hottest day already pass?

452
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:41,890
I'm not hungry, so you guys go eat.

453
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:44,500
It's no fun because we eat together all the time.

454
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:48,890
Okay, Chef. If you don't want chicken, then maybe beer.

455
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:53,290
Oh, what am I to do? I really want to drink with Chef today!

456
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:56,150
Let's go, Chef. I won't run away today.

457
00:44:56,150 --> 00:45:00,100
Ooooh!

458
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,110
Kang Seon Woo! Kang Seon Woo!

459
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:05,390
Kang Seon Woo!

460
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:09,570
Drink up!

461
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:11,090
Is there more to life than this?

462
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:17,030
Sweating at work, then drinking beer and eating good food with our beloved family will do!

463
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:20,910
How nice is it to be with the guys? Women are all a headache.

464
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:28,190
Of course. There's a saying like this in Italy, everyone.

465
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:30,130
Handle a bull from the front.

466
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:35,870
When handling a horse, do it from the back. But when dealing with women, be careful of all directions!

467
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:37,470
There's a saying like this!

468
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:40,630
Beep Beep! Is that a saying from Jeolla-do?

469
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:46,130
Seriously. Anyway, the point is women are all useless. They're wicked!

470
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:49,570
There's no need for them. We don't need any of them!

471
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:52,610
You startled me.

472
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:55,370
It's decided, it's decided. It's been decided.

473
00:45:55,370 --> 00:45:58,950
From now on, whomever betrays us and dates a woman,

474
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:03,690
I will remove all the good things for you.

475
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,510
Go on in.

476
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:11,810
-Chef.
-What?

477
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:15,410
About Bong Seon. You're not going to give up like this, are you?

478
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:20,530
-What?
-She's quite nice and good natured.

479
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:24,090
The Bong that I know, from the time she first came to us,

480
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:26,450
only had eyes for you, Chef.

481
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:32,790
When she's washing dishes, serving, even on her break,

482
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,310
her eyes only followed you, Chef.

483
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:39,790
I respect you, Chef, but if you give up on Bong like this,

484
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:42,590
I'll be disappointed in you.

485
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:45,620
I know it's not my place to say this,

486
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:50,630
but I want the two people that I like to be happy.

487
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:14,090
What is it, Kang Soo Kyeong? You haven't gone yet? You shouldn't overdo it on your first day back.

488
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:16,570
Yes, I'm going to leave soon.

489
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:19,850
I ate dinner a little too early.

490
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:23,890
This punk just eats and pees and eats and pees. Do some work!

491
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:25,870
Should I order some pork hocks?

492
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:29,110
It's a bit too much, but the time to deliver--

493
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:35,070
Don't do that, but I'll stay here, so go out and eat.

494
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:37,050
No, no, we should stay together.

495
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:42,450
No, I have things to organize. So just eat out.

496
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:44,590
Should we?

497
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:46,770
Let's go.

498
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:48,290
Will you be okay alone?

499
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:50,990
You were scared to be alone.

500
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:55,550
I have to get used to it. Since that's a police's life.

501
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:58,870
Go ahead.

502
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:01,030
This kid!

503
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:02,250
 Shut up.

504
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:04,390
 Where should we go?

505
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:06,430
 Ah, Hyung!

506
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:22,690
 What are you doing?

507
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:26,630
Officer Han.

508
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:32,890
Officer Kang, is there something suspicious about Sergeant Choi?

509
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:38,770
-A tip?
-Yes.

510
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:45,550
A tip came in about Officer Choi, something about a bribe.

511
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:52,390
So, I can't say in detail, but the higher-ups wanted me to look into it.

512
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:58,350
Really? There are many fishy things about Officer Choi.

513
00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:00,990
What do you mean?

514
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:06,270
Actually, I'm also keeping watch of Sergeant Choi. I'm suspecting something.

515
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:09,190
Suspicious? In what way?

516
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:14,410
I don't know if you heard, but I was attacked not long ago.

517
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:19,990
I was on my way back from retrieving  material from Officer Choi's wife's hit and run broken CCTV footage.

518
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:25,250
And when I was falling down, I think I caught a glimpse of Officer Choi.

519
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:28,470
At the scene?

520
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:34,750
I think he's concealing the culprit to his wife's hit and run.

521
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:38,530
It seems that he's having certain backhanded deals with the culprit.

522
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:42,930
-How could something like that?
-I know.

523
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:48,550
For now, it's just a feeling. But it will become more clear when the results comes out.

524
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:51,750
 I secured a crucial evidence.

525
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:58,030
When those results come out, Officer Choi won't be able to get out of it.

526
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:05,250
Your food is out.

527
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:10,390
I'm sorry. You couldn't even close because of us.

528
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:13,950
Not at all. I'm just giving you what I had.

529
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:16,810
Eat a lot. I heard you have to work late tonight.

530
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:18,630
I'll go out and clean outside.

531
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:21,770
We'll eat well.

532
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:27,950
Sergeant Han said he'll be back right away, but why is he not coming?

533
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:30,850
 But why are you looking around since earlier?

534
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:32,450
 Are you looking for someone?

535
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:36,250
Oh, no. Eat up.

536
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:43,070
 It isn't good for Officer Choi to see you, so don't come out if at all possible.

537
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:43,270
This girl.

538
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:48,650
It seems that she did study about me.

539
00:51:57,110 --> 00:52:00,380
 I was frail ever since I was young... she made it for me often...cabbage porridge...

540
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:03,390
I saw this in the Sunshine blog.

541
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,670
 -&gt; To make the texture crispy...(1) Buckwheat flour...

542
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:32,410
 The glorious buckwheat pancakes I ate with him on that hot summer night.

543
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:38,840
 In honor of the one who said about those who cook being like an orchestra conductor of the kitchen,

544
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:41,990
 I'm posting this buckwheat pancake recipe.

545
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:45,540
 What oil was used, what goes in the batter, and in the seasoning,

546
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:49,520
 think about what went into it. Reflect on the process instead of just eating it.

547
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:54,810
 We are the orchestra conductor of the kitchen.

548
00:52:57,670 --> 00:53:05,470
 If you're able to understand the cooking ingredients, no matter where or when, he said you'll be able to make the perfect dish that you want.

549
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:08,630
 Please try tasting and studying the flavor of each ingredient.

550
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:14,090
 After that, it's good to drink ginger tea to get rid of the unpleasant taste in your mouth.

551
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:20,000
 Sunshine's recipes

552
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,770
 always contain a happiness that can be tasted. Fighting!

553
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:28,930
 Thank you. Your comments always give me strength.

554
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:33,290
 In fact, I'm eating cabbage porridge right now.

555
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:39,530
 I think I connect with her on a deep level. I like you, Sunshine.

556
00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:49,450
Resume. Resume.

557
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:54,590
Kyeonggi-do, Yangpyeong.

558
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:16,050
Yes?

559
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,070
Here.

560
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:26,430
What is this?

561
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:29,770
Don't you know when you see it? This is ice cream, of course. Eat it.

562
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:32,910
Father told me that you haven't eaten anything all day.

563
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:36,010
At least eat this and get some strength, girl.

564
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:39,150
No need. I don't feel like it.

565
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:43,410
Why don't you feel like it, you wench?! Everyone has to eat in order to live, isn't it?!

566
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:47,430
And why are you using formal speech with me? Are you purposely trying to distance yourself?

567
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:52,550
It's all because of Kang Seon Woo, isn't it? Isn't the reason you quit because of him, too? Am I wrong?

568
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:55,330
You stupid girl.

569
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:58,590
If you left me to go to him, you should at least be happy.

570
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:02,970
You got dumped like a fool, quit your job, and you're not even eating.

571
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:07,110
You dummy, why did you go and like someone like him?

572
00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:25,490
A guest is coming. Who might it be?

573
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:39,750
Excuse me, is someone here?

574
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:45,570
Hello, by chance, does Na Bong Seon's grandmother live here?

575
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:51,280
Yes, that's right. You must be from Seoul and you work with knives.

576
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:59,090
Ah, yes. I'm a senior who works with Na Bong Seon, I'm Kang Seon Woo. It's nice to meet you.

577
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:02,950
Yes. You picked the right line of work.

578
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:11,330
Your fortune reading is on the direct formation. So an artist or a military man is a good fit for you. Not bad at all.

579
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:15,650
And it's a good match with my Bong Seon, whose fortune reading is on the indirect formation.

580
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:18,030
Ah, yes.

581
00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:27,130
But why did you come? Did something happen to Bong Seon?

582
00:56:30,610 --> 00:56:35,570
No, that's not it. I had something to do nearby, that's why I came.

583
00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:39,550
I thought I heard that Bong Seon's grandmother lived here, so I came to say hello.

584
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:43,690
So that's how it is. Aigoo, you really.

585
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:45,930
You are very courteous. Have a seat.

586
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:46,990
It's okay.

587
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:50,250
Aigoo, just sit down.

588
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:52,850
Is it because our place is shabby? Sit down.

589
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:54,790
Yes.

590
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:08,790
Ah, well. Bong Seon is living well.

591
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:12,810
She's naturally sincere and a deep person.

592
00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:17,550
Aigoo, I'm not worried about her.

593
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:22,370
She's always been so mature since she was young.

594
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:30,890
Losing her parents early and growing up under a shaman grandmother like me.

595
00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:33,990
She never once let on that she didn't like it.

596
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:39,240
Morning and night she would prepare my meals and wait for me.

597
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:43,210
She is too good-natured.

598
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:49,030
It would have been good

599
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:54,990
if she didn't get any of my blood. But since she was young,

600
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:59,290
she was able to see ghosts.

601
00:57:59,290 --> 00:58:03,550
She grew up lonely without a single friend.

602
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:08,920
Oh my. Look at me carry on in front of a guest.

603
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:13,690
Just keep sitting here. I'll go and buy a bottle of soda.

604
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:20,170
- No need, Grandmother.
 - Just stay here. I want to drink it, that's why.

605
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:25,190
Stay here.

606
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:49,850
 So you were as lonely as me, Na Bong Seon.

607
01:00:16,990 --> 01:00:20,170
Hey, Kang Seon Woo, you bad guy.

608
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:25,250
- You... 
- Right, it's me, you bastard.

609
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:28,050
Wow...you look good.

610
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:33,730
You seem to be really carefree and in a great condition after playing around with an innocent kid and throwing her away.

611
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:35,610
What are you talking about?

612
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:42,330
You're asking me what I'm talking about? Are you asking me because you don't know, you bastard?

613
01:00:42,330 --> 01:00:47,150
Why did you do that to Na  Bong Seon? Why did you hurt this weak and frail kid?!

614
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:53,310
I've never seen someone as bright as her other than my sister.

615
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:58,970
But what did you do to her that overnight she is hunched over unable to eat?

616
01:00:58,970 --> 01:01:00,070
Are you even human after doing this?

617
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:02,350
How do you know that she isn't eating?

618
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:05,050
Because she's at my home, you bastard!

619
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:13,290
 Be happy.

620
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:29,930
Yes, Grandma. What?

621
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:35,250
No, there's nothing going on. I'm living well.

622
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:41,370
What? Who came by? Who?

623
01:01:41,370 --> 01:01:43,430
Na Bong Seon!

624
01:01:55,970 --> 01:01:57,990
You were alive?

625
01:01:58,730 --> 01:02:00,390
Huh?

626
01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:04,350
You only hid as far away as here?

627
01:02:04,350 --> 01:02:06,690
You deliberately hid here because you were waiting for me to pick you up, isn't it?

628
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:07,530
No—

629
01:02:07,530 --> 01:02:09,790
I'm right.

630
01:02:15,810 --> 01:02:18,530
Don't delude yourself, Na Bong.

631
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:26,150
I didn't run here, because I've forgiven you for deceiving me. I just was so worried.

632
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:35,670
My heart is telling me to hug you, so I'm hugging you. So let me hug you and relax a bit.

633
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:40,790
I missed you.

634
01:02:41,950 --> 01:02:44,730
Don't talk like a mosquito, I can't hear a word you're saying.

635
01:02:46,670 --> 01:02:50,730
I said I missed you, Chef, really really a lot!

636
01:02:59,770 --> 01:03:03,590
I thought about it and the one thing I'm sure of,

637
01:03:04,450 --> 01:03:10,290
so I, from the beginning, much earlier than when you were possessed by ghosts,

638
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:16,270
I watched over you, thought about you, and was worried about you. So don't disappear from my sight.

639
01:03:16,270 --> 01:03:19,010
Because I'm going to go crazy worrying about you.

640
01:03:20,990 --> 01:03:23,330
Chef.

641
01:03:23,330 --> 01:03:26,850
- Understand? 
- Yes.

642
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:39,770

643
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:49,390
♫   Close your eyes. You can smile.  ♫

644
01:03:50,270 --> 01:03:57,730
♫   Remind our memories.  ♫

645
01:03:57,730 --> 01:04:04,950
♫ Matching your footsteps to mine

646
01:04:04,950 --> 01:04:07,430
 Oh my Ghostess 
 ~Preview~

647
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:11,710
 I feel like I've become a bad guy without even sinning. I'm not a two-timer either.

648
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:14,950
 It would be great if we could go inside together.

649
01:04:14,950 --> 01:04:18,250
 I'll definitely not let go of your hand from now on.

650
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:21,490
 If we look at the current circumstances, it's almost sure that it was Sergeant Choi's doing.

651
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:23,810
 Don't we have to tell Chef now?

652
01:04:23,810 --> 01:04:27,630
 You know that I rely a lot on you, don't you?

653
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:34,010
 Sergeant Choi might be involved in Eun Hee's hit-and-run case.

654
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:36,190
 What are you saying now?
