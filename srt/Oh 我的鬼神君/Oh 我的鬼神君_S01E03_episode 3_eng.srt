1
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:22,940

2
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,210
 Oh My Ghostess

3
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,660
 Episode 3

4
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,390
 Okay. That's done.

5
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,840
 Here, have something refreshing.

6
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,620
 President, will it take longer?

7
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,750
 There's an on going war on my stomach now asking for food.

8
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,240
 I'm sorry. You'll get in soon.

9
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,980
 It will be a problem if word gets out. The sun would set while we wait.

10
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:01,550
 Aigoo, I'm sorry. Oh, they're out. Two people, please come in.
Daughter, two people!

11
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,100
 Yes, welcome!

12
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:08,530
 I'll clear this up right away. What do you want to eat?

13
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,230
 Two scorched rice soups for us.

14
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,770
  Yes, two stews with Chungyang red pepper so they're spicy, right?

15
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,100
 Of course.

16
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,550
 I'll bring it to you right away.

17
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,890
 Hey, are you a bat?

18
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:23,200
 You come home late every night. You came out at lunch when it's the busiest to help your sister, right?

19
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,180
 I'm tired of your nagging so I went out.

20
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,550
 Daughter! When's our pork dish coming out? We're dying of hunger here.

21
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:31,450
 Yes, yes.

22
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,340
 Aigoo, yes. It will come out soon.

23
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,360
 Daughter! Hurry up on their pork dish.

24
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,560
 Yes, it's coming out.

25
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,330
 At least serve the side dishes, hurry.

26
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:42,140
 Daughter. How about singing your specialty while doing that?

27
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,310
 It will cheer you up and we'll be less bored.

28
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,020
 It will be nice if you do it!

29
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:51,360
 I'm busy as hell and you want me to sing? Seriously.

30
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,530
♬  A long time ago, on a faraway star,  ♬

31
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:02,390
♬  when I came out into the world,  ♬

32
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:07,440
♬  I heard a soft voice  ♬

33
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,480
♬  telling me to come and give love.  ♬

34
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,740
♬  Without a feeling of hate, hate, hate  ♬

35
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,990
 Daughter, one more person here!

36
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,900
 Welcome!

37
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,830
Seriously...

38
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:32,510
Miss, just wait a bit. I'll be right out.

39
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,130
 Father, I told you to clean the utensil holder in every corner.

40
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:14,690
 Also, only put the spoons here once they're all dried. It will get stained.

41
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,680
 Father. I told you to cover the cubed radish container with a wrap.

42
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,500
 It won't taste good if it is dried out.

43
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,170
Is it okay?

44
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:02,140
What was I thinking? It's hot and I didn't even turn the fan on.

45
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,940
Just wait a second.

46
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,930
Oh? What's wrong with this?

47
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,910
This is broken again. It was okay before.

48
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,890
Seriously.

49
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,360
It works.

50
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,200
How did you do it?

51
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,300
I just pulled it and it worked.

52
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,950
I see.

53
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:35,670
I'm so grateful that I asked you to come here and cook something for you.

54
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,070
I'm not sure if it tastes good.

55
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,310
Yes. It's good.

56
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,600
I have to go.

57
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,710
Wait, wait. What am I doing?

58
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:55,530
I keep on grabbing on to a busy person.

59
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,880
This is not much but... Take a taxi home.

60
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,090
No, thank you. It's okay.

61
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,610
It's because I'm thankful.

62
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:13,220
In our world nowadays, he would've been in big trouble if not for you.

63
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,490
Here. This is what I feel so please accept it.

64
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,040
I ate well. Thank you.

65
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,000
 Right, it's this place. The neighborhood where I lived.

66
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,090
 New Village Computer Cleaning

67
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:07,180
 Hey, Soon Ae. Are you going to do a delivery? Come and take your father's suit.

68
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:11,860
 He left it here after a wedding, but didn't come back. Come and take it.

69
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,830
 Soon Ae! When are you going to pay me for the haircut last time?

70
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,950
 You always put it on credit. Hurry and pay me!

71
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:23,190
 Why is Gyeong Mo not coming these days? It's about time to get his haircut.

72
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,720
Hello, Ahjumma. How's your back?

73
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,720
Who are you?

74
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:38,850
I bought clothes from you before. It seems that you don't remember. That time,

75
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:42,000
you said your back was aching so...

76
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,260
Take good care of your health.

77
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:48,290
Back? I got surgery on it last year.

78
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,440
 The food is here.

79
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,950
 You're here?

80
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,160
 Wow. This is heavy.

81
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,760
 Let's eat!

82
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,610
 It came in big portions.

83
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,690
 It's been a while, Miss Soon Ae.

84
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,900
 - Enjoy the food.
 - Yes.

85
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,520
 Officer Choi, this.

86
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,290
 What is it?

87
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,920
 The amount of rice is different.

88
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,310
 Eat and leave   to me. Thank you.

89
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,010
 Thank you.

90
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,260
 Ah, seriously. Miss Soon Ae!

91
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,140
  I love quail eggs.

92
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,970
 Me too!

93
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:01,130
 -Enjoy your meal!
-Enjoy your meal.

94
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:14,930
 Officer Choi whom I liked by myself.

95
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:18,000
 No, you're a Sergeant now, right?

96
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,260
 You're warm and amazing as always.

97
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,870
 Everything is still the same.

98
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:33,850
 Why am I the only one who's not here?

99
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:39,430
 Why did I die leaving all these memories behind?

100
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,600
 I remember everything else, but

101
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,280
 I can't remember that moment.

102
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,700
 Just what exactly happened to me?

103
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,430
That miss, that...

104
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,220
So she cooks.

105
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,190
She even comes out on TV.

106
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,860
I didn't know she's a famous person.

107
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,410
 There's only about 10 minutes left.

108
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:33,050
 To see how the cooking is proceeding...

109
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,890
 Chef Kang Seon Woo making  dried pollack soup with rice crust

110
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:41,870
That... Our Soon Ae is really good at that.

111
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,980
A young person like her knows how to make that.

112
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,970
 Hey, jackpot! Chef must be a genius.

113
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,500
 Chef Kang Seon Woo's dried pollack soup is being tasted by the judges

114
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,660
 The judges are trying it out.

115
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,030
  The judges are tasting Chef Kang Seon Woo's pollack stew

116
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,140
  The rice is at the top.

117
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:09,400
How can a person who doesn't eat rice think of something like this?

118
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,470
But Na Bong Seon, you're a natural.

119
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,140
It doesn't seem like it's your first time in a program.

120
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:19,420
What natural? Is being like that on the side make you a natural?

121
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,290
What a shame. People would think you've been starved.

122
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,280
Why? It's more natural and interesting than just being stiff.

123
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,800
What? Okay, it's good to be natural but eating like that just won't do it.

124
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,140
Hey, Joon. What are you doing? It's almost over.

125
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,590
Hey, this is really fun.

126
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:39,110
I was organizing the sponsored rubber gloves that came in.

127
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:42,140
It must be because it's expensive, but it totally sticks to the hand and is good.,

128
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,230
I think we'll use the two boxes for a long time.

129
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,410
But where did Chef go?

130
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:53,640
Ah! They should've zoomed in here! I smiled on purpose too with my charms exploding.

131
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,600
Is the camera director a newbie or what?

132
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,830
Um, excuse me...

133
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,100
Yes, that's right. But what should I do? I don't have a pen.

134
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:14,020
No, I was wondering where I have to go to get to Mapo Bridge.

135
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,300
Oh, Mapo Bridge.

136
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:21,070
It's probably that way.

137
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,950
How is it? It's really good, right?

138
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:28,030
Yes, this is really good.

139
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:31,190
But why do opinions of someone like me matter that much?

140
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,700
Of course it does! The opinions of a person who uses the gloves everyday matters the most!

141
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,290
That's why I'm giving out samples.

142
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,990
Anyways, just use them, without any burden.

143
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:45,330
Thank you. I had to buy new gloves since mine had holes.

144
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:52,240
People must give people who come out on television things like this for free.

145
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,400
I'm just the kitchen assistant. Anyway, I will say good bye now!

146
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,440
I feel so relieved.

147
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,910
Can you try this for me?

148
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,390
Of course.

149
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,560
How is it?

150
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,850
Can I look around the kitchen?

151
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,190
Sure.

152
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:43,080
This is a kitchen in a restaurant,

153
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,550
but there's nothing really good here.

154
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,400
Why are you pouring soda into this?

155
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,420
This is different from sugar, so it gives it a new flavor.

156
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,070
Try mixing it again.

157
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:05,380
Really? Let me see...

158
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,050
You're right!

159
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:18,540
It tastes exactly like the ones my daughter used to make.

160
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:23,380
I didn't even know this and only poured in sugar.

161
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,810
Do you have a daughter?

162
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:31,470
I did. But she went far away.

163
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,740
She was like a son.

164
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,770
But what is your name?

165
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:43,750
I don't even know your name.

166
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,320
  It's Soon Ae, Father.

167
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,320
My name is Bong Seon. Na Bong Seon.

168
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,990
Oh, Bong Seon!

169
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:55,370
It's a good name. It's very warm and friendly.

170
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,590
Wait here for a moment.

171
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:02,220
I ran out of yogurt at home, so I have nothing to give you.

172
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,720
No, it's fine. I'm really fine.

173
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,060
I can't do that. I will be right back, so be right here.

174
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:14,840
Seriously...Well, my father

175
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,270
never just let a customer go.

176
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,900
Where is the kimchi container?

177
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,700
My father is the best.

178
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,880
How does this look the same, even after two years?

179
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,610
Nothing changed.

180
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,850
Why are you smiling?

181
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,660
Are you that happy?

182
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:12,410
Well, I never thought that this picture will be used at the funeral.

183
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,850
My diary...

184
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,860
  Soon Ae's Diary

185
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:25,070
 Who is it? Who are you?

186
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:30,440
Where is the bathroom? It's not here...

187
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,040
Excuse me!

188
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,230
Can you not tell a bathroom and a room apart? Are your eyes not working?

189
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,040
Yes, I have astigmatism.

190
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,960
  Why so picky?

191
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,410
  A bastard who used to wake up when the sun set on days he drank had to wake up early today.

192
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:50,450
Why are you looking at me like that?

193
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,640
- What? 
- What?

194
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,110
Did you wake up?

195
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,940
You guys already introduced yourselves?

196
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,230
What? She's not a customer?

197
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,150
You rascal. She is the lady

198
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:06,800
who assisted you when you were sleeping on the street yesterday.

199
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,250
Why do you always sleep on the street whenever you are drunk?

200
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,430
I will wake up anyway when the sun rises.

201
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:15,820
Thanks.

202
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,840
  Thanks? Look at the way he talks.

203
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,350
That's right. Why did I assist you to the police station?

204
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,860
You look like you are jobless.

205
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,610
You don't seem to be helping your father.

206
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:32,540
Even if you sleep there till the morning or your things get stolen,

207
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,620
I should have ignored you and just went along my way.

208
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,530
It's none of your business?

209
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,910
  The problem is that it is my business.

210
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,420
That's right.

211
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:45,990
It seems like you don't have a job, since you are here at this time of the day.

212
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:48,520
I was working...

213
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,740
What time is it right now?

214
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,780
I'm late! I'll leave first.

215
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,480
- This yogurt...
- I'll come again next time.

216
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,140
That lady.

217
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,630
Who is that woman?

218
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:05,260
- Ahjussi, use this! 
- Why are there so many?

219
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:08,290
There are too many in our store... It's overflowing. Use them well!

220
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,110
But still...

221
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,290
Use this!

222
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,810
That lady.

223
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:29,440
You used too much oil. The flavor wouldn't hold!

224
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,790
I can't put too much or too little. It's really hard.

225
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:36,560
It's very hard. If cooking becomes easy for the cook, the food will taste bad.

226
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,030
Where is the mentaiko that we will use for our special, Mentaiko Pasta?

227
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,900
Oh, Chef.

228
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,540
It's here.

229
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,750
Why are they so slimy? Wipe this for me.

230
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,810
Why is there water all over the floor?

231
00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:00,520
These bastards. They only brought these bad ones.

232
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,820
Min Soo, return this.

233
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,490
Take it back and say "you guys can eat this crap".

234
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,420
Yes, Chef. I will tell them that exactly.

235
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,900
Chef. Then what are we going to make for our special?

236
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,870
Yeah, what should I do?

237
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:16,410
Oh, right. We have some caviar that we used last time, right? Where is it?

238
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:17,890
Oh, yes.

239
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,890
You want to make caviar pasta? That is more expensive.

240
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:25,120
I won't take it from your salary so don't worry.

241
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,890
- Chef. 
- What?

242
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:28,430
The caviar is not here.

243
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:31,890
What do you mean? I put it in the left side.

244
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:35,890
I put it here...What? Where did it go?

245
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:39,480
I remember seeing it two days ago.

246
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:44,360
Chef. I don't know if it's good to tell you this in this situation,

247
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,270
but kitchen supplies have been disappearing since a couple days ago.

248
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:51,390
But they were of such small quantity,

249
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:54,240
so I didn't tell you.

250
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,110
What?

251
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,510
Thank you. Bye.

252
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,640
I'll come back again.

253
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,460
Okay.

254
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,740
Bong Seon!

255
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,740
Why are you here?

256
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,720
I wanted to just stop by and see him.

257
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:29,150
You must have become really close to him after that incident.

258
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:36,160
Well, Ahjussi is a really good person

259
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,690
and he seems like my father.

260
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:43,210
You are more social than I thought.

261
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:45,770
I thought you were really an introvert.

262
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,700
A little bit.

263
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,720
  It must be fate that I possessed her body.

264
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,930
  I saw my father and Officer Choi again.

265
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:04,360
  How is a man's hands so pretty? I want to hold them, I want to hold them.

266
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,920
 - I want to hold them. 
- I saw your broadcast. You weren't nervous at all. You did a good job.

267
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,620
Yes, I want to hold them.

268
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,450
- What?
- What?

269
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:14,100
Oh, no. That's not it.

270
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,900
It wasn't as scary as I thought.

271
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,800
I guess people didn't really know you.

272
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,080
Well, myself included.

273
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,050
Oh.

274
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:29,980
I'll head this way now. I have to meet my sunbae.

275
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,430
Oh, then. Next time...

276
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:37,730
  Let's walk again. While holding hands.

277
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:39,360
Go safely.

278
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,800
Okay.

279
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,830
'Go safely.'

280
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,720
He told me to go safely!

281
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,160
Yes, yes, I will go safely!

282
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,430
Oh my, why is the sky so pretty?

283
00:20:56,430 --> 00:21:01,410
The people are so pretty, and so are the flowers!

284
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:06,200
Oh my, my face must be turning red. You're so silly.

285
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,170
I think I'm feeling hot, after a long time.

286
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:12,010
Oh my, what should I do?

287
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:22,350
It feels weird to use them, but also to not use them.

288
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,750
What should I do?

289
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:29,000
Where did you go to get a haircut? You should have come home earlier.

290
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,040
I went to Cheondamdong. You don't just get a haircut anywhere, Father.

291
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:37,610
What is all this? Are you sending this off somewhere as relief goods?

292
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:42,310
You know that woman who works at the restaurant.

293
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:45,740
She stopped by again? She is so strange.

294
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,400
Why is she giving us something like this? Are we beggars?

295
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,530
She has a weird reason behind her actions.

296
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:54,050
But she didn't mention anything about insurance.

297
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,810
Then she must be a flower snake.

298
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:58,620
She probably thinks you are a rich man.

299
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,870
That's not right. Look at her face. Does she look like that?

300
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:05,270
Then does a conman have a sign 'I am a conman' on his face?

301
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,190
Don't you know how scary kids nowadays are?

302
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:11,350
The only thing more scarier than ghosts are women.

303
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:23,890
The fact that some of the kitchen supplies disappeared

304
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:29,590
means that someone here stole it. Since it's not me, it's one of you guys, right?

305
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:34,610
What kind of uncomfortable incident is this?

306
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:37,370
What? What?

307
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:41,870
If you need money, I would have given it to you.

308
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:44,590
You would have worked harder then.

309
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:52,530
If you took the ingredient and practiced cooking all night, I would have complimented you.

310
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:56,790
How can a person who works hard not look good in my eyes?

311
00:22:56,790 --> 00:23:01,330
But caviar? This much of caviar...

312
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:07,230
It's like only three hundred dollars, but I can't stand it.

313
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,490
Why? Because my trust is gone.

314
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:13,830
What is it? Why is he like this?

315
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:18,370
Our naive maknae must be very curious. Dong Cheol.

316
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:20,710
What disappeared?  Say the list.

317
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:25,730
Oh, caviar, rubber gloves that were sponsored,

318
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:30,670
one bottle of soy sauce, one bottle of sesame oil, sesame seeds...

319
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,210
How...

320
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:41,250
Who steals petty things like this? It's not like you can sell them for money. Who is it?

321
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,310
Turn yourself in.

322
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:46,300
Of course, if you turn yourself in, I will yell at you.

323
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:50,010
But that's better than not telling me and feeling guilty.

324
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:52,670
Come out. Who is it?

325
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:55,290
Chef.

326
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:58,170
Can I say something?

327
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,790
Say it.

328
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:08,630
I find it sad that something like this happened in our kitchen.

329
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:11,250
I understand our responsibility.

330
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:17,890
But what I, who was closer to these kids in the kitchen, think

331
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:23,370
is that this kind of method of catching the thief will do more harm than good.

332
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:26,550
That's what I thought.

333
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:29,770
Well, of course, I don't know if you will be successful in finding out the thief.

334
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:33,250
But until you do, the suspicion between us will grow deeper,

335
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,630
and the family-like relationship

336
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:41,830
that you and I, even if I helped a little, established will break.

337
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:44,590
That's what I thought.

338
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:48,570
The disappeared caviar, soy sauce, sesame seed, and what else?

339
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,710
- Sesame seed oil. 
- Oh, sesame seed oil.

340
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:54,110
You can buy these things with money.

341
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:57,450
But we can't buy our teamwork with money.

342
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:01,710
So we should stop this now

343
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,670
and I will take responsibility

344
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:09,330
and work as much as the values of the disappeared products.

345
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:12,950
That's what I was just thinking and stepped forward, Chef.

346
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,610
It was you, right?

347
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,250
What?

348
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:29,360
Um...

349
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,030
Chef, it's not me.

350
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,190
Chef.

351
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:37,250
It's you, right? Look at me straight in the eyes.

352
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:41,230
Look at me.

353
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:45,070
It's you.

354
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:49,110
Chef, wait a moment.

355
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:53,390
Wait a moment. That's not it.

356
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:58,890
A woman whom I've been flirting with wanted to try my food late at night,

357
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,870
so I just wanted to borrow it for a while and put it back but I forgot. So...

358
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:05,450
You son of a b*tch!

359
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:08,350
Um, Chef. The thing is...

360
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:12,130
It wasn't even that much caviar.

361
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:15,250
Really, trust me. Once I got my salary, I was going to replace it.

362
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:17,710
Does she have a restaurant? Why did you give her the soy sauce?

363
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:22,370
That's not it. I took the caviar, but not the other things.

364
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,470
Trust me.

365
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:27,150
Am I stupid enough to trust your words?

366
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,950
Excuse me, Chef.

367
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:31,810
Then why do you work with me?

368
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:35,430
If you don't trust me at all or want to see me, why do you keep me around?

369
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,830
What do you think?

370
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:41,410
Since you have some skill, I thought you will become a human if you work under me.

371
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,090
What? Bastard.

372
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:46,990
There are some things that you can do and not do. Are you a delinquent?

373
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:49,130
What do you mean deliquent?

374
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:51,710
Aren't you being a little too much?

375
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:54,970
- Can you listen to me...
- How am I too much? Isn't what you did worse?

376
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:58,550
The thing is...

377
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,550
The thing is...

378
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:03,150
I took the caviar,

379
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:05,770
but not the other things.

380
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:07,590
I...

381
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:11,330
I wasn't quiet because I had nothing to say to you.

382
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:14,410
You always ignore me everyday in front of them.

383
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:17,450
And I wanted to retain the teamwork and bought them alcohol.

384
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:21,150
Wow, I'm crazy to have been devoting my whole self for working for a person who looked down on me.

385
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:23,750
Devoting your whole self? Are you being funny?

386
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,890
It's not funny.

387
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:29,890
I'm not working for you because I have nowhere else to go. There are many places that asked me to come work for them.

388
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,510
Then leave!

389
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:34,490
- I am not going to stop someone who leaves because he doesn't like me! 
- I was going to do that anyway!

390
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:38,270
Seriously.

391
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:42,450
Excuse me. Be healthy.

392
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:45,890
Please become more modest.

393
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,630
Oppa, what are you doing? Hold on to him.

394
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:50,750
Why should I?

395
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,450
He said that he wanted to leave. Clean this up.

396
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:57,490
Chef, wait a moment. Excuse me.

397
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:01,490
Chef, Chef, Chef.

398
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:06,030
It's not a situation for you to be so angry about.

399
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,070
What?

400
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:10,090
So people can make mistakes in their lives.

401
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:12,870
People are often tempted when they see good things.

402
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:15,670
So let's bring back Sous Chef again.

403
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:17,530
Should I bring him again and say that you told me to bring him back?

404
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:20,130
It's fine. you better not go after him. Don't hold on to him.

405
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:24,710
Chef, you can let go of one mistake.

406
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:28,810
Also, for us Koreans there is a beautiful and fine tradition of third time's a charm.

407
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:31,990
So let's just forgive him once.

408
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:35,870
Then you can be the owner and pay me salary.

409
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:38,090
Chef...Excuse me.

410
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:44,290
Why are things becoming so twisted? Darn it! I'm about to go crazy.

411
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:50,450
Do you see something?

412
00:28:56,130 --> 00:29:01,010
I see a husband who is running away?

413
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:05,470
I see a young woman next to him.

414
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:12,590
Southwest. The direction is southeast. 
  (She says southwest in English and southeast in Korean)

415
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:15,390
I don't even have a husband.

416
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:18,790
So even if it isn't your husband,

417
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:24,450
I'm saying, someone in your family who may be equivalent to a husband.

418
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,570
To the spirits, if there's a direct line then it's all the same.

419
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:28,970
Oh, so my daughter-in-law...

420
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:31,670
That's right, your Daughter-in-law.

421
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:34,070
What do you mean you are blessed by God? Bullsh**.

422
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:37,490
I can't believe these fakes are earning money in Gangnam.

423
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:40,690
That's why real bodhisatva like mr have no where to go.

424
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:42,050
Oh my, I'm sorry.

425
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:45,280
It hurts.

426
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,920
Wait a moment.

427
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,590
It seems like we have met before.

428
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:53,880
- I don't think so. 
- It seems like it.

429
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,920
- Me?
- Your voice sounds familiar.

430
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:05,220
It's not because I don't trust you

431
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,310
that I went there...

432
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:09,080
It's okay.

433
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,640
You don't have to be like that.

434
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,080
Before buying a cabbage, you go around different stores.

435
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,950
Of course you should try out other places.

436
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:22,530
Then you will see how good I am.

437
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:26,640
That's right. That is so.

438
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,530
But you must have been very hungry. You emptied the bowl.

439
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:36,760
I was trying to find someone today so I skipped my meals.

440
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,850
Find? That's funny.

441
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:44,680
You must not see everything.

442
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,270
The thing is...

443
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:50,500
The thing I'm looking for is not a person,

444
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,220
but a ghost.

445
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,810
A ghost? Oh my.

446
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:57,060
Why a ghost?

447
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,280
He can say anything now that he's angry?

448
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:06,490
Then he shouldn't have made the mistake in the first place.

449
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,600
He and I

450
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,100
spent years together, and he couldn't control himself...

451
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:18,020
Did I do something wrong?

452
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,460
If you are listening to me, tell me instead of just eating.

453
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:29,870
You are better than humans.

454
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:32,160
You won't betray me.

455
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,020
Whatever. Let him quit.

456
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,550
Will the kitchen not function because the Sous Chef is not here?

457
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:46,080
I'm sorry.

458
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,160
Bong Seon, clean this up.

459
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,300
Yes, Chef.

460
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:53,170
Do it slowly. Dong Cheol, why are you in a rush?

461
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:59,580
Didn't seafood noodles already go out to Table 3?

462
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,460
Didn't it already go to Table 3?

463
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,250
Yes, Chef.

464
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,880
Check to see if it has been already made!

465
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,460
We got it.

466
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,110
What happened to the flounder?

467
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:13,220
I'm working on it right now.

468
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,900
Why did you cut it up like this?

469
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,650
I'm sorry. Sous chef used to do this.

470
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:20,250
Start from the tail end... Look.

471
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,630
Pull slowly while doing it.

472
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:26,620
Do it slowly, slowly.

473
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,960
Try again.

474
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:35,130
It's going to take the whole day. Make the salad first.

475
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,330
Bong Seon!

476
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:39,400
Wrap the flounder in kelp and ferment it in the refrigerator.

477
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,290
- Yes, Chef. 
- Beef?

478
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,930
- Ji Woong. 
- Yes, Chef.

479
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:44,420
Can you fillet beef?

480
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,940
Sous Chef used to do that.

481
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:49,810
Why is everyone ordering fillets today? So annoying.

482
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:02,030
Yeah, Hyung, it's me.

483
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:06,900
Perhaps, do you have anyone who can be a sous chef? It's an emergency.

484
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:10,140
 I'm not sure. Those annual wage guys are hard to get.

485
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,310
 Also, the word is out about you being a difficult carcinogenic chef.

486
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:15,810
 A lot of people might not want to work under you.

487
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:19,560
 People these days prefer comfort than a learning environment.

488
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:24,850
What, carcinogenic? Carcinogenic. That's driving me nuts.

489
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:29,450
I'm only telling them the hard truth for their own good. What a bunch of trash. Forget it.

490
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:31,860
Well they are kicking away their luck.

491
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,930
 Hey, are you getting angry at me right now?

492
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:37,370
I'm not yelling at you. I mean. No, I mean.

493
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:40,250
Why would I yell at you? I'm sorry.

494
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:43,020
It's chaotic right now.

495
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:46,490
I understand. I'll call you later. Make sure you eat. Yeah.

496
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:53,360
I'm going crazy. Where do I hire an souschef?

497
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:59,580
Excuse me. There's a girl name Bong Seon or whatever who comes out on television here, right?

498
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,030
- Yes, that's right. Why? 
 - I'm right.

499
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:05,250
I'm the owner's son of a restaurant down the road.

500
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:08,060
Here. Tell the girl.

501
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:11,280
If she thinks we're poor, we don't need her pity.

502
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,050
And if she's after my dad, my dad is poor.

503
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:17,390
Tell her that there's nothing that she'll gain from seducing us and that it's worthless.

504
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:19,330
You memorized it, right?

505
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:22,800
I brought this without touching it, so don't complain later.

506
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,400
What is he saying?

507
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:32,430
And what is this?

508
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:38,320
Really. Really! Why? What?

509
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,550
Why? What?

510
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:43,190
Why are you doing this?

511
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,680
What is this?

512
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,920
What is this?

513
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:56,090
Why why why is is this here?

514
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:59,860
Seeing that you're surprised, you did it.

515
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:03,580
The son of that restaurant in the front brought it over. Explain it to me.

516
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:08,590
Explain to me so that I can understand.

517
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,690
That is... This...

518
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:16,140
Perhaps, you're not trying to pull something with that Ahjussi like what the son implied, right?

519
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,440
Did that bastard say that?

520
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:22,790
This bastard, I should have sewed his lips.

521
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:25,410
Hey, Na Bong Seon...

522
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:26,860
Yes?

523
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,740
You're really hurt, right?

524
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:35,950
More than being hurt, I'm a little bit unstable these days.

525
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:41,340
No, no. You... You recently have become worse. What's wrong with you?

526
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:47,600
Nevermind about that. What's your relationship with that restaurant that you would... why?

527
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,490
It's not because there's anything going on...

528
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:54,460
It's very sad, that's why. If you go see for yourself, then you'll know.

529
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:57,540
It's very shabby. There's nothing that's in order over there.

530
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:01,310
I don't know how he is able to run a business like that.

531
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:04,550
He is struggling to make a living after his daughter died.

532
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:08,640
But his son is a playboy and doesn't help at all, not even 1%. So, I...

533
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:14,150
- So, you gave alms, with these? Not something of yours but with the restaurant's?
- Ah, yes.

534
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:19,790
Woah. I'm going nuts.

535
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:23,540
I can't understand how your brain is functioning.

536
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:28,040
Seriously, what is wrong with you? In the past, you couldn't even look at me in the eye . What's wrong with you?

537
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:32,240
This is totally crazy.

538
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:36,030
So, what are you going to do?

539
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:40,480
Min Soo left and now this situation, how are you going to take responsibility?

540
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,880
So why did you hastily fire the person?

541
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:48,950
And, I was going to call him back but you for no reason got mad-

542
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:52,210
Really! Oh, my head.

543
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:59,690
You... first of all,

544
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:03,560
this is just between us.

545
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:07,220
Only you and I know about this. I'll take care of this, so you go on in.

546
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,550
Yes, Chef. But Sous Chef-

547
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:12,950
I told you that I'll take care of it. Get inside now.

548
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:15,680
Yes, I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

549
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,610
The cost for these goods, from this girl's wages, ah no, from my wages, make sure to take it from my wages.

550
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:25,920
This...this sinner will be going inside now.

551
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,300
- Go already.
- Yes, I'm going. I'm gone.

552
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,690
Stop.

553
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,460
 Hey, Heo Min Soo!

554
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:46,380
How can you put diesel in a gasoline car, you fool?

555
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,250
Don't you know gasoline and diesel in English?

556
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:51,230
-Why would I not know? 
 - How can you mix it up if you knew?

557
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,280
You're driving me nuts.

558
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,060
Why is a cook coming here and being such a nuisance to me? You're driving everyone crazy.

559
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,790
Just take it out of my pay!

560
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:01,330
Do you know how much the engine costs? It's $4500.

561
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:03,560
And your pay is 40,000 Won.

562
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,560
Why is different than what Noona said. I thought it was 100,000.

563
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,730
Ask that of  your sister.

564
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:09,990
Just wash the car.

565
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:11,800
I'm sorry.

566
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:16,140
Scrub it well, scrub it! Like you're washing your own body, as clean as your own body!

567
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,290
Like my own body, like my own body.

568
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:21,090
Yeah, can't you even wash a car? Are you stupid? An imbecile?

569
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,570
Seriously, you!

570
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:26,420
This is too much even amongst family.

571
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,800
You shouldn't roll it down...

572
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,910
Did you talk big just to come here?

573
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:38,730
You said there were plenty of places to work, why here?

574
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:42,600
-Why did you come here? 
 - I came to get a car wash.

575
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,990
Yes.

576
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,930
What are you doing? Get in!

577
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:54,430
Are you going to keep holding a dirty rag with your knife-holding hand?

578
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,920
Just a moment.

579
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:03,110
Gasoline. Gasoline!
 (Sound like bullsh*t in Korean)

580
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:09,640
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

581
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,970
You're grossing me out. Why are you doing this?

582
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:13,210
You're seriously...

583
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:15,480
You acted like you weren't going to see me again. Were you really planning never to see...?

584
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,830
-You were, weren't you?
No, I wasn't, I was going to keep seeing you.

585
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:20,830
Okay, okay, let's go.

586
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,460
Attention.

587
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,460
Min Soo's back.

588
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,620
I brought Min Soo back,

589
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:36,410
and well, being like this at this hour,

590
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:38,570
about the bad thing that happened today.

591
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:40,760
Let's not bring it up again.

592
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,120
It's not a good memory anyway so let's just bury it.

593
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,680
Today never happened, okay?

594
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,390
Yes, Chef!

595
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:54,770
Let's clean up and go out today.

596
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:57,410
I don't think I've paid enough attention to everyone lately.

597
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:02,800
What are you talking about? A sous chef should pay attention to everything and be the support person.

598
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,690
It's all my fault. Please just hit me.

599
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:08,510
What hit? No, I wasn't thinking.

600
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:12,540
What do you feel like eating? Short ribs?

601
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,390
-Chicken 
 - Chicken?

602
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:16,220
Chicken.

603
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:20,300
Chicken? Then let's eat spicy stirred fried chicken.

604
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,600
Yes.

605
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,170
-Then clean up.
-Yes, Chef!

606
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:26,310
Thank you, Chef!

607
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:35,090
You were really worried, weren't you? It's all over with, don't worry. Look happy.

608
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:38,480
Let's finish up and tonight's outing is 100% attendance, okay?

609
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,480
If one of you bails out, then I will hate you!

610
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,050
-Is there anyone who wants to be hated by this sous-chef?
-There isn't!

611
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:48,870
There isn't!

612
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:57,110
Chef really has a good heart.

613
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:59,500
If it were me, I don't think I can just bury it.

614
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:04,360
Today is just like a dream.

615
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:09,760
He's like a zombie who just won't die.

616
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,830
He doesn't die.

617
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:13,380
Why don't you come with us?

618
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:17,780
It's fine. I'm tired and Seong Jae is coming. I talked to him on the phone.

619
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,090
Let's go.

620
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:21,050
Yes, Chef. Let's go!

621
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:23,500
Let's go to dinner.

622
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,130
Seon Woo! Eun Hee!

623
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:27,470
What's wrong, Mom? It's late.

624
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:30,500
-Hello.
-Hello.

625
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,890
Did you drink again?

626
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:34,520
Just a bit with  .

627
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,930
This here is Seobinggo.

628
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:40,230
She's famous in Seoul for having high spirits.

629
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:42,610
We became friends today.

630
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:43,960
Friend, friend.

631
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,770
She came to look at you.

632
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,730
We're going for dinner right now.

633
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:49,380
Dinner?

634
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,410
Hey, you go first.

635
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:52,530
Yes, Chef.

636
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:54,420
Ah, yes. Eat a lot.

637
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:57,290
-Mother, I love you!
-I love you too.

638
00:41:57,290 --> 00:42:00,350
Eat a lot.

639
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:03,840
Hey! It's the girl who doesn't greet well.

640
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,950
What was your name?

641
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:08,010
-Bong Sook?
-Bong Seon, Mom.

642
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:11,580
Bong Seon. I'm sorry.

643
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:15,160
Can you get us two cups of water? I'm a bit thirsty.

644
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,490
Ah, yes. Water?

645
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:20,590
Wait!

646
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,200
Me?

647
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:26,380
Please get me lukewarm water. My teeth are in  bad shape.

648
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,280
Sure.

649
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:37,010
-It's weird here.
-Weird?

650
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:41,520
Yin and Yang are strangely mixed.

651
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:50,640
-Oh, strong. Really strong.
-Strong?

652
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,900
-Really strong.
-Strong?

653
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:56,900
Even when I'm tipsy, from what I feel,

654
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:59,640
a lot of ghosts will stick to you.

655
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,230
Ghost? See, Seon Woo.

656
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:03,950
The ghost here is no joke.

657
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:06,880
Excuse me. I'm sorry but I don't believe in ghosts.

658
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,800
My employees are waiting outside so I'd have to excuse myself.

659
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,770
Mom, I'll talk to you later.

660
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:13,930
No, Seon Woo. Wait.

661
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:16,460
-Wait!
-Aigoo. Let him be.

662
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:22,500
If he doesn't believe, charms are of no use.

663
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:27,100
Wait!

664
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,150
Yes?

665
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:31,110
Thanks for the water.

666
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:36,840
-Enjoy it.
-Yes, of course.

667
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:46,920
  Yoo Ga's Chicken Galbi

668
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:51,460
Here, here, here.

669
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:53,620
Attention.

670
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:57,210
Let's forget our age and status

671
00:43:57,210 --> 00:44:00,540
and relax!

672
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:04,580
Everyone, cheers!

673
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:08,570
Chef, can you do a love shot with me?

674
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:10,200
What love shot? We're both guys.

675
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:14,200
- Just do it once, Chef! 
- Sous Chef loves you very much. Just do it once!

676
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:20,380
Love shot! Love shot!

677
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:22,190
Seriously.

678
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:24,470
- Just do it once! 
- Why do I have to do a love shot with a man?

679
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:26,210
Just do it once!

680
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:28,090
Hurry up.

681
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:30,770
Seriously!

682
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:33,330
Do it, do it!

683
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:35,850
You guys look good together!

684
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:43,280
It's delicious. But Chef, wait a moment.

685
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:48,250
Here.

686
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:50,430
It's delicious.

687
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:56,990
Chef, honestly, for half a day today, I thought a lot today

688
00:44:56,990 --> 00:45:01,630
about human relationships and the meaning of life.

689
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:05,670
I thought a lot, Chef, honestly

690
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:11,700
I'm thankful that you took the first step.

691
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,910
I didn't steal anything besides that caviar.

692
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:18,110
We already decided not to talk about that.

693
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:21,810
- I want to clear it up.
- We decided to just bury it.

694
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:27,070
Since we are starting again, cheers!

695
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:30,740
Cheers!

696
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:40,960
Chef.

697
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,320
- Hey. 
- It's so nice.

698
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,260
Why did you drink so much? Are you drunk?

699
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:48,410
No. I'm not that drunk.

700
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:50,130
Stop drinking.

701
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:54,480
Chef, you feel good too, right?

702
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,830
What?

703
00:45:55,830 --> 00:46:02,210
You took back Sous Chef. You really did a good job. Seriously.

704
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:06,860
Are you cornering a mouse? Why are you driving me to the corner?

705
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:09,090
- Because I like you.
- I already know.

706
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:11,750
Chef. Chef.

707
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:15,000
I like it too. Let me go. I have a phone call.

708
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,510
- So Hyeong, why?
- It's Chef!

709
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:21,570
Did something happen?

710
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:25,320
What is this? Where are you going?

711
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,560
So Hyeong.

712
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:35,420
Seon Woo.

713
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:37,560
What happened?

714
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:41,580
I'm really sorry. You were the only person I could think of.

715
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:46,530
I turned my steeringwheel because a cat suddenly jumped out.

716
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:49,630
I think I slightly hit the cat, but I was so surprised.

717
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:53,940
Are you okay?

718
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,370
Yeah.

719
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:08,310
Do you know why I came back crawling here?

720
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:13,930
Many places heard the news and told me to come...

721
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:19,550
I refused them. I couldn't leave because of you guys.

722
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:21,190
Crazy bastard. He is talking bullcrap.

723
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:24,830
Let's have a drink.

724
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:28,870
I want to bury bones with you guys (stay together for a long time).

725
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:33,950
- Why would you bury bones? 
- Put your bones here. 
- Here.

726
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:38,580
But the only person who thought of you was Bong Seon.

727
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:41,840
Bong Seon told Chef to bring you back many times.

728
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,530
That's right.

729
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:46,740
Really? Seriously?

730
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:49,820
Yeah, me.

731
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,070
Bong, seriously!

732
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:56,640
I'm so thankful. You are the best.

733
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:02,770
No, it's nothing. I also had a reason... Anyway, I'm athankful.

734
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:05,030
No, no. I'm more thankful.

735
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:08,910
No. I'm more thankful.

736
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:12,590
Bong, you are so cool.

737
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:17,990
Okay. Call me Oppa from now on.

738
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:21,290
You are, from now on, on my side, okay?

739
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:23,530
We are a family, family. Okay?

740
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:28,350
Really? Then do I have an Oppa now?

741
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:32,270
It's nice, nice. So nice.

742
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:35,030
Oppa, Oppa. Where do you live? Do you live alone?

743
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:39,170
I want to go to your house.

744
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:43,830
We are a family. Why are you so seductive when you are drunk?

745
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:46,900
No, I want to go.

746
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:50,350
- I want to go to your house.
- I can't! My house is really small.

747
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:53,660
That's why I should go! Since it's small.

748
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:56,390
It's not fun if it's big.

749
00:48:56,390 --> 00:49:00,750
Our Bong Seon is too seductive.

750
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:04,150
But can you let this go? It's so uncomfortable.

751
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:06,730
No, bastard. We are a family.

752
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:08,230
Family! We are!

753
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:13,070
This bastard! You have to listen to him!

754
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:18,510
Do you know how stubborn this bastard is?

755
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:21,690
He doesn't lose.

756
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:24,720
- It seems like you are talking badly about me, now that you are drunk.

757
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,480
Why does it seem like we are not walking straight?

758
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,870
- Let's go. Let's go. 
- Catch me if you can!

759
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:32,260
- I'm going to kill you when I catch you.
- I am walking, but why does it seem like I'm not?

760
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:37,350
Stop! Stop!

761
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:40,230
Bong Seon!

762
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:47,230
Why do you close so early? I would have missed you if I was a little late.

763
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:51,200
You must have had a drink today.

764
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:55,600
Yes. I had a work dinner.

765
00:49:56,790 --> 00:50:03,310
It was nice. Laughing  and talking with people and drinking.

766
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:08,210
I was going home, and I thought of you.

767
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:13,010
You like this.

768
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:19,170
Ahjussi, why did you return the things I gave you?

769
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:24,670
I'm really sad. I just gave it to you, without any other meaning.

770
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:30,470
I'm sorry. My son is a very cautious person.

771
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:34,670
But what should I do? I have to go somewhere now.

772
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:35,960
Where?

773
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:40,010
My son wanted soondae all of the sudden.

774
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:41,730
Let's have a drink next time.

775
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:45,790
I love soondae too.

776
00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:52,030
Really? But my son is very shy.

777
00:50:52,730 --> 00:51:00,910
And I hope you don't bring things from now on.

778
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:06,490
I know it's with good intention, but I feel uncomfortable.

779
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:10,200
Come here whenever to eat.

780
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:13,370
Then I'll be going.

781
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:30,300
He could feel uncomfortable.. Father doesn't know who I am.

782
00:51:31,110 --> 00:51:36,310
Yes, his son is first, of course. Why would he want to eat soondae with me?

783
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:43,340
Why did I uselessly go? I should have just had a drink by myself.

784
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:46,960
Oh? Officer Choi...

785
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:51,860
- Eun Hee?
- Seong Jae!

786
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:54,800
Sister-in-law!

787
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,630
Your kimbab was awesome!

788
00:51:57,630 --> 00:52:00,420
Why is Officer Choi with Eun Hee?

789
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:03,360
This house must have the blood of a chef.

790
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:07,960
The food was delicious...I'm asking you to make it for us again.

791
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,280
- Of course. Anyway. 
- Yes, thank you.

792
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,730
Give it to me. I'll drop off my wife at home and come back.

793
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:14,490
Okay. Bye.

794
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:17,910
- Yes, I'll see you again. 
- You're a goddess.

795
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:31,000
I feel bad. If I knew you were having a work dinner, I shouldn't have called you. I was going to call a driver anyway.

796
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
It's okay. I wasn't planning on staying for a long time.

797
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:40,510
I must be sensitive to things like this. With the cat and all...

798
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:46,880
I don't like it when somebody gives me flowers for a present. I don't want anything to die after coming to me.

799
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:55,960
It seems like it's going to rain. Do you want to come in and have a cup of coffee?

800
00:52:57,930 --> 00:53:04,410
No. What if you attack me?

801
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:10,830
Are you crazy? Even if I am starving, I know what to eat and what not to eat.

802
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:13,600
Why am I something that can't be eaten? Am I rotten?

803
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:18,890
You don't just not eat rotten food. There are personal preference as well.

804
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:20,810
Then goodbye.

805
00:53:20,810 --> 00:53:24,690
Drink something warm and sleep. You were in shock.

806
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:28,150
- I'm on my way. 
- Bye.

807
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:38,110
He just left without turning around. That cold bastard.

808
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:57,360
 Hello.

809
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,980
 Yes, enjoy your meal.

810
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:02,760
 It finally happened. Please help me, Seon Woo.

811
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:06,900
 Remember the goddess from our class that I told you about? I asked her to meet me here for an assignment.

812
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:16,140
 Something like that?

813
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:18,200
 That's right.

814
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:22,100
 Isn't this too old-fashioned? Will it work?

815
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:25,300
 When there's nothing else, going with the classic is better. That's what I think.

816
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:27,140
 Good for you, punk.

817
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,320
 She's here. She's here.

818
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,720
 So Hyeong.

819
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:44,980
 This is my friend, Seon Woo.

820
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:46,580
 Hello.

821
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:50,460
 -Yes, hello.
-I knew at that time.

822
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:56,900
 The sad thing about love is that it's not the person that is wrong but the time.

823
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,440
 I'll...

824
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:07,070
 Also, time lost can never be brought back. That's how it goes.

825
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:08,320
 Chicken and beer?

826
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:09,980
 Well, for me...

827
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:14,080
 -That's good.
-Really?

828
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:34,260
 Sergeant Choi got married and his wife is Miss Eun Hee.

829
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:38,520
 I died and this body is not mine.

830
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:49,720
 Right, that can happen too. Three years is not a short time.

831
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:54,860
 A lot of things can happen. Someone can get married.

832
00:56:54,860 --> 00:57:00,720
 Someone can lose a child and live because he can't die yet. Also, someone...

833
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,300
 That's right. I was mistaken for a second.

834
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:11,420
 I'm not Na Bong Seon.

835
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:16,020
 I'm not even Na Bong Seon and I'm also not Shin Soon Ae.

836
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:18,660
 I'm just a ghost.

837
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:24,930
 Just one of the many virgin ghosts who possess someone else's body.

838
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:25,490
Why is this out here?

839
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:33,610
I'm sorry. Continue on what you're doing.

840
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:42,890
Excuse me. What are you doing in my room right now?

841
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:44,290
It's my room.

842
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:48,910
No. It's my room. Didn't you mistake it for your room?

843
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:50,810
Do you want to come in?

844
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:55,330
What?

845
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,540
It's right though...

846
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:04,530
I got the date wrong and he vacated my room?

847
00:59:04,530 --> 00:59:07,710
Didn't even say anything. This is really too much.

848
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:15,990
But this girl... What does she have in her luggage? What is this?

849
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:23,370
Oh?

850
00:59:23,370 --> 00:59:27,750
How can she not even have one card?

851
00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:31,510
She's really unique.

852
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:49,130
Yes, Grandmother.

853
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:53,710
 Why are you not calling? Did something happen recently?

854
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:55,530
No, Grandma.

855
00:59:55,530 --> 00:59:59,680
 I got the money. You sent money for my disc surgery

856
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,970
 when you probably don't even have much

857
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:05,250
  You don't listen when I tell you not to send money monthly.

858
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:07,580
It's nothing. Use it comfortably, Grandma.

859
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:12,490
 But why are you suddenly using formal speech when you never did?

860
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:19,370
It's not that. I got mature all of a sudden and I thought I had to be formal.

861
01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:27,870
Hello? Grandma? Grandma.

862
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:32,890
 Right. Eat well and don't forget to light the incense.

863
01:00:32,890 --> 01:00:35,550
Yes, goodbye.

864
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:44,600
She's a good granddaughter. She gives all the money she earns to her grandma.

865
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:52,930
What is this? Is it makeup?

866
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:13,270
How silly. You didn't have to live like this.

867
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:16,270
You just live and die once.

868
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:19,430
Use whatever you want and do what you want to do.

869
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:23,750
I should've dated and two-timed, or even dated three at once. I should've been reckless like that.

870
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:26,430
I didn't even know that what I'm saving will just become nothing.

871
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:31,710
But where do I go now?

872
01:01:31,710 --> 01:01:36,640
I can't just go and sleep anywhere while in someone else's body.

873
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:39,930
There's also so much luggage...

874
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:26,620

875
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:45,370
Ah...

876
01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:49,180
This is nice.

877
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:02,750
Aigoo. That scared me.

878
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:07,310
What is this? Are you a poltergeist?

879
01:03:07,310 --> 01:03:10,810
Ah, it seems like the gates have been opened at this time,

880
01:03:10,810 --> 01:03:16,330
but what can I do? My mind and body are so tired I don't like to fight you.

881
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:19,550
Can't you go somewhere else? Does it really have to be here?

882
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:22,590
It's not that. Okay, fine.

883
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:26,570
If you want to stay here and don't want to go somewhere else, then let's stay here together.

884
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:28,290
I'm not that picky.

885
01:03:28,290 --> 01:03:32,790
Also, whether it's a ghost or an evil spirit, I don't mind as long as they won't hurt me.

886
01:03:34,090 --> 01:03:37,870
I'm a pacifist. I advocate peace.

887
01:03:37,870 --> 01:03:43,650
What's with you, really? I'm really tired. Okay, I get it.

888
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:49,610
Okay. If you really want to do this, then fine. Let's do it.

889
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:58,930
Brace yourself. I'm going. Come at me. Come!

890
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:08,960
 A lot of ghosts will probably stick to you.

891
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:13,080
 The ghosts here are no joke too.

892
01:04:36,070 --> 01:04:37,590
 Oh My Ghostess Preview

893
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:39,960
 Ah, Chef.

894
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,360
 I just acted cute once and he got angry?

895
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:45,640
 Did Miss Eun Hee like you first or was it you who chased after her?

896
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:47,240
 I chased her first.

897
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,280
 How can he be so considerate?

898
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:51,620
 Ah, you should have been more careful.

899
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:54,220
 She's not just a friend, right? You like her as a woman.

900
01:04:54,220 --> 01:04:56,160
 What are you saying?

901
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:59,280
 I found the man of vitality!

902
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:01,320
 How can someone change like that so suddenly?

903
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:06,330
 I'm asking a favor. Can't you just do it? I won't ask for more. Just once is enough.
