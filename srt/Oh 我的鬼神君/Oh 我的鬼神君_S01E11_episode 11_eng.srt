1
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:38,690
 Oh My Ghostess

2
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,840
If you leave me, you're dead.

3
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,320
I'm sorry!

4
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,660
What should I do. It's so hot.

5
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:51,720
Oh, what am I to do? I'm going to go crazy. What now?

6
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,220
Why why?

7
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,280
Huh?

8
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,440
Didn't you come out on purpose to see me?

9
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,780
No. No, all of a sudden the heat...

10
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:19,420
No I came out on purpose so I can talk with you.

11
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,340
It's cooling off since nighttime is here. Should we ride the swings?

12
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,160
There isn't anything else going on?

13
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,680
Huh? Not yet.

14
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,340
I'm okay but

15
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,240
I feel like I've gotten a lot closer with Chef.

16
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:52,160
What about you? You said you don't have a lot of time left.

17
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,920
Are you worrying for me right now?

18
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,840
Oh? I guess so. I'm really meddlesome, aren't I?

19
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:08,860
Long time ago I hated even looking at a ghost.

20
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,520
I guess I've changed a lot too.

21
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:19,260
Actually, having a heart to heart talk like this with someone

22
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:24,980
isn't something I've done before. Because people might find out my situation,

23
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:31,890
I've lived hiding things to myself, like a fool.

24
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,440
Now you aren't alone.

25
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,620
Even if I leave, Chef will be by your side.

26
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,840
I'm not really sure. Even if it goes the way we thought it to be,

27
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,300
I'm not sure if Chef will continue to stay by my side.

28
00:04:55,130 --> 00:05:00,940
I'm happy right now but a little worried as well.

29
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,760
 Na Bong Seon, I'm sorry.

30
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:13,340
But still, I like it much better now than before. I feel like I get along well with others.

31
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,960
And I don't see other ghosts.

32
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,840
 Just a little longer. I'll stay just a few more days before I go.

33
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,000
 I'm sorry for deceiving you.

34
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,960
It's good riding the swing after a long time.

35
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:40,800
 Oh My Ghostess 
  Episode 11

36
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:48,030
Ah, this is so embarrassing. I feel so ashamed.

37
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:54,590
Who's the one who was begging to go to a motel? Was it too sudden?

38
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:58,870
Did she get surprised? Na Bong Seon!

39
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,730
Chef.

40
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,430
You.

41
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:09,450
Just tell me like it is. I'm just curious.

42
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:10,990
I was nauseous.

43
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:16,480
What? Nauseous? What I did earlier was-

44
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:21,710
No, no, no. That's not what I meant. Earlier, I might have eaten too quickly,

45
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:26,650
and I'm prone to indigestion. And I suddenly wasn't feeling well.

46
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,130
Yes.

47
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,890
That was it?

48
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:36,870
Of course! What else would it be? There's no reason for me to refuse.

49
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:43,450
Ah! You scared me! Oh, I was thinking of anything and everything it could be.

50
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:47,950
I thought maybe I made a mistake, or do I smell, or your condition is turning bad again...

51
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:55,730
Oh, no! It's none of that! I wasn't feeling well, that's why.

52
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:00,750
Then it's okay. Let's go up.

53
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,450
Go up?

54
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,450
We have to sleep since it's getting late.

55
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,530
She scared me.

56
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:16,790
Let's go on vacation next time. Today is just to get the feeling.

57
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:19,210
Yeah okay Chef.

58
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:24,430
Are you really okay? You don't look that unwell.

59
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:29,790
No. I still don't feel that good but

60
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:34,790
I'm feeling much better after getting some air.

61
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:39,210
-Ah, it doesn't make me feel good. Since you don't feel well after eating what I made.

62
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:44,730
No! Not at all. It wasn't because of the food you made. It's because I stupidly ate too quickly.

63
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:48,130
Chef, your food was really, really delicious. Really. Perfect.

64
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:49,490
Well that's obvious.

65
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,370
Yes.

66
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,430
Let's clean the rest of this up and go in and comfortably sleep.

67
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,450
Yes, Chef.

68
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,270
It sure was awkward.

69
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:04,610
Why did it have to be right at that timing?

70
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:16,590
Okay. Is today the only day?

71
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:25,150
I'm really going to give her a shock.

72
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:31,230
Seriously. Na Bong Seon, you're going to be in big trouble. One, two, three...

73
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:35,840
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,...

74
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:45,880
I know Chief that it's my greed but I'll stay by your side a little longer.

75
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,970
For very short while.

76
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,690
That's enough for today.

77
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:56,310
Oh my! You're here, Son-in-law Choi!

78
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,190
Come in.

79
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,050
You weren't sleeping yet, Mother-in-law?

80
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:03,090
I couldn't go to sleep before seeing you get home.

81
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,170
I guess you have a lot of work these days?

82
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,800
We don't have additional recruits so there's a lot of work to do.

83
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,500
Oh dear. Your eyes are sunken and  you look so tired.

84
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,540
Do you want a glass of wine? It will help you to sleep.

85
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,780
I'm sorry, Mother-in-law. I'll be your drinking buddy next time.

86
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:23,620
Hurry and wash up you need to go early tomorrow as well.

87
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,290
Yeah. Good night.

88
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:30,740
Son-in-law Choi, sleep well.

89
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:38,110
When he smiles like that, he looks like a child.

90
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:42,660
But it isn't good for a person to be too nice.

91
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,810
It's a problem because he's too kind.

92
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,770
Why is it a big issue? I married him because I liked that.

93
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:51,690
That's a good thing. Since we never had to fight over a guy.

94
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:56,240
I find bad men to be attractive.

95
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,570
Of course you would.

96
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:10,720

97
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,760
What exactly is your identity, Na Bong Seon?

98
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:56,170
Hurry, hurry! Sous Chef is so hungry he could die! Hurry, hurry!

99
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:00,470
Just wait! Even though we have to eat, for our Bong,

100
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:04,430
it's a historic day for her to hold the frying pan for the first time,

101
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,590
if you keep that up, it'll become dog food.

102
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:10,190
This isn't dog food. Just looking at the color, it looks marvelous.

103
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:13,190
Bong Bong, it looks like it will be good.

104
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,990
It's done. Please give me a bowl.

105
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,230
Bowl.

106
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,190
Hey, hey!

107
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,030
Let's just eat it like this.

108
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:23,310
Ah, it's all done.

109
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,550
I'll serve it for you. Just wait. Sous Chef, just a moment.

110
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,710
Bong, the Bong! It's not bad!

111
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,870
It's really good!

112
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:33,270
Still, however you look at it an assistant made it.

113
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,510
 It's hot, be careful.

114
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:44,490
A kitchen help should be able to pull off at least this much with her experience. It's edible.

115
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:49,950
It tastes very good. And the seasoning is just right. Oh, you've made it now, Na Bong Seon.

116
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:55,430
Chef, with leftover meat and cherry peppers,

117
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,850
she made bulgogi pasta, try it. It's really good.

118
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,630
Really?

119
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:14,810
It's good. And the noodles are cooked just right.

120
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:24,890
Today I have to go out for a magazine interview. Min Soo, take charge of the dinner.

121
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:29,630
I'm sorry. I don't like leaving the restaurant for things like this.

122
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,750
But the editor is a friend of mine.

123
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,650
Don't worry, I'll take care of everything.

124
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:40,210
But I would be honored if you would mention me a little during your interview.

125
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:43,490
-No, no, I don't want to at all. Na Bong Seon.
-Yes?

126
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:44,630
You come with me.

127
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,530
Me?

128
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:49,310
Because they're doing Chef to Chef with the assistants, too. Thanks for the help.

129
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,870
Yes, Chef!

130
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:51,810
I'll be back.

131
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:54,450
See you later, Bong.

132
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,350
Hey!

133
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,570
Give some here!

134
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,450
Chef, what do I have to do there?

135
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,670
-It's a lie.
-What?

136
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:09,630
It's lonely if I go alone. You can assist with the makeup.

137
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:13,870
You completely fooled me! I thought I was getting interviewed.

138
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,910
Why would they interview you? You still have a long way to go.

139
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:23,430
But that pasta was pretty edible. You've improved a lot.

140
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:26,910
I surprised myself, too, after tasting it. It was so good.

141
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:31,090
For experience sake and to become familiar, beginning from tomorrow, start creating appetizers. I'll watch over you.

142
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:35,030
Appetizers? Deal! Appetizers are like chewing a gum for me

143
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:40,830
Again, again. You're goofing around. There's no middle ground with you. What's with gum chewing when it comes to meals.

144
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:45,210
Even if you're good at making bread, it tastes different based on the hands that make it. That's what cooking is.

145
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:49,790
Yes, yes. Modesty, and more modesty.

146
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:55,870
But are these the only clothes you have? You should wear something else to go out.

147
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,710
Why are we here? Are you going to buy me some clothes?

148
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:02,310
Did we come to go window shopping? You're so embarrassing to take out.

149
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:06,290
I like it. I like it so much!

150
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,050
 No?

151
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,690
 No.

152
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,770
Doesn't it look intellectual? No?

153
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,090
 How about this?

154
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,390
 Okay?

155
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:02,010
 Nice!

156
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,630
All these.

157
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,090
 Do you like it?

158
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:10,030
 Yes! So, so, very much!

159
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,810
 Wear them well.

160
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,790
 Yes!

161
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,990
Let's go quickly!

162
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,630
What?

163
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,250
I have to try some clothes on!

164
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,110
Hello.

165
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:28,290
There are so many pretty clothes!

166
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,650
Give me this entire thing.

167
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:31,050
What size would you like?

168
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:34,210
Size? Size? Where are you?

169
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:38,170
-Yes?
-Yeah, her. What is your size?

170
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:47,310
It looked good on the mannequin though. But it isn't long nor is it short. It isn't so great.

171
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:50,070
How can you buy something without even trying it on?

172
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:53,760
It's fine. I don't have time and to go through trying it on, I can't stand that kind of shopping.

173
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,250
It looks much better than that Sun's tee shirt. Let's go, Bong.

174
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,650
Yes.

175
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:05,750
Good shot. Yes.

176
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,070
Oh, it's so cool. Our chef.

177
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:11,470
Can we touch up your makeup?

178
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,630
You look cool.

179
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,690
You're pretty.

180
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:25,490
Should I change poses?

181
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:31,870
Yes.

182
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:37,670
Then, this is my last question. For all your female fans who want to take care of the hot star chef.

183
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,730
What is your ideal type?

184
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:46,650
Oh, my ideal type? Let's see.

185
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:51,470
First of all, I'd like to be able to cook with her. And also,

186
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:55,690
someone who knows how to respect her elders.

187
00:16:55,690 --> 00:17:01,790
You know the cute, dainty type, one that looks like a puppy?

188
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:05,710
And not being provocative would be good.

189
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:09,130
It's an expression that's used a lot lately - a night owl...one who is more energetic during the night but  weak during the day.

190
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:14,370
And I like eyes that are like the half moon.

191
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:19,050
Are you talking about someone like your assistant whom you brought today?

192
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:25,770
Aren't her eyes more like a weasel's eyes?

193
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:29,110
And also, she is a bit sexy.

194
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,750
That's somewhat ambiguous.

195
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:36,250
What? You were rejected?

196
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:40,590
Yes, basically. Seon Woo said I'm nothing more than a friend.

197
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,810
Oh my. He's crazy.

198
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:47,270
There's nothing wrong with you. No matter how I look at it,

199
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:51,770
it would be harder to be just friends with you. Is there something wrong with him?

200
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,990
Right? He really doesn't have an eye for women, does he?

201
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:59,010
So then there is no room for improvement?

202
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,950
Never.

203
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:06,490
Professor, thank you for looking so favorably on me.

204
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:12,270
But I don't want things to be uncomfortable with Seon Woo. I just want to remain good friends with him.

205
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:16,970
Where else is he going to meet such a cool woman like you?

206
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:24,100
Did he bring anything else up? Like another woman,

207
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,790
Excuse me?

208
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:28,090
Nothing. I'm talking nonsense.

209
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:38,650
 Sorry We Are
CLOSED

210
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:48,390
Seriously, you're like a ticking bomb.

211
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:52,310
What if the reporter had caught on? How could you talk about half moon-shaped eyes?

212
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,290
Everyone can see mine are half moon-shaped.

213
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:57,610
It's my decision. Let her catch on.

214
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:01,390
Yes, what else can you do?

215
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,250
Go on inside.

216
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,390
You worked hard today, taking care of my makeup.

217
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:10,210
Yes, you worked hard, too. Thank you for the clothes.

218
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,670
Go inside.

219
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:17,210
You have to let go of my hand for me to go in.

220
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:22,390
Ah, this hand, so I was holding this hand. I should have let go of this hand for you to go in.

221
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:25,510
I should let go, so you can go inside.

222
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,510
Go on in, Chef.

223
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,950
Good night.

224
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,330
The clothes look pretty.

225
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:38,290
Ah, it's cold!

226
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,750
What is it?

227
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,750
Ah!

228
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,850
What is it?

229
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:44,950
This is ... water...

230
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,950
The rain is leaking.

231
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,370
What is this?

232
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:50,970
Oh, it's flooded.

233
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:53,190
My goodness.

234
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:57,350
The blanket is all wet. What am I to do?

235
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:01,570
I'll have to call someone to fix it. I should have done the repair work. It's all wet.

236
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,950
This won't do. You'll have to sleep  in my room tonight.

237
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,150
In your room?

238
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:14,210
Then, are you going to sleep here while doing the backstroke?

239
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,730
Do you have any clothes?

240
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,850
What?

241
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:42,490
Good. It looks sort of like a sack but it's not bad. Just think of it as pajamas.

242
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:47,490
But, Chef, maybe I'll sleep downstairs in the hall. I think I might snore.

243
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:51,670
It's fine. I won't be able to sleep if I let you sleep on that hard chair.

244
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:56,150
You can sleep here, I'll sleep on the floor.

245
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:03,070
And if you're expecting something, stop dreaming. Because I'm tired today.

246
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:07,950
Expecting? Who said I was expecting anything, Chef?

247
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:22,190
 Why does the mood keep going there? Why do we have to share a room today?

248
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:27,670
 I can't go up yet. I want to stay beside him a little longer.

249
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,560
- Should we just go to sleep? 
 - I think so..

250
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,180
We have to work tomorrow.

251
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,650
Should we turn it off?

252
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:53,160
I think we should turn it off. Yes.

253
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,480
I should go wash up.

254
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,720
I should act like I'm sleeping.

255
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,920
Aren't you washing up?

256
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,680
Yes, Chef. I don't usually wash up, so good night.

257
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,470
Good night.

258
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:32,410
Are you okay? Wait. Oh, no!

259
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,230
Are you okay? Oh no!

260
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,750
-Oh!
-I'm okay.

261
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:40,710
Oh, Chef! It was dark and something suddenly came in and it scared me. Are you okay?

262
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,210
I'm sorry.

263
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:47,210
What are you? Seriously.

264
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:51,070
When was it that you flustered me by coming at me, I can't believe this.

265
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:56,540
Yes, this is unbelievable, isn't it? I can 100% understand how you feel.

266
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,460
But I changed my mind. You said it last time, didn't you?

267
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,150
To go slowly. When I thought about it, it was 100% right.

268
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:09,130
Relationship shouldn't be without progress...that process...

269
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:10,870
Back then, that...

270
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:13,790
Oh, yeah, that's what I was talking about.

271
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:17,030
Yes, that's what I was saying.

272
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:20,170
Now you understand it. The situation now,

273
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:23,630
since it turned out like this,

274
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,790
I just wanted to make sure you weren't expecting anything. I'm not in any rush either.

275
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:29,920
I'm really sorry, because it startled me.

276
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,770
Was that it?

277
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:36,990
You've grown up, Na Bong Seon.

278
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:42,430
My goodness, so that was it. Go to sleep.

279
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:44,650
What can I say?

280
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,510
-Thank you, Chef.
-Go to sleep tonight.

281
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:50,290
Yes, sleep well, Chef.

282
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:08,210
At one point she came after me as if she'd die immediately by not doing it.

283
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:10,670
Now she wants to go slowly?

284
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:13,990
It's not like we're playing around.

285
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:17,930
What? Is this a push-pull game?

286
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:21,410
It's making me mad thinking about it.

287
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:33,530
Oh? You're here?

288
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:37,380
Hi! Good-looking young man. What was your name again?

289
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,060
- Jing? 
 - No, it's Joon. Seo Joon.

290
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:43,190
That's right, Joon.

291
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:48,830
Your mask is one that kids now days really like. Cocker Spaniel kind.

292
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:54,310
I'm not saying you're like a dog.

293
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:59,150
It's just a shame that I wasn't a few years younger.

294
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:09,760
-What brings you here at this hour?
-I was in the area,

295
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,590
is that Bong Sook girl here?

296
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:14,120
Mom, it isn't Bong Sook, it's Bong Seon, I told you.

297
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,690
Whatever.

298
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,630
You're here?

299
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:20,540
It's been a long time.

300
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:24,080
Would you see me for a moment?

301
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,770
Excuse me? Me?

302
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:35,910
Ah! For what reason,...

303
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,810
Here.

304
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:42,830
Oh, what is this, Mother?

305
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:48,290
Mother? It's a little awkward to hear that.

306
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:53,850
Just take this for now. I made an effort so it shouldn't disappoint you.

307
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:58,210
Oh, I think you must be misunderstanding something.

308
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:00,880
I'm not that kind of person. I can't accept this.

309
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,930
Just open it, I said.

310
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:06,970
To go through such trouble. You didn't have to do this. Oh my?

311
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:09,940
What is this?

312
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,930
He's an assistant in my field. He's 32.

313
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:18,190
He's well-liked and smart and has a good personality. And both his parents have passed away.

314
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:24,350
If he has a small flaw, it's that he has four sisters. But what's wrong with that, they aren't parents-in-law.

315
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:27,530
What do you think? Will you meet him?

316
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:29,410
Me?

317
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:32,970
He's very smart and decent. I can guarantee that.

318
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:38,190
But four sisters-in-law are better than a mother-in-law like me.

319
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:42,830
I'm young and I had a lot of oriental tonics, so I won't die easily.

320
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:47,050
Even worse, I'm not mature. Are you confident to handle an immature mother-in-law who'll live a long life?

321
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:49,760
-So,...
-Mom, what are you doing?

322
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,530
Chef!

323
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:56,290
This, uh,...

324
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:02,410
Go inside. Mom, come here.

325
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:05,160
Bong Seon! Bong Seon, call me whenever you think about it.

326
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,720
-I'll set it up right away!
-Hurry up and come here!

327
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,660
It hurts! It hurts!

328
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,970
Why are you doing useless things? Don't come if you're going to do that!

329
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:15,450
Watch how you speak!

330
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:19,810
Why else would I go this far? That Bong Sook is said to be dead already.

331
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,590
Fated to die young, do you know what that means?

332
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:24,330
Seon, it's Seon. Not Bong Sook, but Bong Seon!

333
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:27,480
-Sook or Seon, whatever!
-I'll take care of it!

334
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,920
Bye, Professor! Seriously!

335
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,510
That rude kid!

336
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:39,430
Do I have to find someone even younger for him?

337
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:42,920
How do I find someone younger than her?

338
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:47,650
What are you doing?

339
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:51,780
Dong Cheol, I'll do that. Put the potatoes for tonight's side into the oven for me.

340
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,590
Yes, Chef.

341
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,730
Ji Woong, eat it.

342
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:02,940
Ji Woong, it's so tasty.

343
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:08,030
Chef, the garlic! It's all burned!

344
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:12,230
Are you okay?

345
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:14,100
Yes, I'm okay.

346
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,520
I'm sorry. I didn't see you.

347
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:24,890
These are stained. Seriously.

348
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,730
Oh my! Did you get burned?

349
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:41,710
No.

350
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:45,130
I think you did, let me see.

351
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:50,560
You did get burned. Is it when you bumped into Chef earlier?

352
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,430
What are you going to do?

353
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:55,240
It's okay. Once I cool it down with ice, it will feel better.

354
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:00,050
It looks like it would sting. You should have told him earlier, so you could see a doctor.

355
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:03,890
It's fine, it isn't a big deal.

356
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,950
Never mind me.

357
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:07,910
Give it here.

358
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:12,450
Oh, I bet it hurts.

359
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:16,300
Whip it to get the foam.

360
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,010
Yes, Chef.

361
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,100
What?

362
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,940
-Add some salt here.
-Yes, Chef.

363
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,590
Of course it hurts. Do you like to just endure or are you a fool?

364
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:39,070
Neither of those. I'm just being smart.

365
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:44,290
Ah, yes. Go see a doctor tomorrow and don't suffer needlessly.

366
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:46,750
I'll take care of it.

367
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:50,370
You better not tell the Chef. He'll feel bad.

368
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:54,910
From what I can see, you're just chef's fan.

369
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:57,470
What's so great about the Chef?

370
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:02,450
He has a big heart. Unlike other chefs who just care about their image.

371
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:07,490
You don't know do you? Chef went backpacking all over the world, and

372
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:11,650
he even ate food from the garbage along the streets and mastered through practical experience.

373
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:15,940
Paid the full tuition for The Culinary Institute of America, but didn't attend.

374
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,300
Is that so? Is that cool?

375
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:21,960
Of course it is. But,

376
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,070
is your friend getting along with her boyfriend?

377
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,690
My friend? Which friend?

378
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:28,830
The friend you told me about at the chicken restaurant.

379
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:34,610
Yeah, so-so. But, I guess now he's being more forward, so I guess that's a big concern.

380
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:36,940
Really? How interesting.

381
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:40,990
Wait, wait. I'll put a little more on this side.

382
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:43,870
It will scar.

383
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,670
It's good enough.

384
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,660
I think you've used up half of it already.

385
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:52,140
I'll just put a little bit here.

386
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:55,290
- Does it sting? 
 - Ah!

387
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,110
Go easy on me. Easy now.

388
00:31:57,110 --> 00:32:02,090
You whine more than I'd expect.

389
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:06,710
I'm going very gently on you.

390
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:09,090
Hey, that's enough. Stop now.

391
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:12,210
Just wait a little longer.

392
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:17,190
What are you guys doing?

393
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:19,610
-I had something to discuss with Na Bong.
-Discuss what?

394
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:22,210
Something like consultation on things that worries us.

395
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:24,670
Advice on worries?

396
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:27,450
I'll get going first then.

397
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,590
Wait.

398
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:33,050
Since when did you get close enough to him to discuss his concerns?

399
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:37,590
Was it last week? Or the week before? I'll get going.

400
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:40,310
Hey, I'm not doing speaking...

401
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:44,070
I can't believe this.

402
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:48,850
Meanwhile she was making up a ridiculous excuse to draw a line with me. What's with her?

403
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:53,670
Do you discuss concerns by going *grunt* and *groan*?

404
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:57,170
Hey, go get a popsicle from the freezer for yourselves.

405
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:02,350
We've been in the scorching heat since the morning, so at least eat one of these. It's so hot, I'm going to die.

406
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:06,350
Popsicle, seriously.

407
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:08,910
-It will be yummy!
-There's only one though.
-What?

408
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:11,450
What are you saying? Hey, I...

409
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:15,470
- I bought just enough for everyone. 
 - There are none.

410
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:18,510
Sous Chef, that's your second one, isn't it?

411
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:21,410
I don't remember.

412
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:26,150
Hey, it is your second! I saw some in there earlier. You're like Jaws!

413
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:31,650
What? A Sous Chef is entitled to eat two. Did I eat three of them? Or four?

414
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:35,090
-You licked the whole thing!
 -I'm fine. You eat it.

415
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:37,090
 No, I'm fine.

416
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:40,890
It's okay. I don't like them that much.

417
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:44,770
Hey, these two seriously!

418
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:49,250
What? What is it? Are the two of you melancholy or what?

419
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:53,590
Hey, Seo Joon, did you change your image to a romantic?

420
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:56,730
Were you always like that or is it just for Bong Seon?

421
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:00,830
Now that I look at them, Joon and Bong look good together.

422
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,810
Do we?

423
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:04,570
Did you come to play?!!

424
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:10,570
Did you come to play? Aren't you going to wipe up this oil? Did you verify the number of reservations for today?

425
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:13,410
Do I have to curse you out to understand? Get moving.

426
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:16,370
Yes, Chef.

427
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:22,460
Eating ice cream by themselves.

428
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,740
Is it because we didn't give him any ice cream?

429
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,040
I think so.

430
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,360
 Come In. We are 
 OPEN

431
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:33,800
3T, one escargot, two specials. 7T, one salmon salad, two Shrek.

432
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,440
9T, one beef tenderloin steak, two jjamppong (spicy seafood noodle soup).

433
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,840
- Got it. 
 - Dong Cheol, finish up the salad. Min Soo will cover.

434
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,260
I'll do the escargots, so Ji Woong, you serve.

435
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,260
Yes, Chef!

436
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:50,900
Hey, Joon. Is this all the oil we have?

437
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,260
Yes, I'll go get some.

438
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:56,300
No, I'll get it.

439
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,800
Chef!

440
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,680
What?

441
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,720
Look at me when you're talking, huh? Are you mad at me?

442
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:25,020
-No.
-I mean, I think you are. Why?

443
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,620
Is it because of yesterday?

444
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,840
Yeah, I'm mad, why?

445
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,080
 I'm mad.  What are you?

446
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,860
Since it came up, what are you? Are you playing push-pull games?

447
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:40,280
-No.
-Is it because you've already caught the big fish?

448
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:46,800
Saying you wanted to go slowly, brandishing a Eunjangdo (an ornamental silver knife). You were having quite fun with Joon earlier.

449
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,040
-What?
-Are you going to two-time?

450
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:53,260
Joon is pretty good. He's good-looking and talented.

451
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:57,020
Ay? Are you being jealous now?

452
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:00,700
Jealous? What? Hey,

453
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:06,740
I'm Kang Seon Woo. You're Na Bong Seon and I'm Kang Seon Woo. Kang Seon Woo.

454
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,520
Because I was a little good to you, now you don't see a thing, do you?

455
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,040
Chef, I think you're misunderstanding something.

456
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,760
What misunderstanding? Tell me.

457
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,880
But, I promised I wouldn't say anything, so...

458
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,840
Promise? Now you're coming right out and

459
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:26,360
Never mind, it's annoying. This is a waste, just forget it then.

460
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,620
Why are you being this way over such a trivial thing as this?

461
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:32,380
-Just do your work.
-Wait, wait, Chef!

462
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:41,220
Chef! What is this? Seriously! Of all things. Getting jealous?

463
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:45,320
I can't say anything because I promised Joon.

464
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:48,220
I'm in a sticky situation. Seriously!

465
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,780
Chef...

466
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,360
She just left.

467
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,740
She just left.

468
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,140
Sous Chef, have some water.

469
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,560
Hey, hey!

470
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,960
Who cleaned these?

471
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,560
-I cleaned them.
-Did you clean them with your feet?

472
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,280
-What?
-Don't you see the sand?

473
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,380
Where?

474
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:34,780
Don't you see the sand between the shells?

475
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:38,740
I don't see anything. Isn't this good enough?

476
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:43,220
Good enough? Who told you to make that decision?

477
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:48,400
If a customer loses a tooth biting one of these, are you going to pay for the implant?

478
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,660
Seriously.

479
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,960
Do you think I'm just uselessl trying to find fault? I'm not.

480
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:00,040
This is why you're a kitchen help. During the summer, cleanliness of food ingredients is most important.

481
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,440
What have you learned until now?

482
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:07,260
Hey, these can't go out, so change the dinner special to shrimp pasta.

483
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,360
-Min Soo,
-Yes?

484
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,960
Tell Na Bong to buy 5kg of shrimp.

485
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:16,160
Chef says for me to tell you to go buy 5kg of shrimp at the market.

486
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,120
Yes, yes! I'm going. I heard him!

487
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,800
Yes, yes, I heard it, too.

488
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,120
They look clean to me.

489
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:32,460
It's one thing to be mad, but to be petty and try to find fault?

490
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:38,720
Anyway, in a social status setting, whether their behavior is right or not, men are childish.

491
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,660
Although they're kind of cute in that way, too.

492
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,740
Ahjussi!

493
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,420
Oh! Welcome.

494
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:52,280
No, no, continue with your call. I just stopped by for a moment.

495
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:57,620
No. It's a call that won't go through anyway.

496
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,120
Pardon?

497
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,640
It's my late daughter.

498
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:07,920
I do this whenever I think of her.

499
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:17,020
It might sound crazy, but sometimes I feel like she'll pop out and answer saying, "Dad, it's me!"

500
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:21,500
You must not have terminated your daughter's cell phone yet.

501
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,360
I can't get myself to do that.

502
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:29,680
Even though the cell phone is missing and gone.

503
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,020
Her cell phone is missing?

504
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:38,200
Then, was it an accident?

505
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,160
No.

506
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:46,180
I don't know what was so difficult that she wanted to die,

507
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:53,260
she just decided to leave this world.

508
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,260
You're saying it was suicide?

509
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:09,220
Look at me. I should offer you a juice. Oh, we just ran out.

510
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,500
I'll go get some right away. Sit here.

511
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,520
Ah, no, it's okay.

512
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,640
I also want to drink too. Sit here, I'll be right back.

513
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,000
Suicide?

514
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,720
Me?

515
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:36,560
Why in the world would I?

516
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:38,260
 Father, what should we do next Sunday? It's your birthday.

517
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:42,200
 What birthday? Who doesn't have a birthday?

518
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:47,060
 But still, it's your 60th, we should do something. Won't you feel upset if we don't?

519
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:50,600
 It's fine, it's fine. Don't think about spending money unnecessarily.

520
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:56,460
 I suppose, to go out and eat costs money. To invite your friends and have a party is even more money.

521
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:59,040
 This way or that way, it's all money.

522
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,660
 I'll buy a cake and some candles.

523
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:07,300
 That's not necessary either, kid. We can make seaweed soup in the morning.

524
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:17,560
 Is this Star Travel Agency? I wanted to confirm my travel package.

525
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:21,780
 It's for three people. Shin Myeong Ho, Shin Soon Ae, Shin Gyeong Mo.

526
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:27,250
That's right. I made travel arrangements without him knowing because it was his 60th birthday.

527
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:32,520
But the week before that, I committed suicide?

528
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,540
Hi, Na Bong Seon!

529
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:43,100
Ahjussi, I have to get going.

530
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,190
Why? Have some juice before you go.

531
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:48,660
Something urgent came up. I'll stop by again later.

532
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,600
Okay, bye!

533
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:55,720
What is it? She left because I came?

534
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:00,260
Gyeong Mo, I don't think you're the one for her. In my opinion.

535
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:06,630
Right? Don't you think so? She had fallen for me though.

536
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:11,140
It's that lazy neighborhood chef. That guy intercepted her.

537
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:14,450
Who? That restaurant owner?

538
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:17,950
-Is it?
-Can't you tell?

539
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:22,020
Didn't you see the way he looked at her when they were here fixing the hose?

540
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:27,780
I'm right. He probably approached her with money. That bad jerk.

541
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:50,920
Hello? This is Na Bong Seon.

542
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:56,280
Yes, where are you? I have something to ask you.

543
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,120
Here.

544
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,620
Yes, thank you.

545
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:04,240
Well...

546
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:10,940
Tell me. You said you had something to tell me.

547
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:13,690
Yes, that's...

548
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:15,620
This.

549
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,020
What is this?

550
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:23,120
Do you know who Shin Soon Ae is?

551
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,290
Yes. That restaurant.

552
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:32,950
Yes, the late daughter of that family. This is Shin Soon Ae's diary.

553
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:38,060
But why do you have this?

554
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:43,060
Ah, I knew her before. So,

555
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:47,520
we went to cooking class together. We were close.

556
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:52,160
But I didn't know she had committed suicide. And I didn't know we lived in the same neighborhood.

557
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:58,880
Recently, I found out she was his daughter and I happened to see this. But would you look at this?

558
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:04,520
Here. This is travel tickets dated for September.

559
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:09,180
If you look here, it says it was her dad's birthday in September.

560
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:15,560
Someone preparing for a family trip commits suicide, isn't that strange? Was it suicide for sure?

561
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:19,120
Is there no possibility of it being an accident or murder?

562
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,700
No.

563
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:27,520
From what I remember, before she died she texted ajussi in the context a suicide note.

564
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,760
All the circumstances and signs point in that direction.

565
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:34,540
I believe it was certain to be suicide.

566
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:38,660
Really?

567
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:46,120
Why would she do that? From what I know, she had no reason to.

568
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:51,260
I'm not sure. Depression

569
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:55,100
isn't something you can easily admit to others.

570
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:01,920
I'll check the records again. If there is anything questionable.

571
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,800
Yes, thank you for this favor.

572
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,660
I'll hold on to this.

573
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:14,080
To see if there's any notable item.

574
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:18,240
Yes, then please do. Would you look at this as well?

575
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,740
Yes.

576
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:25,690
When did you do this? It looks pretty recent.

577
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:28,960
Was it when you and Chef collided?

578
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,270
That must be. Oh man, it must really hurt.

579
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:36,920
-It's okay. I put ointment on it, so it's going down.
-What do you mean? It looks pretty severe.

580
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:43,320
That Chef, he's always shouting at everyone to be careful with the knives and fire.

581
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:47,340
Instead of a bonus, he gives you this burn. What a picture, geez. 
  (Homonyms: 화상(火傷)=burn. 화상(畫像)=image,picture)

582
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:50,910
Hey, Joon.

583
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:52,210
Yes, Chef?

584
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:54,830
Is your back okay?

585
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:57,390
Is your back okay?

586
00:46:57,390 --> 00:46:59,430
Ah, yes. It's okay. It isn't anything big.

587
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:01,070
Let me see.

588
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:07,790
Hey, it's a bad burn. If it hurts, you should have said something. Do you need to see a doctor?

589
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:10,610
I'm okay. I think it'll be fine, if I keep putting on ointment.

590
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:13,310
I'm sorry, in any case.

591
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:20,320
Do you have anything else to say?

592
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,830
Earlier,

593
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:29,070
when you were in the storage with Bong Seon. Was Bong Seon putting ointment on for you?

594
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:36,050
Ah, yes. That's right. I told her not to tell you in case you would worry.

595
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:41,510
Then,

596
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:47,730
He's smiling.

597
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:52,570
What a fool.

598
00:47:58,070 --> 00:48:02,770
Why are you getting here so late? Did you make the shrimp?

599
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:04,730
Yes, a little.

600
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:13,710
She's mad. She's mad. She's scary mad. Seriously, why couldn't I let it go?

601
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:20,750
What do I do to get her over it? I'm going to go crazy.

602
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:33,710
I just can't understand. Why in the world?

603
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:39,470
Hey, Na Bong Seon, I'll be right back.

604
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:42,350
-Where to?
-I have to look into something.

605
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:46,650
I washed the dishes and put them away. I'll be back.

606
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,470
Organize the storage room while it's cool!

607
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:57,370
Yes, Chef!

608
00:48:57,370 --> 00:49:01,450
Soak the vegetables in water in advance.

609
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:03,950
Devein and unshell the shrimp nicely. We're going to make soup with them.

610
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:08,750
We're making soup so check on the dough one more time. We should use rosemary.

611
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:11,510
Min Soo, you...hey,

612
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:17,930
And while it's cool, organize things. It's a pigpen, a pigpen. Is this how you work?

613
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:20,150
No, Chef.

614
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:26,410
 Was it suicide for sure? Is there no possibility of it being an accident or murder?

615
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:39,390
Let's see, let's see, let's see. The husband is suspicious.

616
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:43,150
Is he supporting two houses or three houses?

617
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:45,190
Do you see something?

618
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:48,970
That's right. There's a woman, isn't there?

619
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:57,390
Oh my gosh. Did this girl not leave yet?

620
00:49:57,390 --> 00:50:00,570
-What? What girl?
-Oh my!

621
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:03,930
What happened to you? Why are you here?

622
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:08,910
-Me?
-No, I wasn't talking to you ladies.

623
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:11,270
I have something to ask you.

624
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:15,770
-Later, girl. I have my first customer in a long time.
-It's urgent.

625
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:19,970
We'll come back again later.

626
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:23,710
Leave that here. Ladies!

627
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:30,730
What amazing timing. Why are you still here? What happened to your overnight?

628
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:36,750
That isn't important now, Unni. He said I took my own life.

629
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:39,310
What? You did really?

630
00:50:39,310 --> 00:50:42,310
But no matter how I think about it, there was no reason to.

631
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:46,950
Unni, does someone who commits suicide wanders the netherworld as a ghost? I don't think I've ever seen one.

632
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:50,290
There are. It's just that there aren't many.

633
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:55,530
Even if they committed suicide, it's possible there're life's deep regrets and resentments.

634
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:58,550
Do you still not remember you dying?

635
00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:03,210
No. But it's too strange.

636
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:06,230
Why would I? Why in the world would I have done that?

637
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:12,310
I'm sure you had your reasons. But hurry up and go up.

638
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:15,500
While you're on aesthetically pleasing walks and in a blink your three years will be up,

639
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:18,970
then you'll become that evil spirit that keeps psycho criminals silent.

640
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:23,850
I know, I know! Who says I won't return.

641
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:27,670
But knowing made things so complicated.

642
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:58,250
 No lesson today. Clean up and go up.

643
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:02,430
Oh, why?

644
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:06,890
I wanted to get a lesson from Chef since it's been so long.

645
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:18,850
It's too bad.

646
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:24,870
-I forgive you, Na Bong Seon!
-Chef.

647
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:27,740
-I forgive you.
-What?

648
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:30,500
It's true I was mad because of you.

649
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,330
But, at some point,

650
00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:35,820
we grew closer by fighting, and since you can't live without me,

651
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:38,360
I'll generously forgive you.

652
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:42,060
I can't stand flowers like this that you can't even eat, geez.

653
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:45,290
But I'm doing even these kinds of things because of you, so here.

654
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:46,770
Okay.

655
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:51,790
Since you accepted them, I'll take it that we've made up. Next,

656
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:57,170
I don't do this kind of thing.

657
00:52:57,170 --> 00:53:00,410
I can't stand these "couple" things.

658
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:04,350
This is mine. And for you, the boys

659
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:08,330
might see and be shocked.

660
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:12,410
So I put it on this necklace.

661
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,140
There.

662
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:21,810
It's pretty. As expected, I've taste.

663
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:28,460
There you go liking it since you're a girl.

664
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:37,070
Seriously.

665
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:39,870
How did I turn out like this?

666
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:45,600
I'm going crazy because of you, Na Bong Seon.

667
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:55,570
I don't know what's what? I can't remember anything.

668
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:03,140
I should go see Chef's face to cheer up.

669
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:07,980
 Na Bong Seon,

670
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:09,820
 Yes, Chef.

671
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:14,800
I won't get the wrong idea ever again.

672
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:26,040
I think I like you a lot more than I realized.

673
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:29,620
Me, too, Chef.

674
00:54:55,430 --> 00:55:00,500
Na Bong Seon! Are you okay? What happened?

675
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,400
Ah, there...

676
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,420
What is it? Are you all right?

677
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:07,560
Yes,...

678
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:10,250
Yes.

679
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,040
Are you really okay?

680
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,900
Yes, my leg gave way.

681
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,580
Ah, you scared me.

682
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:23,160
You scared me when you collapsed like that. Let me see.

683
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:32,050
I must be crazy. What did I do?

684
00:55:34,450 --> 00:55:36,730
No, no.

685
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:50,410
 But the evil spirits are different.

686
00:55:50,410 --> 00:55:54,510
 It's completely different than when you possess people.

687
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:58,670
 It never ceases. It stays by a person with shady character and

688
00:55:58,670 --> 00:56:02,390
  wanders around inducing wickedness.

689
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:11,580
 Na Bong Seon, thank you for this whole time.

690
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:15,350
 I'm sorry I couldn't say bye before leaving.

691
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:18,910
 But I can't be in your body any longer.

692
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:21,670
 My heart keeps getting deeper,

693
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:25,010
  and I'm afraid I'll want to stay by his side.

694
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:28,590
 I'm afraid I won't be able to keep the promise I made to you.

695
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:33,670
 Things will turn out well for you and him even without me.

696
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:37,810
 I sincerely wish for you to be happy.

697
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:41,270
 The last thing I want to say to you,

698
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:45,010
 is to love the best you can while you're alive.

699
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:48,610
 Yourself and others.

700
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:04,270
 She grew to like Chef?

701
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:30,830
Why would I dream such a weird dream?

702
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:35,930
What is it?

703
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:39,870
Who are you barking at, Stalker?

704
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:51,710
What is it?

705
00:58:56,570 --> 00:58:59,970
Where did she go? At this early morning?

706
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:04,770
What is it?

707
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:09,690
What do I do now?

708
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:19,710
Yes, Chef.

709
00:59:19,710 --> 00:59:23,870
 Where are you? Where did you go at this hour leaving the door open?

710
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:27,510
Ah, I had something to do out front here.

711
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:31,370
 You're crazy. What time is it now that you fearlessly go out?

712
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:36,870
 What if you trip while walking in the dark with your head down like that?

713
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:40,170
What? Do you see me?

714
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:51,770

715
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:03,950
 I can't give up now.

716
01:00:03,950 --> 01:00:08,010
 Chef is telling me to come. He's waiting for me because he's worried.

717
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:13,870
 I like him so much. What it took to win his heart.

718
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:19,130
 I'm going to think only about myself. Just this once.

719
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:24,770
 I'm going to guard it no matter what it takes, Chef's heart.

720
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:26,750
Na Bong! Where did you go?

721
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:35,730
What is it? Because of you, sleep is gone.

722
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:38,430
My goodness, this is trouble. Big trouble.

723
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:42,050
You're completely smitten with me.

724
01:00:42,050 --> 01:00:46,590
I suppose there is a part of me that makes it hard to break loose from once you've fallen for me.

725
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:47,970
I understand, so let go.

726
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:51,850
I don't want to. I don't want to separate myself from you.

727
01:00:51,850 --> 01:00:56,670
What is this in the intersection? Is this a manic episode?

728
01:00:56,670 --> 01:00:58,710
I mean,

729
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:02,370
when was it you wouldn't let me touch you?

730
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:05,970
It's your hobby to come and go.

731
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:11,090
♫  Oh, just stay near me.  ♫

732
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:15,070
♫   Stay right here.  ♫

733
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:21,990
♫  Don't leave me today.  ♫

734
01:01:21,990 --> 01:01:26,910
♫   Just stay.  ♫

735
01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:30,690
♫   My one and only.  ♫

736
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:38,010
♫   In the seat next to mine.  ♫

737
01:01:38,010 --> 01:01:41,470
♫   Please remain with me.  ♫

738
01:01:41,470 --> 01:01:43,490
 Preview

739
01:01:43,490 --> 01:01:45,970
 It's mine. Take care of your body.

740
01:01:45,970 --> 01:01:48,970
 Yes, Chef. I'll keep it in mind.

741
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:50,470
 See you later.

742
01:01:50,470 --> 01:01:53,830
 -I'll do the rite to heaven.
 -I'm not ready yet.

743
01:01:53,830 --> 01:01:56,470
 You have the skills. You can do it, can't you, Na Bong Seon?

744
01:01:56,470 --> 01:01:58,130
 -Hurry up and clean up.
-Yes, Sous Chef.

745
01:01:58,130 --> 01:01:59,710
 Bring me that battery box.

746
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:01,910
 I told you to stay seated.

747
01:02:01,910 --> 01:02:03,350
 We're dating.

748
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:06,490
 This mood is strange.

749
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:08,210
 I said I'm okay, why the fuss?

750
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:12,310
 He isn't the person I knew. He tried to kill Na Bong Seon.
