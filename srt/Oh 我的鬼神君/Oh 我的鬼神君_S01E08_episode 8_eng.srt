1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,950
 Oh My Ghostess

2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,000
 Park Bo Yeong

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,600
 Jo Jeong Seok

4
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,960
 Im Joo Hwan

5
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:29,080
 Kim Seul Gi

6
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,140
 Oh My Ghostess

7
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,860
What is it? It's Na Bong Seon.

8
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,480
Where did you go? I looked for you forever!

9
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,580
Me? You were looking for me?

10
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,170
You. I looked forever for you.

11
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,470
But why?

12
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:01,150
You told me to go. How long ago was it that you chased me out by setting a fire?

13
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:05,340
Why would puritanically stubborn Na Bong Seon come looking for me?

14
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,840
I'll permit you to come into my body.

15
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,090
I'm saying for you to possess me. Make Chef mine.

16
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,710
So, so what you mean is,

17
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:29,880
what you're saying is that you want me to possess your body, that you're giving me permission?

18
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,220
Is that what you are saying right now?

19
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,690
You girl!

20
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,560
You, seriously!

21
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,910
Good thinking! Good thinking, Na Bong Seon!

22
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,870
I love you!

23
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,270
You're so lovable! Let's get close now!

24
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,020
Call me Unni. Your unni!

25
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,170
That's our restaurant.

26
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,520
It's really close to our restaurant.

27
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,530
Yeah, it is.

28
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,030
That's my father.

29
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:16,940
My father, who is a good person with a lot of compassion, so he is always sustaining losses like a fool.

30
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,470
It might not look like that now, but it used to be quite a popular restaurant.

31
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:24,530
At lunchtime, taxis used to be lined up waiting.

32
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,200
Making sure to wake up at 2:00 to 3:00 in the morning to prepare.

33
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,430
I'd make the rice, and run deliveries.

34
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,940
I lived very busily.

35
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,500
If I had known I was going to die this early, I should have played as much as I wanted like others,

36
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,020
and had a lover. I should have lived like that.

37
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:45,390
But why did you die? May I ask you?

38
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,990
I don't know.

39
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,420
I don't remember dying.

40
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,730
I'm not sure if it's because I died so suddenly or what.

41
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,940
But, why did you suddenly change your mind?

42
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,190
Before, I was fine just looking at him.

43
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:07,730
That was then, but now I have a desire to have Chef.

44
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,490
Good job. You did well.

45
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,180
You should have some desires. And make some noise.

46
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,670
You should live like a person, Na Bong Seon.

47
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,360
-Let's do well.
-Let's do well.

48
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,080
Since it has come to this, it's the same as if we're one body.

49
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,930
Relieve my resentment, and until the day you gain your unrequited love, hermaphrodite united!

50
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,590
Hermaphrodite unite!

51
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,400
I...I don't think hermaphrodite is right.

52
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,940
Then, except for that. In any case, let's do this!

53
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,450
You, too. Let's remodel your personality, and unleash energy!

54
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,530
- Fighting! 
 - Fighting!

55
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,400
With more gusto, fighting!

56
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,720
- Fighting! 
  - Fighting!

57
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,210
That's so refreshing.

58
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,170
Let's do this!

59
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:14,790

60
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:21,320
 Episode 8

61
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,240
Did you sleep well, Chef?

62
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,010
So-so.

63
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,020
You must not have slept well.

64
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,670
You aged ten years overnight.

65
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:44,040
What ten years? It's because I haven't washed my face.

66
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,460
What?

67
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,110
Are you having a manic episode?

68
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,670
Maybe?

69
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,660
It's so confusing. I never know which cycle to expect.

70
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,260
Why do you have to bicker? Can't you just overlook things?

71
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,350
Chef, there's something I'm curious about.

72
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,950
I remember reading this in some magazine before.

73
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:09,270
It said that men have the most energy from 10:00 to 11:00 a.m., is it true?

74
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,380
-Hey, this girl, again!
-Oh my.

75
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,310
It must be true!

76
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:18,320
Hey, hey, hey. Go take your medicine. Quickly.

77
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,840
He's so cute when he's like that.

78
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,090
Chef, chef, chef!

79
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,480
He locked it again.

80
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,440
Chef!

81
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,570
What did you go and do now, Lee So Hyeong?

82
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,800
 Seon Woo

83
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,950
 So Hyeong

84
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:18,790
It's hot!! It's so hot!

85
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:22,190
I think pork belly can be cooked on my back.

86
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,860
This weather is going to kill me!

87
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,690
You just have to make it through today, since we're off starting tomorrow.

88
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,700
That's right, we're off starting tomorrow.

89
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:36,100
I'm suddenly getting the happy virus. Cordon, why are you so good looking?

90
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,830
Hey!

91
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,510
Did I touch it?

92
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,460
What are you doing during your break? Do you have plans?

93
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,910
I'm going fishing in the ocean with some friends.

94
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,220
Fishing.

95
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,680
Not fishing.

96
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,200
Hey, Ji Woong, what are you doing?

97
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,860
Oh me, well first,

98
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,480
I think I have to stop by to see my family, since it's been so long.

99
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,750
There's a water festival at Jangheung,

100
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,440
so for the first time in many years with friends

101
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,280
while having some makogli in a bowl; it seems it's been a while since I've seen my mother and father.

102
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,170
-Let's go together.
-What?

103
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,200
Got you! Just kidding.

104
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:19,390
I have to put up with you guys in this crowded kitchen, would I spend my break with you, too?

105
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,740
Hey!

106
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,260
Hey, Cordon? What are you doing during break?

107
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,810
I'm going to go wakeboarding somewhere nearby.

108
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:30,040
Wakeboarding somewhere nearby?

109
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,920
This punk,

110
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,120
Cordon even plays so differently from me. We don't match.

111
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,570
What break? We get a break, Sous Chef?

112
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:42,870
Why are you recklessly scratching the hind leg of an elephant?

113
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:46,530
Chef told us the day before yesterday, that we're off for two days.

114
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,470
Ah, that's right. Isn't it?

115
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,510
Two days starting tomorrow.

116
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:54,200
Move aside. Why are blocking the path?

117
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,950
Sorry.

118
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,020
She's getting strange again, isn't she?

119
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,290
Eat slowly, dear.

120
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,830
You can get indigestion even from porridge.

121
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:22,060
Is it because it's the special? There is plenty of abalone in it.

122
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:31,460
But why did you come for a sick visit? It isn't that bad.

123
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:36,030
But still, how can I sit still when a friend is sick?

124
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:44,800
But, even being sick, it's fortunate you still have an appetite.

125
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:49,470
I'm just eating it because of the care you put into bringing it.

126
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,610
No, no! There's no need to do that! You don't have to eat it if you don't want to.

127
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,880
It's okay.

128
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,050
I'll just eat it. It's okay.

129
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,210
Really? You're okay?

130
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,440
Yeah.

131
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,570
Then eat it.

132
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,770
You have to eat and get better quickly.

133
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,490
I'm dying of boredom.

134
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,960
Even more so since it's break.

135
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,520
I don't have anyone to eat with, or anyone to drink with.

136
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,180
You don't have any friends to eat or drink with?

137
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,590
Someone who's even a professor?

138
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:25,950
Because I got my doctorate when I was so young,

139
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:29,280
I never had much opportunity to meet women.

140
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:34,190
And also, women didn't like me.

141
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:40,220
Something about me flirting or whatever with the guys. Of course, that's all stories from the past.

142
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,950
Now even men gross me out.

143
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:48,160
That's right. When you get older, it isn't men, but friends you want.

144
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:56,280
But, dear. Why aren't you looking me in the eyes today?

145
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,590
Are you upset at me?

146
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:03,530
What? Why wouldn't I look at your eyes?

147
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:07,970
Your, about your son. Is there anything going on with him?

148
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:11,430
For example like he passed out from hypothermia~

149
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,400
Oh! Why? Why? Do you see something like that?

150
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,130
No, no.

151
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:18,760
I'm just asking because I was curious.

152
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:24,080
And here I thought. My heart.

153
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,010
Nothing is going on.

154
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:30,290
He's on vacation starting tomorrow, so I'll have to make sure he's careful around water.

155
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:34,370
Oh, really? He's on break?

156
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,090
3T's saffron and cream shrimp with Shrek go out?

157
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,710
Yes, it just went out, Chef!

158
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:42,770
Ok, then let's cut off taking orders and let's start cleaning up the kitchen in 10 mins.

159
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:45,100
Yes, Chef!

160
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,400
I'll go clean the hall.

161
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,650
Hyeong Jin. Hyeong Jin, Hyeong Jin. Hey, did you get the days off?

162
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:07,570
Ah, no, no, don't say that you can't.

163
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,100
You said you were going to talk to your boss.

164
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,490
Is it your fault that business isn't going well?

165
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:16,970
Ah, no, you can't. Ah!

166
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:20,390
Hey, hey, Hyeong Jin, buzz off.

167
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,390
He said he'd be able to.

168
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,730
I don't have a good feeling about this.

169
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,040
Let's avoid him for today.

170
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,290
Don't even make eye contact with him. Got it?

171
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,990
My plans are disappearing. Seriously.

172
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,150
You know, you guys...

173
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:44,000
Hey, where are the preserved tomatoes?

174
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,550
My stomach suddenly hurts.

175
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,460
Hey, is wakeboarding fun?

176
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,620
I said they are in the back!

177
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,200
Chef. Chef!

178
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,860
Do you have any plans for your days off?

179
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,820
No, I don't. Why?

180
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,420
As a rally for unity,

181
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,560
I was thinking if we were to go together on vacation.

182
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,190
I have lined up an awesome pension for it.

183
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,920
Unity rally?

184
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:23,320
That's because, Chef Marco's kids also went to Jeju Island on an MT.

185
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,330
When they came back, their hands and feet were all in unison, and the harmony at work was no joke.

186
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,290
Apparently, the incidents for scolding during work all disappeared.

187
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,410
Really?

188
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:37,180
What do you guys think?

189
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,400
Of course, we should go.

190
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,350
Well, if Chef says to go, we should go.

191
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,520
Then, to build Sun's team work and unity,

192
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:52,030
Chef is especially giving us the days off. Hey, Cordon!

193
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,420
What do you think about it?

194
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,190
Wakeboarding...

195
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,710
was what I had planned to do, but I'll try canceling it.

196
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:03,140
Since it's an MT we're all going together on.

197
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:08,670
Of course! For me, I'm in! I'm totally in! Let's go, okay?

198
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,380
Okay! Then we're going.

199
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,540
Plan what we're going to bring to eat.

200
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,980
Yes, Chef!

201
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,130
How long has it been since going on an MT?

202
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:23,170
- I'm going to enjoy myself.
- I'm going to have fun.

203
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,620
Me, too!

204
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,400
Oh, So Hyeong.

205
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,980
 Are you busy? It's almost closing time, right?

206
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,200
I'm in the middle of wrapping up now.

207
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,230
 Then see me for a moment. I'll go there.

208
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:43,040
Oh. Oh, okay.

209
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,060
Was it obvious?

210
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,080
Go while I'm saying it nicely.

211
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,340
Where are you going? To see PD Lee?

212
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,950
None of your business. Why does it concern you where I go? Go now.

213
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,660
I'm not though.

214
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,650
I'm not following you. I'm just going this way.

215
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,390
Where are you going?

216
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:31,580
I'm... over there... that Ahjussi's restaurant down there.

217
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,060
Then go. Go first, ahead of me.

218
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:37,420
Yes. You're really barking orders.

219
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,360
You're seriously...

220
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,900
So petty.

221
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,730
That, seriously, that manic stuff.

222
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,980
You're here?

223
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,890
I ordered two since I thought you'd be coming right away.

224
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,560
- Is grapefruit juice okay?
 - Yup. It's good.

225
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,850
The air conditioner is really strong here.

226
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:13,760
They should at least maintain a temperature of 20 °C.

227
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:19,190
Seon Woo, about yesterday.

228
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,020
I know, Kid.

229
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,210
You blacked out yesterday?

230
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:29,640
You were so wasted. Do you remember me taking you home?

231
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,710
I suppose, it looked like you were coming around by the time you got home.

232
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:38,990
How much did you drink?

233
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:41,450
I did drink kind of a lot yesterday.

234
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:46,080
But learn to drink in moderation. You'll make mistakes if you black out like that.

235
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,900
It's okay since I'm a friend, but you'll get slapped if it went anywhere else.

236
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,580
Be careful.

237
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:56,550
I know. I keep doing that lately.

238
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,470
Broadcasting ruined you.

239
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:07,740
You used to have good skin, but look how all the moisture has been sapped out..

240
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,260
Really? I should get some skin treatments then.

241
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,140
Thanks for telling me.

242
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,010
Be careful.

243
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:23,040
Let's get going. I'm going on an MT with my guys.

244
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,340
I have to go and pack.

245
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:29,370
Okay. I also have to go on an exploratory trip for Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving Day) special.

246
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,890
Okay, let's finish drinking and let's go.

247
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,580
Ahjussi!

248
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,190
My goodness! Come in.

249
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,270
Hey, why did you come again?

250
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,700
How long has it been since you ignored us.

251
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,950
Did you think the push-pull games weren't going to work on me? So you're here waving a white flag?

252
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,160
What are you talking about?

253
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:00,080
Ajussi, eat this, it's the one you like. The adzuki bean flavored hard pop.

254
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,800
Thank you.

255
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,150
Eat this.

256
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,390
-Have a seat.
-Yes.

257
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:09,450
But how did you know I like this?

258
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:13,350
You don't remember, do you? You told me last time.

259
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:16,860
Oh, did I?

260
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,930
But are you exercising regularly?

261
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:21,790
Of course. I went to the mineral springs this morning, too.

262
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,300
And if I have time, I go in the evenings, too.

263
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:28,900
Good job. I'm sorry I couldn't even keep my promise because of work.

264
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,770
And tomorrow I'm going on an MT with my work.

265
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,290
I think you'll have to exercise alone for the time being.

266
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,960
What? MT? Hey.

267
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,290
There are only guys there! You aren't sleeping with them, right?

268
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:44,940
Don't wear those pants that go up your butt, and spaghetti strapped shirt is a no, too.

269
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,260
What are you? Who are you to tell me what I can or can't do?

270
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,860
And don't go crazy because you're going away and put on all sorts of lipstick.

271
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,040
And make sure to wear sunblock.

272
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,630
Your skin is light so if you're not careful, you'll get sun burned.

273
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:00,710
What's with the nagging? You're strange.

274
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:04,900
And call me before you go to sleep. I'll be worried.

275
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,870
He's so strange. Why is he doing that?

276
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,690
He is naturally meddlesome on useless things.

277
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,840
He sure is.

278
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,540
Hyungnim!

279
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,310
You're here?

280
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,110
Please give us another glass.

281
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,360
Yes!

282
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,300
Thank you.

283
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,410
Did I drag you out when you should be sleeping?

284
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:32,130
No, not at all. I'll sleep better after a drink anyway.

285
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:34,330
Now that I think about it, it's been a long time since we've had a drink together.

286
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,700
It is.

287
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,610
But, is there something the matter?

288
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:45,770
Your face doesn't look very good.

289
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:51,080
Just because. You know those days you just want a drink.

290
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,040
The restaurant is closed tomorrow, too.

291
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,300
I heard you're going on an MT. From Eun Hee.

292
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,860
Yeah, to strengthen the unity.

293
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:04,220
It would have been nice to bring Eun Hee, too.

294
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:08,910
But she'll say she's a nuisance and feels uncomfortable, so I can't even bring it up.

295
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,440
Don't worry. She's going to an alumni gathering and I'm going with her.

296
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,660
Oh, really? That's good.

297
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,210
It's upsetting.

298
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,170
She liked going places.

299
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,380
It's too late now, isn't it? Catching the hit and run driver.

300
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:34,450
Probably...also, it's been a long time.

301
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:37,310
How could it be there wasn't a single witness?

302
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:41,870
And the CCTV was broken. Otherwise, something might have come out.

303
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:46,790
Just forget about it. Eun Hee has me now.

304
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,220
Yeah, that's why I like you. And buy you drinks.

305
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:04,560
We're going on an MT? For two days and a night?

306
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,260
That's what I said. This is a heaven-sent opportunity.

307
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:13,870
Why? When people go on vacation, they are happier and are released from their weariness.

308
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:16,190
- And so? 
 -And so? So that's what.

309
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,800
Let's just jump him. Just.

310
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,850
- Just jump him? 
 - Then? Don't jump him?

311
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:25,420
You have to look at the sky to be able to pick the stars.

312
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,460
No, but still, that's...

313
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,630
This isn't the time to be shy or embarrassed now.

314
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:36,010
PD Lee called Chef Kang, so he went out. And he's still not back.

315
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:38,910
It's very unsettling, unsettling now.

316
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:43,320
But it doesn't look like Chef Kang will finish up the progress either.

317
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,920
We have to first get in there and stir up trouble.

318
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,880
Do you have any good ideas?

319
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,300
Then first, don't we have to make sure Chef has his own room?

320
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:58,670
If there are many people, it's a little bit...you know, to seduce him.

321
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:04,120
And also, I don't think it would be good having him drink a lot of alcohol.

322
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:08,840
He has to have control over his body if we want to have that fling with him.

323
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,240
You have a good brain! Unexpectedly.

324
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,090
You're fast with ideas.

325
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,440
No, I don't.

326
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,790
Ah, then, should I buy a new nightgown? Like a slip-on type?

327
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,290
That's awesome.

328
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,300
You girl.

329
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,800
Slip-on?

330
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:35,040
We're here!

331
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,380
Wow, this is nice. It's refreshing.

332
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,590
Hello!

333
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,370
It must have been tiring getting here.

334
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,340
The traffic is probably backed up with vacationers.

335
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,610
No, not at all. The traffic wasn't as bad as expected.

336
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:51,340
The scenery is really amazing. It looks even better than the website.

337
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,500
Thank you.

338
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,330
These are semi-dried persimmons.

339
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:58,840
It's our neighborhood's communally produced eco-friendly product.

340
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,810
It's slightly frozen, so let it thaw out a bit before you eat it.

341
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:04,050
Thank you very much.

342
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:06,400
Are you planning to use the barbeque grill?

343
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,790
Should I get some charcoal prepared for you?

344
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:10,510
We're cooks so you don't need to worry about us.

345
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:13,160
I see.

346
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:18,630
But why is there another unni inside that unni?

347
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,060
Me?

348
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:31,490
What are you saying? I don't understand what that means.

349
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,920
Honey.

350
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,540
Why are you out here?

351
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,570
Let's go. Now!

352
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,700
The rooms are this way.

353
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,580
I gave you the largest cabin.

354
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,640
Ah, thank you.

355
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,010
Let's unload first.

356
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:50,090
Yes, Chef!

357
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,540
I'll take it out.

358
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,290
Wait, wait. Stop it, stop it. There's more. More here.

359
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,420
Ah, wait.

360
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:07,170
Ow, just one is already plenty heavy!

361
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:10,370
Wait a second.

362
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:13,800
Why don't you take what's left instead of dumping it on a woman.

363
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,750
How is she a woman?

364
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,180
Then is she a man?

365
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,710
She's not a man eith...

366
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:24,150
But Cordon punk, talking back. Are you Bong's boyfriend, what's the fuss?

367
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:28,470
Can I only make a fuss if I'm her boyfriend? Fine, I'll be her boyfriend then!

368
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:34,210
Wow, his strength is awesome. Wait for me, Boyfriend.

369
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:39,950
That #$%^! When did he get hit by struck by lightning?

370
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:42,240
That bastard!

371
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,660
Boyfriend, I'll carry this.

372
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:54,060
Let's go together, Boyfriend. Today is starting Day 1.

373
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:03,040
Chef, we're running out of meat.

374
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,120
Not much left.

375
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,520
-It's all gone!
-Give it here, I'll do it.

376
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,280
No, normally the seniors do it when you come to places like this.

377
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,470
-Really?
-Just eat.

378
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:13,010
I want to hurry up and eat. It's so good.

379
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:16,080
If you're bored, then make some accompaniment for alcohol, with that bulgogi.

380
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,280
Survival. Should we do survival?

381
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,870
What kind of survival?

382
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:23,570
The first place will ascend to the menu next month.

383
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:27,270
I feel good. Okay, it'll be addition to the menu every month.

384
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,580
Bring on the competition!

385
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,320
Let's do this.

386
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:36,020
-Chef, you want to do a survivor contest all the way here...
-Start!

387
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,710
Let go!

388
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,780
Hey, Bong, did you practice your knife skills?

389
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:58,210
It looks like artwork.

390
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:02,710
I met this really good teacher recently.

391
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,690
Pop!

392
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:33,450
For now, the top two items are...

393
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:43,140
Min Soo's bulgogi en papillote and Joon's torch bulgogi.

394
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,090
That's too bad.

395
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:50,300
Both meet the originality of the menu concept and they both taste great.

396
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:57,140
No, can't announce the winner yet. We have a 30 year veteran taster, Choi Ji Woong.

397
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:01,750
Then, yes, I like bulbogi very much.

398
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:07,280
I will try tasting it. Joon's, let's see.

399
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,640
Wow, it's juicy.

400
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,540
Wow, with a taste of wine and a hint of rosemary soaked in...

401
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:20,110
It's amazing. Chef, you know,

402
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:23,470
it would be a hit if we added this to our menu. Hey, Cordon!

403
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,770
Wow.

404
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:27,430
Then Teacher, the next food item.

405
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,980
Wow, what's this?

406
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:36,950
It's juicy and light, and it's a taste that's tiresome.

407
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,860
I feel like I've tasted this before.

408
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:42,450
It's our restaurant's braised pork in a bucket!

409
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:44,940
Ah!

410
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,940
That's pork bellies, this is sliced beef tenderloin. They're totally different.

411
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,480
Chef, quickly announce the winner. I can't stand it.

412
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,360
- I've decided.
- Chef has decided.

413
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,610
Then, for entrance into the special menu and

414
00:26:55,610 --> 00:27:01,020
shining on Sun's restaurant every month, the winner is...

415
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:12,720
Seo Joon! Seo Joon! Seo Joon! Seo Joon! Seo Joon! Seo Joon! Seo Joon! Seo Joon!

416
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,560
Heo Min Soo's bulgogi en papillote.

417
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,020
How dare you try to climb up.

418
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:31,350
Joon's torch bulgogi showed originality and it was good, but

419
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:35,540
Min Soo's was more faithful to the basics and gave stability, that's what it means.

420
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:42,770
You guys might not understand it, but you can say it's from years of experience? Okay. Very good.

421
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:45,270
What are you guys doing? Let's eat and die.

422
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,360
Yes, Chef!

423
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,510
Let's eat, let's eat!

424
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,900
Taste this again.

425
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,340
Bring some alcohol.

426
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:55,780
This tastes better though.

427
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,950
-  ♫ Unspoken love~
- Shut up.

428
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,940
Seriously, geez.

429
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:21,450
Chef, on a nationwide scale, why don't you give us a cheer?

430
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,960
So corny...

431
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:30,880
Well, for giving your time that's precious as gold

432
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:38,380
for Sun Restaurant's team work, I sincerely thank you.

433
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,190
Let's go far together!

434
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:46,450
Let's go!

435
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,750
Ah, the alcohol goes down so smoothly.

436
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:56,310
Is it because I'm drinking it with such fresh air?

437
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:59,760
It's almost all gone.

438
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,220
Go buy some more.

439
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:05,090
Will poop couple go, or Cordon, will you go?

440
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:06,510
Let's just drink what's left.

441
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,670
Sous Chef should go.

442
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,620
I'll go.

443
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:14,610
Hey, no. Why would you go and leave the ones below you?

444
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:17,580
Didn't I say that when you go places like this, the senior is supposed to do it.

445
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:22,190
Also, I'm in pursuit of being non-authoritative, hyung like owner.

446
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:25,350
Oh... Thank you!

447
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,560
Go safely!

448
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:33,200
He's showing off over a few bottles of alcohol. I'll kill him if he buys the cheap stuff!

449
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:35,650
Now, music!

450
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:43,170
♫ Loser outer shell, just a thug full of hurt, trash

451
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:46,950
♫ Idiot. Look into the mirror~

452
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,010
- You're not saying that to me, are you?
- It's a song.

453
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:54,540
It's a song. Listen carefully.

454
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:58,070
Nice.

455
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:00,720
♫ Loser ~

456
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:04,010
Okay, fine.

457
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,120
That's nice.

458
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,510
♫ Loser...

459
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:12,900
I like that.

460
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:16,120
Chef, let's go together!

461
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,220
What is it?

462
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,300
-Let's go together!
-Why did you come?

463
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:23,510
I mean, the sun is setting soon and in a dangerous place like this,

464
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:27,580
the ghosts are in abundance. Particularly virgin ghosts.

465
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,980
I have to protect you, Chef!

466
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,930
Who's protecting whom? You're the most dangerous one.

467
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:35,680
Ah, don't worry. I won't touch a hair on you.

468
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,660
Oh my! Isn't this a bicycle? Let's ride this.

469
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:42,220
Ah, never mind. Hurry up. I could run there and back faster than giving you a ride on that.

470
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:45,690
What? We can carry the alcohol right here.

471
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:46,890
It's heavy.

472
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:50,980
No, but. We didn't even get permission to use it!

473
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:55,090
Ah, seriously. She just does what she wants. So stubborn.

474
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:02,880
Ah, Chef! Go faster!

475
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,110
Hey, how much do you weigh? You may be small, but you sure are heavy.

476
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:11,840
Hurry up! I'm not heavy, your lower body is just weak.

477
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,590
Hey, my lower body is no joke. You will be shocked.

478
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:18,500
Yes, yes, that's what you always say.

479
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:23,020
It's so frustrating, you'll drive me crazy! I'm getting off!

480
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,160
What? What are you doing?

481
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,910
Stop! So slow!

482
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,740
Move over. I'll steer.

483
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:30,450
You can't ride a bike though.

484
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:33,540
I'm going!

485
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,310
- Trust me.
- Slowly, there you go.

486
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,210
-Here we go.
-Slowly, that's it.

487
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:40,200
-Slowly.
-I'm going!

488
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,770
Let's go.

489
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:45,850
Slowly!

490
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:48,690
It's working.

491
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:51,090
I said to go slowly!

492
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:55,420
Ah, fireworks.

493
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,170
Why did you buy that? So childish.

494
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:59,120
Why? These are so fun.

495
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,250
And they explode, pop, pop.  Do you want to see?

496
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,820
Be quiet. Do it by yourself later.

497
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:09,850
Ah, yes. Don't ask me for one later.

498
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:16,800
The air is sweet. It's really nice.

499
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,890
The air is very nice.

500
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:24,650
My dream since I was young is to come out to a rural area like this when I turn forty,

501
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:30,260
and tending a vegetable garden and running a small restaurant.

502
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:35,160
You can do that. Land isn't that expensive in the countryside.

503
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,430
I wish I could, but it's already too late.

504
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:41,730
Late? Are you setting up a restaurant in Paris?

505
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:45,460
-It is possible.
-No, it isn't. It's too late for me.

506
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:50,750
Chef, what you know isn't everything there is. Just try to know up to here.

507
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,410
If you know more then you'll faint.

508
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:56,250
Ah, do whatever. It's your dream, not mine.

509
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:01,440
Oh? Chef, your shoelace is untied.

510
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,240
It's okay.

511
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,170
Ah, just wait.

512
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:09,970
There's this incredible way so that they don't come untied.

513
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:12,800
I don't usually teach anyone how to do this.

514
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,610
I'm making an exception today.

515
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:18,760
I was planning to file for a patent for this at the Korean Intellectual Property Office.

516
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:22,260
But I missed the opportunity and couldn't do it.

517
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,540
Tada!

518
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:28,260
What do you think? They won't come untied now, will they?

519
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,400
Hmm?

520
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,940
What do you think?

521
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,800
Yeah, they aren't coming untied.

522
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,880
Tada! Now we're a couple!

523
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,460
What couple? Let go of me.

524
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:43,530
Why, when I know very well that your hands are occupied

525
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:46,910
with the bicycle handlebar, why would I listen to you? Am I nuts?

526
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:49,190
Do you want to crawl? You're going to be in trouble. Hurry.

527
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:52,000
Do I want me to crawl? How? Like this?

528
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,700
- What are you doing?
- Should I go up?

529
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,990
-Hey! Get down. Hurry. Let go!
-Seon Woo!

530
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,900
 Oh, So Hyeong?

531
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,820
Just a minute.

532
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,700
What brings you here?

533
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,480
The place we were scouting is nearby.

534
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,870
I was going to go after finishing, but I remembered you were coming on an MT. I wanted to give my support.

535
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:15,060
You didn't have to do all this.

536
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,320
-You must have come out to buy something.
-Yes.

537
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:22,780
-Are you well, Bong Seon?
-Yes, I am well, but this was so unexpected.

538
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:27,140
Companies these days must just give out money.

539
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:31,460
So not busy. So much free time.

540
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,520
Oh, there's nothing to drink!

541
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,680
Bring the alcohol! I want to drink!

542
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,060
Alcohol!

543
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:46,470
Who gave him so much to drink? This is terrifying. What a turnaround.

544
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:48,750
He drank all by himself like he lost his nation.

545
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:52,000
Hey, leave him alone. He's finally acting like a human.

546
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:55,900
Oh my!

547
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,660
Seriously, now we've seen everything.

548
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:03,160
Aish, this chef, is he brewing the alcohol himself?

549
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,620
-Oh my gosh, what am I going to do?
-Why?

550
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,820
I think my goddess is coming. Isn't that PD Lee? PD Lee?

551
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:10,030
What nonsense are you saying?

552
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,000
Oh? PD Lee!

553
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,010
Hello!

554
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:18,060
Here, Oppa, here.

555
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:22,670
 Hello, I was nearby for work so I stopped by. I'm not an unwanted guest, am I?

556
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,510
No, no!

557
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:28,290
Actually, it was a bit lonely because only us men are here, but now there's light.

558
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,490
Just men? What about me? Me?

559
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:34,690
You're family.

560
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:37,320
That's enough talking. PD Lee brought two bottles of wine.

561
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,070
Wow!

562
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:43,950
PD Lee! PD Lee!

563
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:47,270
Be quiet!

564
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:51,050
Hey! Hey! It's too noisy!

565
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:54,250
- Escort Joon now.
-Let's escort  him.

566
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,490
Joon!

567
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:58,160
- Let's go.
- Let's escort  him.

568
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,730
His legs. We've got you.

569
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:03,080
I said I'm going home!

570
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,580
Have fun, Eun Hee!

571
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:11,550
It's been a long time since you went to a reunion.

572
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:16,770
Right? But you'll be alone, will you be okay? Do you have any plans?

573
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:21,960
Why wouldn't I? My friend is coming over so don't worry. Please take good care of her, my Son-in-law.

574
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,530
Yes, don't worry, Mother-in-law.

575
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:26,760
Oh, she must be here! She's here!

576
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:31,110
Oh! You're here? Come in, come in!

577
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:34,750
We could meet out somewhere,

578
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:40,280
why do you insist I come to the house to eat?

579
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,220
You've come?

580
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:45,290
You've seen my daughter before. Oh, it's the first time meeting my son-in-law, isn't it?

581
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:47,320
Say hello. This is my friend, Seobbinggu.

582
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,800
Ah, hello.

583
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,880
Ah, yes. I've heard a lot about you.

584
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:07,730
Hurry up and go, you'll be late! Hurry up.

585
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:11,080
Have a good time!

586
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,070
We'll be back.

587
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:16,860
Eun Hee, eat lots of good food.

588
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:22,320
It's strangely strong. I usually don't lose in the spirit energy fight.

589
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:28,400
Is it because I'm short on supernatural power? It's making my heart sour.

590
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:33,290
Hey, Eun Hee! You're here?

591
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:37,100
How long has it been? You should stay in touch. I'm going to forget how you look.

592
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:40,810
That's right. I was a bit lazy. I'm sorry.

593
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:43,300
I heard that Hae Soo is Giselle.

594
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,740
-Ah, that's right.
-That's great! Congratulations!

595
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,130
Thanks.

596
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:50,820
But I'm already worried. I think it's going to be hard work.

597
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,860
Eun Hee was the best Giselle amongst us.

598
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,930
I know.

599
00:37:55,930 --> 00:38:00,420
The professor also acknowledged it, that you'll definitely end up at a place like Universal.

600
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,550
That's right. That's what he said back then.

601
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:05,560
If it weren't for that hit and run.

602
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:10,460
They didn't catch him yet, have they? The hit and run driver.

603
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:13,640
Even if they don't know who it is, he'll get his just due.

604
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:20,070
How can he leave after hitting a person? An evil person like that needs to be ripped up and killed.

605
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:22,670
-Hey!
-That's so scary.

606
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:25,370
It's scary.

607
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:29,400
I'll wait outside. Call me when you're done.

608
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,940
Why?

609
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:34,130
-No, I'll just wait outside.
-Stay a little longer.

610
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:36,570
-Have a nice time.
-I'll call you.

611
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:39,390
Be careful on your way.

612
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,060
Did we only talk amongst ourselves?

613
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:46,710
No.
-Does he treat you well?

614
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:59,870
 Oh, Eun Hee! Hello!

615
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:40,760
♬ The alcohol is going in! In! In!♬

616
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,370
♬ How much longer are we going to keep dancing with our shoulders?

617
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:45,820
♬ Look at my shoulders. They are dislocated ♬

618
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:49,100
♬ There is no time for rest. There is no time for rest. ♬

619
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,980
♬ I don't know if it's this way, I don't know if it's that way... One!

620
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:55,050
-What is that? Two!
-Three!
-Three!

621
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,920
Hey, one shot for each of you! Not one shot.

622
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,520
Black Knight! Black Knight!

623
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,490
-Chef!
-Chef!

624
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:07,110
Whoa!

625
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:12,500
Double black knight! You have to choose one of them.

626
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,280
I'll just drink them both.

627
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,230
Hey! That's no fun.

628
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,560
Then,

629
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,060
after drinking them, make a wish. A wish.

630
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,610
A wish! A wish! A wish!

631
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:26,620
Hey, I don't have a wish. Since it's 2:00 already, let's just clean up and go in.

632
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,820
Let's just sleep.

633
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:31,440
Then let's go inside and eat some more.

634
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,290
Then PD Lee and Bong share a room.

635
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:37,760
That drunk guy and chef can share the same room, and us three  can share the same room.

636
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,860
No! Since the Chef is the chef, he should get his own room!

637
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,920
No, no, I can share.

638
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:46,120
No, no! There's a such a thing as rank, so that's not right!

639
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,680
Chef gets his own room. End of discussion.

640
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,900
Okay. Do whatever you want.

641
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:55,120
Then, clean up.

642
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,280
Yes!

643
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:00,130
Hey, Seon Woo. Do you want to take a short walk to walk off the alcohol?

644
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:05,600
Chef! Didn't you say you were tired earlier? Oh my, look at these dark circles! Come quickly.

645
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,320
-Okay!
-Watch the stairs!

646
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:14,210
Ah, I got it. Okay!

647
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:20,420
  Today's the most important day. Why did that woman come? Darn it.

648
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:23,650
 I have to finish talking with Seon Woo tonight.

649
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:28,260
I'm not sure if I'm making it uncomfortable for you, Bong Seon. I'm sorry.

650
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:33,020
I'm not sure why someone who is sorry would insist on butting into someone else's MT.

651
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:40,130
Then what about you, Bong Seon? I'm not sure why you're insisting on staying in that storage room.

652
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:42,280
I wonder if there is really no other place to stay?

653
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,430
Chef offered it to me. I wasn't the one who asked him, you see.

654
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:49,410
Even if it was 100% the sincerity of the other party, you still should have declined.

655
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:53,350
-Don't you think it would be troublesome for Seon Woo if the others knew?
-Eh!

656
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:55,380
-Bong Seon, don't you have any friends?
-No, I don't.

657
00:41:55,380 --> 00:42:00,230
-Then you should have come to my house.
-Why are you so concerned where I sleep?

658
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:03,840
Then why are you so concerned that I came here?

659
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:07,500
Ha! Geesh!

660
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:20,420
-Where are you going?
-The light. I was going to turn out the light.

661
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,410
It's over there!

662
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:26,560
I can't sleep with the lights on.

663
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:48,130
-Where are you going?
-The bathroom.

664
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:54,350
Why go out? There's one in this room. Over there.

665
00:42:55,070 --> 00:43:00,570
-The bathroom.
-Is it urgent?

666
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:04,310
It went away.

667
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:12,200
I won!

668
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:17,190
Then I can casually use his arm as a pillow.

669
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:20,300
-Oh, Chef!
-What is this?

670
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:24,670
Shh! You'll wake people. It's Na Bong Seon.

671
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,990
How did you get in here?

672
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:31,690
I mean, PD Lee keeps snoring.

673
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:36,340
I'm so tired, but I can't sleep.

674
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:42,060
So, why else would I have had to barge into here?

675
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:48,280
Why? Why are you looking at me like that? You're getting me excited.

676
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,950
Did you take your medicine?

677
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:52,730
Can't you stop asking me about taking my medicine?

678
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:59,290
Why do you think I keep asking you about your medicine? Why is a woman seriously like this? I'm going crazy.

679
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:02,710
-Oh, this is so nice.
-Let's go.

680
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:04,390
-I don't want to.
-Come out.

681
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:09,420
- I said that PD Lee is snoring!
- I don't want to.

682
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,050
Na Bong, come out!

683
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:18,580
Seriously, what am I to do with you?

684
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,480
Oh, Chef!

685
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:36,380
Do you have a prejudice against mating?

686
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:41,410
If I tried this much, you can just close your eyes and...

687
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,140
Why are you like this especially today?

688
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:50,330
Do I have to take you to the hospital again? It seems to be getting more severe.

689
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:51,600
- Sit down.
 -Chae Hee!

690
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:54,600
Chae Hee!

691
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:59,900
-Chae Hee!
- Yoon Chae Hee!

692
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,860
What is it? Is something the matter?

693
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:04,620
It's because our daughter is missing.

694
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:07,380
Your daughter? The one who was wearing a school uniform earlier?

695
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:10,400
She isn't in her right mind.

696
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,600
If she's alone, she'll cause some trouble again.

697
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,350
Oh, where did this child go?

698
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:17,960
Chae Hee!

699
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:20,430
She likes to hide.

700
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:23,380
-Chae Hee!
-It seems as if she's hiding somewhere.

701
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:25,140
It's really late.

702
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:27,520
Hiding,

703
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,930
then we'll try looking for her.

704
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:35,500
Her name is Chae Hee?
Yes, Yoon Chae Hee.

705
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,610
Yoon Chae Hee!

706
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:41,150
Your mother and father are worried! If you're hiding, then that's enough! Come out!

707
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:43,480
Yoon Chae Hee!

708
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,930
I don't think she's around here.

709
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:49,460
Chef! Look that way! I'll go this way.

710
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:52,910
-Huh?
-Go that way.

711
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:57,210
Oh, okay. Be careful. If you goof around you'll fall again.

712
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:04,990
Yoon Chae Hee! Chae Hee!

713
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:11,930
Look for the children. They were playing hide and seek with me, but they suddenly all disappeared.

714
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:14,980
You didn't see them either? Which way they went?

715
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:20,130
Is this Chae Hee? You were here!

716
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:24,230
It's the unnies I saw earlier. Hi, Unnies.

717
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:28,600
No wonder. I was wondering how you saw me. You're an ill child.

718
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,440
Let's go, Chae Hee. Your mother and father are worried.

719
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,480
I can't. I have to find the kids.

720
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:36,660
-Kids?
-Hey, kids!

721
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:42,160
Chae Hee, wait! Wait a minute! Where are you going?

722
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:44,200
Hey!

723
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,390
Chae Hee, stop for a minute! Just a minute!

724
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:52,620
Chae Hee, listen to me! Chae Hee, wait!

725
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:56,120
That little thing is so quick.

726
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,450
Where is this place? Storage...ow!

727
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:05,740
Seriously!

728
00:48:07,110 --> 00:48:09,440
Chae Hee!

729
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:14,860
What is this? It was a storage freezer?

730
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:17,650
Finally the temperature suits me.

731
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:22,800
Chae Hee! Where are you? Stop hiding and come out!

732
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,560
Let's go back to your mother, Chae Hee!

733
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,680
Chae Hee! Where are you?

734
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:33,150
Oh my gosh! Hey, Chae Hee!

735
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:37,060
Chae Hee! Chae Hee, quickly open the door! Chae Hee!

736
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:39,610
That unni is a ghost. I have to lock her up.

737
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:43,000
I'm really scary when I get mad!

738
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,600
Chae Hee! I don't know if you know this, but I'm a ghost!

739
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:52,130
If you don't hurry up and open this, I'm going to get you!

740
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:55,340
Chae Hee! You're a good girl, aren't you?

741
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:59,940
Hey! Yoon Chae Hee, hurry up and open this!

742
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:02,970
I said that I'm very scary when I get mad!

743
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:09,660
Hey, Yoon Chae Hee!  Hey! Yoon Chae Hee!

744
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:12,080
Chae Hee!

745
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,040
Chae Hee.

746
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:18,360
Hey, Yoon Chae Hee, where did you go? Do you know how worried I was?

747
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,940
I told you not to go out at night.

748
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:24,320
This girl has no fear! Where in the world did you go?

749
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:27,930
I was just playing with the unnies.

750
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:30,590
Oh, they found you, Chae Hee.

751
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:35,010
Yes, I'm sorry. You should be sleeping but because of us.

752
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:38,420
Not at all. Not at all. It's a relief you found her.

753
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:40,100
Then take her inside.

754
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:43,240
-Yes, thank you. Go on inside.
-Yes.

755
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:46,670
What did Mom tell you?

756
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:51,150
My goodness. She's cute but it's too bad she's like that.

757
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:56,680
But where did Na Bong Seon go?

758
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:00,370
One is found and another goes missing.

759
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:08,410
Chae Hee! You're not gone, are you? You didn't leave me and go, did you?

760
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:13,800
Oh, what is this? Did she really leave?

761
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:18,390
How did such a small thing lose her senses?

762
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:29,990
Where did she go? I keep circling this place.

763
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,130
 -Hello? 
-Hey, Na Bong Seon.

764
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:40,910
 No, this is So Hyeong. Is this Seon Woo?

765
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:44,270
Yeah, just a minute.

766
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:47,390
Did Na Bong Seon leave her cellphone and go out?

767
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:52,690
I shouldn't be here like this.

768
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:58,510
I should be doing something. This won't do.

769
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:03,220
-Na Bong Seon. 
-Where is this?

770
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:06,160
We're locked in a storage freezer.

771
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,940
It's a long explanation. Wait a little bit, I'll try to find a way out.

772
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:14,030
You can go sit down over there.

773
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,910
Ah, so cold.

774
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:26,100
Let's see, let's see. So I just have to lift this. This thing.

775
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:34,560
Ahh! I feel like it could work.

776
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:43,490
Oh, is it too heavy? I'm going to go nuts.

777
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:50,000
Oh? Did I drop this earlier when I fell?

778
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:55,570
Let's see, let's see. I think this might be possible.

779
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:14,450
Yes!

780
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:19,430
I've passed the first step.

781
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:30,140
I've looked at all the likely places, and I don't think she's there.

782
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:34,090
-This side, too.
-Where did she go?

783
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:39,480
They say that buckets that leak inside leak outside too. She  had to cause trouble. I didn't even get any sleep.

784
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:44,290
A person is missing and you can sleep? Family is missing!

785
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:45,740
It's because I'm worried.

786
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:50,070
She's been missing for two hours already! It isn't even somewhere familiar.

787
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:54,230
Should we report it to the police?

788
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:57,270
Ah, that scared me! Who's setting those off in the middle of the night?

789
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:58,990
That's Na Bong Seon.

790
00:52:58,990 --> 00:53:01,700
Chef, where are you going?

791
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:07,330
Chef! Chef! Chef!

792
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:12,560
 Oh, Chef! Here, here! What a relief, you found me!

793
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,980
 Here, here, in the storage freezer.

794
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:20,120
 Oh, here! She's in here!

795
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:25,620
-Bong Seon! Is Bong Seon here?
-Bong Seon isn't here.

796
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,930
Chef, I'm in here! Please open the door!

797
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:38,000
Chef, I'm here, open the door! Chef! Chef!

798
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,690
-Chef!
-Na Bong! Hey, are you okay?

799
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:46,520
I'm still okay.

800
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:49,590
Hey, Bong! Are you crazy?

801
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:54,550
Hey! Seriously! Are you out of your mind?!

802
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:59,760
Do you have a brain or not? Why did you come in here? I told you to be careful and not goof around!

803
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,920
Why don't you listen to me?

804
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:08,430
I'm sorry for worrying you. I didn't get locked up because I wanted to be.

805
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:13,060
Be quiet. You seem like you're okay?

806
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:17,490
Does it make sense being in a freezer for two hours? Stay still.

807
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:19,980
First, let's get out of here. I'll piggy-back her.

808
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:38,650
Your body is so cold. What do you mean you are fine?

809
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:42,540
Oh, that's right.

810
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:45,770
But who set off the fireworks? Bong was locked up alone.

811
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:49,860
It was probably just a coincidence.

812
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:53,160
But why is Chef so angry?

813
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,400
To me, I think he's going a little overboard.

814
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,450
It's obvious.

815
00:54:57,450 --> 00:55:01,090
If she was in an accident and was hospitalized, what about the hospital bill?

816
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:04,370
Would I pay for it or would you? Hey, you pay.

817
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:07,460
She is just repaying it by working hard.

818
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:26,670
Seon Woo.

819
00:55:31,810 --> 00:55:34,140
What are you doing? Get up early.

820
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:36,070
What did you say?

821
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:38,830
Goodbye! We'll come again!

822
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:40,730
Goodbye!

823
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:42,890
Good bye!

824
00:55:42,890 --> 00:55:45,510
We had a good time.

825
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:48,410
-I'm sorry about my daughter yesterday.
-Not at all.

826
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:50,940
Come again, we'll give you good service.

827
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:52,740
Yes, goodbye.

828
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,380
Bye!

829
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:57,930
Unni came out safely.

830
00:55:57,930 --> 00:56:00,820
It would be nice if the unni came out of the other Unni.

831
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:02,470
Bye, Unnies again!

832
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:03,770
Oh, okay.

833
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:06,520
Take care. And don't cause trouble.

834
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,520
Good bye.

835
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:13,160
Seon Woo, can you take me to the station?

836
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,330
Oh, okay.

837
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:18,390
Officer Choi! Officer Choi!

838
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:20,600
When is your birthday?

839
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,250
My birthday?

840
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:23,640
It's in the winter, why?

841
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:26,190
Nothing. I have a gift for you, that's all.

842
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:28,930
I'll tell you when it's for certain.

843
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:30,760
Oh, just a minute.

844
00:56:31,790 --> 00:56:34,680
Yes, yes. That's me.

845
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,450
Yes!

846
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:40,710
Ah, yes. I see. I'll stop by after work.

847
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:42,970
Yes, thank you.

848
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:46,390
It's good news, Officer Choi.

849
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:50,840
Actually, you know the CCTV that was broken involving Eun Hee's hit and run.

850
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,420
I requested it for restoration.

851
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:54,820
This time, there is a professional who got released from prison, and he's really good.

852
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:56,240
He says he can do it.

853
00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:00,720
I'm going to go get it after work. What do you think? Surprise! Are you touched?

854
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,070
Really? That's great.

855
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:05,250
I think there will definitely be some kind of evidence.

856
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:07,160
This is evidence from how many years ago?

857
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,110
This is the proverbial, "where there's a will, there's a way."

858
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:13,130
If I catch this bastard, he is dead.

859
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:14,960
Wait. Let's try calling Chef Kang.

860
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,910
I'll tell him.

861
00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:18,520
You will?

862
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:23,090
Okay, then I'll go first and check it. I'm getting excited.

863
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:25,480
Thank you.

864
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,520
For taking concern in the incident.

865
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,620
It's not because it's about your in-laws.

866
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:34,740
It was the first case I was on. How can I not be concerned?

867
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:37,860
Let's do this methodically from here.

868
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:00,510
Then go in.

869
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:01,980
Seon Woo.

870
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:07,590
Aren't you curious? Why I went all the way to your MT?

871
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:10,970
-So Hyeong
-I know.

872
00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:14,280
It's not that you're not curious. It's probably that you're afraid to ask.

873
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:18,490
Because you already know what I'm going to say. Don't you?

874
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:26,820
Let me ask you one more thing. You keeping your distance from me.

875
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:30,770
Is it related to Bong Seon?

876
00:58:32,990 --> 00:58:36,140
Never mind. Let's forget I asked that question.

877
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:39,100
I feel like that's lowering myself even more, so I'm not happy.

878
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:43,750
Go safely.

879
00:58:52,190 --> 00:58:55,810
You only left the evidence and left.

880
00:58:55,810 --> 00:59:01,310
You annoying CCTV. You are dead, you bastard.

881
00:59:01,310 --> 00:59:04,970
Now, let's go.

882
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:07,560
Hey.

883
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:10,580
This bastard.

884
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:13,550
Seriously, I should get a new car.

885
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:18,690
This always does this!

886
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:25,770
Let's see. Did the battery die?

887
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:31,480
Would I know what to look for?

888
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:57,520
Oh, why isn't he coming? It's making me nervous.

889
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:00,870
Is PD Lee trying something?

890
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:04,490
I should have done it at the MT somehow.

891
01:00:04,490 --> 01:00:08,800
Ah, what a waste!

892
01:00:09,990 --> 01:00:12,160
Chef, you're here?

893
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,620
Ah, give it here, give it here!

894
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:15,720
Do you feel okay?

895
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:18,140
Ah, of course. As I said yesterday,

896
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:21,000
I am okay with cold temperatures.

897
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,000
If you're okay, then put on an apron. We skipped class yesterday. Let's practice with the wok today.

898
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,360
Yes, today, too?

899
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,200
Yes.

900
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:34,920
Oh, so heavy!

901
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:40,030
Don't just pull it up. Pull it towards you, rhythmically.

902
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:43,700
I want to stop now.

903
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:47,900
It hurts so much I think I'm going to get body aches. It's too hard.

904
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:49,580
Oh, stop then.

905
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:51,810
What? Really?

906
01:00:51,810 --> 01:00:54,050
Stop then,

907
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:57,370
-and clean the floors.
-Yes, Chef.

908
01:00:58,890 --> 01:01:02,960
-Ah, but Chef. There's something I'm curious about.
-What?

909
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:08,050
Yesterday, why did you get so angry in the storage freezer?

910
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:10,530
Huh? Hmm?

911
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:16,930
I mean, even if you got mad, you got so mad I couldn't believe it.

912
01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:18,660
Why?

913
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:25,620
So should I compliment you for causing trouble even all the way there? Stop saying such useless things and clean the floors.

914
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:28,090
Yes, Chef.

915
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:39,670
Move aside, so I can spray it.

916
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:44,170
Ah!

917
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:46,530
Seriously!

918
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:50,340
Hey, how can you turn on the hose so suddenly?

919
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:57,520
So cold!

920
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,920
Is this the first time you've held a hose?

921
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:04,090
No, I didn't know it would come out so strong so suddenly.

922
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:07,460
Oh, what do I do?

923
01:02:08,450 --> 01:02:10,770
I'm all wet.

924
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:16,810
It's so cold!

925
01:02:16,810 --> 01:02:19,310
Oh, what do I do?

926
01:02:19,310 --> 01:02:22,130
Come here.

927
01:02:22,130 --> 01:02:24,100
Yes.

928
01:02:25,770 --> 01:02:28,040
Oh, it's so cold.

929
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,480
I got too wet.

930
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,400
What do I do?

931
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:37,630
Oh my, you're so wet. I'm so sorry, what can I do?

932
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:43,110
Seriously..

933
01:02:46,830 --> 01:02:51,060
Well, I think it's all wiped off.

934
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:53,490
It seems like it...

935
01:02:56,060 --> 01:03:00,660

936
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:31,260
♫   Memories that I want to forget. The moments that I want to remember   ♫

937
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:38,330
♫   Everything is disappearing    ♫

938
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:46,790
♫   Sometimes, they say that forgetting things is a good thing    ♫

939
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:53,920
♫   It seems very unlikely   ♫

940
01:03:56,210 --> 01:04:03,090
♫   The people whom I loved greatly   ♫

941
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:11,340
♫   The warmth that still remains in my hands     ♫

942
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:18,620
♫    In my heart...   ♫
