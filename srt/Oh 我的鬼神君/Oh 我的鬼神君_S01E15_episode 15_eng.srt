1
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,370
 Oh My Ghostess

2
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:22,760

3
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,350
 Oh My Ghostess

4
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,690
Na Bong Seon, I found out.

5
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,640
53 Oh 2368. It was a car license plate number.

6
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,390
It's Officer Choi's car.

7
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,440
 R-really?

8
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,090
Right before I died, in my diary and cell phone,

9
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,240
I think I wanted Officer Choi's license plate number be known.

10
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,240
First, tell Chef. I'll be there later.

11
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:06,610
 I didn't know Officer Kang had such interest in me.

12
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:17,890
 What about my car?

13
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,260
What are you so curious about?

14
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,540
N-nothing. Good bye.

15
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:29,060
You...

16
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,570
Who in the world are you?

17
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:32,250
You finally appeared. Shin Soon Ae.

18
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,890
I remember everything.

19
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,620
Why did you do that to me? Why me?

20
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,760
Because you saw something you shouldn't have seen.

21
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,450
You did.

22
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,930
But still how could you? To a person?

23
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:01,720
So you shouldn't have worried about a vexation and just gone up.

24
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,110
Why are you going through such trouble?

25
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,330
There's no use.

26
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,110
The world already started becoming aware of your evil deeds.

27
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,550
Things won't turn out the way you want any longer.

28
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,000
- It's already known that you have become one with that body. 
 - Shut up!

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,750
You're going to be locked up paying for your crimes forever!

30
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,100
Shut your mouth!

31
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,800
 Episode 15

32
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,540
 3 years ago

33
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,760
 DWI inspection. Blow hard on this once.

34
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,380
 So you recognize me, Father.

35
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,500
 With the murderous look in your eyes that used to stare at our Myeong Joon,

36
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,760
 How could I forget?

37
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,280
 We shouldn't have let in someone we were ignorant about.

38
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,420
 You became a cop?

39
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,520
 Why?

40
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,360
 Can't I become a cop?

41
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,020
 There's no reason you can't.

42
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:43,580
 Anyway, let's not meet even coincidentally if possible.

43
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,540
 It's painful to remember memories I want to forget.

44
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:03,790
 Just a minute. Officer Choi is working late tonight.

45
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:07,490
 Should I make his favorite stir-fried cartilage and bring it to him?

46
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,690
 To give him lots and lots of strength?

47
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,670
 -Let's go inside.
-You're all wet.

48
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,320
 It's okay, as long as my son isn't wet.

49
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,860
 What is this? I'm wet, too.

50
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,640
 Okay, Mom.

51
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,120
 Why get jealous over that?

52
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,540
 It's fine. You guys play with each other.

53
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:59,710
 Oh yeah. Should I buy Myeong Joon some ice cream?

54
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:07,130
 Yeah, yeah. I shouldn't be doing this now.

55
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:12,550
 Wait a second. Where do I have to go to buy ice cream?

56
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:39,550
 I have to report it. Oh, my phone!

57
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:49,590
 Is this 911? This is Wonhyoro 4-ga, Yongsan-gu, in front of the Jangwon market.

58
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:53,050
 A person has been hit by a car. Please come quickly.

59
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,840
 Yes, Officer Choi, this is Shin Soon Ae from Gi Restaurant.

60
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,560
 Where are you? I have something urgent to tell you.

61
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:36,280
 Officer Choi? You must be coming from somewhere.

62
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,860
 Yes, a bit. But what is it, Soon Ae?

63
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,040
 Actually, earlier I witnessed a hit-and-run accident.

64
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,980
 I called 911 and the person who was hit got taken away by ambulance.

65
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,410
 But I think I saw the back license plate number of that car.

66
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:52,110
 I was going to report it to the police but I thought of you.

67
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,970
 Good job. But what is the license number?

68
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:03,430
 It's 2368. The back number was definitely 2368.

69
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,480
 2368?

70
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,160
 53 Oh 2368

71
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:19,060
 What is it? What's wrong, Soon Ae?

72
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,740
 I...

73
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:32,390
 I... I... just remem...bered... something... urgent...

74
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:36,280
 My father... is drinking with friends...

75
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:42,470
 I... said I'd get him... I have to go...

76
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,580
 I-I'm sorry.

77
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,380
 The phone is turned off...

78
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,970
 We're home.

79
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:35,320
 Soon Ae! Soon Ae!!

80
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,630
 Soon Ae! My Soon Ae!

81
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,690
 Be careful.

82
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,960
 Please come here.

83
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,900
 Soon Ae! Soon Ae!

84
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,010
 No!

85
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,310
 Soon Ae!!

86
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:57,170
 I wasn't a virgin ghost.

87
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:03,650
 Because I died so suddenly that I was just a restless ghost who couldn't go up.

88
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:22,720
There's no response and now it's raining again.

89
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,100
This ghost said she was going to look into the license plate number.

90
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,820
How come there is no news from her?

91
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,790
I'm so curious I could die.

92
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:39,300
Oh, my gosh! How many times have I told you not to stand there?

93
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,530
What is it? What happened?

94
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:48,080
Unni.

95
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,430
By chance,

96
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,760
I remembered.

97
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:56,240
Why I died.

98
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,300
How I came to die, I remembered it all, Unni.

99
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:22,340
Are you alright? Are you calmed down?

100
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,650
That's why you were restless.

101
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:33,810
You were killed so suddenly by that wretched person.

102
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:36,370
And that became your resentment.

103
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:48,920
From now on, you have to stay very alert.

104
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:52,270
The opponent has been taken over by an evil spirit.

105
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:55,240
And since he's seen your face,

106
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,470
he won't ever sit still now.

107
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:14,590
 Shin Soon Ae, this troublesome girl. Where did she disappear to?

108
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,690
 -Officer Choi. 
-Ahjussi.

109
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,760
What are you buying? Should I carry it for you?

110
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:27,870
No, no. I just bought some pork hocks. They're good at the marketplace. And the portions are big.

111
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:31,280
But why did you buy so much? Can the two of you eat all this?

112
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,390
The two of us can't eat all this.

113
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,240
We have a guest at home.

114
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:41,240
A guest? I'm sure it will be good.

115
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:49,270
 I think right before I died I wanted to let Officer Choi's license number to be known through my diary and cell phone.

116
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:52,110
 First, tell Chef, Na Bong Seon.

117
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:02,310
 Chef Kang

118
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,270
 It's me.

119
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,600
Chef, where are you?

120
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,730
 Where else? At the restaurant.

121
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:14,560
 Did you happen to get in touch?

122
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,170
I'll go to the restaurant, Chef.

123
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:19,440
 No, I'll go. It's dangerous at night. Stay there.

124
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,690
Oh, Ahjussi. Did you go somewhere?

125
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:33,450
I was hungry, so I bought some pork hocks for a late night snack.

126
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,020
Did Kyung Mo go somewhere?

127
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,550
Kyung Mo! Come out and eat some pork hocks!

128
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,600
Chef should be here by now.

129
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,610
Chef?

130
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,310
I told her not to turn off her cell phone.

131
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,300
Did she not charge it?

132
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,310
Na Bong.

133
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:06,530
Yes,... I'm Officer Choi's brother-in-law Kang Seon Woo.

134
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:09,210
Is Officer Choi there?

135
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:13,080
Dear spirits. Because the current days are strange,

136
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,050
evil spirits are ridiculing humans and using criminals to run rampant.

137
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:21,060
Give us the strength to fight the evil spirits.

138
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,760
Give us the strength.

139
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,180
Sagakdaemangdeurookooseusa~

140
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,000
 Excuse me! Are you there?

141
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,490
Who is it?

142
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,850
 Excuse me!

143
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,500
Who is it?

144
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,660
What is it?

145
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,240
Na Bong Seon is missing. With my brother-in-law.

146
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,720
Na Bong Seon? Unni.

147
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,950
Oh my world. That evil spirit

148
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:52,660
must have chosen her to be his shield.

149
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,020
Evil spirit?

150
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:00,230
 This ghost remembers now.

151
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:04,300
 She witnessed your sister being hit-and-run by Officer Choi.

152
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:08,790
 And was going to report it and was harmed by Officer Choi.

153
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,950
 He's taken over by an evil spirit.

154
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,840
 It's wearing the image of a human.

155
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,080
He's still not answering?

156
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,510
What's going on? He's never done this before.

157
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,320
Nothing would have happened, would it, Mom?

158
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,850
Because of what happened to Officer Han and since the police station can't reach him, I'm so worried.

159
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:36,630
I'm sure nothing happened. He's not a child.

160
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,170
He's probably meeting a friend.

161
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:43,430
I noticed these role models have an impulse at least once to deviate.

162
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,390
That would be a relief.

163
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,000
But I keep having a bad feeling about it.

164
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:20,680
Mom, can you get that luggage behind the box down?

165
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,900
Where? That one?

166
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,560
Yes.

167
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:32,230
 Eun Hee, what is all this?

168
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:35,310
Mom, would you give me that wallet?

169
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,410
-This?
-Yes.

170
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,970
The cell phone.

171
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:41,910
Whose phone is this?

172
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,690
Oh my.

173
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,180
Eun Hee.

174
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:01,300
 Seon Woo, it's a good thing you came. What is all this?

175
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:07,140
Oppa, I can't get in touch with Seong Jae. And this.

176
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,940
Oh, I met Brother-in-law a little while ago,

177
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:16,800
he said his friend had some problem so he was going there. I forgot to call you.

178
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,680
Really?

179
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:22,460
My world, you should have called. She's been so worried.

180
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,110
Then what is this?

181
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:29,920
Why is this kind of stuff in Seong Jae's luggage? Officer Han's wallet and some stranger's cell phone, what is all this?

182
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:35,080
Is this evidence from his cases?

183
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:42,950
- He must be investigating it on his own. I'll ask him just in case. Don't worry too much about it. 
 - Ah, evidence.

184
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:47,480
 Why would he keep these things at home. It's so scary.

185
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,200
 He'll be back soon.

186
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,480
 Choi Seong Jae, Choi Seong Jae.

187
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:59,240
 Suspect, Choi Seong Jae. Choi Seong Jae. The cell phone location identified. All units make a perimeter of two kilometers for seize. Urgently mobilize.

188
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:13,700
Please stay back. Keep watch here.

189
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,280
This is Officer Choi's cell phone.

190
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,820
He purposely left this and fled.

191
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:47,880
Bong Seon, too.

192
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:12,950
My goodness, they must be like ghosts and know that the Chef isn't here today. There are so few customers.

193
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:19,320
I know. Eun Hee isn't here because she's sick, too. What's going on? And Chef went somewhere.

194
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:23,920
I know. Chef doesn't seem like himself in many ways lately.

195
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,880
My gosh, look at that.

196
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,010
Because the tiger isn't here, the fox is acting like the king in the tiger's den. Is he nuts or what?

197
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:30,900
Look at the way he is sitting there.

198
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,520
Look at that service saying he knows those customers. Is this his restaurant?

199
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:39,690
This, this is a spinach Shrek pasta. It's from our signature menu.

200
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:42,290
I developed this menu item.

201
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:43,360
 Oh, really?

202
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,260
 What is it called? Shoorek?

203
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,630
Not Shoorek. It's Shrek.

204
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,110
Shrek? Oh.

205
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:51,820
It's so good. So good.

206
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:56,960
Yeah, it's good. But my throat feels dry.

207
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,000
Then I'll help moisten it.

208
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:06,230
Dong Cheol! You know that Pommery, Pommery that came in, bring that with two champagne glasses. Quickly.

209
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:11,870
Those guys work under me, and with one word from me, they're afflicted with urinary incontinence.

210
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:18,540
Wow, Heo Min Soo. You're not the same loser from long ago. You've grown a lot.

211
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,140
Move, move, move.

212
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,480
The champagne is here.

213
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,780
Dong Cheol, is your recent concept

214
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:33,140
a larva? Move faster!

215
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,060
Dong Cheol Hyungnim.

216
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,750
Are you perhaps Dong Cheo, the leader of Yeongjingo?

217
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,300
Jeong Jin, Jeong Jin, You're Choi Jeong Jin!

218
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,430
How are you?

219
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,740
Have you been well?

220
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,760
Oh, yeah. It's been a long time.

221
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,040
It's really been a long time.

222
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,560
You're my senior, how can this Dong Cheol punk be your senior?

223
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,780
He isn't Dong Cheol punk.

224
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,620
 Hey, you don't know Jo Dong Cheol?

225
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:06,100
He is sunbae Jo Dong Cheol, who took care of Yeongjingo with his side kick.

226
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:10,220
Why bring up stories from long ago?

227
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:16,740
Oh, our Sous Chef was Yeongjingo junior?

228
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,140
Hey, bend over. I said to bend over.

229
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,580
Bend over comfortably.

230
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:26,010
 Properly bend over.

231
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:27,640
 This is my girlfriend.

232
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,820
 Oh, nice to meet you.

233
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:35,140
She's so pretty.

234
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:39,540
Where did this evil spirit flee to?

235
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,760
Let's see, let's see, let's see, let's see.

236
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:47,100
Let's look up, look down, look backward, look to the side.

237
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,760
Do you see something?

238
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,460
Unni.

239
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,100
I don't see anything.

240
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,740
But please keep trying. Keep trying until you see something.

241
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:04,180
You said you're skilled and finding a person is your specialty. Why can't you find her? Why not Na Bong Seon?

242
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,900
 I want to as well.

243
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,500
But my powers have been decreasing lately.

244
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:14,320
Unni, try somehow. We have to get a clue in order to find her.

245
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,300
 If something happens to her, I'll be sorry towards her and to Chef, so please.

246
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:25,120
 I get it, girl.  The two of you are staring at me like lasers, so I can't see a thing.

247
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,540
 Don't stare at me.

248
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,980
Fine, fine.

249
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:33,460
Let's see, let's see, let's see. Let's see again. Where is this?

250
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:38,600
I hear something coming. Oh!

251
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,340
Is it nearby Seoul? It's not too far, not far.

252
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,120
Nearby?

253
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:48,160
But something is interfering with the sound. What is it?

254
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,520
It's children.

255
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,600
-Children?
-Children?

256
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,480
 Yeah, there's lots of them.

257
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,040
 Heaven Orphanage

258
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,680
I'm kicking it. There!

259
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,940
The children like this so much.

260
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:23,480
There aren't many people who come personally and play with them.

261
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:28,560
Ah, yes. I just... well, since I grew up here, too.

262
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:34,980
I heard. I heard you donated that car as well.

263
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:38,640
Ah, yes.

264
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,480
Is the room livable?

265
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,200
It's been vacant for so long.

266
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,240
No, it's nice. I'm just here during my break.

267
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,100
Hello!

268
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,760
Hello!

269
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,140
Were you lonely, Na Bong Seon?

270
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:26,000
What is this? You're petrified.

271
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,640
I won't do anything to you that soon.

272
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:34,000
Then it wouldn't be any fun.

273
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,960
I heard there was a fire a few years ago.

274
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:19,120
 I have to get out of here somehow. Chef must be really worried.

275
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,520
 But where is this place?

276
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:28,440
 I think it took over an hour by car. I can't figure it out.

277
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:34,640
 But there's a familiar smell. What is this?

278
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,200
 Although there's consideration for quality and texture, but the key to Papillote

279
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:43,760
 is the fragrance of rosemary. That's more important.  Try smelling it.

280
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,250
 Mmmm.

281
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:50,840
 Rosemary.

282
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,580
 Oh, rosemary.

283
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:58,600
 That's it. It's the smell of rosemary.

284
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:03,810
 Herb farm

285
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:05,750
What's so ridiculous?

286
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:09,300
I'm asking for you to check around preschools and schools where children are, how is that ridiculous?

287
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:13,710
Of course, it can't be done. It's not like there is only one preschool in Seoul.

288
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,870
And on top of it, it isn't even a credible tip.

289
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:18,680
You're going off of a shaman's words.

290
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:22,280
It's not even adequate for a forensic science investigation. For someone who is educated, what are you doing?

291
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:27,300
But what about the police? What are the police doing now? Shouldn't they investigate whoever it's from?

292
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,390
A person is missing! She's been kidnapped!

293
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:33,870
Look, Kang Seon Woo. Don't you see us eating cup ramen while working because we don't even have time to eat?

294
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:37,250
We've reviewed all the CCTV nearby and we've been searching and questioning all night.

295
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,650
Just work a little harder.

296
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:42,210
I know you're distressed. But this isn't the only case.

297
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:45,360
It's hard for us, too.

298
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,880
 Officer Shin, how many times have I told you I like the fried kimchi cup ramen.

299
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,360
 I think this tastes better.

300
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,700
If your younger sister is missing, would you talk about forensic science investigation?

301
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:01,870
You'd even be banging your head against the bare ground. Na Bong Seon, just wait a little longer. I'll find you.

302
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:20,870
 Hello.

303
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:24,520
Have you seen her in this area?

304
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,660
I'm not sure. I don't think I've seen her.

305
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,510
I see.

306
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:36,660
Oh, is there another school other than this in the area?

307
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:50,020
-Ah, you can't.
-Let me just look around once.

308
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,270
I said you can't. Hey, think about it.

309
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:56,560
Who you like the idea of you opening up every room of a massage parlor?

310
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,760
I'll just look for a person. It's because this is near a school.

311
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,110
What are you saying? If you keep this up,

312
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:04,280
I'll report you to the police! Come here!

313
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:08,630
Seriously! Get out!

314
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,470
Oh, friend! You still haven't gone?

315
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:18,380
Wow, what are you going to do?

316
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:21,980
That isn't important right now. I need all of your help.

317
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:24,690
We have to find someone. It's a female in her 20s.

318
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:27,960
 She's about my height, her face is like a puppy and her eyes are like the half moon.

319
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,360
 Her hair is shoulder-length and she's being held by a man.

320
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,910
 And there are supposed to be a lot of children nearby.

321
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:38,500
 I have to find her. Please ask everyone to help.

322
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:44,340
She really is annoying. She was annoying when she was stirring up the neighborhood going around possessing bodies, but...aish.

323
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:49,350
Since my dislike for her is also an attachment, so I can't ignore her request.

324
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:53,840
Is there only one or two places with children? Including the orphanages.

325
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,370
What is that?

326
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,800
What is it? Do you see me?

327
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:17,030
What are you looking at?

328
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,470
This is all my fault.

329
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:37,810
I was careless with her and let my personal feelings be attached,

330
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:42,280
and carried out a taboo. I apologize.

331
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,180
Just once bestow your generosity.

332
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:53,170
I plead with you to give me strength to fight the evil spirits.

333
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:57,620
*Chant*

334
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:09,970
Na Bong Seon, where in the world are you? Where are you hiding?

335
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:12,000
Huh?

336
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:25,110
 But what about you? You said you didn't have much time.

337
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:31,130
I should have been the one to get caught. I shouldn't have run away.

338
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:34,750
I'm sorry.

339
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:37,610
Hey, you still haven't found her, have you?

340
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:41,410
No. I have to find her.

341
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:44,220
She opened her heart to me with a lot of difficulty and worried about me.

342
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,070
If something happens to her,

343
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:51,190
You're so... as a ghost, you're quite humane.

344
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:56,230
I mean, the only one clue is where there are many children,

345
00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:02,140
I even checked all the orphanages. There isn't anyone even similar to the girl you possessed.

346
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:05,900
I was scared by someone who sees ghosts though.

347
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:09,650
Someone who sees ghosts?

348
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:14,510
He had a lot of energy, looking like a beanpole.

349
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:18,190
Why does everyone see ghosts lately? Is it a trend?

350
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:20,090
It's getting harder to survive.

351
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:24,000
In what way was the energy strong?

352
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:58,260
Even if you'll be rid of when the time comes... Here.

353
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:09,020
Officer Choi. Turn yourself at least now.

354
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:14,020
For the sake of your family who cares for you, no, for Eun Hee.

355
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,570
For Eun Hee's sake at least.

356
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:17,430
Shut up!

357
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:22,830
Who said to talk?

358
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,520
I can't stand people who talk too much.

359
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:35,660
 Choi Seong Jae. Choi Seong Jae.

360
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,190
Yes!

361
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:43,120
 I wanted to move the children's dresser,

362
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,420
 but because we're all women,

363
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,490
 Of course, I should help you.

364
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,370
 Kiddo,

365
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:03,140
 I can see you. I'm not a bad person so don't be scared.

366
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:06,040
 Have you moved an object before?

367
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:09,150
 That cell phone over there. Can you kick it this way?

368
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,380
 Yeah, that one.

369
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:50,840
Who put water on my apron? Is it you? It's you, right?

370
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,120
-Is it you? Is it you?
-It's not!

371
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,550
- You're going to die! 
- I said it wasn't me!

372
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:58,230
Where did you leave it? Where did you leave it?

373
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:03,620
He probably left it near the sink. One should take care of one's own apron.

374
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:08,040
I knew it. I knew you would antagonize.

375
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:11,320
 What is it? What is it? Why is it so noisy? What?

376
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,970
What? Is there a problem? What? What is it? It's so hot!

377
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:18,520
The kids seemed to be out of energy, so I was giving guidance...

378
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,980
-What? What? What?
-I'll go clean up some poop.

379
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:24,880
Clean up some poop? Go then.

380
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,600
Wow, Dong Cheol Hyungnim is the best.

381
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,080
If we knew it would be like this, you should have come out sooner.

382
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:37,990
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. You never know how a person's life will change in an instant.

383
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,890
Chef!

384
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:42,940
Is everything alright?

385
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:46,390
I'm sorry for not being here.

386
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,990
Yes, this is Kang Seon Woo.

387
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,000
Is this Bong Seon?

388
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,670
This is Na Bong Seon, isn't it? Right?

389
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,610
Where are you now?

390
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:11,020
What? What? Can you not speak?

391
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,570
Is that it?

392
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:17,910
Oh, okay, then can you text me? Hang up and text me where you're at.

393
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:19,770
Hurry.

394
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:47,590
 Rosemary

395
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:30,620
Rosemary. What is this?

396
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:33,000
Rosemary. What is this?

397
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,850
Does it mean that she smells rosemary?

398
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,970
What is it, Chef? Did something happen to Bong Seon?

399
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:41,250
Where do we get our rosemary?

400
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:45,690
I'm not sure. It changes each time. There's Yongshin Herb Nation and Anseong, too.

401
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:49,780
Why rosemary? Did Bong Seon go following rosemary?

402
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:54,190
This rosemary,

403
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,380
Eun Hee is growing it, isn't she?

404
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:00,670
Yeah, she said she bought it coming back from somewhere with Officer Choi. I think she said there's an herb farm nearby,

405
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:03,150
and she seems to be raising it with much care.

406
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:05,070
With Brother-in-law?

407
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:12,620
 Heaven Orphanage

408
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,900
 Seobinggo

409
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,120
Yes.

410
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,340
 This is a tip that just came in through that ghost's ears.

411
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,580
 She said she saw some guy who sees ghosts.

412
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:27,720
Could it be that the place she saw him was near an orphanage?

413
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,290
 Yeah, that's right. Is there a connection?

414
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:34,030
It's where he grew up. Heaven Orphanage which is in Namyangju.

415
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,800
Yes, officer, this is Kang Seon Woo.

416
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:40,140
I think we've located them. The text I just sent you, please track the location.

417
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:44,160
And please come to Heaven Orphanage in Namyangju. Quickly.

418
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,670
Ahjussi, Heaven Orphanage in Namyangju.

419
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:01,820
-Unni, quadruple!
-Quadruple!

420
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:17,060
 What's happening, Seong Jae?

421
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:24,430
 Oppa said it's nothing. That I'm being overly sensitive.

422
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:28,160
 But I don't think it is.

423
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,320
Something is going on, isn't it?

424
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,210
Hello?

425
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:43,480
Hello, Seong Jae?

426
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:47,490
Yeah. It's me.

427
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:49,300
Are you at the restaurant?

428
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:53,760
No. At home. Where are you?

429
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,940
Where are you now? Is something wrong?

430
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:02,730
No. I had something to think about. To clear my head.

431
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:04,320
So,

432
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,190
did Hyungnim say anything about me?

433
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:10,200
Just not to worry.

434
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,730
 But I'm so worried, Seong Jae.

435
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:16,840
You didn't go to clear your head.

436
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:21,120
What is it? Can't you just tell me honestly?

437
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:25,170
 Is it something bad?

438
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:29,070
No. I'll call you back.

439
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:30,980
 Seong Jae.

440
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:38,080
 I don't know what it's about, but I'm on your side no matter what.

441
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,450
I trust you.

442
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:43,230
 You're a good person.

443
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:46,210
 Seong Jae.

444
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:52,430
Seong Jae?

445
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:14,680
First, start search the inside.

446
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,540
 How can you all go that way, come this way, too! Seriously!

447
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:19,650
Officer Shin, you look this way.

448
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:22,840
Not that way! This way!

449
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,650
No, this way!

450
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,610
2368

451
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:09,100
Isn't that Chef Kang's car?

452
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:12,060
And in front of that is Officer Kang's car, 2368.

453
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:14,500
Excuse me! That car!

454
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:01,650
Stop! Stop!

455
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:05,080
Chef!

456
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:09,600
Ah!

457
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,330
It's okay.

458
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,780
You're okay.

459
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:19,760
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

460
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:28,950
Na Bong Seon! Na Bong Seon, are you okay?

461
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:33,280
I'm sorry, this is because of me.

462
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:37,150
What about Officer Choi, that evil guy.

463
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:38,560
He just left.

464
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,870
That rotten...

465
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:42,520
Let me use your car, virile man Chef.

466
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:43,740
You're going to drive?

467
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:46,310
It's a do-or-die situation.

468
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:52,720
Unni, slow down a little.

469
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,080
Hey, why does a ghost have so much fear?

470
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:59,540
Have you ever seen anyone slowing down during a car chase?

471
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:03,000
I'm the one who would die. You won't die again, girl!

472
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:38,620
This evil guy is gone. Where did he flee to?

473
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,640
Unni.

474
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:45,800
Blood.

475
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,430
This is a situation I didn't anticipate.

476
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:53,820
What kind of Hansel and Gretel is this? It's not even bread.

477
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:56,260
Hey, let's follow it.

478
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:43,170
She just fell asleep.

479
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:12,030
Thank you, Na Bong Seon. For coming back safely.

480
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:28,790
The blood trail was cut off midway. Where did he go?

481
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:31,940
He probably couldn't go far in that condition.

482
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:35,360
Unni.

483
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,020
Over there.

484
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:43,860
I can feel the dark and violent energy.

485
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:46,840
And I think I can smell blood.

486
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,400
Let's go.

487
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,220
That scared me!

488
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:15,480
I'm a bit impish so I can't even watch horror movies.

489
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,960
It's easier catching a ghost.

490
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,820
Be quiet. Are you advertising that we're here?

491
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:22,520
Okay!

492
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,700
Hey, shh. Up there.

493
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:00,820
Unni!

494
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,500
You did a good job following me.

495
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:19,060
All the way here.

496
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:20,720
Why did you do it?

497
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,600
If you didn't have bad intentions, I wouldn't have died.

498
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:27,520
Quit whining!

499
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:06,160
 Seong Jae, I'm on your side no matter what.

500
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:11,440
 You're a good person. Today was a long day.

501
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,100
 -What about you?
-I was busy, too.

502
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,560
 Hold on tight. Hold tight.

503
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:20,380
 Seong Jae, you can get irritable with me from time to time, too.

504
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:23,220
 How can a person always be so angelic?

505
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:26,420
 But don't get hurt. I don't like you getting hurt.

506
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:28,240
 -What are you doing?
-You're not wearing anything, are you?

507
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,080
 Do you know how much those cost?

508
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,960
 -Those underwear cost $200!
-I'm not looking!

509
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,220
 You're suspicious.

510
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:39,340
 This is Officer Choi's.

511
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:43,250
 The rice quantities are different.

512
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:46,500
 Leave it out after you're done eating. Thank you.

513
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:49,740
 You tie them so uniquely.

514
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:54,660
 I tie them this way. So they don't come undone easily.

515
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:12,320

516
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,880
 Oh my Ghostess 
 ~Preview~

517
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:35,100
 I think it was fate that you came to me.

518
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:39,860
 I didn't know that and the one who killed my daughter...

519
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:43,880
 When he fainted he also suffered a stroke. I think you should be prepared for the worst.

520
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:46,220
 Please save him!

521
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:51,080
 The meaning of these flowers is unfading love. Forever love.

522
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:54,360
 It's today. My three year anniversary.

523
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,440
 I'm telling you to possess me.

524
00:58:56,440 --> 00:59:01,640
 Chef, you have me. I'll protect you.
