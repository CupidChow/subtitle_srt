00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,580
 Today's special Oh My Ghostess

2
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,400
  Park Bo Young

3
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,850
  Jo Jeong Suk

4
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,260
  Im Joo Hwan

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,260
  Kim Seul Gi

6
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,620
  Oh My Ghostess

7
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,670
 Oh. what should I do?

8
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,520
 Na Bong Seon! Please listen to what I have to say!

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,140
 My father fainted, but no one knows.

10
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,710
 Please, you have to call 911.

11
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,580
I don't know. I don't know. I can't hear anything.

12
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,890
I don't know anything.
- You're the only one right now who can help me.

13
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,120
 Please. My father is dying.

14
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,700
Stop doing this to me. Go.

15
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,930
 It's my father!

16
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,700
 It's not anyone, but it's my father. How I act like I don't know?

17
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,960
 Even if I'm a ghost, how can I just watch?

18
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,100
 Please, just call.

19
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,710
 I'm begging you like this. Please.

20
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,420
Na Bong Seon! Na Bong Seon where are you?

21
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:31,230

22
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:55,260
Is this 911? This is Yongsan-gu, Wonhyoro #24, Transport Eatery.

23
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,290
Hurry up and come! My father fainted!

24
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,520
 Thank you. Thank you.

25
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,820
Ah, where have you been!?

26
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,390
We can't even go to shoot because of you!
-What?

27
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,730
Hurry up and go. Hurry!

28
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:19,520
I understand. I'm going right now. Ow, my arm.

29
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,110
My arm.
-Na Bong Seon! Na Bong!

30
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,430
You-

31
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,240
Yes, the cast is on standby.

32
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,870
We'll immediately go into the shoot, so come in.

33
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,630
Hey, Na Bong Seon, are you alright?

34
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,190
Well, yes...

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,700
 I'm going crazy. I have to hurry up and go to Father.

36
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,840
Hey, Na Bong Seon, listen carefully to me.

37
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,690
Don't get nervous and relax your arms. If people next to you talk, just kneed the dough.

38
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:48,440
I'll do whatever I can for the loss of flour.

39
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,130
Yes.

40
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:58,680
Now, there isn't much time. Both team's hands are moving faster.

41
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,440
It seems like Chef Kang Seon Woo's team is making salmon-chive pancakes.

42
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,520
Yes, but an unfortunate accident happened when they dropped some flour.

43
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,680
According to the rules, you cannot supplement the ingredients.
-This is not enough.

44
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,940
I'm a bit worried about how they're going to overcome this difficulty.

45
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:23,340
Yes... The flour is not enough.

46
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,480
But instead of flour

47
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,860
she is mixing bean flour and mixed grain powder.

48
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:35,530
Will the dough work?
-Maybe
--Dad, wait I'll be there soon.

49
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:39,530
 Episode 6

50
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,220
You've worked hard.
-Yes, you've worked hard.

51
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,200
Chef, you killed it.

52
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,740
It was really incredible. Congratulations. You've worked hard.

53
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,850
You've worked hard.

54
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,410
 Emergency

55
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,350
Father.

56
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,220
Where is he?

57
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,730
90

58
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,820
One hundred.

59
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,970
One hundred.
-One hundred.

60
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,110
Father...

61
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,930
Father...

62
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,390
It's a relief. You're okay, right?

63
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:38,600
I was really scared.

64
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,760
He needs to do more tests, but it's early stages of
 hepatic cirrhosis.

65
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,480
Pardon? Hepatic cirrhosis?

66
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,240
Yes, it looks like it might be alcoholic liver cirrhosis. But fortunately the count isn't high.

67
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,280
If there's no inflammation in the biliary tract, I think outpatient treatment is possible.

68
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,930
Of course, he has to stop drinking.

69
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:00,460
Yes, yes. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you!

70
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,220
I'll fix your pillow.

71
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:11,320
Thank you. You're really better than my son.

72
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,090
But how did you know?

73
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:20,570
I visited your restaurant, but a neighborhood person said that you were taken by the ambulance.

74
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:25,040
But something bad could have happened! It's a good thing it was only this.

75
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,930
So that's why I told you to stop drinking. Look at how your face darkened.

76
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,190
Do you think your liver would be okay after drinking alcohol with an empty stomach?

77
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:37,740
You really seem like my daughter when you nag like that.

78
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:45,400
You might have unconsciously said it, but you called me Father.

79
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,760
While I was dizzy, I felt like my daughter came back to life.

80
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:55,310
It was for a moment, but it was nice.

81
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,590
Daugh-

82
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,590
You can think of me as a daughter.

83
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:08,620
That's right. You already seem like my daughter.

84
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,100
Yes...
 -Dad!

85
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,160
Dad! Dad!

86
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,720
Dad!

87
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,180
Hey, kid. What's the fuss? Your dad is okay.

88
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:23,110
Do you know how shocked I was when I heard that you rode the emergency ambulance?

89
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:26,760
Like when it happened to Noona. I thought like I was going to be an orphan.

90
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,570
You're really bad.
-You bastard.

91
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,610
I should just!

92
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:35,530
Hey, a person who is this worried you left to this condition?

93
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:39,110
What are you? Why are you here again?

94
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,660
Come here. Talk with me.
-Talk about what?

95
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,320
Come here, you bastard.

96
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,610
Hey, hey! Let go!

97
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,880
Ah, really.
-Hey, it hurts. Let go of this.

98
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,410
Get your act together. Father has hepatic cirrhosis!

99
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,300
Hepatic cirrhosis? Is it severe?

100
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,430
If it was severe, you'd already be dead in my hands.

101
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:03,660
You... You should really get a hold over yourself. What were you doing while your dad was like that?

102
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,980
You should have stopped him from drinking since before.

103
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,290
Your words are really informal.

104
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:10,240
Do I look like I'd care about that when your dad might die?

105
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,610
It's my dad. Is it your dad?

106
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:16,170
Even if you're sad, I'm more sad. And if you're worried, I'm more worried.

107
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:19,970
Why are you cos-playing  like a daughter-in-law? Even though you like me that much.

108
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,530
Hey! This jerk!

109
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,770
Please get a hold of yourself.

110
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,590
Your dad has to stay one day at the hospital and take some tests.

111
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:32,520
You. You better not lock yourself down playing games, but look after him.

112
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:39,950
This is the first woman to hit my head except for my older sister.

113
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,680
Chef Kang?

114
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,710
Congratulations for second win. Bean powder salmon pancake. Wow...

115
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,790
It's fresh.

116
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:54,260
Don't do tag next time. It's not even a joke.

117
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:58,170
I have no choice. We have to change the format.

118
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,930
But what about Miss Bong Seon?

119
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:03,530
Seeing her before, I saw her running out. Is she alright?

120
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:07,000
I don't know either if she's okay or not.

121
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,250
Actually, I got called by the CP (Chief-Producer).

122
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:14,360
He must have been watching the recording. He said that if it had been live, it would have been a live accident.

123
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,700
He asked if it revealed an inexperienced assistant.

124
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,980
You got scolded.

125
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:22,770
It's not the problem of getting scolded. The CP suggested we should change her.

126
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:23,920
Who? Na Bong Seon?

127
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,360
It seems like the assistant's work might increase. What if today's accident happens again?

128
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,790
Hey, but still.

129
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:35,490
You said it would be difficult to make changes while winning, sheesh.

130
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:40,200
Does your broadcasting station always go change what they say a lot? Do they fire someone just because of one mistake?

131
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,800
Why do you react like that? In a CP's point of view, that can happen.

132
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,300
Forget that. I don't have any thought of that so if you're going to fire her, fire me too, as a set.

133
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:53,410
And that bean powder salmon pancake, it was Na Bong Seon's idea.

134
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:56,330
She redeemed herself.

135
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,940
I'm leaving.

136
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,390
Seon Woo, why are you so sensitive about that?

137
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,590
So Hyeong.

138
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:07,930
I'm not sensitive but you are, no, you guys are insensitive.

139
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:12,720
When I hire those who work under me, I decide after at least half a year.

140
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,260
Even then if I don't think they're a fit, then I'll find a place for them before sending them away.

141
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:20,870
Why? That is good manners towards people.

142
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,480
It's a relief that's all that happened.

143
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,750
Before, even the sky looked yellow.

144
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,580
Na Bong Seon, is it you again?

145
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:44,200
I'm sorry. Just think that it's your fate. What can you do?

146
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:50,030
I'll do well. Do you think I'll do something horrible?

147
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,920
Aigoo...

148
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,880
Is she not here yet?

149
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,810
She's a strange girl.

150
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:23,850
After running out like that,

151
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,790
where is she that she isn't back yet?

152
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,380
A kid whose mind comes and goes as it is.

153
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,750
  Hello?

154
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,000
Hey, Na Bong Seon, where are you right now!?

155
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,540
  Why? Are you worrying about me, Chef?

156
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:58,030
Worrying? That's crazy.

157
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,540
Hey do you know because of you really--

158
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,240
Ah where are you right now?

159
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,760
 I'm a little far away right now.

160
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,010
  Oh the connection can't-h-hello? Chef?

161
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,360
Hello?

162
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:14,600
Seriously, how far away is she that...?

163
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,150
Did something happen to her grandmother in the countryside?

164
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,930
Tada! Surprise!

165
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,650
Hey, you said you were far away.

166
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,960
Even from far off I can come right away.

167
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:34,090
Because I'm someone who lives in Chef's heart every day.

168
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:37,920
Oh, that's right. How did the recording go? Did it get wrapped up?

169
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,480
You were really startled earlier, weren't you?

170
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,900
Why?

171
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,530
Are you having a manic episode again? That cycle came again?

172
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:51,900
I'm not sure.

173
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:57,070
I think it might be and I think it might not be.

174
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,720
Ah, aigoo!

175
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,680
Where are you lying down again?

176
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,890
Here. Can't we just lie down together for a bit right here?

177
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,660
Here, here, here. Come here.

178
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,960
Quick. Get up.

179
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,480
Then five minutes!

180
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,300
- It's because I have something to say! 
 - One minute, one minute!

181
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,730
I have something to say!

182
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,760
Ah, seriously. Get up!

183
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,270
It's because I have something to say to you. I can't do it here.

184
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,330
Seriously!

185
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:27,030
Just tell me here!

186
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:30,230
But outside is a little...

187
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,340
No, what does it matter?

188
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:37,370
There's a spiciness to being outside, too.

189
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,350
What is it? What are we going to do here?

190
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,240
I want to talk...

191
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,020
I said I wanted to talk to you.

192
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,340
What is it that you want to do?

193
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:54,590
-You already know.
-Stop messing around.

194
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,200
What is your dream really?

195
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,890
Dream?

196
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:02,010
My dream. I only have one thing. Doing it with Chef once.

197
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,600
Are you going to keep joking around?

198
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,830
I'm not joking though.

199
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:13,050
You're not cooking to just keep yourself busy, are you?

200
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,390
Do you really want to become a chef?

201
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:18,820
Well... Maybe.

202
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,240
Do you want me to train you?

203
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,150
What? What training?

204
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:26,240
I have to keep doing the broadcast.

205
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,720
And there's no guarantee something like today won't happen again.

206
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,130
That dried pollack soup or today's bean powder pancakes,

207
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:35,810
it does seem like you have ability to use your wits.

208
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:37,940
But your know-how of the basics is weak.

209
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,440
So? You're going to give me lessons?

210
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,920
Of course, I'd like that. Deal!

211
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,840
Stop joking around. If I do it, I'm going to be tough on you.

212
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,660
There would be no allure if you didn't. Tough guys are the best!

213
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,790
Deal, deal, deal. Totally, deal!

214
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,240
Ah, seriously.

215
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,270
Deal?

216
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,630
I got it. Follow me.

217
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,490
We're starting today?

218
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:04,200
Ah, he really is getting tough.

219
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:09,420
Starting back at the beginning, let's work on knife skills.

220
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,770
Okay! I can do this much.

221
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,640
Good job.

222
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,820
There's a big difference in the one you sliced here from the one in the middle.

223
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,250
They're not uniform. How do you make them consistent?

224
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,310
Since it's bent, stand it up, like this.

225
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,150
See, aren't they uniform?

226
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:38,090
They really are.

227
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:40,880
Slowly, slowly. So they're uniform.

228
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,550
If you slice the onions this way,

229
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,960
Look. When you stir-fry it, the texture is good.

230
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:50,030
The texture is good, but it loses its sweetness. And it takes longer to cook.

231
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,380
But try slicing it the other direction.

232
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,790
If you slice it the other way,

233
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:58,840
it will bring out the sweetness quicker. Because it will lose the water.

234
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,590
Then time is shortened, but on the other hand it becomes pulpy.

235
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:06,160
It becomes mushy. Mushy. So what should you do?

236
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,810
- Mix it?
- Bingo!

237
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,420
You catch on quicker than I expected.

238
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,580
When I was in school, I've never been pushed out of the top ten spot.

239
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,260
Okay, okay, now slice some more.

240
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,760
I can't compliment you.

241
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,410
My arms hurt so much that I can't continue.

242
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:28,040
You have to master your knife skills in order to move to the next step.

243
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,880
Why all this suffering?

244
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:33,810
Ow, I cut myself! I cut myself!

245
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:36,870
-Hey!
- Blood!

246
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,380
- Do you want to die? 
 - No~

247
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,900
So that's why I'm saying let's stop.

248
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,830
If you keep doing this, I might just jump you, Chef.

249
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:51,530
Stop playing, and just slice the rest of this.

250
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:54,870
Oh, stop! Oh, are we going to stop, or do more?

251
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,750
Okay, let go! Let go!

252
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,440
-What are you going to do?
-First, let go.

253
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,800
- Are we doing more? More?
- Okay, okay, we'll stop.

254
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,340
-Are we going to stop?
-Okay, I won't.

255
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,560
-Really?
-Let's stop.

256
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,360
Even if we stop, let's stay like this for a moment.

257
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,760
You said to stop!

258
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,100
It's nice.

259
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:23,190
Compared to sleeping in the dining hall, this is like a hotel.

260
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,930
She doesn't know this is all thanks to me.

261
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:29,670
Na Bong Seon, this girl.

262
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:37,040
This guy's lesson was really tough.

263
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:43,030
They say, a boy and a girl should not sit together after they have reached the age of seven.

264
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:48,050
After being together like this...

265
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:30,330
Oh, how could this be?

266
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:34,520
Ah, wait! But what is my virile man doing right now?

267
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,270
Is he stark naked after taking a shower?

268
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:49,070
Chef! Are you asleep?

269
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:58,960
Wow, it's a volatile situation. Seriously, wow.

270
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,140
Wow, her timing. She doesn't miss a beat.

271
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,920
Geez, he locked it. That's mean.

272
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,450
This person is always so alert.

273
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,910
Hey, doggie!

274
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,170
Why don't you at least acknowledge me?

275
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:23,190
Are you going to be this cold because I asked you to be quiet?

276
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,780
Huh?

277
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:29,040
Fine. I'm sure you have some pride.

278
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,860
I got it. Let's not meet eyes if we don't have to. Ha!

279
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,500
Sleep.

280
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,580
What is this?

281
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,820
- What is all this?
- Wow!

282
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:53,600
Good morning!

283
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,580
-What?
-What is all this?

284
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,370
What else would it be? They're sliced vegetables.

285
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,140
So why are there sliced vegetables? Nobody asked for them.

286
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,080
I did them, why?

287
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,070
Vegetables can only be sliced with your permission?

288
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,860
No, Chef. If you needed them, you could have told me. I could have done it.

289
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,550
-What is today's special?
-Shrek pasta.

290
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:13,370
To be precise, on June 28, 2015, I developed and

291
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:18,070
received a warm round of applause from the staff for, spinach Shrek pasta is on the special menu, Chef!

292
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:21,760
-Okay. Today's special will be vegetable spring rolls.
-Yes, so today...

293
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,590
What?

294
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:26,510
Where did that suddenly come from? I've been waiting for today.

295
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,450
We have to use what we have first.

296
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,230
- Let's do Shrek tomorrow.
-Yes, Chef!

297
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,140
Let's check the stock and hall appearance, let's hurry.

298
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,960
 Yes, sir!

299
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,990
I upgraded the recipe because I thought he said we're going with Shrek.

300
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,990
Is it right to change menu so radically?

301
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:45,560
Isn't the special usually up to the Chef?

302
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:51,630
Abo! Vegetable spring roll-

303
00:19:56,060 --> 00:20:00,330
Hey, why did you say you did it? You could have just said that I did it.

304
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:04,430
Would Min Soo feel good knowing that the special got pushed back because of you, Youngest?

305
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:10,130
And also, there could be a misunderstanding if they find out you're practicing separately, so watch what you say.

306
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,540
What misunderstanding?

307
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:14,500
Seriously.

308
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:19,280
Whatever misunderstanding.

309
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:24,800
He can be so cute sometimes.

310
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,950
Then it just makes me want to do more!

311
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,220
What do you want to do?

312
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,640
What?

313
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:34,440
Exercise. Exercise.

314
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,630
My body feels so stiff these days.

315
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:41,870
Bong Seon, you must be feeling better today.

316
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:45,470
Your expression was dark for a few days, so I was worried.

317
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:49,640
Thank you so much for your concern.

318
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,030
But it puts a little burden on me.

319
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,320
 Today's Special
Vegetable Spring Rolls
Salad

320
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:08,480
Oh that's right. Father is getting discharged today.

321
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,610
Who is this?

322
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,060
-Hello?
-Hey, it's me.

323
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,340
Where are you? Right now? Did father get discharged?

324
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:25,680
We are now, why? If you're so curious, why didn't you come?

325
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,130
Hey, be quiet. Take good care of him.

326
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:31,530
Make sure to take care of meals. I'm busy so I'm hanging up.

327
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,200
Hello?

328
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:40,650
When did she get my number? I didn't expect that.

329
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,730
Was it Bong Seon?

330
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:47,930
She's so spirited the more I get to know her.

331
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,790
And she's so caring.

332
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:54,320
Don't go giving your heart to her, Father. I haven't made up  my mind yet.

333
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,380
This kid.

334
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:01,220
 Na Bong Seon

335
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,980
What are you doing Officer Choi?

336
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:13,470
Ahjusshi!

337
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,820
I went on my rounds yesterday and stopped by.

338
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,220
I was so startled after hearing that you had collapsed and been taken away by ambulance.

339
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,590
My goodness, I see you were.

340
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:34,570
But,

341
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:37,510
can you be discharged so quickly?

342
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:40,570
Fortunately, I was discovered quickly.

343
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:44,570
My liver isn't doing well, but they say it'll get better with outpatient treatment.

344
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:48,420
Ah, that's really a relief.

345
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,040
But,

346
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,560
who discovered you?

347
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,500
I don't know. That's a mystery to us, too.

348
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:01,120
According to the ambulance driver, they said a daughter called 911. But my deceased sister wouldn't have come back to life.

349
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,140
Daughter?

350
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:10,380
They must have been mistaken.

351
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,490
But wait. Should I get you a drink?

352
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:17,410
-No, please stay seated.
-No, no, no.

353
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:20,220
Here, have one of these.

354
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:24,570
I'm always sorry and thankful to you.

355
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,510
You always come and stop by.

356
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:28,280
Not at all.

357
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:33,190
Please take care of your health, and don't drink so much. You're getting older.

358
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,000
Yeah.

359
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:42,290
Bye!

360
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:03,010
The mixed noodles taste really good today.

361
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:06,580
Yeah, right. There's more vegetables than noodles.

362
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:11,290
What kind of sliced vegetables situation is this? Sliced vegetable mixed noodles, vegetable spring rolls, and there's still leftover sliced vegetables.

363
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:15,250
But wasn't it well-received? It seemed like it sold a lot during the day.

364
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:18,000
The chef came up with that. Last year.

365
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:22,000
Really? That was a great idea.

366
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,690
Isn't our chef impressive?

367
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:28,640
I think he's developed over a hundred menu items?

368
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,860
Wow. Even though it seems like he only plays, I guess a chef is a chef.

369
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:39,020
Next to every pro, is a real pro that supports that pro. That's me.

370
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:44,260
How much consulting did I do on seasoning it? In consideration for that, he shouldn't have dissed Shrek, don't you think so?

371
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:47,320
You guys know, too. That the menu items that I okay do well.

372
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,540
That's not true. Only the ones that you said wouldn't work were big hits.

373
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,090
What are you saying?

374
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:57,700
Hey, why again? Our sous-chef is the best!

375
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:02,130
All over Korea know that our Sous-Chef is the best. The nation's best.

376
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:04,880
The people's sous chef. Please give me a chopstick full.

377
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,740
Cheers!

378
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:11,600
If you've finished eating, Bong, come with me. So we can go to the fish market.

379
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,690
What? The fish market?

380
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:17,200
Again? You took Bong yesterday to buy groceries.

381
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,840
It's because there's a lot to carry.

382
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,240
And Min Soo, prepare the spinach Shrek for tonight's special.

383
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,590
Thank you! I'll show you how it's prepared!

384
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,670
Be back soon!

385
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,060
How long has it been, right?

386
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,320
Where's the spinach?

387
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,720
In the fridge.

388
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,830
But isn't chef keeping Bong stuck to him like gum lately?

389
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,300
The way he talks to her is totally different from before.

390
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:53,540
The gaze is different. When they look at each other, the affection just sparkles.

391
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:56,750
Is it a trend to flip-flop? Bong flips and flops.

392
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,800
Chef flips and flops.

393
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,870
Hyungnim!

394
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:05,940
Are you going somewhere?

395
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,210
I'm going to look at bass and scallops at the fish market. Are you here to see Eun Hee?

396
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:11,050
Yes, today is the day she goes to the hospital.

397
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:16,040
Ah, really? Then take her home after going to the hospital. No need to come back.

398
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,340
Wait. Just a moment.

399
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,970
Hello.

400
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,830
You look like you feel better today.

401
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:25,990
Yes, well, so-so.

402
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:30,820
At the police station last time, you looked exhausted, so I was worried. It's a relief.

403
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,690
The police station?

404
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:35,260
Yes.

405
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,940
Early the day before yesterday. Don't you remember, Bong Seon?

406
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:43,100
The day before yesterday, yeah, the police station. I remember!

407
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,730
Right? Yeah, I was, at the police station.

408
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,780
Go.

409
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:53,160
Then, goodbye.

410
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,630
Bye!

411
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,860
Pay good attention, and look carefully.

412
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,690
People who cook need to have discernment when looking at ingredients.

413
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,370
Of course I have discernment.

414
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:09,430
Stop playing around.

415
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:14,070
Discernment doesn't just happen. You have to touch and feel for yourself.

416
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,500
What are you doing?

417
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,190
-You said to touch and feel.
-The food.

418
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:21,070
Food.

419
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:24,260
Ah, I want to take a bite of you!

420
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,400
Aunt!

421
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,640
Oh, son! You came?

422
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,010
You curled your hair!

423
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:32,660
Indeed, there's nobody who can follow my son.

424
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:36,850
You're drop dead pretty. I want to buy you a hair clip, but I'm afraid you'd cheat on me so I can't.

425
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:42,130
I know you're just saying it. But why does it make me feel so good? Is it because you're good-looking?

426
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:45,000
Is it because I'm handsome?

427
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,770
Did these scallops come in this morning?

428
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:51,570
They came recently from the east sea. They're fresh. Look at them.

429
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,360
It's tightly shut that there's nothing to see.

430
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:00,210
Oh, they're good. 5kg of this. 5kg that is more like 6kg, as you know?

431
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,720
After hearing I'm pretty, why wouldn't I?

432
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,400
-Move, move, move!
-It's cold!

433
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:14,430
Oh, what do I do? It's wet inside.

434
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:21,540
Put these on. Aunt is especially loaning them.

435
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,760
The design is too uncouth.

436
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,510
We're not here to play. We have to walk around a lot more, so put these on quickly.

437
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,640
The size looks wrong.

438
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:46,760
I mean, if you were going to bring some anyway, you could have brought something prettier.

439
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,990
Before I cover it with a plastic bag, keep quiet.

440
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,820
The things you put me through.

441
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,950
Ah, looks yummy! This must be a hot spot, right?

442
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:03,560
I'll eat well!

443
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,070
What is it now?

444
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:09,500
A chef eats food once with their eyes, then the nose and then the mouth. You eat it three times.

445
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,740
What are you talking about?

446
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:16,360
First, take a look. Then smell with your nose.

447
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:19,780
In case I wouldn't know you're a chef.

448
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:24,110
Look. Smell. What smell...?

449
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:28,010
Why would they have left these?

450
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,720
What are you doing? Those aren't ours.

451
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:34,880
They're perfectly fine. Isn't it a waste? They're not even touched.

452
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:38,540
What do you think you're doing?

453
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:43,070
So they aren't. I'm sorry. I thought you left.

454
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:46,950
I'm sorry. Sorry.

455
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:50,450
I'm sorry. She thought you had left so she took them.

456
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,710
By chance, are you Kang Seon Woo?

457
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:58,940
Yes, that's right. Do you want an autograph?

458
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:04,190
Hey, don't you recognize me? Daemyungsoo School, 1st year, Room 4. Park Jin Seob!

459
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:09,420
I kept hearing about you from Kim Young Soo's wife. How did I run into you here?

460
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:13,190
Ah, Jin Seob. It's been a long time.

461
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:18,570
It's so good to see you. But how do you have time to be here?

462
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,880
So you came out to buy ingredients.

463
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,980
I guess you would be. My office is nearby.

464
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,520
Ah, I see.

465
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,330
I'm supposed to see the guys tonight. They'll be glad to hear I saw you.

466
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:36,720
They spoke of you at times.

467
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:42,100
Then do you want to come to my restaurant later? I'll treat you.

468
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:45,990
Really? We'd like that. Being treated to by a star chef.

469
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:47,700
We're really going then. You're being sincere, right?

470
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,850
Would I just be saying it?

471
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:52,320
So you're coming with Cheol Min and everybody, right?

472
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,900
Of course. I should let the guys know.

473
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:05,160
You weren't very close with that friend earlier, were you?

474
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:09,650
Seeing your expression, it didn't seem you were that excited to see him.

475
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:11,840
Let's just go quietly.

476
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:26,890
 Ah, Kang Seon Woo, why are you going there? You're in the way.

477
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:29,750
 - I'm sorry. 
- Give me the ball.

478
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:35,820
 Hey, loser. How come you kick like a girl?

479
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,850
 I'm sorry, Cheol Min.

480
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,220
 It's fine.

481
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:43,320
 Isn't he a totally loser or what? He gets hit and says sorry to me.

482
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,060
 Father!

483
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,080
Father, I saw god.

484
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,770
Aigo, what are you fussing about again?

485
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:00,580
It's not that. Look at this, Father.

486
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:03,400
I went into Noona's room for scissors and this was spread out in the open.

487
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,310
It must be her stash. Let's split it in half between us.

488
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:11,730
Ah, I didn't have any money, this turned out well. Noona, thank you!

489
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:15,360
Leave it. Put it back in her room, just like it was.

490
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,650
Why? Let's just use it, Father.

491
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:23,060
If I say to put it back, then put it back. Now.

492
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,140
You can't touch anything that belonged to her.

493
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:30,690
It's money, isn't it better for us to use it? What good is it put away?

494
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:34,210
The same goes for the cell phone. You complain about how big the bill is.

495
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:39,560
Even though her cell phone is missing, you don't terminate it. My dead sister is more important to you than me.

496
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,000
Be quiet, kid. Does that make any sense?

497
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,780
Then, have I ever said anything that made sense?

498
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,210
I don't know.

499
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:51,300
That, that, that....

500
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:06,340
 Soon Ae

501
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:12,310
 The customer has turned off the phone...

502
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:15,710
 at the sound of the beep...

503
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:25,410
I said I would go to the restaurant.

504
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:29,680
He said to do this, so just rest for today.

505
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,820
Are you okay?

506
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,810
Don't be too disappointed.

507
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:47,840
We can do it again next time.

508
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,800
Don't worry, I said I was really okay.

509
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,790
You should get going.

510
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:55,510
Okay. Rest.

511
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,100
Oh, yeah.

512
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,260
Your brother and Bong Seon,

513
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,780
Yeah?

514
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,330
Were they always close?

515
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,980
No, she was afraid of my brother.

516
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,550
But I think they've become closer lately, while doing the broadcasts.

517
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,830
Is that so?

518
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:18,400
But, Bong Seon.

519
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:22,170
Was she always so flighty? And forgetful?

520
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:25,700
What do you mean? Rather, she is cautious to a fault.

521
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:29,400
But I think she's gotten a lot brighter lately. Her personality, too.

522
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,190
There's been many fun moments because of Bong Seon.

523
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,300
Really?

524
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,320
But, why?

525
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,120
Nothing.

526
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:47,300
 Expectant Mother's Journal

527
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,420
Did he use this before?

528
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:21,240
How many parties are there tonight?

529
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,780
About 10 parties. Why, Chef?

530
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:26,780
My alumni are coming at 9, so don't take any more after that.

531
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,760
What's up? You don't usually see school friends.

532
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,300
Can you stay an extra hour tonight?

533
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,440
Yes, Chef.

534
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,350
Where are the tablecloths I bought from Italy?

535
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:39,310
You want to use those today? You were saving those for the end of the year.

536
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:41,080
Just use them. If you save them, it just turns to poop.

537
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,640
Are these the only clothes you have?

538
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:47,260
We got new ones recently. Wear those. You look poor because they're so worn out.

539
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,510
-Yes, Chef.
-And today's special is...

540
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,320
...spinach Shrek pasta, Chef!

541
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,680
Change it. To truffles escargot.

542
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,810
Truffles, aren't those expensive?

543
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:59,010
And because we're going with Shrek, everything is prepared.

544
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:02,220
Do it next time. Next time. You and that Shrek.

545
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:05,050
Will spinach rot? They won't.

546
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:08,520
Take out the Bulgo Mountain snails and let's go with truffle escargot.

547
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,690
Also, there's ginseng we laid out when President Kim was coming, right? Make kkakdugi (cubed radish kimchi) with it.

548
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:13,910
What?

549
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:15,410
Peel them if I tell you to.

550
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:17,090
Yes, Chef.

551
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:19,200
Wait.

552
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:22,460
Where are my awards?

553
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:26,620
The ones from Hong Kong and Turkey. The awards. My awards.

554
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,910
Are they here?

555
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:32,450
First he tells me to make it and then don't make it. Am I his mutt?

556
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:36,550
Should I strangle him with the spinach?

557
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:38,450
It's so strange.

558
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:41,070
It isn't the president coming. Why does he care so much?

559
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:46,640
You telling me. Truffle... ginseng kkakdugi, this is the first I've ever heard of it.

560
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,800
Are important friends coming?

561
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,880
It's definitely something that's never happened before.

562
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:33,390
 Today's Special
 Star Chef Kang Seon Woo's Special Dinner
 Truffle Oil Escargot Pasta

563
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:47,300
Hey Seon Woo!

564
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:51,320
-Oh!
-Hey, Kang Seon Woo!

565
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,570
It's been a really long time!

566
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:55,690
Glad to see you. Have you been well?

567
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,180
Welcome!

568
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,690
Hello.

569
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:06,480
What's with the greeting? They work below me.

570
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,290
- Still...
- You're being unsophisticated; getting nervous and all. Come on in.

571
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,900
What are you doing? Go in and prepare.

572
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,150
Yes, Chef!

573
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:22,520
- This is...totally business like.
 - So cool.

574
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,180
You're something else.

575
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,050
Are those your employees?

576
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:30,360
You really are a chef.

577
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,690
I don't see Cheol Min. Is he not coming today?

578
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:36,090
- No, he'll be here.
- He'll be coming once he is done with work.

579
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,060
-Yes, Chef!
-My sous chef.

580
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,720
- Ah, hello.
- He is the next in command.

581
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,350
Here, first, a scallop salad.

582
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:51,020
For an appetizer, grilled abalones in extra virgin oil. For main...shall I decide?

583
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,990
Oh, yeah, we don't know very well.

584
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:55,380
Okay, then for the main dish...

585
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,900
Never mind. It's better if I give the orders.

586
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,490
The chef is personally...

587
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,870
Now, I'll give the orders.

588
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:13,300
Third seat, one scallop.

589
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,240
Three Wagyu (beef), two abalone.

590
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,850
Fourth seat, two Wagyu.

591
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:20,420
One bass, lobster and gratin one.

592
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:24,150
Min Soo, take the pasta. Dong Cheol, the steak. Ji Hoon and Joon, do the salad.

593
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,680
Joon, serve the dining hall.

594
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,500
Na Bong, you're coverage for both Ji Hoon and Joon.

595
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,140
Yes, Chef, copy!

596
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,960
- We copy that!
- Fire.

597
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,870
Fire!

598
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:38,750
What is that? 
That's some serious business.

599
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,840
For now, send the salad out. Start with the salad.

600
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,780
Yes, Chef.

601
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:49,130
First, the alcohol.

602
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:51,290
We have Costa Roche? Start with that.

603
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:53,100
With the decanter and the crystal glasses.

604
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,660
Yes, Chef. But what about snacks with drinks?

605
00:39:55,660 --> 00:40:00,050
There's prosciutto and parmesan cheese.  Makes it sensible. Also hurry up and put out the ginseng kkakdugi.

606
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:01,770
Yes, Chef.

607
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:04,780
Why is he doing this, has he lost it?

608
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:08,910
I don't know what it is but he's not in his right mind. Making pickled radish with ginseng, what's up with that?

609
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:14,420
Wild snails and tuffle and the wine is very expensive one. It'll easily cost one million won.

610
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:19,140
I don't know since it's not my money. But just hurry. If it's late, he'll throw a fit.

611
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,950
Got it.

612
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,170
-He's so cool. 
-Hey, Bong!

613
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:32,210
Yes, Chef!

614
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:38,750
Untie me.

615
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,660
Ah, yes.

616
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,410
This must be awkward for you guys.

617
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:48,040
Well, you're a king.

618
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:54,650
You're hungry? Wait a little bit more. With truffle and Wagyu,

619
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:57,830
I've prepared things you've never eaten in your life,

620
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:01,100
so today I'll move you in a delicious way.

621
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:04,500
Thanks to our successful friend our bellies will be treated with luxury.

622
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,750
What time did Cheol Min say he was coming?

623
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:10,610
I'm not sure. He said he was coming right after work. He should be here.

624
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:13,230
He'll be coming, I'm sure.

625
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,930
Oh, he's here!

626
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,850
Cheol Min, hurry up and come!

627
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:22,320
It's been a long time!

628
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,810
-It's been a long time, Kang Seon Woo.
-It's been a long time.

629
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:26,020
Yoon Cheol Min.

630
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:30,330
 Isn't he a real loser? He gets hit and then says he's sorry to me.

631
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:33,770
Have a seat.

632
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:37,470
All of us gathered like this, it really is touching.

633
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:40,150
- It's been twelve years, right?
- More than that.

634
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:43,260
Cheol Min has changed a lot, too.

635
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,980
In the past, you used to be light-footed and had charisma too.

636
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:48,260
Your face has aged a lot.

637
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:52,570
Hey, hey, it's because I didn't shave this morning.

638
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:55,740
You should watch your weight, that stomach. What is that?

639
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,830
Who would believe we're the same age?

640
00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:01,430
That's true. Cheol Min carries all of his weight in his belly.

641
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:03,470
Do some exercising. Exercise some.

642
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:05,480
It the law of gravity.

643
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,750
You piglet.

644
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:10,710
Wasn't Cheol Min the ringleader at school before?

645
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,450
He was.

646
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:15,260
Wow, that's right. That's right. Now I remember.

647
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:19,460
At the snack stand, didn't all the kids bribe him and all that?

648
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,260
He had a ton of charisma.

649
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:24,210
Hey, hey,  stop that. Why talk about the olden days?

650
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:28,230
I suppose. It's nothing to brag about.

651
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:30,190
Even if you were young.

652
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:35,110
What's up with this mood?

653
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:37,370
I told the guys before you got here,

654
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:40,090
tell me everything you want to eat today. I'll treat you to everything.

655
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,470
Seriously?

656
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:44,720
When we were young, I bribed you a lot with food.

657
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,900
I probably got money stolen, too.

658
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:51,650
Hey, that's all in the past! It was when tigers were smoking cigarette.

659
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:53,280
After you, it was me.

660
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,570
I didn't. I didn't steal yours.

661
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,770
Tell me truthfully. How much do you make?

662
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:01,560
Why are you asking between friends?

663
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,680
Is it good or bad?

664
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,380
It isn't too bad.

665
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:11,530
There're many investors who want to open a second and a third shop but I don't want to work too hard.

666
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:15,440
And giving my name out just to have them mimic my cooking is unsettling.

667
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,570
I'm a chef, not a businessman.

668
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:19,160
That's so cool!

669
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,230
-He's a pro. A pro. 
-He can't help but be a chef.

670
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:25,660
I'm sorry, but I have to get going.

671
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:27,090
Why? Eat some more before you go.

672
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:30,500
Hey, hey. My schedule is packed but I came just to see you.

673
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,270
Let's do it again next time.

674
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:34,610
There's a ton of stuff still coming. Why go now?

675
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:36,210
Sorry, I'll see you.

676
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:39,850
- Bye!
- Next time, it's your treat. I'll call you.

677
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:46,350
Wow, that Seon Woo. He changed so much that he is unrecognizable, don't you think?

678
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:51,760
- True.
- This is what you call a metamorphosis.

679
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,260
As always, you have see how well they do. Did you see that earlier?

680
00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:00,660
His shoulder was pumped up from early on and he was like, "it's been a long time, Yoon Cheol Min."

681
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,910
He was oozing with confidence.

682
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:06,580
I know. Who would think that's the Kang Seon Woo who used to grovel to Cheol Min?

683
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:09,700
Nobody would have imagined. I wouldn't have even dreamed it back then.

684
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,890
I'll say. When did that happen?

685
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:14,820
Me, too. You as well.

686
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:21,750
Hey, hey. Why don't you stay a little longer? I'm disappointed.

687
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:24,740
I know. I'm sorry, too.

688
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:31,080
Geesh. I prepared a lot because I heard you were coming today.

689
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,370
-Really?
-Come again sometime.

690
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:35,150
Okay.

691
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:37,540
And also, wait.

692
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,170
Here, for the taxi.

693
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:45,430
-No, no, the taxi fare.
-Stop playing around.

694
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:49,130
Hey, it's because I'm glad to see you. Glad to see you.

695
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:51,190
I'm really glad to see you.

696
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:54,030
Thanks. And also,

697
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:57,270
Your business card?.

698
00:44:57,270 --> 00:45:00,180
Actually, I run a business. I sell vacuum cleaners.

699
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:04,110
You're successful. You probably know a lot of people. Please introduce me.

700
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:07,830
Maybe because the economy is difficult, it's rough lately.

701
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:12,210
Actually, I have to entertain a client right now.

702
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:16,410
Even though there'll be no result but I cannot attend either.

703
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:23,180
It's just a beer gut. A beer belly. I should have watched myself like you.

704
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:29,330
Everyone is the same. At our age.

705
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:32,120
In any case, I had a good time. I'll see you again.

706
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,870
Thanks a lot for the cab fee.

707
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:38,180
Of course. Go safely!

708
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:30,120
Chef!

709
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:36,650
Chef! We're not having cooking class today?

710
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:44,750
Today, review what you've learned.

711
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,300
Oh, he must be in a bad mood.

712
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,820
 Yoon Cheol Min

713
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:18,710
Customer, the menu item you ordered is here!

714
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,300
What is it?

715
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:28,120
I just tried making something with the buckwheat flour. It looked like you didn't eat much earlier.

716
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,780
For an accompaniment.

717
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:32,490
-Ahh
-I'm fine, I'm fine.

718
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:36,480
Couldn't you just eat considering the care that went into it? You'll ruin your insides.

719
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:40,380
I said I'm fine.

720
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,870
How is it?

721
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:46,240
Isn't it awesome?

722
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,630
You seasoned it well.

723
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:54,950
I must be becoming a chef.

724
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:59,320
I learned for just one day, but my cooking skills went soaring. Soared.

725
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,370
Sheesh.

726
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:05,450
As long as you put things back in their place.

727
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:09,190
Oh, you look even more handsome when you smile.

728
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:11,660
Then it makes me want to get you.

729
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:15,720
Things were going so well. Quit saying that you want to do it.

730
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:20,570
-Why?
-I get startled in my sleep because of you.

731
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:24,420
To hear that kind of reply from a single guy... say what?

732
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:28,180
Oh my, seriously? Why?

733
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:32,300
What do you mean why? What are you thinking? What do you take me for?

734
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:35,650
Is it true you're not? Hmm? Really?

735
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:40,070
You're really going to surprised. Huh? You're going to be in trouble then.

736
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:44,010
That's what I mean. I really want to get in trouble, by you.

737
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:46,190
I really want to get in trouble. From you.

738
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:48,980
She is out of her mind.

739
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:51,090
What can I talk about with a sick child?

740
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:57,460
Seriously. Who isn't sick at this day and age?

741
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:00,840
I'm saying let's just live smiling and happy.

742
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:03,960
After living, you'll see that's how it is.

743
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:08,270
Life might not be as long as you think.

744
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:15,450
So what I'm saying is that each day is so precious.

745
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:18,400
You're talking as if you've lived your whole life already.

746
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,510
Let's stop quibbling over nothing. My conclusion is,

747
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:26,100
Just forgive if it isn't a big deal, and take some losses.

748
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:32,220
And just live happily. To forgive allows you to stretch your legs and sleep peacefully.

749
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,970
Don't you agree?

750
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:38,820
And if you still feel like you're getting mad.

751
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:41,210
Then do this.

752
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:47,410
Have a nice drink, and take something delicious,

753
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:50,080
and have a bite,

754
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:57,220
and you'll already start to feel happy.

755
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:04,330
Yeah, you're right.

756
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:07,620
I should. What's the big deal.

757
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:11,810
Then at this moment, corroboration shot.

758
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:14,240
What corroboration shot?

759
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:19,180
What corroboration shot? What are you doing?

760
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:28,240
Got it?

761
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,740
It came out well.

762
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:41,270
Oh, it's so pretty.

763
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:43,670
Why are you doing this again?

764
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:47,620
The mood is nice. At least give me your leg today.

765
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:50,380
It isn't going to rot or anything.

766
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:55,250
I'm feeling a little tippsy since I drank a bit.

767
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:59,660
I'll just stay like this for a moment.

768
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:13,270
The seasoning is about right, but the dough was a bit watery.

769
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:15,630
Your buckwheat pancakes.

770
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:21,330
There's a place in Hongjaedong that makes an awesome buckwheat pancake. I'll take you there as a lesson.

771
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:23,740
Really? When?

772
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:25,580
Anytime.

773
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:28,210
-If you want to go tomorrow, we can.
-Really?

774
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:32,410
Tomorrow? Promise me. Please promise me.

775
00:51:32,410 --> 00:51:34,960
-If you're up, let's go.
-No, I'm sleepy!

776
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,100
Why are you doing this again? Let go, just let go.

777
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:42,520
-I wish I could do it with Chef just once.
-I said to stop saying that!  Stop saying that!
-Why?

778
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,180
-My back! My back!
-Ah, I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry.

779
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:48,520
Are you okay? Are you okay? You're okay, aren't you?

780
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:55,710
 Ahjusshi!

781
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:57,420
Yeah, you came?

782
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:00,150
You're not even feeling well. What are you doing? Please give me that.

783
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,010
I'm okay to do this much.

784
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:06,070
What do you mean you're okay? Even lying down is too much for you.

785
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:10,270
That Gyeong Mo, that punk. He's still passed out, isn't he?

786
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:14,740
I even told him to do better. That punk.

787
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:20,480
You really are like my daughter. And you speak like her, too.

788
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,320
He just seems a little pathetic.

789
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:29,280
It's okay. He needs someone to say those things to him.

790
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,560
But are you feeling better?

791
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:36,880
You should rest from business a few days. Or get hospitalized.

792
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,860
Oh, no. I don't like being cooped up in hospitals.

793
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:47,640
Even the doctor said that taking my medicine and slowly walking around and exercising is better.

794
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:52,450
Oh, exercise? Then it would be good to go to a mineral spring.

795
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:56,540
Yeah, there is a mineral spring right here,

796
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:59,470
but it isn't easy to get myself to go.

797
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:03,060
Then would you like to go with me?

798
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:05,490
It's exactly the same here.

799
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:09,160
The air is nice.

800
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,890
Have you been here before?

801
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:16,420
Once when I happened to pass by.

802
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:20,610
When my daughter was alive, she exercised here every morning.

803
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:24,520
She always asked me to go with her and I never did it for her.

804
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:29,420
Isn't human foolish? We always regret things after it's past.

805
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:33,430
Don't be the same way.

806
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:37,140
Ahjusshi, do you want to try this?

807
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:39,490
Should I?

808
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,970
-Ah, it's refreshing.
-Isn't it? It's refreshing.

809
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:44,620
Don't you feel like you're getting healthier?

810
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:46,450
It seems so.

811
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:51,830
Let's come here together now. I'll go to the store every morning. Deal?

812
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:54,990
That would be good for me. Sounds good. Deal.

813
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:59,850
Oh, I ate too much chicken yesterday and just the smell of oil bothers me.

814
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:02,040
I think I overdid it yesterday too.

815
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,460
I had diarrhea  starting in the morning.

816
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:08,010
Hyungnim, still, we played really hard last night

817
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:10,480
that we must have used up half of the gift money.

818
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,850
Did you see him yesterday when he had to pay?

819
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:15,710
That mouth that's open but not open.

820
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:22,080
What's with the chatter? You better focus.

821
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:26,520
Hey, Dong. What's with this hair?

822
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:29,260
Can a person who works in a kitchen be this dirty?

823
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:30,710
And, Oong.

824
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:34,420
You need to talk less. Why do you have so much to say?

825
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:38,000
Use that energy to work harder. Work, work.

826
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,510
Why are you on everyone's case from early in the morning?

827
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:42,190
Because they seem to be slacking off.

828
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:44,970
Make sure you don't slack off.

829
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,330
Thanks for all your hard work yesterday.

830
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:52,850
I'll pay you for overtime, so don't worry.

831
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:55,230
Min Soo, go take the sign out there.

832
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:58,450
This isn't it. This menial task.

833
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:01,270
Yes, Chef.

834
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:04,250
Hey.

835
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:10,360
Why? You can't get Shrek ready?

836
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:13,670
You're serious, right? We're going with Shrek as today's special, right?

837
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:16,410
Hurry up and put it out there before I change my mind.

838
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:24,540
Did the flour come in today?

839
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,410
What?

840
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:39,030
Is there something with you and the chef?

841
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:41,560
Why? What?

842
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,800
But why are you...

843
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,240
Hmm?

844
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:50,040
Never mind. What does it matter?

845
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:52,680
But,

846
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:59,500
don't get hurt by yourself, like an idiot.

847
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:05,950
What is he saying?

848
00:56:05,950 --> 00:56:10,940
I'm not sure what he is talking about, but sometimes he looks really cool.

849
00:56:11,870 --> 00:56:15,550
Why are you so late? I waited forever!

850
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:19,240
After hanging up, it hasn't been thirty minutes to get here.

851
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:22,870
Am I your girlfriend?

852
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:25,400
Why do you call me out of the blue for no reason?

853
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,500
How much is a cup of coffee going to be in this place?

854
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:31,300
Why waste money when it's coming right out as pee.

855
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:36,110
You're so funny! You're so charming.

856
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:39,290
What? Why are you falling for me and making so fuss?

857
00:56:39,290 --> 00:56:45,470
I know. Once I like someone I put a lot of attention on them. You're in big trouble.

858
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:48,560
What would you like? Is an iced Americano okay? I'll order.

859
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:53,880
Hey...ca..ca..I prefer caramel macchiato.

860
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,920
Instead of money sticking to me,

861
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:00,770
this idiot of a professor friend stuck to me.

862
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:07,420
This is all because of that virgin ghost.

863
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:11,190
Where did she lock herself that she's not to be seen?

864
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:15,810
But this feels strange.

865
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:19,040
I feel like she's hiding in this area.

866
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:22,650
But I feel like I'm missing something.

867
00:57:38,910 --> 00:57:40,600
Uhmm.

868
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:45,170
 Yes, this is Yoon Cheol Min.

869
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:48,520
Cheol Min, it's me Seon Woo.

870
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:51,300
 Oh, Seon Woo. What's up?

871
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,720
Uh, well,

872
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:59,400
that vacuum cleaner you were talking about yesterday.

873
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,220
 Hey, Seon Woo. Just pretend you didn't hear that.

874
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:03,250
Huh?

875
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:05,900
 I was regretting it after getting home.

876
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:09,190
 I don't know about anyone else, but I shouldn't ask that favor of you.

877
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:11,880
 I should have a conscience, too.

878
00:58:12,430 --> 00:58:15,770
No, it's okay.

879
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:20,590
But, if you change your mind, let me know. I have a lot of places I can introduce to you.

880
00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:22,850
 Okay, thanks.

881
00:58:22,850 --> 00:58:25,330
Okay, work hard. I'll hang up.

882
00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:26,680
 Hey, Seon Woo.

883
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:28,050
Yeah.

884
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:31,460
 I'm sorry for before.

885
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:38,190
Don't worry about it. It was a long time ago.

886
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:44,780
Live diligently. I'll hang up.

887
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:59,150
Chef! What are you doing here?

888
00:58:59,150 --> 00:59:00,670
I was going to look at something in the storage.

889
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:04,750
Chef! You haven't forgotten about the buckwheat pancakes today, have you?

890
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:07,690
I haven't forgotten. I haven't forgotten.

891
00:59:07,690 --> 00:59:09,350
I'm going to stop by home for a bit.

892
00:59:09,350 --> 00:59:12,930
When you get off work, wait for me at the intersection stop. I'll pick you there.

893
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:14,780
Yes, Chef!

894
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:21,270
 So this is D-Day!

895
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:33,350
Let's see.

896
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:36,880
This is too mu...oh my, what is this?

897
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,220
Is this a sauna?

898
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:42,730
Is this clothes or a potato sack?

899
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:46,040
Ah, I can't. I can't, I can't. This won't work.

900
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:50,970
Today, whatever it takes, I have to knock the Chef over.

901
00:59:52,810 --> 00:59:55,760
What do I do about these?

902
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,800
Drastically...

903
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:04,130
I should rip this.

904
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,790
Oh, it's okay!

905
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:14,280
One, two, three! Ow!

906
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:23,210
I think this will work. Now the bottom.

907
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:31,560
He won't know it's air freshener. Nobody will know.

908
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:41,550
Why isn't she coming?

909
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:46,660
It isn't even a date, do I have to wait?

910
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,780
At least this much.

911
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:03,170
Oh, is it already this late?

912
01:01:03,170 --> 01:01:06,920
Ah, chef is going to freak out. I better hurry up.

913
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:09,250
Hm.

914
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:17,890
Who are you?

915
01:01:17,890 --> 01:01:22,030
Don't try to pretend. I know you're possessing that body.

916
01:01:22,030 --> 01:01:24,810
I don't know what you're talking about.

917
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:26,990
Habitually

918
01:01:26,990 --> 01:01:30,070
going in and out of the body, I am already on to you.

919
01:01:30,070 --> 01:01:33,470
When I thought about it, I had missed that.

920
01:01:33,470 --> 01:01:36,760
When I went to that Sun or Sum or whatever, that bell sound.

921
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:40,730
That kitchen help. The yin and yang that's oddly mixed in with the energy of the restaurant...

922
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:43,920
- Unni.
- What about "unni"? I'm telling you, the lights are dark.

923
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,970
Hello!

924
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:49,130
Stop right there!

925
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:53,850
Don't follow me!

926
01:01:53,850 --> 01:01:56,970
I'm going to catch you today!

927
01:01:56,970 --> 01:02:02,310
Darn it! Not today!

928
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:06,270
If I get a hold of you...

929
01:02:06,270 --> 01:02:08,910
Darn it!

930
01:02:08,910 --> 01:02:11,090
Darn it!

931
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:21,830
Taxi! Taxi!

932
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:24,860
That bus!

933
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:14,830

934
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:38,980
 Oh my Ghostess 
 ~Preview~

935
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:42,190
 In the kitchen, we're the orchestra conductor. Understand?

936
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:43,620
 So cool, Chef.

937
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:46,570
 -You said you found your virile man?
-That's what I said.

938
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:49,260
 She couldn't do it with her strength, so she bit his thigh. She's scary.

939
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:51,400
 Do the two of you go exercising together these days?

940
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:54,730
 She doesn't have much strength, so she can't hold a frying pan well.

941
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:56,490
 Why do you make excuses these days? It's suspicious.

942
01:03:56,490 --> 01:03:57,700
 What's there to be suspicious of?

943
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:01,900
