1
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,250
 Oh My Ghostess

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:14,850

3
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,310
 Oh My Ghostess

4
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:09,890

5
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,610
Twenty-five year old male found unconscious at the foot of a club staircase in Itaewon.

6
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:41,830
His vitals are unstable with a temperature of 25 degrees and signs of possible hypothermia.

7
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,610
-Again? 
-Yes.

8
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:44,810
Hey, again?

9
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:48,470
So, I don't know the number of similar cases we have already had for this month in this sweltering heat.

10
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:52,090
Perhaps, couldn't it be a virus like Ebola?

11
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,690
Ebola?

12
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,350
In my opinion, I suspect it's drug related.

13
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,710
Hey. What did the police say?

14
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:04,130
The victims had a similarity of having been with a woman before the accident.

15
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:04,850
But?

16
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:10,190
All their ID's and job's are all okay. But there's nothing connecting the women.

17
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,770
Then what about the identity?

18
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,270
We don't know.

19
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,030
But we discovered one thing all these women have in common.

20
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,270
What is it?

21
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,250
One similarity.

22
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:25,350
A knockout beauty with perfect proportions.

23
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,790
A sexy woman?

24
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:32,970
What's her identity?  She's not exactly a ghost is she?

25
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,710
Is it a ghost?

26
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:40,710
Ah, that jerk got my body all hot and bothered for nothing.

27
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,710
That was a bust.

28
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:48,050
Damn.

29
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,390
Huh?

30
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:35,370
You see? Me?

31
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:41,930
  Oh My Ghostess 
 Episode 1

32
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,650
 Hello.  I'm DJ Jin Yi for Music at Noon

33
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:50,550
 Again today the temperature has reached 30 degrees. On this hot summer day

34
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:54,650
 I'm sure everyone has their own method to deal with the heat.

35
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,250
 Fans and air conditioning are a given.

36
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:03,390
 Watching a horror movie is a method as well. Ghosts are scary.

37
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:08,030
 But everyone, did you know? I read this is in a book.

38
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:13,990
  We commonly think the ghost is dressed in white with streaming black hair living in a haunted house.

39
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,790
 But in fact, they exist in our daily lives.

40
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,550
 Right now, they are right next to us.

41
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,450
 Ghosts, chatting together.

42
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,770
The weather is nice.

43
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,250
Ah, because it's so hot I have no drive.

44
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,290
-Right. 
-What are we eating for lunch?

45
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,730
I want bibimbap. What about fermented soybean soup? Fermented soybean soup sounds good today.

46
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:38,470
On a hot day like this, we should get a bowl of cold noodles.

47
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,870
Okay. I'm good with cold noodles.

48
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,770
-Okay. 
 -Fine. I'm okay too. 
-Let's eat rice. In Korea, it's rice.

49
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:47,050
-Then because I'm thinking about cold noodles, I'm cool already. 
 - Rice! Rice! Rice!

50
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,470
Right?

51
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,210
Let's go.

52
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,270
They should have taken me along too.

53
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,250
I wanted to go and enjoy my eye candies, but I guess I don't have a chance to lunch with them.

54
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,070
Are you all that if you're handsome?

55
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,170
 I'm a ghost.

56
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:20,530
  On top of that, a virgin ghost. A ghost with the most bitter grudge of all.

57
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:26,930
  Imagine how painful it must have been to die as a virgin, not go to heaven, and go around this world as an "other."

58
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:32,810
  I'm an ill-tempered queen of the ghosts' world, but I want to be understood.

59
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:37,030
  I'm a pitiful love song and a spirit of regrets.

60
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:41,570
  And I'm very bored.

61
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,150
What's up with you?

62
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,550
You're very cute.

63
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,850
Do you want to play with me?

64
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,510
Can you see me?

65
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:08,450
-Hey! Pass! 
 -The ball, ball ball.

66
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:29,830
Wow. The sky is really high.

67
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,870
It's so blue.

68
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,010
It's quite pretty.

69
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,190
My, this is depressing.

70
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:51,170
This won't do. I'll have to gain strength by eating funeral food.

71
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:23,230
Dong Cheol, Dong Cheol, Dong Cheol! Stir in one direction! What are you doing!?

72
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:26,670
Come here. Like this. Like this. Like this.

73
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,630
That's not it. My arm is tired.

74
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,310
So exercise. Maintaining your health is a skill.

75
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,570
Yes.

76
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:35,890
You indeed look like a manager of a company.

77
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:39,450
Who would think that you were one year younger than me?

78
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:43,650
Your face deters anyone from speaking to you informally! So dull!

79
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:47,750
- That's not true. 
 - He's not dull! Brainless, maybe.

80
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:54,470
But when I see him, I think he looks old for his age, but I think you look too young for your age.

81
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,130
They think you're in your twenties, right?

82
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,790
Twenties? They say that I'm a high schooler, a high schooler.

83
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:01,790
-I almost talked informally to you at first. 
-That's right.

84
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,190
Dong Cheol, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

85
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,710
Yes.

86
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,550
Hey, Joon.

87
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:10,830
The meat is too thick. Are you making braised short ribs?

88
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:14,870
Huh?  It's soup stock.  It must be well rested.

89
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,470
Don't you know these things? Don't they teach you this at Cordon Bleu?

90
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:20,870
-They don't teach those things. 
-Do you think I'm like this because I don't know?

91
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:24,530
I'm being sarcastic! Do you not know what metaphors and irony are?

92
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:27,950
I'm trying him but he's not budging. Should I just fire him?

93
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,950
Sous Chef. Don't you smell something burning?

94
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,450
My inside is burning. My inside is burning.

95
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,670
This is why I don't like those who study abroad.

96
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:37,610
What good are qualifications when you have poor character?

97
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,830
Wait. This is the smell of something burning.

98
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,770
It's from outside.

99
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:46,590
Hey, hey, hey.

100
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:49,470
-Hey, hey, hey. 
-Na Bong Sun, are you crazy?

101
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,050
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

102
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,850
Look at the smoke. What are we going to do?

103
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,150
Who in the world falls asleep while cooking the sauce?

104
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,230
I'm really sorry, Sous Chef. I'm really sorry.

105
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,130
Is saying sorry enough? There was almost a fire!

106
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:06,770
How do you not even have the basic skills? I might just fire you. Who's restaurant are you trying to burn down?

107
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,730
I'm sorry, Sous Chef.

108
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,730
I don't think it's your restaurant.

109
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,330
Oh.

110
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:19,250
I thought this was the Himalayas, with such thick fog.

111
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,950
The view is grand, don't you think?

112
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,650
Right?

113
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:36,750
Heo Min Soo, what are you in this kitchen?

114
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,630
-I'm the sous chef. 
-Then you're number two.

115
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:44,730
Before you act like this restaurant is yours, take care of things.

116
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:47,490
You left the sauce to this kid!?

117
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:52,170
Truthfully, I was watching it the entire time, but I left it to her for 10 minutes.

118
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,230
She couldn't last that short moment and fell asleep~

119
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:58,390
Are any moments in the kitchen short? Don't you know those moments mean life or death?

120
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,730
Yes, it was my mistake.

121
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:03,570
Chef, I'm sorry. It was my mistake.

122
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,190
You talk behind my back, right?

123
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,910
It's okay. It's fine. It's fine.

124
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:14,350
The work here is hard and laborious. Laborers should have some fun.

125
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,890
No, Chef. How could I Chef?

126
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,950
But pushing your work to another person?

127
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,610
Lacking in professionalism?

128
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,690
I can't hold that in.

129
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:31,510
That's inherent character. It can't be learned.

130
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:34,450
I'll be careful, Chef.

131
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,950
-Let's do well, Min Soo. 
-Yes, Chef.

132
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,750
-Do well. 
-Yes,Chef.

133
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,050
-I'll be watching you. 
-Yes, Chef.

134
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:03,810
I'm in my thirties, yet everyday, I get scolded like a kid.

135
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:07,750
This is so humiliating I should just open my own restaurant.

136
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,290
I'm sorry, Sous Chef.

137
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,790
Hey, Bong Seon, you...

138
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:17,330
You, damn Bong.

139
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:24,710
Why can't you sleep at night, and end up nodding off at daylight? Why?

140
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,250
Let's do better, please. Huh?

141
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,850
Yes.

142
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,090
Sheesh.

143
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:11,310
Ah, I can't fall asleep.

144
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,590
Ah, I can't.

145
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,690
That stings! It stings!

146
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:26,690
Our Father which art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name.

147
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:32,370
Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven~

148
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,650
Oh, Grandma.

149
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:48,810
 Why does your voice sound so weak?

150
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,210
 Did you eat?

151
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:53,110
Yeah. What about you? You've been well, right?

152
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:56,990
 Me? Well... How are you?

153
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:01,230
  Are you able to sleep? Are ghosts still bothering you?

154
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:05,590
No. I've been sleeping and recently, they haven't been coming.

155
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:11,090
  That's good, as you shouldn't live as a shaman like I did.

156
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:16,410
  Make sure to light incense by your bed.

157
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:21,370
Okay. I'm hanging up, Grandma.

158
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,590
Ah, what do I do?

159
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:39,500
Here, report card. You did well.

160
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,960
There's nothing I'm not good at.

161
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,950
I'm good at cooking, good looking, and good at wits.

162
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,390
The heavens are so unfair in giving me everything.

163
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:52,490
You'd be perfect if you wouldn't continuously compliment yourself.

164
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:55,330
That's my intentionally created flaw.

165
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:58,730
If I were too perfect, I'd be despised.

166
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:04,330
You're nice and friendly, but why are you mean toward two women?

167
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:07,110
- Who?
 - Bong Seon.

168
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:11,090
She's been more shy since you've been hard on her.

169
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:14,870
I don't really like her. Who's the other person?

170
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,170
It's me!

171
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:20,390
Perfect timing. Mom, you came?

172
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:32,280
Are you here to examine us?

173
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:37,810
You're giving me a headache. Could you sit? I asked you not to come to the restaurant.

174
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:43,810
Do I embarrass you? Why can't I come to my son's restaurant?

175
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:48,050
Because the customers ask if you're my aunt.

176
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:52,690
Or my secret elder lover like some nonsense... having me when you were 19 years old.

177
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:56,630
So what if I had you when I was nineteen? Is my life theirs?

178
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:01,470
- So what.
- That's why you should live your own life. Why do you keep coming to the restaurant?

179
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:07,170
I think he is attending classes for wicked speech.

180
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,660
Seon Woo.

181
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,390
Seon Woo.

182
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,050
Seon Woo.

183
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,310
What is it?

184
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,230
It's nothing to be alarmed about.

185
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:25,130
Your fate is filled with vitality.

186
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:28,490
The energy is already strong, but this year there's a connection to a noble family too.

187
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:31,710
He said a ghost will stick to you. It's horrifying, isn't it?

188
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,780
Who said so? Master Tae?

189
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:37,410
No, this one is from Seongbukdong Mr. Jang.

190
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:41,390
Mom. Mom, I'm really okay. I told you I don't believe in ghosts.

191
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,830
Who told you to believe it? Just hold on to it.

192
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:47,840
I really don't want to! I don't want to!

193
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,960
Mom, how can someone who is a professor be so  superstitious?

194
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,870
Mom, do your students know you're like this? Seriously.

195
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,310
Phone, phone.

196
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,400
Yeah, Lee PD.

197
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,320
Yeah, I'm always busy. Why?

198
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,500
Here, here!

199
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,650
Oh! You came early.

200
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,440
Welcome.

201
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,760
Hey, it's been a long time.

202
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:15,060
That's right, I was wondering why you would miss someone else's funeral banquet.

203
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,350
I guess you were hungry.

204
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:21,970
You can't even eat your own food offering, so how starved must you be.

205
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:27,170
It's funny when you think about it. Isn't this the first time we're hearing about a ghost with amnesia?

206
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,760
That's right. It's not that common.

207
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,110
Okay. Let's say it happened because of your trauma from your sudden death.

208
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:38,490
If you can't be generous with your own food offerings, then you should at least not be greedy for someone else's food.

209
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:41,390
A ghost still needs to feel shame.

210
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:48,030
They say that appetite and sexual desires coincide. You're totally being obvious that you're a virgin ghost.

211
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,810
Hey, stop it. Even a dog shouldn't be bothered when eating.

212
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,370
Can you say that you're better than a dog?

213
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:56,590
I heard that you're possessing women's bodies to seduce men these days.

214
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,970
I heard detectives are desperate trying to catch you.

215
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:01,190
Whatever it is, how is it related to you?

216
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,950
I'm saying this now because it does concern me!

217
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,510
Because of you, we're being driven to the edge.

218
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:09,870
Why are you doing what the Heavens forbid? Didn't you know that possession is not allowed?

219
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:12,410
Then you've never done anything to be ashamed of?

220
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,850
I know that you've done a lot of possessions back in the days!

221
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:17,570
- Do you want to see who is more crazy? 
- Let's fight!

222
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:21,390
Come on, start something!

223
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:25,030
Hey, what the heck? Where are you all going? Now that I want to fight, you're scared?

224
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:28,670
Hey, come! Come! Let's fight!

225
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:36,390
This... This girl...

226
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,490
Hello, Unni.  (Anyongihaseyo means "Are you at peace?"

227
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,770
I can't be at peace, wench!

228
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:43,290
How could  I be at peace because of you?

229
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:47,270
Ah, what do you mean? Please eat.

230
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,930
Where are you going?

231
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,110
Y-You... Stop right there!

232
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,890
Hey! Wench! Stop right there!

233
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:01,150
What's wrong with her?

234
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:02,310
Hey, hey!

235
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,090
- Wait a minute.
 - Let go!

236
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:06,970
- Please calm down!
 - I'm not crazy! I'm fine!

237
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:09,910
I have to go catch her! I'm not crazy!

238
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,910
Hey! Hey!

239
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,830
She's scarily fast!

240
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,630
Stop right there!

241
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:24,730
This wench! Just how much energy did you get?

242
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:28,130
I can't catch her. Come here! Stop and come here!

243
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:31,470
- Dammit!
 - That, that...bus...

244
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,870
Taxi! Taxi!

245
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:40,250
Wow! That Unni...really ...

246
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,090
Hey! Hey, wench!

247
00:18:54,970 --> 00:19:02,610

248
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:09,290
Let's try hiding here.

249
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:16,190
Aigoo, where did this girl go now?

250
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,510
Has she possessed someone again?

251
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:22,730
She really doesn't listen!

252
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:26,870
It will be good if you come out. It would be better if you come out.

253
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:29,970
Ah, seriously. Where is she?

254
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,890
Seon Woo!

255
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,430
Yeah.

256
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:48,590
Oh! Hey! I got you!

257
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,990
Hey, come here!

258
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,190
Come here, come here! Get up, get up quickly! Get up!
 - Be gentle!

259
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:58,150
Hey, get up. You thought I wouldn't catch you? Come here.

260
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,210
What the heck?

261
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,270
Ah, it hurts! Please!

262
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:06,790
Does it hurt? I'm in pain too! Because of you, I'm getting stressed!

263
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:10,010
This girl is putting up a show.

264
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:17,030
Ah, seriously. I couldn't stop her.

265
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:21,820
When did she put this here? I'm going crazy.

266
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:25,300
Here, lukewarm Americano is served.

267
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,900
Right? You hate it hot because it hinders your taste buds.

268
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:33,410
That was when I first started in the kitchen. It's been long since I was a novice.

269
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:36,210
What is it? Tell me what you need. I don't have much time.

270
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:39,570
Aigoo, I know that you're busy.

271
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:42,690
Actually, I'm going into a new program.

272
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:45,630
It's a cooking program that accepts viewers' requests. A survival show.

273
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,720
I want to put you against Chef Marco in the first episode.

274
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,700
Is he going to do it again?

275
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,680
He really got the celebrity disease.

276
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:57,160
He does have a star quality, and his background is unique too. So what do you think? You're going to do it?

277
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,300
No, I don't do pilots, my friend.

278
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,330
If it becomes a regular show, then I'll give it a thought.

279
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,720
Hey, even if I beg you?

280
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,100
I need to refrain from broadcasts.

281
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,880
I took my eyes off it for just a moment and the cooking is a mess.

282
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,710
What a snob.

283
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,730
It's not being a snob. How many times have I told you, I'm just that good.

284
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:22,690
-So are you really going reject my offer?
-I already did earlier.

285
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:28,040
I feel bitter. I got rejected by a friend I trusted. Is this how we learn about life?

286
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,020
I'll go first.

287
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:35,040
Ah, right. I'm going there this weekend. You don't want to go together?

288
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,900
I'll check. He wouldn't want to see the two of us together, right?

289
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,410
I'm going.

290
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,300
Come here.

291
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,890
You're not going to look away? I'm entering my password.

292
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:04,450
I'd want to get out. Do you think I'd want to go in?

293
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:06,580
This detailed wench.

294
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,380
I guess I'll need to put the key inside.

295
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,360
- 7182. 
- I'll change it, you wench.

296
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,320
 Seobinggo Bodhisattva

297
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,860
Please help...

298
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,290
Don't put on a show!

299
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:31,920
It's not a harmful charm. It's just a padlock.

300
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,230
Why are you annoying only me?

301
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,710
Shall I let you know?

302
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:42,050
Because you go around doing possessions and seducing men,

303
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:44,760
the higher ups are really mad.

304
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,700
Until I get you locked up, I won't get my powers!

305
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,940
Then what shall I do when I like men so much?

306
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:55,120
Of course, you'll like them since you're a virgin ghost. Still, using someone else's body,

307
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,420
are you going to seduce the men that you couldn't have when you were alive?

308
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,330
No matter how much you try,

309
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:04,220
a man who would have the energy enough to stand a ghost's energy,

310
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,690
where else does this exist in this world?

311
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:09,330
They say the powerful man contains the rays of the sun within his two arms.

312
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:15,030
Where would you find one man in a million?

313
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,970
Still, I have to try until I succeed!

314
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:19,730
I'll change into a scary bad spirit after three years of being a ghost.

315
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:22,250
So I'll have to relieve my resentment and leave before that, don't I?

316
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,320
That's why, you wench.

317
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,490
That's why you have to discipline your heart well.

318
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:31,310
No matter what, abandon your grudge, enter nirvana, and think about going up.

319
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,170
Will this go as I wish?

320
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:36,620
If something goes wrong to you while doing that

321
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,460
and you meet a body with the perfect frequency as yours,

322
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:45,240
you might really get locked in and not be able to come out.

323
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,840
But since there's an Unni who's worrying about me, I feel happy.

324
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,590
And I like it that I don't have to talk to myself.

325
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,540
This wench...

326
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:07,790
- Aigoo, you wench...this pitiful wench... 
- Why are you like this?

327
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:10,100
I know how you feel.

328
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,630
Why are you doing this? It's embarrassing.

329
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,730
It's because you're so pretty, you wench.

330
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:19,180
Okay, okay. Why are you so sensitive today?

331
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:22,690
-I love you, you wench.
-I love you too.

332
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:24,630
Perfect!

333
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:29,780
What is this? What is this?

334
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:33,700
How can I trust you? I should at least put a bell on you.

335
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,270
Wow! Am I a cat? A dog? What?

336
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:41,020
Aigoo. Hey. Don't even try.

337
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:44,210
I'm the only one who can untie it and the only one to put it on you.

338
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:47,340
Untie it!

339
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,440
Take it off, please!

340
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:55,020
Look at this. Oh my goodness! $78. Why is the maintenance fee so high?

341
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:01,230
Get out of the way. Get out of the way.

342
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:07,410
Aigoo. Hey, hey! This!

343
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:08,760
Aigoo.

344
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:14,810
But don't we have to eat dinner? I think the Chef will be late tonight.

345
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:17,740
What should we eat?

346
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:23,700
The Chef isn't here, so should we chew some rice? Let's order rice.

347
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,300
That's not it, but I don't think the Chef will like it when he comes.

348
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,850
That's right. If it's rice, the Chef gets disgusted.

349
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:30,890
Getting supervised for nothing. I hate that.

350
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:34,180
This annoying Chef, seriously!

351
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:39,840
Just because he's the chef and he doesn't like rice, are we supposed to continuously eat just noodles?

352
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,240
Is he Nero or something? There's no other dictator like him.

353
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,870
Chef never pressured us to do it. We just did.

354
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,380
Cordon, this bastard.

355
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,220
If we're going to eat, order it quickly before the Chef comes.

356
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:54,860
I'm craving chive bibimbap that I had at home.

357
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:57,500
-Then, I want chive bibimbap too. 
-Me too.

358
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,090
Dried ox blood soup for me.

359
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,950
Hey Bong. Bong.

360
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:06,180
Three chive bibimbaps, one siraegi bibimbap, and you have  kimichi stew, because there's no broth.

361
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:09,620
But are we really ordering?

362
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:14,190
We are really ordering. The Sous Chef says he's ordering, so who's saying anything?

363
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:18,370
Hey! Today, we'll sit here like ministers and eat.

364
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:22,160
Not like beggars standing everyday to eat. Seriously.

365
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,640
You haven't had dinner yet, right? Come in, let's make spicy seafood noodle soup.

366
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,440
-Yes. 
-Yes, Chef.

367
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,870
Yes, Chef.

368
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,860
Hey.

369
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,730
Did the medium salmon arrive?

370
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:40,880
-Should I bring it, Chef?
-Get it and let's cut it.

371
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,950
-Give me the tweezers. 
-Yes.

372
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:19,050
Why did you buy this bad salmon?

373
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:24,980
Are the customers stray cats? Can we just feed them just any kind of fish? They're crazy.

374
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:28,600
Sous Chef, return this. Tell them that if they keep on cheating us like this, the deal is over.

375
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,890
Yes, Chef. I'm  amazing at making threats.

376
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:35,040
Chef, what do we do with the scallops from yesterday? I don't think we can leave them out any longer.

377
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,100
Ah, the scallops. I ordered too much.

378
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,390
What do we do? Is there any spinach left?

379
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:45,790
-Yes. 
-Okay. Then change today's special to scallop and spinach pasta.

380
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:50,040
Okay, got it? I'll take care of the taste, so tell the customers that it tastes really good.

381
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,090
-Recommend it. Don't force it to them.
-Yes, Chef!

382
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:57,390
 Orders are coming in. Let's make it tasty and so the customers fall for it.

383
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:00,670
 Table 1, two specials. Table 2, two seafood.

384
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,220
Fire!

385
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:12,350
-Hey, Joon. 
-Yes? 
-The noodles. 
-Yes.

386
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:33,340
Table 5, two steak pastas, one special.

387
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:37,350
-Table 11, one special and one sun salad. There's two specials so do them together.
-Yes!

388
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:40,640
Table 8, two specials. Hey, pour this.

389
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,980
-I'll take care of the specials. So Min Soo, do the pastas. 
-Yes.

390
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:47,850
-Dong Chul, do the salad. Ji Woong, take the orders.

391
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:52,750
-Bong, hurry and bring it!
-Yes, Chef. It's coming.

392
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:58,270
Fill this with water. Water!

393
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,120
  Now the combo!

394
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,900
Min Soo, Table 5 is pretty do well.

395
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,300
I saw! I saw her!

396
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,950
Put in some more.

397
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:45,290
That's loud! Go around more quietly.

398
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:48,660
Whatever. So why did you put a bell on my neck?

399
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,350
Ow, that hurts!

400
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,140
You all worked hard. Let's finish up.

401
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:59,420
-Yes. 
-Yes, Chef.

402
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:03,520
Chef, if you have no appointments, should we have a drink?

403
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,410
Don't say thing you don't mean. I'll go exercise. You can go yourselves.

404
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:10,810
-Yes, Chef. 
-Good work! 
-Good work.

405
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:14,790
Good night! He sure has some sense to him.

406
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:17,860
Let's wash quickly and go.

407
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:36,950
Ah, I've cooked at least 100 dishes of noodles today.

408
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:39,260
Why do we get so many customers? So annoying.

409
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:44,060
Still, if business does well, don't you think our wages would go up too?

410
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,910
Hey, as if.

411
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:49,560
Look at Chef. Would he treat us at least half as good as he treats his sister?

412
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:53,340
But Miss Eun Hee is not an ordinary sister. She's different.

413
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:56,890
That's right. That person who dances ballet so elegantly

414
00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:00,820
suddenly can't use her legs after a hit and run. What do you think the brother would feel looking at her.

415
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:04,060
That's why heaven is fair.

416
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:08,530
She has a well-off brother and a dependable husband.

417
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:12,530
How awesome is that? A well-off and a dependable...

418
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,700
This Cordon bastard is staring at me with flounder eyes. Do they teach this in Cordon?

419
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,910
- They don't teach that! 
- They didn't teach you that? 
- Let's go, let's go.

420
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:26,990
Our Sous Chef, it's time to eat your medicine. What medicine do you want today?

421
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,440
Should we have soju or beer?

422
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,130
-Mixed!
-Should we have it mixed?

423
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:35,100
I really can't take this.

424
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:38,020
He's a guy that's so much younger than me.

425
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:41,570
Is being a Sous Chef so amazing? Is he a king?

426
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:45,180
If I acted under my impulses, I would come out and punch him.

427
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,580
You bastard!

428
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,870
Then why did you lie about your age from the first place?

429
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:55,780
What can I do? Because of my age, I always get rejected even without an interview.

430
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:59,300
I should have just stayed fixing cars. I started cooking for no reason.

431
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,380
Hey, Dong Cheol! Are you not coming out?

432
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:06,560
I'm on my way! Why so impatient?

433
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:14,100
I'm all dressed. Come in.

434
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:10,620
- Yes. 
 - Eat well. 
 - Yes.

435
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:34,310
  Central Goshiwon (single rooms)

436
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,540
Aigoo, it's so loud.

437
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:48,660
It's so loud I'm going to die. I can't concentrate because of that.

438
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:52,790
I-I'm sorry. I'm the cook's helper.

439
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:56,400
I need to practice. I'll be more quiet.

440
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:01,980
Lately everyone is a chef. TV ruined everything.

441
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,900
I'm sorry.

442
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:16,540
 For me, a pale and frequently sick child,

443
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:20,580
 my grandmother often made this cabbage porridge for me.

444
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,800
 Under the threat of getting my finger pricked again if I don't eat it,

445
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,410
 the cabbage porridge that I forced myself to eat out of fear.

446
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:32,760
 Remembering the feelings of how it soothed the girl's stomach and comforted the grandmother's heart,

447
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,830
 I'm posting the cabbage porridge recipe today.

448
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,970
Room 305, you have a package.

449
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:42,600
Y-yes!

450
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,880
Excuse me. Excuse me.

451
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,850
Yes.

452
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:28,380
Can you heat the soup again? It doesn't look good since it's cold.

453
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:34,030
Ah, but...noodles will get bloated and won't taste good...

454
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:37,610
Excuse me. I'm the blogger of good restaurants Five Years.

455
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:42,140
I know all that, so if I said heat it again go heat it up.

456
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,300
Yes, customer.

457
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,430
Yeah, this way.

458
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:52,020
Mom, let's play.

459
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:55,070
Okay, son. Let me work. Just a second.

460
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:58,220
Ah, it's not coming out well.

461
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:07,770
What are you doing?

462
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:08,940
Well, I'm...

463
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,770
Hurry up. Hurry.

464
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:19,040
Oh my gosh! So hot.

465
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,010
Jin Soo, are you okay? You didn't get hurt? What did you do?

466
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:25,020
Are you okay child? Are you okay?

467
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:28,750
What are you doing right now? Can you be this careless while carrying hot stuff?

468
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,510
What would have happened if the child got burned?

469
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:32,870
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

470
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:36,580
I mean children are always running around. An adult should think about the children.

471
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:40,520
Should the child take care of the adult? How did they train their employees?

472
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,590
I'm sorry, customer. I'm really sorry.

473
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:45,640
How old are you? Do you go to kindergarten?

474
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,220
Did you learn that you can't run around like this in a closed space or not?

475
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,360
I did.

476
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,320
You did? Then, did you do wrong?

477
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,330
I did wrong. 
-Right?

478
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:55,010
What are you doing right now?

479
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:58,800
Why? Is it upsetting you that your child is getting scolded?

480
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,670
Me too. I got upset because you were scolding my employee.

481
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,290
What kind of situation is this?

482
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:09,040
Exactly! This kind of situation does exist. It doesn't matter if noodles become bloated just heat up the broth.

483
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,650
And if the dish doesn't taste good, then the food...

484
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:14,570
Let go. That was senseless .

485
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:17,400
I wonder why you're putting the blame on someone else, when you can't control your own child?

486
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,800
What? Are you done talking? You think you're something because you were on TV?

487
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,040
Excuse me, customer. Please calm down and-

488
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,890
What are you?

489
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:29,090
There's nothing normal here, huh?

490
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:40,420
Come out, come!

491
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,960
This is so crazy.

492
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,430
We don't accept crazy people either, only normal.

493
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,080
This is so unbelievable.

494
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,910
Let's go, Joon Soo. I won't stay calm!

495
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:53,830
Excuse me, you dropped your card.

496
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:55,600
Do you even know who I am?

497
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,980
I'm sorry. Please go safely.

498
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,640
Hey.

499
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,220
I'm sorry.

500
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,680
Ah, really.

501
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,150
Come inside.

502
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,230
What do I do?

503
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:27,010
I'm sorry, chef. I should have been more careful.

504
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:29,370
Do you know why I dislike you?

505
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:31,130
Your attitude bothers me.

506
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:34,640
When you do something wrong or not, you're always sorry, in this position,

507
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,050
and saying that it's your fault. That attitude.

508
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:40,900
That's not even being nice.

509
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:45,160
You don't know that you're clueless, "it's my fault" makes it worse for everyone around you, do you?

510
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,000
I-I'm sorry-

511
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,890
Kitchen is not an easy place. It's a war zone.

512
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:59,600
It's a place where only aggressive and strong people remain. You'll have no chance if you make yourself into a weak person.

513
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:10,540
I'm sincerely advising you. Think about it carefully

514
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:13,060
if the kitchen is really the place for you.

515
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:18,850
Instead of hanging on foolishly then getting hurt and being a nuisance to others.

516
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:26,680
Put some salve on it. It's not good for a girl to have scarred hand.

517
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:44,830
Did you scolded Ms. Bong a lot?

518
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:49,560
This time it's not Bong Seon's fault. It's not a sin to be nice.

519
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,060
Being too nice is a sin.

520
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:58,200
Will you be okay? That girl said she was a power blogger.

521
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,320
Is that a government position?

522
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:05,010
These days, more than reporters, bloggers are the most annoying.

523
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:08,970
Who are they to give grades then lower it? What're the standards?

524
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:12,740
Where are they trying to be a boss?

525
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:18,370
 Daemyeong Middle School Reunion.
Date - July 15th, 3:30PM
Place - Royale Hotel

526
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,410
Why? What is it?

527
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:26,150
No, it's nothing. Just spam message.

528
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,170
 Do you want to delete the message?
 Yes

529
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:39,780
 Aish, everything fell. So dirty.

530
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,650
 I'm sorry. I'll clean it.

531
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:45,150
 Hey, it happened because of you.

532
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:50,800
 Be quiet, bastard. It's because of Kang Seon Woo that idiot.

533
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,520
 Can you... move your foot?

534
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,070
 You clean it.

535
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:11,900
 Seon Woo, mom's going to be late.

536
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:16,840
 It's your birthday, I'm sorry. At least order kimbap with this money.

537
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:30,290
 Gyeonggi Restaurant Traditional Korean Food Buffet

538
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,150
Ahjussi, the check please.

539
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:35,200
Yes. It's 15,000 won.

540
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:40,710
Yeah, I'll be there in 10-20 minutes. Ok, I got it.

541
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:46,050
The side dishes were lacking today, right? I'm sorry I was busy.

542
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:48,640
No, it was good.

543
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,850
Here you go.

544
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:53,530
You gave me a lot of change.

545
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:57,290
Aigoo, I'm sorry. What was I thinking. Sorry..

546
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:58,860
You almost had a fruitless day today.

547
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:01,190
Aigoo, I know.

548
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:04,010
- Where Gyeong Mo?
- He went to meet up with friends.

549
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:07,810
Well, it's better for me if he is not around.

550
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:10,010
Coffee is not coming out, Ahjussi.

551
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:15,600
Again? Jeez...this thing...is it a faulty contact?

552
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,550
Wait a moment. Let me open it up with the key and take a look.

553
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:19,410
It's all right.

554
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:21,760
- Still..-
- It's all right.

555
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,700
Eun Hee, Eun Hee!

556
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:28,100
- Every time, coming down it scares me.
- It's all right.

557
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,510
- You waited a long time. 
 - Not at all.

558
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:38,970
I had to resolve a civil complaint before coming here.

559
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:41,400
Long time no see, Chef Kang.

560
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,880
Oh! That surprised me!

561
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:46,270
Who is this goddess? I was totally surprised.

562
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:47,580
- Have you been well? 
 - Yeah.

563
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:52,190
You must have changed your favorite restaurant, Sergeant Han. You don't even come for the seafood spicy noodles that you like.

564
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:55,740
Your words upset me.

565
00:43:55,740 --> 00:44:00,960
Your spicy noodles are always in my mind. But I have to stand in line if I want to eat it.

566
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,190
There are a lot of people.

567
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:06,770
It's not my style. A star chef's restaurant is just so-so.

568
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:10,050
I will especially make room for you when you come.

569
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:15,120
Really? As expected of Sister-in-law. There's a benefit to my matchmaking. Be good.

570
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:18,970
Yes. I understand. By the way, Hyungnim. Are you going somewhere?

571
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:23,230
Yes. A close friend is opening a restaurant. It calls for a celebration

572
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:25,860
so I'll go to do some nagging.

573
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:28,460
Good night.

574
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:31,660
Should I go too? I'll see you tomorrow. Good night, Sister-in-law.

575
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:33,890
-You've worked hard.
-You too.

576
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:37,840
Okay. Should we also go now?

577
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,670
Yes, my husband.

578
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,880
My day was really long. What about yours?

579
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,470
I was busy too. Hold tight.

580
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:50,970
There you go!

581
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:57,010
It looks luxurious. Very luxurious.

582
00:44:57,010 --> 00:45:01,160
-I was wondering why it looked so luxurious. It's the same one as mine.
-Right, right.

583
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:04,890
Did you pick up the whole thing and drop it in here?

584
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:07,230
Didn't you teach me to copy everything that is good?

585
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:09,610
This is a carbon copy, punk.

586
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:13,860
Here, try it. You're acting like a chef again. That's occupational illness.

587
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:17,800
Originally, a chef tastes 50% with his nose and 50% with his mouth.

588
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,170
That's right. Okay.

589
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:24,400
Finally! Chef Kang Seon Woo will have a taste.

590
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:39,200
It won't fail.

591
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:42,910
The noodles are good and the seasoning was right.

592
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:45,260
Yes!

593
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:49,580
Wow, what's up with Hyung Seon Woo?
Then, am I now at your heels?

594
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:53,040
Hey, can you compare a human with a god? My cooking is a mystery of nature.

595
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,810
Right, right! As expected!

596
00:45:56,810 --> 00:46:00,910
Not everyone gets to hear my advice. Listen carefully.

597
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:05,500
Don't joke around with food. What's in the plate is not food.

598
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,580
It's your faces.

599
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:11,120
Don't stop me.

600
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,920
I will cause trouble. A big one!

601
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,230
Noona Wang Joo is here. Noona Wang Joo.

602
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:19,900
She's not someone who would be coming here. Have a seat.

603
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:22,540
Okay. Noona Rang Joo. Let me introduce you.

604
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:27,030
Noona Rang Joo is an amazing woman. You know him, right? Chef Kang Seon Woo.

605
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:31,210
-Hello.
-That's Chef Choi Seon Woo right there.

606
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:06,260
Right. You lit (incense) again. I knew it.

607
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:11,390
-I'm s-sorry.
-It's not a matter of apologizing. I told you so many times.

608
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:15,270
This room doesn't even have a window. It will catch on fire if something goes wrong.

609
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:19,540
The ventilation is not working too. You make people hate you, seriously.

610
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:21,810
I-I'm sorry. I'll be more careful.

611
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:25,270
Forget it. I can't do this anymore. Find another place.

612
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:27,370
Ahjussi...

613
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:30,060
That's the incense but

614
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:33,230
this... Aigoo. You even hang strange things.

615
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:37,590
I feel so uncomfortable so this won't do. Leave as soon as possible.

616
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:39,230

 Tomato bacon salad

619
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:25,120
 You don't know that you're clueless, "it's my fault" makes it worse for everyone around you, do you?

620
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,800
 Give it a thought for once

621
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:31,030
 if the kitchen is the right place for you.

622
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:36,530
 Don't uselessly stay and hurt yourself while becoming a burden to other people.

623
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:43,990
 Chef Kang Seon Woo

624
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:28,810
Look at where you're going.

625
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:55,590
Actually, next week is my birthday

626
00:49:55,590 --> 00:50:00,100
so I'm planning a party. Can you cook food for us?

627
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,800
All my friends are your fans.

628
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:06,460
Ah, what should I do? I'm a bit expensive.

629
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:08,550
Hey.

630
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:12,230
It's a joke. Am I not allowed to joke? I can't even say anything.

631
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:16,370
Still, you won't ask for a building, right? I'll pay your price.

632
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:21,100
Hyung. You can raise your price. This noona is the daughter if Yeong Chang Group.

633
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:23,390
Is that so?

634
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:31,030
I was going to do it because you're pretty but what can I do? I think I'll get an appointment. Sorry.

635
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:33,340
I forget about my appointment. I'll go first.

636
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:36,900
Why? Why, Hyung? Why? Have fun before you go.

637
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:43,370
Why, Hyung? Drink some coffee before you go.

638
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:46,690
-I'm meeting someone over coffee.
-Really? A woman?

639
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:50,570
Wouldn't it be weird if I'm meeting a man at this hour?

640
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:53,410
Hey. Take it.

641
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:58,110
Hurry and take it. It's because I wasn't able to buy flowers.

642
00:50:58,110 --> 00:51:00,200
I will really do well.

643
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:07,220
Cheong Ho, you. Don't be too friendly with that Yeong Chang Group's daughter or whatever noona she is. Do you understand?

644
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:13,690
Work hard, punk. You said everything was borrowed. I'm going.

645
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:24,930
I love you, Hyung.

646
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:28,150
Our handsome oppa.  The golden ratio (of creamer and sugar).

647
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:30,660
Thank you!

648
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:39,300
Ah, as expected, your coffee is really the best!

649
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:43,020
You drank yesterday so you came late. No. Did you come early, then?

650
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:46,520
Whatever. Now, I'll drink coffee

651
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,820
and slowly get items. Bye.

652
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:51,240
Bye, handsome oppa!

653
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:14,170
I'll give it to you at a cheap price. Buy one of these.

654
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:16,020
No.

655
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,460
You're not going to buy after being like that, right?

656
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:41,390
It's not fresh so why would I buy? Don't put up stuff like these. You'll have a bad image.

657
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:46,700
Such an expert. Shrimp! I really got these today.

658
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,480
It's okay.

659
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,160
Ah, it's good. You don't even have to look.

660
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:55,610
The gloss and the shell are good. They're good. Three kilos of this.

661
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:58,460
Five kilos that are like three kilos. Here.

662
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:42,300
What is this?

663
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:47,670
Who's that? Na Bong Seon?

664
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:50,660
What's with you at this hour?

665
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:56,980
-Are you coming in or leaving?
-Yes, coming in... I mean... leaving.

666
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:59,850
-What are you saying?
-This... I will...

667
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:01,640
Take it.

668
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:33,740

3. Kang Seon Woo

670

What is this? My ranking went down.

671
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:42,930
Why is Marco second?

  Appearing with Jeong Eun Joo in an SBC drama.

674
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:53,520
He blogged pictures of himself with celebrities.

675
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,800
 Together with musical actor Mr. Jung Eui Gap.

676
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,680
Look at this guy.

677
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:02,090
His skills alone aren't sufficient so he always does this.

678
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:03,850
Just do that.

679
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:12,130
  How to make cabbage porridge.   
 You are my sunshine, the joys of daily life,

680
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:17,810
dreams of a warm table. How great is that?

681
00:55:17,810 --> 00:55:22,260
Cabbage... that is a good ingredient.

682
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:27,230
This person is very genuine in her cooking.

683
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:30,630
I feel the sincerity through her blog.

684
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:43,220
Sunshine, your recipes

685
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:48,380
always bear a  happiness that can be tasted.

686
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:54,470
I'm a fan. Fighting!

687
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:57,370
Fighting!

688
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:04,580
I wonder if this person is a chef.

689
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:09,020
  Chef, thank you for everything.

690
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:11,380
 You were right in what you said.

691
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:17,300
 Doing what I desire and being able to are different. I was too ambitious.

692
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:22,530
 I'm sorry to everyone at the restaurant. Farewell, you all.

693
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:28,020
 This is something I couldn't express in the letter.

694
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:31,400
 Chef, thanks to you I learned one more thing.

695
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:35,960
 Feelings are like a cold. Once they start, no matter how you resist the illness,

696
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:39,770
 it will only end once you bear through the pain.

697
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:44,550
I'm not sure if your dream is to become a chef, but let's work diligently anyway.

698
00:56:44,550 --> 00:56:47,530
Yes, Chef.

699
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:57,150
Who told you to put garbage on my plate!?

700
00:56:58,670 --> 00:57:03,280
You wouldn't want to eat from a plate with garbage either, would you? Again.

701
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:09,980
 I wanted to become a chef like you.

702
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:16,270
  Like this, like this. Watch.

703
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:22,270
 Hold it here, straight like this, and do it again.

704
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:27,270
 Because of you, I was excited. Because of you, I was happy.

705
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:34,160
 Because of you, I was hurt, and hurt again and again.

706
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:37,780
 I'm leaving now that I learned as much as I can.

707
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:42,080
 To an unexceptional person like me, the Sun was like a nest.

708
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:48,000
 The world will probably push me aside again, still, I'll be leaving now.

709
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,460
  Farewell, Chef.

710
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:33,620
Hello?

711
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:38,080
  Chef,  It's me.  Bong Seon quit.

712
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:41,300
Who?

713
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:46,560
Still, without even saying goodbye... That's terrible, Bong Seon.

714
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:50,280
With her personality, she probably didn't have the confidence to tell us to our face.

715
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,560
Put in about three month's worth for this month's wage.

716
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:53,650
Yeah.

717
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:56,610
Chef! Chef! Chef!

718
00:58:56,610 --> 00:58:59,820
The key to the back storage room disappeared.

719
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:03,220
I think Bong Seon took it.

720
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:04,650
Who has it? Na Bong Seon?

721
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:06,360
Yeah.

722
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:08,980
 This...I will...

723
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:10,730
 Bring it.

724
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:18,490
Did you thoroughly check everywhere?
Are you sure Na Bong Seon took it?

725
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:20,910
It's gone. We checked the drawers and everything.

726
00:59:20,910 --> 00:59:24,960
What should we do? To make that special key will take some time.

727
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,670
It's already 10AM, Chef.

728
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:28,040
Call her first. She probably hasn't gone too far.

729
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,540
She's not answering her phone either.

730
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:33,250
Ah, seriously! To the end really!

731
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:35,660
Keep calling her until she answers.

732
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:40,530
Then, Joon, go to a locksmith and look into the key. Dong Cheol and Min Soo can get started on the dough.

733
00:59:40,530 --> 00:59:42,420
Yes, Chef.

734
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,100
Ah, seriously.

735
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:55,670
 A room with a window is 300,000 won a month plus 10,000 won for maintenance fee; and that's not available often.

736
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:59,260
I guess a room with ventilation is expensive.

737
01:00:01,930 --> 01:00:04,160
 Sunbae Ji Woong

738
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,300
I'm sorry, sunbae.

739
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:19,670
Oh my head. What is it?

740
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:22,720
I'm bored!

741
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:27,060
I'm so bored I'm going crazy!

742
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:30,620
Be quiet, you wench! My poop that came out went back in because of you.

743
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:33,110
Ah, but I'm bored!

744
01:00:33,110 --> 01:00:35,940
There's no customers at this fortune teller's house either.

745
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:37,690
This is all because of you!

746
01:00:37,690 --> 01:00:40,800
It's someone else's rice bowl. Don't spread ashes in it.

747
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:45,300
So you should let me go. Nothing good will come out of us being together.

748
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:49,600
If you let me go, I'll live quietly like I'm dead. For real.

749
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:53,660
How will you live like you're dead when you're already dead? If you were me, would you believe your words?

750
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:55,960
No.

751
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:58,070
Is it a customer? It must be a customer, Unni.

752
01:00:58,070 --> 01:01:00,210
It's bossam.
(Boiled pork eaten with a salty sauce and wrapped in greens.)

753
01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:01,560
Bossam? Bossam is good.

754
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:03,850
Noodles on a tray is delicious too.

755
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:07,790
Hello.

756
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:09,460
It's 35,000 won.

757
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:11,510
35,000 won? Here you go.

758
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:13,240
You had to tell us about the coupon beforehand.

759
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:15,560
Why should I say it beforehand?

760
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:18,120
What...so if I said it in advance, you would take some pieces of meat out?

761
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:20,830
That's not it. I'm going to die, seriously.

762
01:01:20,830 --> 01:01:25,090
Why die, it'll be fine, I'll just call the owner.

763
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:26,410
Ah, seriously.

764
01:01:26,410 --> 01:01:29,710
Hey, don't think of running off...

765
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:35,770
Ah, this wench! Oh this life of mine!

766
01:01:35,770 --> 01:01:39,220
Out of my way!

767
01:01:39,220 --> 01:01:42,540
Ma'am! Ma'am!

768
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:55,320
Aren't you stopping right there?

769
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:58,750
Stop right there!

770
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:01,830
Let's end this today!

771
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:05,110
That...

772
01:02:05,110 --> 01:02:07,250
Right there, stop right there!

773
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:11,060
Oh jeez.

774
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:58,600
Where is this wench hiding?

775
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:02,870
Where is she?

776
01:03:05,110 --> 01:03:07,100
Oh man.

777
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:09,850
Hey, Na Bong Seon, you were here?

778
01:03:09,850 --> 01:03:12,060
There's no time. Let's go. We'll talk once we're there.

779
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:15,490
What are you doing? Get on!

780
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:17,740
I'm going.

781
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:22,910
Mmmm.

782
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:36,900
Hey Bong, you go on in first.

783
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:38,550
Where is this place?

784
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:40,890
What are you saying? Hurry up and get off.

785
01:03:40,890 --> 01:03:42,960
Chef! I found Bong Seon!

786
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:45,840
Wait. Excuse me.

787
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:47,700
Chef! I found Bong Seon!

788
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:50,450
Excuse me, excuse me.

789
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:53,160
- Hey, Na Bong Seon! 
 - Bong!

790
01:03:57,110 --> 01:04:01,020
What...what...

791
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:03,410
Hey.

792
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:13,180
Oh. I'm happy to meet you too.

793
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:17,770
Give up the key, and stop kidding around.

794
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:21,550
- What?
- Give me the key!

795
01:04:21,550 --> 01:04:26,170
What key?
 What's up with this rude jerk?

796
01:04:26,170 --> 01:04:29,210
This girl, seriously. Where is it?

797
01:04:29,210 --> 01:04:31,990
Seriously.

798
01:04:35,890 --> 01:04:37,880
Oh!

799
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:44,990

800
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:03,680
 Oh my Ghostess 
 ~Preview~

801
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:07,760
 It sure is bizarre.  The kitchen is not unfamiliar.

802
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:10,560
 Oh my.

803
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:13,460
 I don't think it's going to be that bad.

804
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:15,210
 It's busy, what are you doing instead of going in?

805
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:18,100
 - Hey, Na Bong Seon!
- If you're going to tell me to do something do it in one shot, will you!

806
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:19,940
 Did you perhaps hurt your head?

807
01:05:19,940 --> 01:05:22,170
 No way. What do you mean assault?

808
01:05:22,170 --> 01:05:23,730
 Did he hit someone?

809
01:05:23,730 --> 01:05:25,850
 That Chef or something person did?

810
01:05:25,850 --> 01:05:28,950
 Did I seduce him while possessing? He seems familiar.

811
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:32,320
 Isn't she your friend? Taking her up will work out  fine.
