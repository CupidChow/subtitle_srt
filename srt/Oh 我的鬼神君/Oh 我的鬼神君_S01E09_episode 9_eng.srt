1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,300

2
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,400
 Oh My Ghostess

3
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,440
It's cold.

4
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,770
I turned it on too high.

5
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,800
What to do...

6
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,980
Oh what to do? You're wet. I'm sorry.

7
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,640
Oh, I'm so clumsy.

8
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,030
So clumsy.

9
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,670
Wait.

10
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,610
I think it's all wiped off.

11
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,050
Wiped off...

12
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:45,310
♫   Memories that I want to forget. The moments that I want to remember   ♫

13
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:52,350
♫   Everything is disappearing    ♫

14
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,170
Ah... So-Sorry!

15
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,260
Hey, Na Bong Seon!

16
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,140
Hey, Na Bong!

17
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,900
♫   It seems very unlikely   ♫

18
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,940
Na Bong!

19
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,560
It wasn't a mistake.

20
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,280
It really wasn't a mistake this time.

21
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:26,680
I also feel confused and like I'm going to go crazy.

22
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,950
But I think this is real.

23
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,890
What?

24
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:38,230
Don't you understand me? So, the almighty Kang Seon Woo

25
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,130
likes you.

26
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,640
I don't know when it started.

27
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,070
If it was from the beginning, or if it was when you changed and stuck to me, or if it was yesterday, or if it was today

28
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:05,560
I don't know.  But what's for certain is

29
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,310
that I keep wanting to see you.

30
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,980
If you're not beside me, I feel anxious and everything.

31
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,460
Ah, I'm going to go crazy, you're like my family.

32
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:26,390
So ... who cares, let's just try going for it.

33
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:29,030
It's my decision, who cares what they say?

34
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,590
How could...?

35
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:39,540
Say...  something.

36
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,660
Don't just mumble, make it so I can understand.

37
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,460
If I confessed my feelings, there should be some sort of reaction, shouldn't there be?

38
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:49,520
What? Ah, that is...

39
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,540
Th-thank you, Chef.

40
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,450
What?

41
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,870
That's not it.

42
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,670
Wh-wh-what I'm saying, so, that is...

43
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:07,200
Are you saying okay?

44
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:12,950
That you like me too?

45
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,690
Yes, Chef.

46
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:54,910
Why are you being so restless for no good reason?

47
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:10,010
Pull yourself together, girl. You're a ghost, you're not Na Bong Seon.

48
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,540
Pull yourself together.

49
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:19,080
Pull, pull,

50
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,370
pull,...

51
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,250
Hey. Here.

52
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,160
I'll do it. Don't move.

53
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,890
Yes.

54
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:42,100
I'll be done quickly.

55
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,660
Ah, it's roughly done.

56
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,740
Your hair is still wet.

57
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,300
Even though it's the summer, if it stays wet, you'll catch a cold.

58
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,160
Hey, turn this way.

59
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,500
-Does it reach you?
-Yes.

60
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,280
I must have really become possessed by a ghost.

61
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,270
How did I...

62
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:29,520
You're like a little chestnut.

63
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:33,240
Looking like a puppy.

64
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,770
Yes.

65
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,940
I know you like it.

66
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,150
I like it.

67
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,790
 Oh My Ghostess
 Episode 9

68
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,180
What could it be?

69
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,050
Yeah, Yang Soo Gyeong?

70
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,220
Officer Han?

71
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,870
Okay.

72
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,820
Yeah, I'll be right there.

73
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,070
Okay.

74
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,150
What's going on with Officer Han?

75
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:20,360
He must have been in an accident. He's in the hospital.

76
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,180
I'll be right back. The car keys.

77
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,650
Over there.

78
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:28,140
Oh my my. Officer Han

79
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,620
was the one in charge of Eun Hee's accident, wasn't he? Your partner?

80
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,300
Yes. I'll be back, Mother-in-law.

81
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,670
- Sleep early. 
 - Yes.

82
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,510
Hey, oh my my. What could it be?

83
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,390
-Was it a car accident?
-I suppose.

84
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:45,940
Oh, my heart is pounding.

85
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,070
You must be thinking of what happened before.

86
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,810
Are you okay? I'll go get you some cold water.

87
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,140
No, I'm okay.

88
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,370
I saw him yesterday briefly when I got off work yesterday.

89
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,330
I hope it isn't a serious accident.

90
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,210
Yang Soo Gyeong!

91
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,340
What the heck is it? What happened to Officer Han?

92
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:07,260
They finished surgery and he is in the recovery room. He's still not conscious.

93
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,930
-Is he really bad?
-I'm not sure.

94
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:13,740
The operation went well they say, but there was too much blood, so they need to monitor him for one to two more days.

95
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,480
What...

96
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,670
What happened?

97
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,410
I don't know.

98
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:23,820
It seems that he was lying in the parking garage bleeding and someone reported it.

99
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:27,420
It could be a robbery. His cell phone and wallet are missing.

100
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:31,990
He must be very meticulous, because all the CCTVs were swept cleaned.

101
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,710
You didn't know, did you?

102
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:38,300
 My heart is pounding still.

103
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,600
Did you contact his mother?

104
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,810
No, I thought she might be too shocked so I called his sister. She should be here soon.

105
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,030
Good job.

106
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,190
Na Bong Seon, are you sleeping?

107
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:10,330
Huh? N-no.

108
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:15,430
-Good night!
-Yes, sleep well, too, Chef.

109
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:19,340
I'm not sure if I'll be able to sleep well or not.

110
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:22,250
Don't lose any sleep because tomorrow will be difficult.

111
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,020
Yes.

112
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:31,050
At least sleep under a light blanket, because if you expose your belly button, you'll get a stomach ache.

113
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,900
Yes.

114
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:37,610
And dream about me. This is a suggestion, not a command.

115
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,450
I will, Chef.

116
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,100
What are you doing?

117
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,640
Oh! Ah, nothing.

118
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,380
Are you wondering what Chef is doing after confessing his feelings to you?

119
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,020
Did you see everything?

120
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:18,440
Of course, I saw it. I had it all laid out for you.

121
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,870
Because of the unexpected appearance of desire, I was ejected out from the heat.

122
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,230
Oh.

123
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:28,280
How is it? How does it feel to be confessed to by the object of your crush?

124
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,910
Uh?

125
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,910
Isn't it nice?

126
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,070
Yeah.

127
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,550
But I can't believe it.

128
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:42,890
I wonder if it's a dream. But at the same time, I wonder what to do if it's not a dream.

129
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:46,770
And I keep thinking that if it were just a dream, I'd be less hurt if I wake up from it.

130
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,860
Why are you making it so complicated?

131
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,520
Our goal is right in front of our eyes now, Ms. Na Bong Seon. We have crossed nine out of ten ridges.

132
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,910
I can release my vexation and you can make Chef Kang your man. It's a win-win!

133
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,450
Win win.

134
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:03,800
All we have to do is look towards our own goals and advance. Okay?

135
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,860
Okay.

136
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,160
Trust me and just follow. We can do this!

137
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:29,750
It's a wonderful morning!

138
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:36,150
Chef's heart has already crossed over to me. And today starts the real game.

139
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:40,430
How should I plan my advance?

140
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,030
Are you already up?

141
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,620
Yes, Chef. Did you sleep well?

142
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,710
Yeah, well,

143
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:56,890
of course, I slept well. Did you think I might lose sleep because I was so excited?

144
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:00,350
Is dating a one day, two day thing? So uncultured.

145
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:05,020
Oh my, your eyes look red.

146
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:08,180
-Me?
-Yeah. Did you not sleep well?
No, I slept well.

147
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,500
Why don't you believe me?

148
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,290
Why are you laughing? Am I funny?

149
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,590
No, because I like it.

150
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:24,690
Don't like it so much. You can get hurt then.

151
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:31,410
And also, I'm saying this out of concern for you, you can't make it noticeable in front of the boys.

152
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:36,290
Oh, of course that's a given. I can control that much.

153
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,550
See you later!

154
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,610
Bye~

155
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,760
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Why is she doing that again?

156
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,280
-She's following Chef around like a puppy that has to poop.
-I know.

157
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,310
Does she want something from Chef again?

158
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:23,610
Does she want another advance in her pay? That's too much. Chef isn't a bank.

159
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,060
I told you not to make it obvious!

160
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,120
When did I?

161
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,430
Don't you see them watching since earlier?

162
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:38,540
Really? I didn't make anything obvious. People are so sensitive.

163
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,850
- Sensitive? 
 - Chef!

164
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:44,310
How many of salmon en papillote should we make?

165
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:50,290
Well, how many do you think? Let's go with ten.

166
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,040
 Chef Kang

167
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:02,140
 Chef, what are we doing today?

168
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:08,300
-Ji Woong.
-Yes, Chef.

169
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,020
What was I going to say?

170
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,430
Ah, the potatoes we ordered yesterday, and...

171
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:15,530
Yes, yes, they've already been trimmed and put away in the refrigerator.

172
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:18,100
Today's lunch special will be baked potatoes,
 Please let me know soon.

173
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,820
-with sour cream.
 Please let me know soon.

174
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,460
Well,

175
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,620
 Reply please!

176
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,070
How many party reservations are there today?

177
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:39,250
Ah, there are 15 parties and one party called to cancel, Chef.

178
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,840
You get a firm grasp of the headcount, Joon.

179
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,980
Alright Chef.

180
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,920
Get ready.

181
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:49,930
Ah, Chef! I'm here. Why? Are we going to talk secrets again?

182
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:54,030
Seriously! You're doing this on purpose so you can see me all flustered, aren't you?

183
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,590
I mean, today is our first day.

184
00:14:56,590 --> 00:15:00,340
Of course, I'd be curious what we're doing at night. Why wouldn't I be curious?

185
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:06,120
Well, then as a lesson, we can go eat somewhere.

186
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,780
That's all?

187
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,660
That's all, you say?

188
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:15,040
Hey, do you know how many people around Itaewon want to get lessons from me?

189
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,230
You're making money. This is luck.

190
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:21,610
But still, this isn't right! There's only one first day!

191
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,480
Shouldn't we have some memorable date?

192
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,770
For example. As an example,

193
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:33,150
like an overnight date, or like one of those romantic courses.

194
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:37,820
We could ride a train, and see the night scenes, and eat something yummy, and then...

195
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,570
And then?

196
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:44,280
And then, after doing this and this and this, if there's nothing else to do, well,

197
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,900
we could take a quick nap in a motel or something.

198
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:52,210
My goodness, like you'd take a nap. You don't think I know what you're thinking?

199
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,710
Overnight, I can't believe her.

200
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,690
What's wrong with one night two days?

201
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:59,290
Na Bong Seon, listen carefully to me.

202
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:03,430
Just because this thing between guy-girl exists, I'm not a person who'll be open about it without a concern about your condition.

203
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:08,750
I'm very, what do you call it, I'm cautious and cerebral.

204
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,740
How do you get cerebral in a guy-girl relationship?

205
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:16,620
Anyway, if you want to date me, then go with my tempo and don't get ahead of yourself. Got it?

206
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,730
-Here.
-What is this?

207
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:23,070
Come down in five minutes. Don't come down right away to make it obvious.

208
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:31,320
Ah, seriously! A virile man wouldn't have any issues with stamina.

209
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:37,230
I seriously don't have any time! What? What is this for? What?

210
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:42,770
Darn it. What's the problem when he's a virile man?

211
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,250
Oooh.

212
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:53,700
Hey! I'm not here to catch you!

213
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,810
I came because I was curious if it was going well, girl.

214
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:58,750
Really?

215
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,710
You don't have these, do you?

216
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:06,460
Eat slowly, Unni.

217
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,200
Oh no!

218
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:15,150
Aiyoo, seriously. Who told you to only hang out with elephants who's been starving for months?

219
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:20,870
You have to open triangle kimbap slowly and carefully.

220
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,230
You're careless.

221
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:26,360
It will all get mixed up when it gets into the stomach anyway.

222
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:32,430
Unni, you were really hungry, weren't you? Did you run out of rice?

223
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:37,030
That mouth of yours. Whose fault is it?

224
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:42,530
But in any case, are you making any progress? I'm talking about that virile man.

225
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,570
Aren't you curious?

226
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,960
What happened...

227
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,760
This little kid.

228
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,030
What's the matter, Unni?

229
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:57,160
Stop whispering and just say it from there. From there.

230
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:03,800
Oh? What's the big deal? I agreed to date that virile chef man.

231
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,200
We even kissed yesterday.

232
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,990
Really? You, girl. You have some skills.

233
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,660
Then, if you even rubbed lips, then isn't it all over?

234
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:20,180
We'll have to see. I think the day that I release my vexation isn't far, Unni.

235
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,650
Hey, you know when you got out,

236
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:27,290
were you pretending not to know that I let you?

237
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:30,350
I did wonder if you did that.

238
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:33,910
So, please just release your vexation, and leave quickly!

239
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:39,050
If the gods find out, I might not be able to get my powers until I die, girl. Because of you.

240
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:44,190
Don't worry, Unni. With this opportunity I'll definitely release my regret and ascend to Heaven.

241
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,250
Please just do that for me.

242
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:53,230
What is this woman? She calls morning and night.

243
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,910
Yes, hello?

244
00:18:55,910 --> 00:19:00,590
-Actually, last night I had a dream.
-A dream?

245
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,810
What kind of dream?

246
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:06,330
My Seon Woo,

247
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,080
in a field of faded and dead flowers,

248
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:13,330
he's walking endlessly. He doesn't respond even when I call him.

249
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,560
A dead flowerbed?

250
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:19,490
Yeah, what exactly kind of dream is it? Please explain it.

251
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:26,580
It's not a bad dream. Colorful bed of flowers means treacherous.

252
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:31,900
For example, like a female snake. But a field of dead flowers mean he is avoiding disaster.

253
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,130
Really? Is that so?

254
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:39,000
And here I thought...! That's a relief!

255
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,300
I'm glad I met you.

256
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,670
Is there anything more you want to eat? Should we have a drink?

257
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,680
Ajumma, serve us some drinks.

258
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,570
 Yes!

259
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:10,620

260
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:24,750
Officer Choi, you're here. I had to go to the restroom.

261
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,250
Noonim, it's hard work, isn't it?

262
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:31,580
What hard work? But, the surgery was supposed to have gone well.

263
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:37,120
Why isn't he thinking of waking up? I'm so upset I could die.

264
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,150
I can't even tell our mom.

265
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:43,490
Oh, Jin Goo.

266
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,970
Are you awake now?

267
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,910
I'll go get the doctor.

268
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,450
Officer Han!

269
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,690
Officer Choi.

270
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,900
Are you okay? This is the hospital!

271
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,750
Yes.

272
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:07,620
Do you remember what happened that day?

273
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:15,560
No. I remember coming out of the place, but...

274
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:21,690
I don't know anything after that.

275
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:29,480
It's a real relief it's only this. Your sister went to get the attending physician.

276
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,030
You're sweating.

277
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,830
Hey, guys.

278
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:00,120
Ah, I forgot I have a grade school band get-together.

279
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,620
Ah, why am I like this again?

280
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,860
Since earlier...slightly... it must be enteritis.

281
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,990
Oh, no.

282
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,700
Then you better get going.

283
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,610
Let's just go. Let's get some rest today for tomorrow.

284
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:15,760
Tomorrow? Is there something tomorrow?

285
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,970
More than there being something tomorrow, I'm just saying let's just go home for today.

286
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,080
Go, go. I'll get going!

287
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,350
Dress nicely tomorrow.

288
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,540
I'm going.

289
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,510
Bye!

290
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,210
What is it?

291
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:30,290
What could there be tomorrow?

292
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:34,620
I'm not sure. But suddenly I don't want to come to work tomorrow.

293
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,450
Let's think about tomorrow tomorrow. I'm off.

294
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:40,100
Oh, okay. We should be going, too.

295
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:41,970
I'm going, too!

296
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:44,640
Yeah, bye.

297
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:51,430
 Be ready and I'll see you in twenty minutes.

298
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,390
 Yay~see you later~♥

299
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:55,700
What is this, with a heart.

300
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:59,840
Is she for real, Bong? Na Bong?

301
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:03,560
A heart.

302
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,610
Yeah. Is that really possible only when we're on an overnight trip?

303
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:13,030
If there's a chance, I just have to go for it.

304
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:15,580
If that's the case,

305
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:19,530
should I try fixing myself up?

306
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,880
Mascara makes a woman, right?

307
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,040
Good. Volume, I'm going to make it for you.

308
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,330
You're the finale, huh?

309
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:46,050
He didn't know it last time either.

310
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,930
If this is an air air fresheners or not.

311
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,070
Ah, why isn't she coming?

312
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:56,230
Na Bong, will it take much longer?

313
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:58,110
I'm coming!

314
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,660
Tada!

315
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:10,770
How do I look? I tried fixing myself up since it's our first date.

316
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:17,730
Why are you making it so obvious you're dressed up? So uncultured.

317
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:20,680
Ah, I'm uncultured?

318
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,810
You think that's classy? Let's go. I'm hungry.

319
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,900
Oh! What are we going to eat? Something yummy?

320
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,960
Then should we go eat something flavorless?

321
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,910
Isn't that skirt a little too short?

322
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:34,710
Short? This? It isn't. It isn't short at all.

323
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:37,410
It's short. Let's just go.

324
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:41,450
Geez, it sure is uncomfortable.

325
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:46,640
Wow, what is all this? Bringing me to a place like this?

326
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,200
When you've always took me to some hole in the wall.

327
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,000
It's a hot place where younger kids go, so I figure once...

328
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,350
If that's the case, are we spying on a rival or something?

329
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:59,920
Let's keep it down. Do you want to advertise that we're spying?

330
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:03,920
Your order is here.

331
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,030
It's Korean tenderloin steak with red ginseng sauce.

332
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:10,100
It's a healthy cuisine prepared without any artificial flavor enhancer or processed ingredients.

333
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,960
-I know of course.
-Thank you.

334
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,350
Yes, enjoy.

335
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,510
Yes, thank you.

336
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:18,210
Eat this.

337
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,620
Just like there's a trend in fashion, cooking also has a trend.

338
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:25,420
Being able to read the trend is also a skill to a chef.

339
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,210
It's delicious.

340
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:28,330
It's delicious?

341
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:30,390
Yes, it's really delicious. You try some, too.

342
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:31,410
Is it better than what I make?

343
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:37,210
Ah, why do you have to say it like...

344
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,880
What are you doing with your foot?

345
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,790
I'm not sure if it's because my legs are long, but they keep reaching you.

346
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,440
My legs are too long.

347
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,220
Let's concentrate on eating and stop thinking of other things.

348
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:53,150
When did I think of other things?

349
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,260
I mean,

350
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:06,640
you probably think I only think of that 24 hours a day. But I don't.

351
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,090
-Go now.
-Yes.

352
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,860
Let's go.

353
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:22,920
I was going to fasten your seatbelt for you. You have to drive safely.

354
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,450
What? Don't I have hands? You don't have to do that.

355
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,950
Let's go!

356
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,890
Yeah, let's go.

357
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:32,220
-Oh my! What is this?
-What are you doing?!

358
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,710
I  think you got something on you.

359
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:36,850
-What...?! Oh, sheesh!
-Here, here, right here.

360
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:38,550
- Where are you going?
-Where are you touching?

361
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:41,130
Where are you going?

362
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:45,360
What are you saying I was touching? I was just brushing something off of you.

363
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,060
I mean, while I'm driving, if your hands just dangerously charge in...

364
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,390
-If you keep this up,...
-I'll be in big trouble?

365
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:55,660
I wish I could get some of that big trouble, please.

366
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:58,300
If I make up my mind, you'll be really shocked...

367
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:02,480
So, let me get that really big shock, please.

368
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,710
Where are we going to go?

369
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,800
We should go home, where else? There's business tomorrow.

370
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:11,400
Whoa! We can't, we can't, we can't! We can't go back early today!

371
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,460
Uh, Chef, do you want to go eat some shaved ice?

372
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:18,920
There's a place I know well. You said you liked shaved ice.

373
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,210
Shaved ice?

374
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,720
What is this? Where exactly is it?

375
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:29,210
We're almost there. We just have to go a little further.

376
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:32,380
There's a shaved ice place at this remote place? Maybe we came to a wrong place.

377
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,850
No, it is this way.

378
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:36,940
Chef, you just have to follow me. This is the right way.

379
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:41,130
It's strange. To have a shaved ice shop in this area.

380
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:42,510
Ah, seriously.

381
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:46,860
I believe there is one in this area.

382
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,580
Where?

383
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:01,200
Na Bong Seon, you...

384
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,870
Yes? What? Why? What about me?

385
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:06,890
They must sell shaved ice in motels these days.

386
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:09,570
Oh my! It really is a motel!

387
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:11,390
How did this happen?

388
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:15,810
But that turned out really well. Because my legs were starting to hurt.

389
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:19,600
So, Chef, should we go here and rest for a moment before going?

390
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,810
-For just a moment?
-Yes, just a moment. Just for an hour.

391
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:25,830
-Oh, Chef!
-You're really too much.

392
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,820
What?

393
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,590
I get it.

394
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:34,410
I'll just lie down holding your hand, okay? Chef...

395
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,910
-My legs hurt.
-Come have a talk with me.

396
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:39,940
-Talk, talk. So we can go inside and talk...
-Hurry!

397
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,450
-My legs are hurting so...
-Hurry up and come here!

398
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:44,890
-Ah, wait a second! Wait a second!
-Sit over here.

399
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,600
Sit down.

400
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,420
What?

401
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,320
Ah, seriously.

402
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,220
I was saying to rest before going.

403
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,910
What are you doing over there? Isn't it better to sit?

404
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,710
Why do you like me?

405
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,280
What are you talking about now?

406
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,400
-Is it me that you like or my body?
-Huh?

407
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:09,680
Ah, now, why do I...  why am I having this conversation? Now?

408
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,800
-What?
-Isn't this normally what a woman has to say?

409
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:16,000
Normally women do say that, but I'm a little different from normal women.

410
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,890
What?

411
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:18,940
I mean, why are you nitpicking?

412
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:24,180
I like you and I like your body. And after liking you I just want to do it, that's all.

413
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:27,890
I mean, is it that strange when we're both healthy man and woman? Is it strange?

414
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:30,340
-I'm not talking about that right now.
-What is it?

415
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,680
-I....
-Yes?

416
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,560
At least, in a guy-girl relationship,

417
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,010
I'm a conservative guy.

418
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,620
And I think that it's right to be like that.

419
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,440
Conservative?

420
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,190
If there's to be progress in a relation between a man and a woman,

421
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,890
there should be some sharing of feelings, some process...

422
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:53,690
To have eyes meet at first sight and to go all the way,

423
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,470
is that right?

424
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,560
You're completely frank and forward.

425
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,530
I wasn't being forward. It's just that I like you.

426
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,080
If you like me,

427
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,720
then use some caution. Am I something instant?

428
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,500
So...a little bit...

429
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,410
So control your emotions and let's not be like that.

430
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,410
Where did a woman learn such naughty...

431
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:16,450
What about a woman? Why? Can a woman not be first like that? Is there some law?

432
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:19,560
You're so weird. You're so old-fashioned in your thinking!

433
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:23,300
And if a woman has done this much, couldn't you just go with it?

434
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,460
-It's because I have a reason!
-What reason?

435
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:29,010
Never mind. Let's give it up. Forget it!

436
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:32,810
When was it that you got heated up and grabbed me and kissed me in the kitchen?

437
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,620
Progression?

438
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:38,450
Oh, yeah, so you need progression? If that's the case, then what? What should I do?

439
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:41,930
Should I stay this far away? Is this okay? Are you satisfied? This much?

440
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:43,580
-That's not...
-What?

441
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,870
Are you being surly right now?

442
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:49,780
No, I'm just obeying you. Why? Is it a problem if I also listen too well to you?

443
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,330
What do you want me to do?

444
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:55,190
Go or stay there? What do you want? What do you want me to do?

445
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:58,240
If it's time that you need, then one minute, no, no, ten minutes.

446
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,860
Tell me. Should I go one step like this? One step every ten minutes?

447
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,750
Excuse me, Chef, are you covering your ears? Am I too noisy?

448
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:08,230
Mother-in-law must be late today.

449
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,690
Yeah, she said she had a get-together.

450
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:13,810
Is Officer Han going to be okay? Can we stop worrying?

451
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:19,500
Yeah, I talked to him earlier. He started eating. They think he'll be discharged soon.

452
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:24,810
That's a relief. What about the criminal? No news yet?

453
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,530
Well, there are so many hit and run thieves.

454
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:35,270
The world is so scary. People like that must not be afraid.

455
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:39,520
People who do bad things will be punished by the heavens at some point.

456
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,310
Oh my. Did you get hurt?

457
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:54,490
Sorry. I guess I'm a little annoyed.

458
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:57,220
It must have stung a lot. Do you want me to put some medicine on for you?

459
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,660
No, it's okay.

460
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:04,310
Let's have a glass of wine and take a walk. The breeze is nice tonight.

461
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:11,180
It was nice seeing my friends. It reminded me of college, too.

462
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:14,630
Was it? It must have been good bringing up memories.

463
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:21,770
I didn't realize it then, but it was a really good period of life. And there weren't many worries.

464
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:31,600
But when I think about it, you never talk about yourself. About college or when you were young.

465
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:39,200
How was the orphanage? It seems you've gone through adoption couple of times.

466
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:44,780
I didn't. Not even once.

467
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:54,150
 I'm back.

468
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:06,440
 Mother, I have to get my report card stamped.

469
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,670
 Just stamp it yourself.

470
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:12,330
 He's smiling. I think he knows us.

471
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:15,810
 Of course, he knows his mother.

472
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:16,960
 Oh  my.

473
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,280
 Where were you that you just came now? You upset your mother.

474
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,850
 What do you think you're doing?!

475
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,780
  What would your mother...? Come out, you punk!

476
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:44,820
 Get out! Get out! Get out, you punk!

477
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:26,660
If I didn't meet you at the hospital three years ago,

478
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:33,720
and if I didn't find the desire to live again, what would have happened?

479
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,890
I probably wouldn't be here now, would I?

480
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,430
Probably not.

481
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:47,200
 Leave me alone, please.

482
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,740
 Leave me to die!

483
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,340
You said this back then,

484
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:03,180
that living because you want to, or dying because you want to die, isn't up to you.

485
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:05,820
What did you mean by that?

486
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,270
Did you say it to intrigue me?

487
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:10,920
Did I? I don't remember that.

488
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,580
Anyway, it was refreshing.

489
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:18,390
After that day, I kept thinking of you.

490
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,410
I see.

491
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,060
What about this? Is this a good enough distance from you?

492
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:41,880
Hey, you seriously.

493
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,490
I shall take that as yes, and withdraw from you, Chef.

494
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:49,080
Conservative and cautious Chef Kang Seon Woo,

495
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:53,490
please take care of your noble body and have a good night.

496
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:56,570
Then, I shall withdraw.

497
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,620
Hey!

498
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:05,710
What's with the going overboard?

499
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:09,010
Do I know how I feel?

500
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,040
I can do it.

501
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,770
Kang Seon Woo can do this.

502
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:28,370
I can hold back. I can endure this.

503
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,120
As if he is some national treasure.

504
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,340
Darn it! I don't have a lot of time.

505
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,680
He doesn't look that way, but why is he conservative?

506
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,430
If you lock eyes and are in agreement, then you just go for it.

507
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:41,080
It's not like it's Joseon period now, don't you agree?

508
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:45,350
But what he said wasn't wrong. What Chef said.

509
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:51,290
Under the current circumstance, even if you like him, you're going to take his side?

510
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:54,780
But, you know, that's part of Chef's charm.

511
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:58,670
At first glance, he might look careless, but he's not careless at all.

512
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:01,910
And he's cautious and responsible.

513
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:06,560
Charm? You've really been blinded, haven't you?

514
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:10,470
Isn't he cool? Our Chef?

515
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,850
It isn't that he isn't cool, of course.

516
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,640
Backing off too much isn't being courteous.

517
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,710
That's what I'm saying!

518
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:24,600
It's a woman he likes as high as the heavens are.

519
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,950
Ah, we were practically there.

520
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:30,780
But not to make any progress from that point.

521
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,590
Does it taste good, Stalker?

522
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:34,730
It's Chef.

523
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:39,050
It must have gotten to him. Seeing how he's out hanging around.

524
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:41,250
-Hey! Don't go.
-Huh?

525
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,230
You have to play some push-pull games with Chef.

526
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,960
At this rate, it will take longer than I thought.

527
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,790
Hold back. Withstand it even if you want to see him.

528
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,240
-I'll just open the door slightly.
-Uh-huh.

529
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,700
-I'll just see his face.
-No.

530
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:56,570
You're eating well.

531
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,130
Is it good?

532
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,460
Whoa!

533
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,980
Wow! Hyungnim!

534
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,170
What? Did something come up?

535
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:30,940
It's Min Soo's birthday.

536
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,050
Min Soo?

537
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:36,480
Ah, Sous Chef, Sous Chef. I got a message saying to wish Heo Min Soo a happy birthday.

538
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,160
Oh my god!

539
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:43,250
No wonder. That's why he was saying this and that about today.

540
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:45,990
What should we do? Do we have to act like we were having a party for him?

541
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,990
Will that get by with him?

542
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:53,360
He's probably expecting a birthday present. A totally expensive one at that.

543
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,590
Hey,

544
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,230
let's ignore it.

545
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:02,230
Okay, Okay. Ignore, ignore. No, that won't work.

546
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:06,130
That' the best, but no. That human being will not be able to handle it.

547
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,430
Hi, Sous Chef!

548
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,360
Hello.

549
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,150
Good morning!

550
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,820
It's really hot today.

551
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:27,460
I think those people who have babies in this midsummer heat are amazing.

552
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:30,110
Post-natal care too.

553
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:32,560
Hey, is there any leftover seaweed?

554
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:37,260
Let's make some seaweed soup for lunch today. I have a craving for it for some reason.

555
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,860
They should get it with that much hinting.

556
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:51,070
Are they already preparing something?

557
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,690
What is this?

558
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:02,310
How childish, they want to surprise me.

559
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,650
What is this? Why is everyone like this?

560
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:08,230
What? Hey, hey. I already caught on!

561
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:11,330
Stop it, turn on the lights! Turn on the lights!

562
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:12,370
Hey, they're back on.

563
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:13,480
Tada!

564
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,690
Oh! What are you doing?

565
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:16,960
What are we going to do if the power keeps going out like that?

566
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,200
Does someone need to fix it?

567
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,900
It's probably because it's summer.

568
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:23,100
When there's a spike in electricity, from time to time there're outages, I'm told.

569
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,640
It will be a problem if it goes out for too long.

570
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,500
What are we going to do about the refrigerator?

571
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,320
And the refrigerator,&lt;

572
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:33,490
Oh, this was a power outage. Is that what you're saying?

573
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:37,960
Hey, guys, are you going to keep jibber-jabbering starting from the morning?

574
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,330
Huh?

575
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:41,520
Didn't you come to work and not to play?

576
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,360
We're not late yet.

577
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,120
You are late.

578
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:48,080
You...you guys, let's assemble.

579
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,720
Assemble!

580
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:56,480
Raise your hands.

581
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,550
Why are you the only one raising them like that? Are you going to raise them that way?

582
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:01,130
No.

583
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,120
-Ow.
-Are you not going to take care of your nails?

584
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:13,480
Did you come from farming somewhere? Look at the dirt.

585
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,130
It's not dirt. It's the raspberry wine that's on my hand.

586
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:20,520
That mouth, that mouth. Are you not going to shut that mouth?

587
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:23,810
Hey, and aren't you going to get a haircut?

588
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:26,160
Are you an Old Boy (movie name)?

589
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,400
Are you a weasel, or a hedgehog?

590
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,270
AIsh.

591
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:34,670
And you. Huh? You.

592
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:40,410
You...you, punk. You're a chef, do you think you're a model?

593
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:42,470
You, aren't you going to get shorter now? Huh?

594
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:48,620
You, go take your overpriced hair and go be ugly somewhere!

595
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,560
Aren't you lowering your gaze?

596
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:58,030
Just looking at you annoys me, She-Bong!

597
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:09,630
I don't think we can make it, do you?

598
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:12,960
I don't think I'm going to last. He is totally a rabid dog.

599
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,360
He's a mad dog, a mad dog.

600
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,960
It's such a bother, can't we just toss him anything as a gift?

601
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,610
Ah, I know.

602
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:24,730
I got a blue jean package delivered this morning.

603
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:29,390
A belt came with it, as a gift with purchase. Can't we just give that to him?

604
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:31,050
Blow it out!

605
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:32,300
Blow it out!

606
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,960
Why did you guys do this? Thanks.

607
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,010
A birthday bang!

608
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:59,110
Hey, it's not like everybody doesn't have a birthday.

609
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:01,430
Hey!

610
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:05,940
I can't stand fussing over me.

611
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:10,960
But, considering your thoughtfulness, I should probably open it, huh?

612
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:13,280
Whoa, it looks rich!

613
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,670
Oh, the smell. Is this a leather smell?

614
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:17,800
It's so nice.

615
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,680
Isn't this a name brand?

616
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:21,900
This.

617
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:26,350
Isn't this pleather?

618
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:27,970
Huh?

619
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:33,480
Kidding!

620
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,240
Hey, you can tell it's leather just from looking at it!

621
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,470
Isn't this real water buffalo leather or what?

622
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:42,250
It's a milking cow.

623
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:44,920
Isn't this really expensive? Did you spend too much?

624
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:48,920
Sous Chef, what are you saying? You've done so much for us.

625
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:53,610
If you say that, we're going to feel bad and get mad. Really.

626
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:57,610
I'm sorry. I'm sorry earlier.

627
00:43:57,610 --> 00:44:02,710
Hey, then. Then after we're done working, I'll treat!

628
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:04,640
Deal, deal!

629
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,510
What is this? Is is someone's birthday? Is it Min Soo's birthday today?

630
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:10,940
It's a bit embarrassing but yes, it is.

631
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:14,420
Your mother must have struggled in the sweltering heat.

632
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:18,790
Hey, then use this to buy something good to eat since I don't have anything.

633
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:22,130
Chef, Chef! How much can I spend?

634
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:25,960
Why ask that? Just use it in moderation. What, $300?

635
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:29,600
We have to go two rounds, how about $400?

636
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,870
Use it to your heart's content.

637
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:35,430
My heart's content. Okay! Okay!

638
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:39,300
Can't you buy all the groceries at once, Father?

639
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,560
Buying piddly amounts every day, it's such a bother.

640
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:45,050
You have to buy it that day for it to be fresh.

641
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:47,590
How hard is it for a young guy to carry that?

642
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:49,360
That's not it, Father.

643
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,650
I, too, have a social status and reputation.

644
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:53,380
But carrying around these onions,

645
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:56,580
how will wives and children of this community see me as?

646
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:58,940
This is why even that Na Bong Seon looks down on me.

647
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:01,230
Be quiet, kid.

648
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:06,650
Your sister bought groceries every morning and night for business.

649
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:10,730
It's because being a glutton for punishment was noona's style, that's why.

650
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,720
Let's go together, Father.

651
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:32,900
Here you go. It's the apple that you like.

652
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,910
Eat a lot.

653
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:42,280
How is my dead sister going to eat it? Such a waste.

654
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,740
Bad girl.

655
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,510
Why did you do it?

656
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:53,430
Bad girl under Heaven.

657
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:07,020
Ahjussi!

658
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:09,800
My goodness, Officer Choi!

659
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,000
What are you doing here?

660
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,720
Oh, we're heading back after getting some groceries.

661
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,070
Ah, I'll give you a ride. Get in.

662
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:17,640
Ah, no, it's okay. We can walk.

663
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,280
It's on my way anyway. And you have things to carry.

664
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,650
Gyeong Mo, over there.

665
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:24,320
Get in, Father. It's not good manners to refuse too much.

666
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,300
Thank you, Officer Choi.

667
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,260
-Oh my goodness.
-Give it here.

668
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:29,880
I feel so bad, what can I do?

669
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,550
It's okay.

670
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:35,160
Let's go.

671
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,040
What?

672
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:39,640
 You tie your laces very uniquely.

673
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:43,330
 I tie them like this.

674
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:45,750
 They don't come undone if you tie them this way.

675
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:48,740
Your shoelaces are quite unique.

676
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:52,520
Ah, this? Is it Bong Seon? That restaurant gal.

677
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:55,140
She tied it for me.

678
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:57,030
-Bong Seon did?
-Yeah.

679
00:46:57,030 --> 00:47:00,250
She said if it comes undone often, I'd get hurt, so she tied them so tightly.

680
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,270
That young gal is so clever.

681
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:05,000
Ah, yes.

682
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:08,960
Are you going to party?

683
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,610
Yes.

684
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:12,330
It would be nice if you would come, too.

685
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:17,530
We need a feminine lady right there. To call her a woman.

686
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:19,380
Sous Chef, you're not my type either!

687
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:21,670
That's a good thing!

688
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:24,430
Go have fun, I won't be going.

689
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:26,820
-Are you going now?
-Yes, Chef.

690
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:28,490
Chef, aren't you coming?

691
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:31,500
-If you don't have any plans, you should come with us.
-Me?

692
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:34,190
Ah! He probably wouldn't go.

693
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:37,340
Because our chef is so conservative.

694
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:39,380
Let's just go have fun by ourselves.

695
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:41,390
Okay, you go by yourselves.

696
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:43,040
So that way you'll think of me when you're out of things to eat with alcohol.

697
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,190
Hey, what are you saying?

698
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:48,010
We'll be going.

699
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:49,380
Chef, we're off.

700
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:50,490
Have a fun time!

701
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:52,880
We'll eat well!

702
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:04,930
To our great Sous Chef, celebrating his royal birthday...

703
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:11,390
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

704
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,420
This is so good! I'm going to eat so much today!

705
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:22,240
Hey, dig in, dig in. It's Kang Seon Woo's card, don't worry.

706
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,810
When else would be be able to use Chef's card?

707
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:26,760
I'm even going to make a donation with this.

708
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:29,400
Make that donation to me. Let's order another one more chicken.

709
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,220
One chicken? You small minded person, you.

710
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:35,750
Go with ten chicken per one person.

711
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:39,530
Ten chicken, deal! Please give us ten chickens!

712
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:43,400
And beer too!

713
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:49,610
I...on the foot of a riverbed where misty fog was rendering a mysteriously feel-

714
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:53,140
- Can I have another beer, please? 
 - Aren't you listening to me?

715
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,250
The misty fog-

716
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:58,000
You should really listen to him-

717
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,260
Aren't you listening to me?

718
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:05,080
So there was a misty fog, then a crane, a crane,

719
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:08,440
a crane was holding a chicken like this.

720
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:12,840
That was my mom's dream, my conception dream. It's a crane.

721
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:16,500
Oh, it's a crane.

722
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:20,030
Hey, a crane flew in here. Here you go, Crane.

723
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:23,190
Try eating this. Feed the babies, too.

724
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:27,570
Ah! That's why he makes us crane around.

725
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:32,210
Sous Chef is talking about a Crane.

726
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:37,850
Whenever he drinks, he blurts out things because he is drunk.

727
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:40,850
Where did Bong Seon go? Bong Seon's gone.

728
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:45,060
Crane, Bong Seon's gone.

729
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:50,190
Hello? Do you hear me?

730
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:53,130
Please turn on your light.

731
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:56,990
Bong! What are you doing here?

732
00:49:56,990 --> 00:50:01,220
Ah! Joon Sunbae! Hi!

733
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:04,650
Are you drunk? Why are you wearing that?

734
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:08,320
Ah, this? My head hurts,

735
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:13,000
but if I wear this, it's tight here and my head hurts less.

736
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,780
I like this.

737
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:16,520
That's so like you.

738
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:17,840
Come here. Sit over here.

739
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:22,500
Oh, there's a chair here.

740
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:28,730
Joon! Joon Sunbae, since you're a guy, you know how a guy feels, don't you?

741
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:31,870
Probably. Why?

742
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:36,590
Listen carefully. This is about my friend. My friend.

743
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:39,980
My friend has this boyfriend.

744
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:45,600
My friend is a very open type, and she's very forward with her boyfriend.

745
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:49,030
But this boyfriend is freaking out by this,

746
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:53,350
and isn't doing it for her. This punk.

747
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:57,670
But what I'm curious about is that do men normally

748
00:50:57,670 --> 00:51:02,390
not like it when women make the first move?

749
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:06,420
I'm not sure. Is your friend not pretty?

750
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:12,530
It's not that she's not pretty,  but she's not really pretty either, to me.

751
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:14,110
It's either one of these two things,

752
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:16,870
he doesn't want to because she's not pretty, or else,

753
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:23,090
he likes her to the extent that he wants to protect her.

754
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:27,200
If it's the former, then he is a very average guy,

755
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:31,010
if it's the latter, then he is a very decent guy.

756
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:38,860
Ah! Seriously, I don't know! It's so confusing!

757
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:41,710
Is it the former or the latter?

758
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:44,780
I'm not sure,

759
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:47,190
but in my opinion, he's probably the latter.

760
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:49,180
You're pretty.

761
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:55,770
It's not me. It's my close friend. A close friend's story.

762
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:58,590
Then tell that friend to do well.

763
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:01,700
That she'll regret it if she lets him go.

764
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:06,300
But, you don't hold my hand these days.

765
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:08,180
You must have resolved the deficiency in affection.

766
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:13,010
No, it hasn't been resolved yet.

767
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:17,400
Not yet. I'm so confused.

768
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,810
 You Are My Sunshine

769
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:23,550
Is she busy these days? She's not updating it.

770
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:28,180
This is the only decent blog worth reading.

771
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,980
But in any case,

772
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:38,730
they should use moderation. Aren't they coming to work tomorrow?

773
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:46,260
My goodness. They sure are eating a lot.

00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:09,440
♬ So there will be no need for separation.

791
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:16,220
If they've played enough, she should come home now.

792
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:19,530
What is she doing with a bunch of guys?

793
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,100
 Lively Karaok...

794
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,600
They're really going all out.

795
00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:40,950
But this girl, without me,

796
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:46,830
she wants to play with men until now?

797
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:49,680
Is she thinking or not?

798
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:17,670
She's seriously crazy. She's crazy.

799
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:21,430
It's almost 2 am, what are they doing?

800
00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:25,300
She wouldn't be doing this on purpose, would she? To get back at me.

801
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:29,660
If that's the case, then seriously, then she's really childish.

802
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,730
 Yongsan Motel

803
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:37,360
A motel?!!

804
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:41,330
Wait, so Na Bong Seon! She's really crazy!

805
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:44,300
She's really crazy.

806
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:48,210
Hey, Na Bong. Are you this crazy?

807
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:51,780
You're not answering? You're not answering.

808
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:54,730
Answer it, you punk!!

809
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:55,880
 Hello? Who is this?

810
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:58,410
Hey, Min Soo. Where are you?

811
00:55:58,410 --> 00:56:02,910
 Actually, I think this is a motel. But everyone is drunk.

812
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:05,980
Is Na Bong Seon there now, too? Na Bong Seon, too?

813
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:08,080
 Bong Seon?

814
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:09,630
 I think she went to wash up now.

815
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:13,250
What? Washing...washing up? Oh.

816
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:15,770
Which room is it?

817
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:27,050
They even left the door open.

818
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:54,450
Na Bong. Get up.

819
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:56,380
Ah, where...

820
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:59,520
Chef. Chef, where were you?

821
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,930
Shhh!

822
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:11,650
I'm innocent.

823
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,530
Chef....

824
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:18,610
Get up!  Shhh!

825
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:21,250
This won't do.

826
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,620
This won't do?

827
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:31,160
I said to be quiet.

828
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:45,690
He's perverted.

829
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:48,420
Why doesn't he take his pants off and sleep?

830
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:52,360
Ah, that startled me.

831
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,870
- Chef! 
 -Not today.

832
00:57:56,870 --> 00:57:58,030
Let's go home.

833
00:57:58,030 --> 00:57:59,900
Chef, one shot! Let's go!

834
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,420
Get your act together!

835
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:05,220
Oh, Chef!  My Chef is here!

836
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:07,940
Chef, should we go have another drink?

837
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:09,090
One shot!

838
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:11,600
What are you talking about one shot?

839
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,950
Yes, stand up straight!

840
00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:19,260
Ah, the sky is hot, Chef.

841
00:58:20,770 --> 00:58:23,020
Drink some more.

842
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:26,400
More, more.

843
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:32,160
-More, more.
-I'm so full I can't drink anymore. Why do you want me to drink so much?

844
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:35,400
I'm telling you to drink more so you can sober up!

845
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,920
Look at me now.

846
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,720
-Are you sobering up a little?
-I think so.

847
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,480
Seriously.

848
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,100
Are you thinking or not?

849
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:51,380
What woman is so fearless as to go to a motel with a bunch of guys?

850
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:55,350
Ah, yeah, well, I'm different from conservative Chef.

851
00:58:55,350 --> 00:58:57,930
For a cheeky person like me,

852
00:58:57,930 --> 00:59:00,730
I go in and out of motels as if it were my home.

853
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:02,160
Don't be sarcastic.

854
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:03,890
What's wrong with a motel?

855
00:59:03,890 --> 00:59:07,300
It's place made for people to rest and go.

856
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:11,000
And if you were so worried, you should have come with us.

857
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,640
You told me not to.

858
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,870
Saying something about a conservative chef or whatever.

859
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:18,430
This is why it doesn't work with men.

860
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:21,090
Was I really saying for you not to come?

861
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:24,420
Can you not read into it, such a smart person as you?

862
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:26,030
And why are you overreacting?

863
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:28,400
Those guys don't think of me as a woman.

864
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:32,260
Why aren't you a woman? I'm dying from anxiety because you're such a woman.

865
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:33,970
Really?

866
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:41,380
It looks like you don't know much about men.

867
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:45,880
Men can change in a moment. You could find yourself in trouble if you're careless, do you understand?

868
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:48,320
I wish I could find myself in that trouble, please.

869
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,490
This girl really...!

870
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:52,130
Ah, this isn't going to do.

871
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:55,200
From now on, stick right next to me wherever you go. Not even for a moment.

872
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,750
I'm going to stick you to me like gum because I'm so uneasy.

873
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:03,230
Ah, when was it that you told me to get away from you.

874
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:05,700
A person can be so inconsistent going back and forth like this.

875
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:08,540
Cancel what I said before. Stick to me no matter what from now on.

876
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:10,850
Yes.

877
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:13,040
I'll stick to you.

878
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:16,890
Can I stick like this?

879
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:18,760
Like a wad of gum?

880
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:21,520
I like this.

881
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:24,690
You told me to stick to you.

882
01:00:29,470 --> 01:00:31,430
Stick closer. Even closer.

883
01:00:31,430 --> 01:00:32,910
Yes, Chef.

884
01:00:32,910 --> 01:00:35,820
Chef, I'm curious about something.

885
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:41,660
Chef, do you not have any desire to do it or are you holding back with all your might?

886
01:00:42,770 --> 01:00:44,030
No comment.

887
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:45,840
Oh, why no comment?

888
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:48,380
I'm really curious though.

889
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:52,260
I...  well,

890
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:55,300
aren't I a man? Is that even a question?

891
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:04,620
Why? Why aren't we going?

892
01:01:16,110 --> 01:01:19,470
Let's start like this.

893
01:01:19,470 --> 01:01:26,230
And slowly. Let's go on for a long, long time, Na Bong Seon.

894
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:42,750

895
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:50,990
♫  All the people I loved so much   ♫

896
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:57,730
♫  The warmth that's left on my finger tips   ♫

897
01:01:59,290 --> 01:02:05,730
♫   What made the inside of my heart soft   ♫

898
01:02:07,370 --> 01:02:14,030
♫   I don't want to lose that memory  ♫

899
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:17,300
 Preview

900
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:21,750
 I like Chef so much.

901
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:23,800
 I think it's because of you, Unni.

902
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:25,200
 This mood is strange.

903
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,070
 Do you know what's the most dangerous things to you ghosts?

904
01:02:28,070 --> 01:02:29,330
 Because I like you.

905
01:02:29,330 --> 01:02:32,390
 It's emotions. You'll start getting greedy then.

906
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:34,150
 Hey! Aren't you going to do it right?

907
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:35,630
 I'm sorry, Chef.

908
01:02:35,630 --> 01:02:37,280
 I can do this with my eyes closed.

909
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,830
 We can just call someone. Don't waste your energy.

910
01:02:39,830 --> 01:02:43,010
 Why are so many people curious about Bong Seon lately?

911
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:44,340
 Let's go on a trip.

912
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:47,770
 I want to go with you now, overnight.
