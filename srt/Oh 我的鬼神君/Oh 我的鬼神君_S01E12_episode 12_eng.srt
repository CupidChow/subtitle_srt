 Oh My Ghostess
Episode 12

3
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,260

4
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,120
 Okay. I can't back down now.

5
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,100
 Chef wants me to come. He's waiting for me because he's worried.

6
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,100
 I like him so much. What it took to win his heart.

7
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,260
 I'm only going to think about myself. Just this once.

8
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:08,080
 I'm going to protect it no matter what, Chef's heart.

9
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,880
-Chef!
-Where were you?

10
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,870
What is it?  Because of you sleep is gone.

11
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:26,180
My goodness, this is trouble. Big trouble. You're completely smitten with me.

12
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,700
I suppose there is part of me that is hard to break loose from, once you've fallen for me.

13
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,210
I understand, so let go.

14
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,040
I don't want to. I don't want to separate myself from you.

15
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,880
What is this at the intersection? Are you in a manic episode?

16
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,450
When was it that you wouldn't even let me touch you?

17
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:50,120
It's your hobby to flip-flop.

18
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,270
So you want to stay like this?

19
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,880
Yes.

20
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,520
 Oh My Ghostess
Episode 12

21
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,580
Officer Han!

22
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,990
Congratulations, for your release! Here.

23
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,450
What is it? What's with the tofu? Did I go to jail?

24
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:31,310
For a policeman, it isn't jail, but the hospital you're supposed to eat this when you get out. It's organic.

25
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,670
Organic?

26
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,490
Please give me your bag.

27
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:45,430
It's embarrassing the more I think about it? Attacking a policeman?

28
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:51,190
He got me off-guard. In any case, when I catch this guy I'm going to chop him up.

29
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:56,790
He smeared dung on the mighty Han Jin Goo's police life. I'm going to catch and kill him.

30
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:03,710
Aren't you hungry? You probably suffered eating flavorless hospital food.

31
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,970
-Hangover soup.
-Okay.

32
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,310
-I need to eat hangover soup.
-Let's go, to the hangover soup.

33
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,210
I can't stay in a hospital.

34
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:13,890
Here's the blood sausage soup.

35
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:17,830
Thank you for the food.

36
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:22,350
I was worried hearing you were hospitalized. But it's good to see you.

37
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,470
I'm glad to see you, too. Thank you.

38
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,050
Okay, eat a lot.

39
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:39,550
Take your time. Aren't you eating too quickly for someone who was just discharged?

40
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:45,810
Hey, have you tried hospital food? It's really bad. This tastes really good. I'm touched.

41
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,350
Here, more blood sausage.

42
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:51,410
-Hey, you should give me meat.
-I am giving you meat.

43
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,630
The more I think about it, the more sorry I am to Eun Hee.

44
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:08,650
You know that CCTV? In a hit and run with no other witnesses, that was the last chance.

45
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:12,310
And I get attacked, does that make any sense?

46
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:19,570
Not at all. You did the best you could.

47
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:25,170
That's why I deliberately didn't say anything to Eun Hee or her brother. Don't worry too much about it.

48
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,810
Can I do that? Eat up.

49
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,870
Yes, please eat.

50
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,060
Hey, hey!

51
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,730
Why are you carrying that? Ask the boys to do it. What if you throw out your back?

52
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:49,510
-It's okay.
-It's mine though.

53
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,970
What?

54
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,550
Take care of your body.

55
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,610
Yes, Chef. I'll keep that in mind.

56
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,910
And also, go to the market with me later.

57
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:03,810
Since they might think it's weird to always go to the market with you. When I give you a sign, say you're hurt and going to the hospital.

58
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:07,670
Yes, then where should I say I'm hurt?

59
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:12,870
Should I say I sprained my ankle ? Or...since it's summer, swelling?

60
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,590
Say anything. Anything.

61
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,710
Yes, anything.

62
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,370
Your mood is strange today.

63
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:24,850
This is not manic, maybe it's a little bit of a precocious child...

64
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:28,670
I find you most endearing when you're in the middle. See you later.

65
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,090
Yes, Chef.

66
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,150
Wow.

67
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,970
-What is it?
-Is everyone gathered?

68
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,850
What? What? What do we need to know?

69
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:55,350
Stay still. Our Chef and Bong,

70
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:58,810
I think the two of them are dating.

71
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:04,770
Why you! Saying nonsense from early in the morning.

72
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,910
Is Chef on drugs to date Bong?

73
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:11,610
Hey, Ji Woong. I really like you, but I don't think that's right.

74
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:16,670
Seriously, I really saw them.

75
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:21,790
When I was coming out of the restroom, Chef goes, "Bong,"

76
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,750
you're precocious. See you later."

77
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,170
Clear away that head. Clear away that head.

78
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:34,870
They probably ran into each other and bumped their heads. Who does this as a sign of affection?

79
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,310
Is it some kind of Kim Bok Nam's fashion show?

80
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:41,710
Oh man, you can be so dense. The vibe was like back when...it was vague.

81
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:47,150
Close that mouth! That mouth! Just make your debut.

82
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:52,070
This guy...if he is going to write a fiction, he should stick to what's possible.

83
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:55,890
Come here. Lately,

84
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,990
do you really not know who Chef has something like that with?

85
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,730
Who is it?

86
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:04,510
What's beneath the light is most possible.

87
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:10,450
What are we going to do with you? You'll have to let your goddess go now.

88
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,870
Goddess? PD Lee?

89
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:17,290
Ding, dong, deng, dong!

90
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:21,110
I had a feeling about the two of them.

91
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,250
When we went to MT, oooh~

92
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:31,810
The two of them were finally stuck together. That's why I brought Bong and put her in our car.

93
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:35,410
- Really? 
- Isn't it your impression and not confirmed?

94
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:39,650
It's for sure. My feeling has never been wrong.

95
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:43,970
But, what? But, Chef and Bong?

96
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:49,330
Hey, punk. If Chef and Bong have that kind of relationship,

97
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:57,890
I'll live the rest of my life as an eunuch.

98
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,150
Oh, geez.

99
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:04,130
I'll be going to mise en place.

100
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,410
I'll going.

101
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,590
This is really annoying!

102
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:11,530
Hey, get up! Let's eat this.

103
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:17,370
I went to a funeral service and snuck some food out.

104
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:21,500
Stop feeling so sad about it, girl.

105
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:26,010
If you're here being lovesick, will that virile man even notice?

106
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:34,530
You should have stretched your legs where you're suited. Why did you get involved in an impossible relationship being a ghost and all?

107
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,530
I think we have to give up on getting rid of the virgin vexation.

108
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:45,590
Hey, let's just do the rite to heaven. I'll do it the least painfully,

109
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:49,010
I'll send you off quickly without it being too hard.

110
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:57,410
Hey, is your mouth glued shut? Someone who would chatter on and would never shut her mouth before...you should at least act like you're listening.

111
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:02,810
Whatever. Do whatever pleases you. Just lie there and become a fossil or not, I don't care.

112
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:30,780
 Don't eat too much.

113
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,530
It's delicious. Seaweed.

114
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:45,870
-What is it? What is it? Who is it? Who is it?
-It's nothing.

115
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:49,490
You look like you're hiding something. Something good is going on lately, isn't it?

116
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:52,850
-What good thing? I said it's not.
-It's written all over your face.

117
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:56,770
I. am. dating. Is it that wonderful?

118
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:01,570
I said I wasn't.

119
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:05,110
You don't believe me. I'm done eating.

120
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,350
I'm going to the market, so get everything ready.

121
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,550
Yes, Chef!

122
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,960
-Ow!
-What is it? What is it?

123
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,030
I twisted my ankle earlier.

124
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:27,190
I hurt it pretty bad and I think I need to go see a doctor.

125
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,960
Oh, no.

126
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,440
 There's so much to be done after eating, She-Bong!

127
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,300
Hurry up and and run there and back.

128
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,690
Yes, Sous Chef! I'm sorr... Ow!

129
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:41,060
It hurts so  much, what am I to do?

130
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,400
It hurts so badly.

131
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:48,660
Man, he bopped me in the head. Geez!

132
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:53,420
Wow, I'm getting goosebumps. She's acting, did you see her foot-acting?

133
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:57,270
When she said she was hurt, it was her left foot.

134
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,540
But when she was leaving, it was her right foot she was limping on.

135
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:03,100
Sous Chef, she's going after Chef, I'm telling you.

136
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,140
She's not. She's not.

137
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:12,060
How is he supposed to get through life without a clue like this?

138
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,840
-I really saw it!
-It's not, you Old Boy!

139
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,270
Oh, is it too dark?

140
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,630
There.

141
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:44,150
-Chef, give it here.
-It's fine. I'm strong.

142
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:47,480
See this. Touch it, try touching it.

143
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,370
-Where?
-It's no joke.

144
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:54,030
What do you mean where? They must be hiding today. It really is no joke.

145
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:58,310
After touching it again, I think they're there. They're really awesome.

146
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,170
-Right?
-Yes.

147
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:03,120
When we're out, you should wear your hair down. It's prettier that way.

148
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,590
Really?

149
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,800
There. It's pretty.

150
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,000
- Hyung! 
 - Ah, Joe.

151
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,540
Hey!

152
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,420
-Did you come to get groceries?
-Isn't that too much?

153
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,430
You don't even visit anymore. Your affection for me cooled off, did it?

154
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:21,990
I've been busy. Let's get together some time.

155
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:25,220
But why are you carrying everything? It's so heavy.

156
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,000
If you brought the pipsqueak, you should put her to work.

157
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,610
Ah, Chef, give them here. My arm fell asleep, but it's okay now.

158
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,970
Why don't you send her back and you and I can grab a bowl of shaved ice.

159
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:37,870
Don't you run a business?

160
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:43,360
You've just started your business! Instead of thinking about selling one more dish...Get going!

161
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,170
It's just that it's been so long since I saw you.

162
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,570
I'll see you next time. Just go.

163
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:50,720
Nagging the hell out of me when it's been a while since we've seen each other.

164
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,990
-Chef, I'm really okay.
-I know. Let's go.

165
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,600
Chef, let go of my hand.

166
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,520
There are so many people, and so many people recognize you.

167
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,000
Who cares? Is this a crime?

168
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,370
-You like holding my hand.
-Huh?

169
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,030
Chef, but where are we going?

170
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:16,990
Somewhere. Somewhere that you'll feel really moved by.

171
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,110
Why here?

172
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,970
We're here to eat, why, do you think I came to sell you at the blood sausage soup place?

173
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,660
I can't really eat blood sausage soup.

174
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,300
What are you talking about? It's your favorite food.

175
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,790
-Me?
-Yeah.

176
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:39,030
-Ah,
-It's here.

177
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,470
-Enjoy.
-It's perfect to eat now, isn't it?

178
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,690
Yes, please enjoy.

179
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,260
-Eat up.
-Yes, Chef.

180
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:52,090
It smells amazing, too.

181
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:59,390
This is the flavor, this flavor. It's good.

182
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:02,640
-Hurry up and eat.
-Yes.

183
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:07,430
-You liked it so much, why aren't you eating?
-I should eat it.

184
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,350
Ah, this girl.

185
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:17,390
Here.

186
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:22,690
-Don't you see my hand blushing? Hurry up and eat.
-Yes, Chef.

187
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,350
-Isn't it amazing?
-Yes, it's delicious.

188
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:33,870
The highlight is the intestines cooked with chives and soybean paste.

189
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:38,480
Eat a lot, Chef.

190
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,770
No, no. I ate a lot of mixed noodles earlier. You eat it.

191
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,950
-Yes. 
-Eat a lot.

192
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:49,830
Yes, Chef. It looks tasty.

193
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,410
May I stop by the restroom?

194
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:02,130
Of course.

195
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,820
It's okay. This is the extent of it.

196
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:20,460
Yeah, blood sausage soup is helping me out, too.

197
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:24,370
It's good for clearing out the toxins.

198
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:30,060
You're okay, Na Bong Seon. You're doing well. You can do this.

199
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,300
What took you so long? Hurry up and eat.

200
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:38,480
-Ah, Chef, you ate a lot.
-I thought it wouldn't be enough so I ordered another serving.

201
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,670
-What?
-Isn't that good?

202
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,360
Oh, So Hyeong.

203
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,430
 Yeah, friend. If I don't call, you never do. Are you going to be like this?

204
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:57,390
No, I'm sorry. I was busy.

205
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:01,910
 I'm kidding, don't be nervous. It's just that an opportunity for a shoot came up.

206
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:05,560
 I was thinking about going to your restaurant to take them. What do you think?

207
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,560
 Ah. If you need to, you should. When?

208
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,840
 Ahjumma, please bring the cooking shears.

209
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,310
I think tomorrow will work.

210
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:21,310
Oh, okay. Then call me.

211
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:24,170
Thank you.

212
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,780
You worked hard in this heat.

213
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:43,440
They're coming tomorrow to shoot Chef To Chef, so just know that.

214
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,680
Woohoo!

215
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,960
 Please!

216
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,960
Overreacting like you're uncultured. Is a broadcast such a big deal?

217
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:56,500
Chefs shouldn't like being on TV too much. Then you'll turn out like Marco. A fame hog.

218
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,230
-Doctors can't even fix that.
-Yes, Chef.

219
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:03,350
Tomorrow's special will be the eggplant marinara.

220
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,400
-Na Bong.
-Yes?

221
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,630
-You give it a try.
-What?

222
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,550
M-m-me?

223
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:15,020
Why are you so surprised? How long are you going to wash dishes?

224
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,870
No, but still.

225
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:20,800
 But, Chef. I don't think Bong is at the level to do that yet.

226
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,180
That's why I'm telling her to try. Am I going to leave it to her permanently?

227
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:28,120
You have to stretch your skills to improve them.

228
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:32,560
It's going to be a hairy day, so Joon should cover. The end.

229
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,770
Yes.

230
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:37,750
Whoa! Bong!

231
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,470
It's okay, you can do it.

232
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:43,390
Just watch out.

233
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,560
What are you talking about that you can't do it?

234
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:50,980
I'm still not ready. And I think it will harm the restaurant if I mess up.

235
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,270
You said you could do well before.

236
00:17:54,270 --> 00:18:00,680
Didn't you say yourself that you wanted to chew gum? What happened to that self confidence?

237
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,010
Are you starting your coming and going again?

238
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:08,220
Th-th-that isn't it, Chef.

239
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,690
Hey, Na Bong Seon. You have talent.

240
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:18,350
You have plenty of ability and then some. You made the dried pollack rice soup and the buckwheat flour pancakes.

241
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:25,440
Am I someone who would give opportunities for my personal reasons?

242
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,650
I'm not. I gave you the chance because you deserve it.

243
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:37,750
Hmm? Why aren't you responding? You can do it, can't you, Na Bong Seon?

244
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,020
What?

245
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,700
I'll try my best.

246
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,190
-Okay.
-Yes.

247
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:52,950
You have plenty of ability and then some.

248
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:33,540
Is it going well?

249
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,400
Ah, Chef. Yes, I'm working hard.

250
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,070
 You can't just work hard, it has to taste good.

251
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:43,490
When you're frying the eggplant make sure to rid of the oil. Since it'll absorb the oil.

252
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:44,960
-Isn't it difficult?
-Yes.

253
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,220
It has to be difficult for you to get a good result. What about the sauce?

254
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,610
Yes, it's boiling.

255
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:57,370
You don't have to slice the tomatoes this small. It's better to have some texture.

256
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:01,320
The flavor is good. Let's add a little bit more black pepper. To make it spicier.

257
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,840
Yes, Chef.

258
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:07,290
-You just have to work a little bit more.
-Thank you.

259
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:54,330
How wonderful. How did you live without enjoying such things?

260
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:57,740
What do you think? Do you want to try a bite?

261
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,610
You really  like pork slices.

262
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:05,400
If you don't eat it now, I'm going to eat all of it.

263
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:10,070
Are you really not going to eat? You're not hungry?

264
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:14,750
I guess sickness of the heart goes deep.

265
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:19,440
This girl who goes crazy over everything edible is refusing to eat.

266
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:25,860
Who is it? There's nobody who would come at this hour.

267
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,280
Who is it?

268
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,230
 Dearie! I'm here!

269
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,270
What brought you here?

270
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:32,460
I was on my way home and thought of you.

271
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:36,680
 I bought beer and soju. Isn't that good?

272
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,380
Oh my. You were drinking alone?

273
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,860
Meat and pancakes. You had a funeral ceremony, huh?

274
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,990
Why did you come without even calling?

275
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:48,380
I have a personal life, too.

276
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:51,470
I know you don't have a boyfriend. What personal life.

277
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:54,500
Be a drinking buddy for me today. It's because of my Seon Woo.

278
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,090
I feel uneasy, that's why.

279
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:00,650
Let's not talk about your son if possible.

280
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:06,290
I'm sure there is something going on with him and that Bong Sook girl.

281
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:12,290
But what you told me about that dead lifeline, it keeps bothering me. That something bad will happen to Seon Woo.

282
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:15,270
Let's go out and eat.

283
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,860
-Why?
-I think that would be better.

284
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,080
This is comfortable and there's plenty to eat.

285
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:23,160
There's a food tent out front with a good-looking man. He looks like Jang Dong Geon.

286
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,120
Jang Dong...really?

287
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,280
Come quickly.

288
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,920
Leave all this.

289
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,890
 How old is he?

290
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:52,780
I miss you, Chef.

291
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:38,460
This isn't it.

292
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,140
Oh, I'm busy!

293
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:07,330
I said I really don't have any time!

294
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:28,070
Ow, hot!

295
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,980
It's hot.

296
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:39,890
Seriously! I'm going to go crazy.

297
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:49,070
No, no, Na Bong Seon. You have to have more grit.

298
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:55,090
This is nothing. Darn it. Darn it?

299
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:02,060
Darn it! Seriously! Who says I'm She-Bong?

300
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,260
I am Na Bong Seon!

301
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:09,700
I feel better now.

302
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:14,600
Yeah, just work a little harder, Na Bong Seon.

303
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:19,520
You're doing well. Just a little bit more.

304
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:25,560
Please. Please taste good.

305
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,240
I think it's okay.

306
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:42,390
Oh, you're here? You're late.

307
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:44,150
Oh.

308
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:49,400
There were so many civil complaints today. You didn't sleep?

309
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,760
How could I sleep first when you're not home?

310
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,310
Oh my, what happened to your hand? Did you get hurt?

311
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,470
Oh, a little. I was stopping a fight.

312
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:00,120
Oh no, you should be more careful. Let me see.

313
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,680
It's okay. It's not a big deal.

314
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,950
Let me see. Do you need to see a doctor?

315
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:10,090
It's okay.
I said it was okay, what's the fuss?

316
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,990
Seong Jae.

317
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:23,630
Sorry. I think I'm sensitive lately. I'm really sorry.

318
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:26,670
Don't worry and go to sleep first. I'll go and wash up.

319
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:32,740
Seong Jae. You can get irritable with me from time to time.

320
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:35,560
How can a person be angelic all the time?

321
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:41,210
But, don't get hurt. I don't like you getting hurt.

322
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,630
Oh. Okay. Go to sleep first.

323
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,730
Sounds tasty.

324
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,890
One eggplant special.

325
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:06,070
It's coming out!

326
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:09,030
One eggplant marinara, one special please.

327
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,400
One Shrek, one eggplant.

328
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,300
Yes!

329
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,050
One Shrek

330
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:16,710
and one eggplant marinara is here.

331
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:20,500
I think the eggplant is a success.

332
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,920
Yeah, the response is good. And there are a lot of orders for it.

333
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,250
I tasted it earlier and it was good.

334
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:29,010
Hey, Bong Seon you've improved a lot. Congrats.

335
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,670
Thank you.

336
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,840
All of this is what Bong learned over someone's shoulder.

337
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:41,400
If you didn't have an outstanding chef and outstanding sous chef, do you think this would be possible?

338
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:47,310
 Hey, Bong. This isn't food on the pan. It's your face.

339
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:50,530
- Yes, Sous-Chef. 
- Stop the chatter. Did Shrek go out to 10T?

340
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:51,270
 Yes, Chef!

341
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,510
Then put a check on it!

342
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,520
Yes!

343
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,180
Concentrate on lunch!

344
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,480
Yes, Chef!

345
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:11,000
Give it here.

346
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:17,190
I told you that you can do it, didn't I?

347
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:20,290
Yes, I did it, Chef.

348
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:24,970
After just cleaning empty dishes, how does it feel to send out your dish? Doesn't it feel great?

349
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:28,650
-Yes.
-I still can't forget that first feeling, too.

350
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:33,680
You made it through your first dish. Good job, Na Bong Seon.

351
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,000
Yes.

352
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,850
You have to keep going with that confidence. Let's have a celebratory party after the shoot.

353
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,010
Yes, Chef.

354
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:46,630
Why do we have to do all this work for a restaurant shoot?

355
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:50,070
We could just film it in 6mm, why bring  me here-

356
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:52,330
It's a different picture with you shooting it, Director.

357
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:55,610
What picture when you're just shooting a restaurant?

358
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:57,550
I'll treat you to bean noodles after we're done.

359
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:59,740
-I'm not eating noodles.
-Soba?

360
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,950
-It's fine.
-Then cold buckwheat noodles?

361
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:02,970
Then I'll think about the cold buckwheat noodles.

362
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:03,880
Cold buckwheat noodles it is.

363
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,080
Let's hurry up and do this.

364
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,000
Welcome.

365
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,660
Hello.

366
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,910
Yes, welcome.

367
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,290
Welcome.

368
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:13,750
Welcome.

369
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,860
-Hello.
-Welcome.

370
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,980
Oh, so hot.

371
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,360
Hello!

372
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,480
-Chef Kang.
-Please look kindly on us.

373
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:23,460
Is there anything for me to do?

374
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,510
Unni, you look so cool.

375
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,560
Seeing you today, you look like a real producer.

376
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,590
Did I look like a fake producer until now?

377
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,060
That's not what I mean.

378
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,680
You should have come to a shoot earlier.

379
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,840
PD, PD.

380
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,560
Hello. You got prettier in the few days I haven't seen you.

381
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:43,330
You just need to wear a wedding dress in this state for the game to be over.

382
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:46,100
Thank you for the kind words, Min Soo. Please help with  filming today.

383
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,620
No problem. Just say it and I

384
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:53,690
will do my everything to do it.

385
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:56,000
Just a moment.

386
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,070
You had some beauty on you.

387
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,650
Jewelry is pretty.

388
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:04,660
 Thank you. Please help us do well today. Bong Seon, have you been well?

389
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:07,600
Ah, you're here?

390
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,040
Do well today.

391
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,670
Yes.

392
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,200
What are you doing instead of getting ready?

393
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,690
Yes, Chef!

394
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,250
That kid, seriously...

395
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:24,070
I think you can just naturally follow the hall.

396
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:26,970
Later, please get a full shot of the kitchen.

397
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:31,000
Also, for the food, you can do a 6mm tight insert.

398
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,820
 Ah, okay! Let's just get through this roughly. Roughly.

399
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:37,580
I didn't have to come to this site, but you  made me.

400
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:42,400
Director, why are you like that? You have to be here for the full picture to turn out well.

401
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,380
My goodness, you and your picture.

402
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:49,700
Hey, she wants a nice picture! Hoon, are you getting the setting well?

403
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,630
Yes, it's all ready, Director!

404
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:56,580
 What are you doing there? What's ready? Clear away those things in the way.

405
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:02,330
And arrange the cords. Let's move quickly. It's hot and I'm getting irritable.

406
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,400
Yes, yes, yes.

407
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,020
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

408
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,570
Hey, Bong!

409
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:13,290
 Shouldn't you give the cold water to the PD and the camera director first? Giving out cold water has an order.

410
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,500
-I'm sorry.
-Turn on some sense.

411
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,000
-Yes, I'll do it right away.
-I'll do it.

412
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,140
Yes.

413
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,370
Hey, and see this in the way? Clear it away quickly.

414
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,720
Yes, yes, Sous Chef!

415
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,770
I'll do it. Take care of the staff.

416
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:26,430
Ah,

417
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,990
It's sour! I won't drink.

418
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:31,330
Director, do you think it'll be alright without you looking over the white?

419
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:35,810
I saw it earlier roughly. Do you think I wouldn't do that?

420
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,530
Geesh.

421
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,170
So frustrating.

422
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:43,160
These young PDs don't know anything, but think they do.

423
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,530
Hey, Hoon!

424
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:49,460
Where did he go again? Are you somewhere texting again?

425
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:53,820
Just let me catch you! It's so hot.

426
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,510
 Hey, bring me the battery box.

427
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,450
Me? The battery?

428
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,630
 The battery box. No.

429
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:03,440
-This one?
-Not that one. The one in the corner.

430
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,020
 Ah, this one?

431
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,470
No, the corner. Don't you know what a corner is?

432
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,520
 Uh...

433
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,660
Is that the corner?

434
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,760
This...this one?

435
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,480
Yeah, that one.

436
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,260
There're others around, why are you making her do it?

437
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:18,670
Thanks a lot. There you go.

438
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:22,550
-Thank you.
-Give it here. I'm getting so annoyed.

439
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:26,430
How can you not know what a corner is? Oh, my nose is running.

440
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:28,950
Hey! Hey, hey. Bring that over here.

441
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,280
Yes? What is it?

442
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,250
-That...tissue!
-A tissue?

443
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,700
Don't you see that I have a runny nose?

444
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,990
Yes, I'll bring it right away.

445
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:39,490
There you go.

446
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,350
Is there anything else to be done?

447
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:44,190
No.

448
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:46,330
Go over there.

449
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:49,100
Don't do anything and just sit there and do what I tell you to.

450
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,110
-I'm okay.
-I told you to sit down.

451
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:54,990
You didn't even get to rest on your break. If it was going to be like this, I wouldn't have agree to do this broadcast.

452
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:59,390
Hey, Heo Min Soo! Aren't you going to look out for your family?

453
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:03,390
Because you keep looking down on Bong Seon, other people do that, too.

454
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,710
I'm sorry, Chef.

455
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:07,960
Who are you saying I'm looking down on?

456
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,220
You're making me feel bad.

457
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:13,660
What's wrong with borrowing some help, Chef Kang?

458
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,910
Why are you so irritable?

459
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:19,260
Are you two dating or something?

460
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:23,750
Yes, we are dating.

461
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,520
So please don't mistreat her.

462
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:29,700
Chef...

463
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:38,170
 Wow. Big news.

464
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:42,400
 Wow, how could such a big thing as this happen?

465
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,930
 See? What did I tell you?

466
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:49,750
I told you so many times that the mood between the two of them was suspicious.

467
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:52,120
Why don't you believe me?

468
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,850
It turned out well. Just congratulate them.

469
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:58,110
What? Did you know something was up?

470
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:00,470
Roughly, I had a sense.

471
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,310
Oh, seriously.

472
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:06,920
You deliberately didn't say anything, did you?

473
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,990
You wanted me to get in trouble for abusing Bong,
so you deliberately didn't tell me, did you?

474
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:14,410
No, if the people involved aren't open about it, why should I say anything?

475
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:15,560
Open? It's close, you punk!

476
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:20,740
Hey, why are you being like that?

477
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,130
What?

478
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:25,380
What do I do? Do I have to quit now?

479
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:28,030
Why quit? What do you mean what do you have to do?

480
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,480
Hold him.

481
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,320
Joon, go get a knife and the cutting board.

482
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,830
Okay, Eunuch Heo, take it out.

483
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:37,380
It tickles! It tickles!

484
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:43,790
Oh, what is it? Do you want something to eat?

485
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:49,150
Tell me. Hurry up and tell me. I'll get whatever you want to eat.

486
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:51,200
I'll do it.

487
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,720
Do what?

488
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,250
I'll do the rite to heaven.

489
00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:00,870
Did you make up your mind?

490
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:05,130
Just don't make it hurt too much.

491
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:07,850
Unni, do it well for me.

492
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,470
Okay?

493
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,530
Okay. Okay.

494
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:17,250
I'll muster everything that I can possibly muster.

495
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:22,140
I'll make it so you can go as quickly as possible. So it won't be too hard on you.

496
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,940
Don't worry.

497
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,330
Okay. Let's do it tomorrow. No need to drag it out.

498
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,910
Will you be okay?

499
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,450
Yeah.

500
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:42,280
I'll just go say my final goodbye to my father.

501
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,720
Chef Kang, sorry about earlier.

502
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:49,220
Bye!

503
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,020
Bye!

504
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:56,370
You worked hard, Chef Kang.

505
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:58,190
You were pretty cool today.

506
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:00,880
Have I ever not been cool?

507
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,990
You were slightly more cool today. And romantic, too.

508
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:07,300
Love really must change a person.

509
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:11,120
Sung Gyu said so before that back when you were freshmen, if you have someone you like,

510
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,560
he would make flower rings to give while you just ignored them.

511
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,160
Why are you bringing up the past?

512
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,080
You're off work  now, aren't you?

513
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:22,480
Let's go. I'll buy. For Bong Seon, too.

514
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:26,000
Together?

515
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:29,060
Oh? What are you doing?

516
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,650
Hey, Bong, Bong! Wait a moment!

517
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,520
Hey, I'm going to do it!

518
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,000
This is my expertise.

519
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,060
Do it quickly. Must Bong Seon do this heavy thing?

520
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,620
Sous Chef, I can do it.

521
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,830
Hey!

522
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:47,290
Come with me.

523
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:48,790
Just come here.

524
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:52,240
Come and sit.

525
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,730
Just a moment. Have a seat.

526
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,560
Just wait there.

527
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,890
You know that I cherish you, right?

528
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:04,600
So I nagged you a lot in order to develop you.

529
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,160
And you know how I gave you a lot of work to give you experience?

530
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,850
-Me, too, me, too.
-Just stay still.

531
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,860
So you know how I feel, right?

532
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,850
Of course, I do, Sous Chef.

533
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:19,020
Oh, Bong Seon. When you smile, you're eyes do this and you look like a puppy.

534
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,620
It's so cute!

535
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:24,810
Not like a dog, you look like a puppy.

536
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,200
What is this?

537
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,180
I'll do better. I'll do my best.

538
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,180
Oh, no. I should do better.

539
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:35,250
No, no, I'm going to do better.

540
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,010
Come here.

541
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,940
Thank you!

542
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,650
Chef.

543
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,360
You were surprised, weren't you?

544
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:58,990
Ah, I wasn't planning to put it out in the open like that.

545
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,890
Are you okay, Chef?

546
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:05,070
Of course, I'm okay, kid.

547
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:11,700
But because I spit it out like that without talking to you, I feel a little bad.

548
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:15,520
But please understand me for acting so hastily.

549
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,300
It's okay, right?

550
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:22,320
Oh, yes. I'm okay if you're okay.

551
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:27,110
It's troublesome for me if you speak so sweetly.

552
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:30,990
So Hyeong wants to have a drink. With you, too.

553
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:33,950
What? Me, too?

554
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:37,730
She feels sorry and wants to resolve things.

555
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:39,350
Will you be okay?

556
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,620
Yes.

557
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,430
Okay.

558
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,060
What?

559
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,600
Do you want this, Chef?

560
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,630
Who gave it to you?

561
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,560
Sous Chef.

562
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:56,140
You really worked hard today.

563
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,580
Here.

564
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,910
Here.

565
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:03,770
Let's down our first glasses in one shot.

566
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:05,450
Yes.

567
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:13,550
Do you want some beer? Or soda?

568
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:18,120
Ah, no. I'll drink this soju.

569
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,160
This dimwit.

570
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,640
The one who is envious loses.

571
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,170
Truthfully, I envy you, Bong Seon.

572
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:30,730
Ah, no. You're so cool.

573
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:33,180
I've always been envious of you.

574
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:39,050
How can someone be so bright and confident and attractive.

575
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:43,950
-Really?
-Yes, really.

576
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:49,850
If she wasn't sincere, I could detest her.

577
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:53,330
But she's so sincere, I can't hate her.

578
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:55,910
I lost, Bong Seon.

579
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:57,290
Here, give me a glass.

580
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:58,410
Yes.

581
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:00,650
What's with the two of you?

582
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:04,440
Am I a ghost (as in invisible)? Seriously.

583
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,980
They're really treating me like a ghost.

584
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,080
Yeah, Brother-in-law.

585
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,090
 It's me, Hyungnim. Where are you?

586
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:13,050
I'm drinking after work. Why?

587
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:16,160
 Eun Hee went in for her treatment now.

588
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:21,620
 But I got an emergency call, so could you take Eun Hee home?

589
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:24,370
Oh, really?

590
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,830
Okay, I'll go then.

591
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,530
Yeah, work hard.

592
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:30,710
What? Is something wrong?

593
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:33,570
My brother-in-law had something come up.

594
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:36,230
I have to pick up Eun Hee. What can I do?

595
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:38,570
Just go.

596
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,210
Aren't you too happy to get rid of me?

597
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:45,030
Because you need to go.

598
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,660
Don't drink too much.

599
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,520
And call me if she hits you.

600
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,570
Then I'll hit her, too.

601
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:53,410
She's the one keeping me in check these days, not the other way.

602
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:55,860
Stop that now and go.

603
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,280
Don't you see that my drink is waiting for me?

604
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,470
Bye, Chef.

605
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:01,560
See you.

606
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,130
Here.

607
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:08,570
Clink.

608
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,350
Now, carefully.

609
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:35,710
I feel so bad that you had to rush here for me.

610
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:38,860
Ah, not at all. It's okay.

611
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:42,450
You're my forever no. 1 priority. Aren't you moved?

612
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:44,700
There's a number 0 though, right?

613
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,240
Huh?

614
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,030
Ah, gosh.

615
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:51,630
I'm sorry. You were surprised, weren't you?

616
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:56,370
I don't know how it happened either. I feel like I was bewitched by a ghost, too.

617
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:59,790
It makes me realize that love can make even Kang Seon Woo to dance around.

618
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:02,000
Love? You're sounding too mushy.

619
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,030
It's true. I saw hearts shooting out of your eyes.

620
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:10,700
Since I liked Bong Seon from the beginning, I'll cheer you two on.

621
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:14,980
I earned a great backer. A great backer.

622
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:19,460
Oh, that's right. It's a secret from Mom. Who knows how she'll overreact.

623
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,990
I know.

624
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:25,390
But I think Mom caught on. She asked me how Bong Seon was?

625
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:27,930
Just tell her you don't know. You don't know anything. Just ignore her.

626
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:30,530
Okay, I'll ignore her.

627
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,290
Father.

628
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:39,230
Don't forget when you leave things on the stove.

629
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:43,350
And when business is done, make sure to turn off the gas.

630
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:46,920
See? Again.

631
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:50,000
I said turn that off first.

632
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,550
Oh, that's right. The gas.

633
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:58,620
You listen well, my father.

634
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:04,530
And don't carry heavy things.

635
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:06,790
It will be really bad if your back goes out.

636
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:09,250
And make Kyung Mo do whatever he can do for you.

637
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:11,640
 Yes!

638
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:19,030
Hey, punk.

639
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:24,030
Father only has you now.

640
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:26,440
Grow up.

641
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:30,510
I know you're a good kid.

642
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,210
Take good care of father.

643
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:37,770
Kyung Mo.

644
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:39,810
Yes, sir!

645
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:43,810
Enough with the games.

646
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:47,300
Ah, you made me die!

647
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:50,680
Geesh, when are you ever going to grow up?

648
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,390
For the last time, just once.

649
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:28,910
Let me just see him once more before I go.

650
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:34,730
It's strange. If it's the second bottle,

651
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:37,310
I should be feeling buzzed,

652
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:39,330
but strangely I can't get drunk today.

653
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:41,830
Here.

654
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:45,110
-Drink up.
-One shot!

655
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:52,530
You drink so well.

656
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:54,970
Bong Seon, you could be my drinking buddy.

657
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:58,270
It tastes good.

658
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,650
Bong Seon, you're quite...

659
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:08,850
unique.

660
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:11,870
Sometimes we see this side of you,

661
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:17,370
and at other times, you're like something else. Seon Woo fell hard into this charm, didn't he?

662
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:22,850
Yes, I guess that's part of my charm.

663
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:25,730
-Are you already drunk?
-No.

664
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:32,070
I feel really good, but it's not because I'm drunk. I'm really okay.

665
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:36,950
Bong Seon, you're really cute when you're drunk.

666
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:43,010
In any case, please forget when I overstepped my bounds at your MT.

667
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:45,640
And make Seon Woo happy from now on.

668
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:49,800
Ah, yes, of course!

669
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,040
You're so cute! I can't hate you.

670
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,230
Me too, Unni.

671
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,400
Bong Seon, I said I'd take you home.

672
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:04,090
PD Lee, I'm really okay. I'm not drunk.

673
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:07,310
Do you want to see?

674
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:10,910
This...

675
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:13,830
Someone who's drunk can't do that, but see, I can.

676
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:15,910
Will you really be okay?

677
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:18,730
I'm really okay.

678
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:22,670
PD Lee.

679
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:28,890
People are all naturally selfish, aren't they?

680
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:33,710
When I'm up to my nose with problems and fire is at my feet,

681
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:38,750
there's no time to think about others, right? People usually don't do that, do they?

682
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:43,530
That's right, because they're human.

683
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:45,050
That's right.

684
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:48,610
Why? Are you sorry towards me?

685
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:52,710
Yes. I'm sorry towards you,

686
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:58,770
and I'm sorry towards the ghost and towards Chef.

687
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:06,210
I just want to ignore it this time.

688
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:10,890
I'll be going, PD Lee. Goodbye.

689
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:13,350
Be careful on your way!

690
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:15,410
I'll get scolded by Seon Woo.

691
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:16,970
Yes.

692
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:23,270
She gets really weird when she's drunk.

693
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:26,530
And I think I can understand why he fell for her.

694
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:34,980
♫ It's okay. It will turn out fine.

695
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:42,880
♫ There's a bright future for you.

696
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:49,660
♫ It's okay. It will work out fine.

697
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:55,960
Okay, it will turn out fine.

698
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:59,760
Have you ever been happier than this, Na Bong Seon?

699
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,520
 What are you doing? Play with me.

700
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:14,100
 I don't want to! I'm not going to play with you!

701
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:18,520
 Why is Na Bong Seon always going around alone?

702
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,380
 She can't talk, can she?

703
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:23,240
 But she sometimes answers about as loud as a mosquito.

704
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,820
 Stop caring. She's always dreary, it's annoying.

705
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,180
 Me, too.

706
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:37,600
Okay.

707
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:43,460
It can't get better than this, can it? Yeah.

708
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:47,980
It's okay. It will turn out fine.

709
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:58,640
Na Bong Seon.

710
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:19,660
Wait! Wait a moment!

711
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:31,460
Didn't you come to see Chef?

712
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,460
No, I didn't.

713
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:41,370
I'm on my way back from saying my last goodbye to my father. Coincidentally.

714
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:44,330
Are you okay?

715
00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:47,740
Yeah.

716
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:52,980
Hey, you're lucky. You almost became my junior.

717
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:55,280
I saved you.

718
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:00,920
Watch out for cars.

719
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,300
It's your loss if you die.

720
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:07,150
-I'm going.
-Just a minute.

721
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:12,140
So,

722
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,700
I'm sorry.

723
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,950
And also, thank you.

724
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:28,500
You're saying things that don't make sense. Why would you be sorry?

725
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:33,740
Who's the one who caused a nuisance by possessing someone else's body? You're embarrassing me.

726
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:38,830
Na Bong Seon,

727
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:44,880
be happy. Please.

728
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:51,010
I'm really going. Eat and live well.

729
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:16,360
Isn't this the car from earlier?

730
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:31,850
Officer Choi?

731
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:35,300
Shin Soon Ae.

732
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:42,820
Hey, punk! Are you crazy? Get out here!

733
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:46,020
Hey! Get out now!

734
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,760
Get out, you punk!

735
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:26,700
Ah, you scared me!

736
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:29,680
You startled me.

737
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,820
Hey, did you see your father?

738
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:35,700
Did you say your farewell?

739
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:38,660
Hey!

740
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:42,440
What's wrong with her?

741
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:46,470
Is it because you're sad after meeting your father?

742
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:50,590
So why did you go to say goodbye? It only pains your heart.

743
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:51,830
Unni,

744
00:52:51,830 --> 00:52:52,860
What?

745
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:58,570
I think I'm going to have to push back my rite to heaven.

746
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:02,250
What? Why now?

747
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:04,850
Is it because you can't leave your father as he's in your thoughts?

748
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:09,960
It's not that. Something is strange.

749
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,450
What's there to be strange?

750
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:15,900
Hey, you're the strangest one, girl.

751
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:20,470
No. He's not the person I knew.

752
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:26,370
The feeling. The feeling was strangely bad.

753
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:30,320
I don't think I can leave like this.

754
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:34,170
What in the world are you saying?

755
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:38,120
Are you making excuses because you don't want to do the rite to heaven?

756
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:41,340
If not, did you meet that virile man? Is it because you're wavering?

757
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:46,000
It's not that. That person,

758
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:50,340
that person is trying to kill Na Bong Seon.

759
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:53,920
Who is? That virile man?

760
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:57,530
No. Officer Choi.

761
00:53:57,530 --> 00:53:59,600
If it's Officer Choi,

762
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:03,780
that virile man's younger sister's husband?

763
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:12,540
Na Bong Seon!

764
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,010
Yes, Chef.

765
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:16,020
Did you drink a lot? You didn't answer your phone.

766
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:17,960
My phone?

767
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,780
 Missed calls

768
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,750
You look like you don't feel that well.

769
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:26,210
Did something happen with So Hyeong?

770
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:30,460
No, nothing happened. I feel fine.

771
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:32,300
-Really?
-Yes.

772
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,970
And here I thought....

773
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:36,580
Let's go in and try making something, I'm starving to death.

774
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:41,140
Ah, you haven't eaten yet, have you? What should I make for you, Chef?

775
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:43,970
Rice.

776
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:47,320
That fried rice you made.

777
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:50,160
Fried rice?

778
00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:57,020
I thought you didn't eat rice.

779
00:54:57,020 --> 00:55:00,390
Yeah, I didn't eat it, it's not that I couldn't.

780
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:02,540
I'm going to start eating it now.

781
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:08,120
Not eating it became a habit, so I get an upset stomach.

782
00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:14,160
And you prefer rice. If I'm going to eat with you, I have to practice eating it.

783
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:17,980
-Hurry, hurry, hurry.
-Ah, okay.

784
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:19,970
It's done.

785
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:24,520
That smells reasonable.

786
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,930
I'm going crazy to eat it.

787
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:38,390
It's edible. Wow, indeed,

788
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:40,710
whose student are you?

789
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:46,920
Make rice for me. I'm going to try being Korean.

790
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,460
Yes.

791
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:55,310
Your expression is strange since earlier.

792
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:57,220
No, I'm okay.

793
00:55:57,220 --> 00:56:01,200
You don't look okay. Did nothing really happen?

794
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:05,770
No, I'm just a little tired today.

795
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:09,520
I guess you had a lot of surprises today. I'm sure you're exhausted.

796
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,700
This won't do. Let me hurry up and eat so we can go out.

797
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,200
Where to?

798
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,220
To get some air.

799
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:18,860
Where are....

800
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:22,060
Don't you know by looking? It's Namsan.

801
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:24,220
You said you wanted to come here.

802
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:28,990
Well, people from the countryside only talks about Namsan Tower or Tower 63.

803
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:31,200
I did?

804
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:36,320
You said it last time at the playground. That there were so many things you hadn't done.

805
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:41,910
You haven't been to Namsan nor to a cruise ship. You kept on saying this and that, so I'm going to let you do it.

806
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:44,090
Since it's your wish.

807
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:51,600
I have a lot of sense, right? I usually just listen mindlessly to what people say.

808
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:56,630
But I especially remembered what you said. Aren't you touched?

809
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,390
You're not?

810
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:02,240
What?

811
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,820
No, I like it.

812
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:06,440
Then should we go there?

813
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:12,090
It is a little tacky, but there must be a reason couples die to go there.

814
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:21,060
I'm not the type who enjoys looking at the view like this.

815
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:26,260
But because of Na Bong Seon, I'm doing all sorts of things.

816
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:30,270
And when you come here, aren't you supposed to take pictures and stuff?

817
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:36,240
The view. Ready.

818
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:48,980
There.

819
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:52,500
Ah, it's cool.

820
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:54,930
It's really nice.

821
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:59,630
It's only nice because you're here with me. It's important who you come with.

822
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:06,000
I like it, too. Because I'm here with you.

823
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:15,450
Do you know when I was really thankful to you?

824
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:23,570
When my alumni came to my restaurant, I was a little crazy.

825
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:27,250
But when I came to my senses,

826
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:36,250
in the 33 years of my life, I was the most humiliated, pathetic and lonely.

827
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:46,600
Your buckwheat pancake from that day and you annoyingly talking to me was comforting.

828
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,740
 It's not me.

829
00:58:50,490 --> 00:58:52,690
I was alone since I was young,

830
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:58,430
so it became a habit to keep it to myself when I was lonely or sad.

831
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:05,330
But having someone by my side, just with that,

832
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:10,160
I realized that it brings comfort.

833
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:15,750
 It's not me. Chef wanting to start eating rice, too.

834
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:19,970
 The one who gave comfort to Chef, too, none of that was me.

835
00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:22,240
Thank you, Na Bong Seon.

836
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:26,820
For having me do things I've never done.

837
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:30,310
And for being by my side.

838
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:35,910
 It's not. It's not me.

839
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:01,120
Let's go.

840
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:09,430
Oh, we're going.

841
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:20,990
On the way down, the view looks different. It's fascinating.

842
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:24,100
We've done Namsan this time, so we'll go to a cruise ship next.

843
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:27,450
I can't help it if you're uncultured.

844
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:29,610
It's not me.

845
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:32,620
Okay, fine.

846
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:37,240
You're not uncultured. I was just kidding.

847
01:00:37,850 --> 01:00:41,390
It's not me that you like.

848
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:44,260
What?

849
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:50,020
What are you saying? The one I like isn't you?

850
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:55,780
What are you talking about, Na Bong Seon?

851
01:00:59,470 --> 01:01:01,380
It's a ghost.

852
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:04,790
Huh?

853
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:10,760
I said that it's a ghost that you like.

854
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:21,640
I... actually, I see ghosts.

855
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:25,060
And my body was possessed by a ghost.

856
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:30,010
Do you know the possessions that people talk about?

857
01:01:30,010 --> 01:01:35,450
So, the one that you like,

858
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:38,130
is the me that's possessed by a ghost.

859
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:41,150
It's not me.

860
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,430
I'm sorry.

861
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:07,930
I'm sorry, Chef.

862
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:17,520
I can't understand what you're saying.

863
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:20,400
Don't cry.

864
01:02:50,090 --> 01:02:51,970
I'm sorry, Chef.

865
01:02:51,970 --> 01:02:53,730
Na Bong.

866
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:14,270

867
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:32,590
♫  The people I love so much, ♫

868
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:40,720
♫  the warmth that remains on my fingertips, ♫

869
01:03:42,510 --> 01:03:48,890
♫  the glamorous memories in my mind, ♫

870
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:54,340
♫  I don't want to forget ♫

871
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:56,670
 Oh my Ghostess 
 ~Preview~

872
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:07,330
♫  The sun rises again and time flows, ♫

873
01:04:07,330 --> 01:04:13,700
♫  Yesterday gets stained with today's life ♫

874
01:04:15,610 --> 01:04:23,360
♫  I will also be forgotten and will disappear, ♫

875
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:31,900
♫ That's how everyone leaves ♫
