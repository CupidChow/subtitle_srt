00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,740
 Oh My Ghostess

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,900
 Oh My Ghostess

3
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,610
 Oh My Ghostess

4
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,350
Hey, Kang Seon Woo, you jerk.

5
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:08,310
-You're...
-Yes, it's me. Wow, you look healthy.

6
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,860
You must be in great condition after playing with a naive girl and discarding her.

7
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,150
What are you talking about?

8
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:22,590
What am I saying? Are you asking because you don't know what I'm talking about, you jerk?

9
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,430
Why did you do that to Na Bong Seon? Why did you hurt that frail girl?

10
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:33,660
I've never seen such a bright and positive girl like her other than my sister.

11
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:39,180
But what did you do to her that overnight she became hunched over and unable to eat even a bite of food?

12
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,620
-You call yourself a human?
-How do you know that she's not eating?

13
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,640
Because she's at out house, you jerk!

14
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,760
Be happy.

15
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,670
Oh, Grandma.

16
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,220
Huh?

17
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:15,520
No, nothing's going on. I'm doing well.

18
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,600
What? Who came? Who did?

19
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,110
 Na Bong Seon!

20
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:36,200
♫   Close my eyes.Hazy longing, more than a dream   ♫

21
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,090
You were alive?

22
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,580
Huh?

23
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,980
This is where you ran away to? You came here deliberately for me to come get you, didn't you?

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:56,460
-No.
-I'm right.

25
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,030
Don't delude yourself, Na Bong.

26
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:06,310
I didn't run here to forgive you for deceiving me. I was just so worried.

27
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,780
I'm holding you because my heart is telling me to hold you.

28
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,590
Let me hold you and put my mind at ease a little.

29
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,020
I missed you.

30
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,530
Don't speak like a mosquito, I can't hear a word you're saying.

31
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,760
I said I missed you, Chef, so very, very much.

32
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:43,540
I thought about it and the one thing I'm sure of,

33
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:50,500
so I, from before, long before you were possessed by ghosts.

34
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,950
I watched over you, thought about you, and worried about you.

35
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,500
So, for now, don't disappear from my sight.

36
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,450
Because I'm going to go crazy worrying about you.

37
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,480
Chef.

38
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,480
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

39
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,820
♫  Walk away just like that    ♫

40
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,400
 Episode 14

41
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,020
Your face looks so haggard after just a few days. You should have eaten.

42
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,650
What's with "You are my sunshine?"

43
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,430
How did you know about my blog?

44
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:47,100
I have my ways. I know you like the back of my hand.

45
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,740
What's with the son of that restaurant that he is all worked up about our business? He came at  me abruptly.

46
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,480
What? Oh, are you okay, Chef?

47
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:02,590
Fortunately, he can't hit. But it still turned out good for me.

48
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,940
Thanks to him, I was able to find out where you were.

49
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,860
There isn't anything with him and me.

50
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:14,620
When I was possessed, I think he was unknowingly drawn to his sister since they're related.

51
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,000
You're making many men into fools. Who was I drawn to then?

52
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,860
I mean, in any case,

53
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,600
can a person change overnight?

54
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,220
I'm asking since it's already out there,

55
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:43,010
but that day, the one who rode the swings with me wasn't you?

56
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,360
Swings? Probably not.

57
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,520
Then the wasted one I piggy-backed out of the motel?

58
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,780
The ghost.

59
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:58,350
Then at the MT, the one who was locked up in the storage freezer who scared the life out of me. Her, too?

60
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,950
Yes, the ghost.

61
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,950
Then the one who caught the bike seat thief...

62
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,380
Oh, that was me. I did that, Chef. I did.

63
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:14,440
That's something to brag about. Yeah. Nice job.

64
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:24,880
So what you're saying, the one who kept coming at me wanting to do it, that manic.

65
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,290
You're saying it wasn't you but the ghost, right?

66
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,250
Yes.

67
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,660
Agh, this is driving me crazy.

68
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,680
I didn't do anything wrong, but I feel like a bad guy. I wasn't even two-timing.

69
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,560
A love triangle having a thing with a ghost.

70
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:47,120
But thinking about it now,

71
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,160
the reason you went from being unconfident and bashful to becoming brighter,

72
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,490
I think I liked that whole change in you.

73
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:03,670
I felt sorry for you from the beginning because you reminded me of my old self.

74
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,150
That's why I pushed you harder.

75
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:16,630
Anyway, I admit I fell for that ghost. She was charming, and her cutesy-ness.

76
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,960
If it weren't for my fortitude, gosh.

77
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:28,650
That ghost liked you, too. She really did.

78
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,720
That ghost has a good eye for men, too.

79
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,540
That scared me.

80
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,960
What?

81
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,270
No, a ghost passed by just now.

82
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,440
Wh-what? A ghost?

83
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:57,980
Wh-where? I mean, you could just see that by yourself, why do you have to tell me?

84
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,860
-You're trying to scare me, aren't you?
-No.

85
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,630
I don't get scared that easily.

86
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:08,040
-Ah, that scare...
-It's me.

87
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:14,490
I'm never going to let go of this hand now. And it's not because I'm scared.

88
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,790
Yes, Chef.

89
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:21,480
-There's nothing there.
-It was moving.

90
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,270
-Are you scared?
-No.

91
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,420
 I think Officer Choi is covering up for the culprit of his wife's hit and run.

92
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:39,690
 It's like he has some dealing with the criminal.

93
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,820
You're not going to come back to Sun?

94
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:55,260
How can I face them after leaving like that?

95
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,310
I get it.

96
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:03,100
Then stay here for now. I'll look into places. There should be something that provides lodging too.

97
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,630
-Go on in. And be careful not to wake up Ahjussi.
-Yes.

98
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:11,170
And make sure to turn on your cell phone. And let me know where you are at all times. Got it?

99
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,830
Yes, Chef. Go on in first.

100
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:17,140
I'm fine. I'm going to watch you going in first because it makes me uneasy.

101
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:22,830
Okay. Go safely.

102
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,830
 -Hey! 
-Oh my gosh! Huh?

103
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,290
Why are you so startled? Where did you go?

104
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:44,150
Oh, I had something to do out front.

105
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:48,990
I told you like that not to go out, but you just don't listen. Sit down.

106
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,730
I know.

107
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:54,560
-I found out something new.
-What?

108
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,000
Officer Choi might be connected to Eun Hee's hit-and-run accident.

109
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,950
What? So, what does that mean?

110
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:10,090
I heard it from Officer Han. He acquired something involving Officer Choi covering up for the culprit in the hit and run incident of his wife.

111
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:12,240
He must be acquired some evidence.

112
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,780
How did you hear that?

113
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,890
I went to the police station and there was a weak female officer. So I slightly possessed her.

114
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:22,890
But you're the body that I like the most so don't be too jealous.

115
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,870
It's probably best not to tell Chef yet, right?

116
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:33,560
Yeah, not yet. Once the evidence is confirmed. Then.

117
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,550
You're really worried about Chef, aren't you?

118
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:46,780
I'm worried about Eun Hee, too. How about you? Are you alright?

119
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,090
Because of Chef.

120
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,970
Hey, am I in any position to worry about love?

121
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:56,300
When there might be some huge secret about my death.

122
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:06,940
 Shin Soon Ae became a ghost and is lingering around here.

123
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:12,580
 It appears she left Na Bong Seon's body. Where are you, Shin Soon Ae?

124
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:20,470

125
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,750
-Officer Kang.
-What?

126
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,750
Did anyone happen to touch my drawer?

127
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:46,380
I don't know. Why? Is something missing?

128
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,880
Huh? No, it's okay. Go back to sleep.

129
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,470
Okay.

130
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,630
 Resume

131
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,760
You are my Sunshine.

132
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,550
Sunshine.

133
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:40,650
So is the sun, me?

134
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,910
 Na Bong Seon

135
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,850
-Yes, Chef.
-I was checking to see if you turned off your phone or not.

136
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,040
Ah, I just turned it on.

137
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:05,060
Yeah, make sure to keep it charged. And don't not answer because it's on silent mode.

138
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,640
I haven't 100% forgiven you.

139
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,930
So keep being sorry towards me and be good to me, okay?

140
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:15,280
Yes, Chef. I'll keep it in mind.

141
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,570
 Okay.

142
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,170
Ah, Chef.

143
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:21,580
What? Say something if you got my attention.

144
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:25,820
You rely on Officer Choi, don't you? And the same goes for Eun Hee?

145
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:29,600
Of course, we're family. Why?

146
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,950
Why are you so interested in a married man? What is it?

147
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,780
Are you possessed again? Are you not Na Bong Seon?

148
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,650
No. That's not it.

149
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:44,670
Is Stalker doing well? I didn't get to say bye.

150
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:50,640
You even change the subject in an uncultured way. You are Na Bong Seon.

151
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:59,430
If you're not going to talk, at least let me hear you breathe. I keep thinking we've been disconnected.

152
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,600
Ah, yes.

153
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:08,240
Yeah, now I can hear you. It puts me strangely at ease hearing you breathe.

154
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:19,410
Okay, that's enough. Now say something.

155
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:27,930
Na Bong. Are you sleep...sleeping?

156
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:33,900
Hello? Are you sleeping? She's sleeping. Oh, she's asleep. Goodness.

157
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:54,550
 Today's Special
Black bean pasta

158
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,770
Where's the apron?

159
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,300
I'll put it on once we're done.

160
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,000
Your face is bloated.

161
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,680
You know that today's special is black bean pasta, right?

162
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,300
-Yes, Chef.
-Take the beans that were soaked yesterday and boil them well so it doesn't taste fishy.

163
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,530
The noodles are going to contain green tea powder so make sure the dough is ready.

164
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:13,420
Yes, Chef.

165
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,060
Anyone has anything to say? Things like suggestions?

166
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,470
I do.

167
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,330
Min Soo.

168
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:23,020
Yes, thanks to the increasing popularity of our chef,

169
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:26,130
at this point where increase in revenue is hitting a new high on a daily basis,

170
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:29,480
overworked under a shortage in manpower-

171
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,840
Yes, being that we're overworked...

172
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,380
I think unfortunately we won't be able to produce high-quality food.

173
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,430
What is it that you want to say?

174
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:42,500
I think we need to hire another youngest. I called other kitchens already, Chef.

175
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,580
We can't keep that spot vacant. Try interviewing them.

176
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:50,980
Already? I think it's still early. Bong might come back.

177
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,280
No, when Bong buh-da Bong comes backs, they can work together.

178
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,580
That's right.

179
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:02,340
And Chef said before that we could use another assistant so they could work together.

180
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:06,580
Yeah. Interview some people and if there is anyone decent, hire them.

181
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:12,360
But hire one primarily based on attitude or on personality.

182
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,250
Cordon and all those things don't mean anything. Trust me, Chef.

183
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,740
Okay!

184
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,520
Bravo!

185
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:23,980
But isn't Chef really different than yesterday? He seems like he's in much better condition.

186
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,460
It's because we cheered him on yesterday.

187
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,620
Fire!

188
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:33,680
It's me, but when are those kitchen assistant interviews?

189
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:47,700
 Darn it. Where did it go in that short time?

190
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,720
Officer Kang, did you eat lunch?

191
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,590
Yes, yes, of course. What time is it?

192
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,430
Where is Officer Han? I haven't seen him since earlier.

193
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:04,320
What? I'm not sure. I just got in, too.

194
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:09,510
Ow, my constipation is severe.

195
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:13,040
Where did he go?

196
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:18,890
Hello, this is Officer Han of Yongsan police station.

197
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:22,850
I was wondering if the results of the evidence I submitted were out.

198
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,510
Oh, this afternoon?

199
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:32,880
Yes, contact me when the results come out. Work hard.

200
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:37,980
Why is it taking so long?

201
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,630
You scared me!

202
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,400
Officer Choi, give me some warning, you scared me.

203
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,820
What warning? Should I meow like a cat?

204
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:55,040
Hey, there's no need for that. But what is it? What?

205
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,540
This is the break area. I came to take a break.

206
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:01,840
Ah, break area. Go ahead. Meow.

207
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,910
Go in.

208
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,450
-Your age.
-I'm 24.

209
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:35,750
That's good, that's good, that's good. A boyfriend?

210
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,520
I don't have one.

211
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,170
She doesn't have one.

212
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:45,620
I don't have a boyfriend, but I got married a little early. So I have a husband and a year old son.

213
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,590
Stay safe.

214
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:54,270
You must eat a lot...so, ask us some questions.

215
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:58,490
What time do we eat lunch and dinner?

216
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,120
There isn't any set time. We eat when the Chef tells us to.

217
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:08,640
Then, the customers...

218
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,020
We can't. We can't eat the customers' leftovers.

219
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,260
No, we can't. The conditions don't match up. Stay safe.

220
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,000
You can go back.

221
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,050
Next!

222
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,880
 I'm getting sick of this.

223
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:28,360
You pass!

224
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,400
Come on in.

225
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,500
It's nice to meet you. I'm Jo Hye Jin.

226
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,490
Hello!

227
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:48,400
You're much better looking than seeing you on TV. Wow!

228
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,790
That's a given. Let's work hard. And learn a lot.

229
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:56,110
-Yes, Oppa.
-It's not Oppa. It's Chef. Chef.

230
00:19:56,110 --> 00:20:00,320
Since it's her first time working in a kitchen, she's very new.

231
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,520
You all know we're fully reserved for dinner tonight. So, let's stay focused. Let's start.

232
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,320
Yes, Chef.

233
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,020
Oh, he has so much charisma. You're so cool!

234
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,470
Dear..I mean, not dear, but, you know. You...

235
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:15,960
Ia your shirt on too tight? It looks very cramped.

236
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,770
It is isn't? The person who wore this before must have been very lacking, right? Do you have something else?

237
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:22,080
We'll have to order a new one. Just wear that until then.

238
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,960
These trousers are also tight. Should I cut it into shorts?

239
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,620
Cut it? Cut it? You're really sharp, aren't you?

240
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,570
What should I start with?

241
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:34,070
Before that, I think we need time to get to know each other. Do you know my name?

242
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,200
I'm the Sous Chef, I'm Heo Min Soo.

243
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,240
I'm Dong Cheol.

244
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,550
You have to work. Now, wait a minute.

245
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:44,210
When did Jo Hye Jin start to be so pretty?

246
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:52,160
Do you want to go get some escargots over there?

247
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,670
Yes!

248
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:56,090
-Yes!
-Cook the bacon so it's crispy.

249
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:58,140
Yes, Chef.

250
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:06,740
Excuse me, these are a little gross. Could you  move them for me?

251
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,780
Move aside. Wash the frying pan.

252
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:31,770
Yeah? I'm washing a frying pan.

253
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:36,630
Huh? Oh no!

254
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:41,620
How could you use a cell phone while working?

255
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,010
 Chef!

256
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,030
 I'll have a one on one consultation regarding this issue, Chef.

257
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,500
 What are you doing?

258
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:51,200
What do you think you're doing?

259
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,440
 I can't believe it.

260
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,850
Why did you come here? Is cooking a joke?

261
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:00,100
You don't even have an understanding of food ingredients, or the basic etiquette and you want to cook -

262
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:05,380
You know, I came to learn because I don't know. Why else would anyone do grunt work?

263
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,410
I guess we made a mistake.

264
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:12,160
-Leave.
-What?

265
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,630
I said to leave. We aren't a good fit.

266
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:17,880
If you don't leave on the count of three, I'll start cursing. One, two...

267
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,200
First, should we go change clothes?

268
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,630
That crazy...

269
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:31,600
Hey, move, move. I'm so annoyed.

270
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,510
Fire me?

271
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,840
 What did I do?

272
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,060
Wow, she's attractive.

273
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,780
You sure picked a great youngest through the interviews.

274
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:50,760
Combination of her refinement and intellect, I didn't think there would be any problem with her personality.

275
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,850
-But not being able to touch snails was a small flaw...
-I should just....

276
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,860
Don't conduct any more interviews. I'll hire someone. Understand?

277
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:15,890
Hey, Na Bong. Can't you come back here?

278
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:21,530
It's too hard to hire a youngest and it's affecting the business. How are you going to take responsibility for this?

279
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:25,350
 Ah, I'm sorry about that, but

280
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:28,490
If you're sorry, then think about it again.

281
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:33,550
What's the big deal if you're embarrassed in front of the boys.

282
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:37,650
I'm getting another call, I'll call you back. Don't turn off your phone.

283
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:44,240
Goodness, Officer Han, what's up?

284
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,380
 Chef Kang, I need to see you. It's urgent.

285
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,860
What? For what reason?

286
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:54,720
 Let's talk when we meet. It's regarding Eun Hee's hit-and-run.

287
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:00,220
 Don't ever tell Officer Choi that you're meeting me. Ever.

288
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:06,080
Yes, yes. Then, where should we meet?

289
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:30,500
 The fingerprints found on the piece of the hard disk is 99.99% match with Officer Choi's fingerprint.

290
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,870
You jerk!

291
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:37,130
Officer Han, where are you?

292
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:44,350
Yes, Officer Choi. I'm out, why?

293
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:50,370
 Ah, you are? Because it seems you can't see me. I see.

294
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,610
I scared you, didn't I?

295
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:06,820
I was right next to you.

296
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,020
What brings you here?

297
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:14,380
Why? Can't I come if I have something to do in this area?

298
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:17,860
There's no reason you can't.

299
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:23,020
But,

300
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,600
what is this?

301
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,670
Is it interesting?

302
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,680
 Han Jin Goo

303
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:54,790
Officer Kang!

304
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,310
Brother-in-law.

305
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,630
You came?

306
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:00,630
What happened? How did this come about?

307
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:06,740
I don't know either. What happened.

308
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:13,070
They said it was accident due to a sudden acceleration, but it makes no sense including the location where he was found.

309
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,190
No, earlier...

310
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:21,670
 It's about Eun Hee's hit-and-run. Don't ever tell Officer Choi that you're meeting me. Ever.

311
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:23,230
What?

312
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:32,650
Ah, nothing. I'm just so shocked.

313
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,600
You should pay your respects.

314
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,840
Oh, oh.

315
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:44,290
Once you're done, leave without me. I have to speak to the hospital about the funeral process.

316
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:47,400
His sister is beside herself.

317
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,200
Oh, okay.

318
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,230
This girl. My mind is unsettled so I wanted to meet next time.

319
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:06,940
She makes me meet her and she doesn't come.

320
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:10,440
Dearie, I'm so sorry I'm late.

321
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,480
 I ordered the red bean shaved ice. You take care of the tab later.

322
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:19,530
The shaved ice isn't the problem. My hands are shaking so much I can't drive.

323
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:22,050
I barely got here after calling a taxi.

324
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:24,410
What is it now? Did you drink in the day again?

325
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:28,620
That's not it. There's this Officer Han,

326
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,100
he's my son-in-law's partner.

327
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,380
He died in an accident.

328
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:38,090
He's an officer who helped a lot after Eun Hee's accident.

329
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:42,620
He died? Your son-in-law's partner?

330
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:46,660
They say people can die at any moment, but this is so terrible, you know?

331
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:50,400
Dearie, I want to live doing a lot of good deeds.

332
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,430
That way I can go to heaven. No,

333
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:57,600
with all the good intention plotting, will I end up in hell?

334
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,350
I don't know. It's too hard.

335
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,220
This place cooked their red beans really well.

336
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,520
Is it Busan red beans?

337
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:54,460
What happened? Officer Han, too?

338
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,840
I think so.

339
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,710
I'm almost sure it's Officer Choi's doing.

340
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:03,960
I can't believe it. It's too awful.

341
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,420
I'm getting goosebumps.

342
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:11,530
The Officer Choi that I liked was kind and gentle.

343
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:14,220
Although sometimes he looked sad behind that smile.

344
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:18,680
But, shouldn't we tell Chef now?

345
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,810
We probably should.

346
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:23,140
There are some things that Chef has to find out for us.

347
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,870
Hmm?

348
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:31,290
How did the accident occur? I heard it was sudden acceleration, is that correct?

349
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:33,450
I think so.

350
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:39,190
It makes no sense. He was just discharged not long ago.

351
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:45,840
Officer Han was a good person so I'm sure he went to a good place. Let's believe that.

352
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,030
But still.

353
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:53,280
-I'm so anxious. For some reason I think something will happen to Seong Jae
-Eun Hee.

354
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:01,180
You have me, why are you so anxious?

355
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,660
You're strong.

356
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:06,340
I'm not. I just act like I am.

357
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:09,660
-For you and for mom and for him.
-I know.

358
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:15,140
You have to be strong to be able to act strong. I believe in you.

359
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,980
Wait a moment.

360
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,400
Yeah.

361
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,440
 It's me, Chef. I think I have to see you briefly.

362
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,480
Where are you?

363
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,240
-Chef.
-You're here?

364
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,310
Yes, we came together.

365
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,670
Who?

366
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:49,100
The ghost.

367
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:55,140
You really came together?

368
00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:00,010
Yes. She said she has something to tell you.

369
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:06,600
Okay, then let's sit first.

370
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,220
Unni.

371
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:11,280
-Sit down.
-Yes.

372
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,920
Please sit down.

373
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,100
-Ah, over here.
-Please sit, Ghostess.

374
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,770
Please speak.

375
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:45,850
You tell him first.

376
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:53,210
Oh. You see, Eun Hee's hit-and-run case.

377
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:56,930
She said it might be connected to Officer Choi.

378
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:01,700
What are you saying? Why would Brother-in-law be related to Eun Hee's case?

379
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:05,940
And Officer Han's accident might also not be an accident.

380
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,800
Officer Choi was trying to cover up for culprit of Eun Hee's accident,

381
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:13,350
and Officer Han discovered that and was investigating it.

382
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:15,540
And while doing that...

383
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:21,460
 It's about Eun Hee's hit-and-run case. But you can't ever tell Officer Choi that you're meeting me.

384
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,540
 Ever.

385
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:32,320
That's unbelievable. How?

386
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,690
And on top of that, this Unni thinks that her death is also connected to Officer Choi.

387
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:42,910
Wa..wa..wait. Let me think about this.

388
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:47,510
What is... Brother-in-law... why?

389
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:51,740
We have to find that out starting now. That's why I'm saying,

390
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,060
there's something Chef has to do for us.

391
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,200
What is it?

392
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,860
The diary.

393
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:00,330
My diary that was in Officer Choi's desk drawer is missing.

394
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:04,590
I think there's something in there he's trying to hide. We have to get it back.

395
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:06,960
A diary?

396
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:12,650
She said she has to get her diary back. There's an important piece of evidence in it.

397
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:15,120
Diary? What diary?

398
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,940
Chef, are you alright?

399
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,260
No, I'm not okay.

400
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:33,660
What I just heard, I really don't want to believe it. But...

401
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:41,950
Actually, I got a call from Officer Han just before he died. To meet without my brother-in-law knowing.

402
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:49,790
Eun Hee. He said it was related to Eun Hee's hit-and-run case.

403
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:55,010
I have to organize my thoughts.

404
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,310
I want to take you home, but I'm sorry.

405
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:59,790
Oh, not at all.

406
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:02,720
Sorry.

407
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,040
Unbelievable.

408
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:14,960
What kind of person Brother-in-law has been to Eun Hee.

409
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:20,230
 No!

410
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:26,030
 Leave me alone, please. Leave me to die!

411
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:40,360
 Dying because you want to die, or living because you want to live.

412
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,000
 Humans don't have that authority.

413
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:50,490
 Live even though you want to die. Since you didn't die, then live.

414
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:58,730
 Eun Hee! Kang Eun Hee!

415
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:02,080
 Hey! You...

416
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:11,430
 It's alright. It's alright.

417
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,750
 What is it?

418
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:19,870
 Oppa, we decided to get married.

419
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:21,480
 I'm shocked.

420
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,240
 He finally proposed to me. Look at this.

421
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:29,560
 Really, Officer Choi?

422
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:36,210
 Yes. There's nothing I can do if you don't  approve though.

423
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:38,840
 Why wouldn't I approve?

424
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:43,970
 Eun Hee is so happy about it. Thank you, Officer Choi.

425
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:48,290
 I'm more thankful. For giving such a beauty to me.

426
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,910
 Are you happy?

427
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,170
 My goodness.

428
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:07,790
Thank you for coming.

429
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:10,040
This is the way out.

430
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:26,000
Hyungnim! You came back again?

431
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:28,870
Oh, I just

432
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:34,250
had a drink alone because my mind was unsettled.

433
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,840
And without realizing it, I came here.

434
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:42,050
Ah, I see.

435
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:48,800
I think I'll have to spend the night here. I have to stand in for the bereaved.

436
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,780
You're working so hard.

437
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,540
Bye, Hyungnim.

438
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,760
Brother-in-law.

439
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,840
Yes?

440
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:11,730
You know I rely on you a lot, don't you? Eun Hee does, too.

441
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,650
Of course. I rely on you a lot, too.

442
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:20,970
You're my only family.

443
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,400
Then that's a good thing.

444
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,430
Then go inside. I'll get going.

445
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:32,040
Bye.

446
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:00,360
Chef.

447
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,320
Na Bong Seon.

448
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:07,080
That's a relief. I thought I might have to wait all night.

449
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:12,470
What is this? You were here outside this whole time?

450
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:17,820
I was worried. I wanted to see you leave safely before I left.

451
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:21,110
It might be too hard for you if you were too drunk.

452
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:23,520
If I were drunk, were you going to carry me on your back?

453
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,750
Yes.

454
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:28,170
You're the size of a bean though.

455
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:30,300
It would be better if Stalker carried me on his back.

456
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:34,890
I think I'd be better than Stalker.

457
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:39,170
Are you happy to see me? I'm happy to see you, too.

458
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:46,310
Chef, are you okay? Should I make you some honey tea?

459
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:51,490
I'm fine. I had a drink because I wanted to get drunk, but I'm still sober.

460
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,100
You're having a hard time, aren't you, Chef?

461
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:59,970
Of course, I'm having a hard time. For several days, because of a bean-sized girl,

462
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:07,210
I was stressed. But I thought I had turned a corner and now this comes up. I can't get my mind straight.

463
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:11,810
It must be harder than I can't ever imagine.

464
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:16,320
He's someone who has been your family for three years.

465
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:22,450
I know how precious Eun Hee is to you.

466
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:32,890
Be strong, Chef. Inner peace.

467
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:36,360
-What? 
-Inner peace.

468
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:40,670
Even in suffering, sense of peace that envelops you inside.

469
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:49,660
Inner peace.

470
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,270
This comes out in Kung Fu Panda.

471
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:54,030
What is that?

472
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:58,920
Since I was young, I faced many things that were so difficult to handle.

473
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:03,460
Whenever that would happen, I would close my eyes,

474
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:09,760
"Inner peace" if I would shout it, my mind would feel more comfortable.

475
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,430
You have this core strength, if you look closely.

476
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:22,900
In any case, this too shall pass, Chef.

477
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:26,300
Good things or sad things.

478
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:30,710
You're right. Everything will pass, I suppose.

479
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:36,590
But still, it's such a relief to have you by my side in times like this.

480
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,370
Should I give you a hug, Chef?

481
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:46,280
Look at you! This character has changed ever so slightly.

482
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:50,180
Are you not Na Bong Seon? Are you possessed by that ghost again?

483
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:54,080
No, I'm not. It's me, Na Bong Seon.

484
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:05,870
It's okay, Chef.

485
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:18,880
 She said she has to get her diary back.

486
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,410
 There's an important piece of evidence in it.

487
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,130
Oppa, what are you doing here at this hour?

488
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:27,560
Did you exercise?

489
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:31,360
Yeah, I couldn't sleep. Brother-in-law isn't back yet, is he?

490
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:35,000
I think he's going to work straight from the hospital.

491
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,210
What about Mom?

492
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:40,060
Oh? Seon Woo, what brings you here, Son?

493
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:44,160
Aren't you showing yourself to me too often lately? You're losing your mystery.

494
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,680
-Mom, I'm so hungry. Make me some toast.
-You're hungry?

495
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:50,210
Yeah, together with Eun Hee. Eun Hee, coach Mom before she makes charcoal.

496
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:53,380
 I got it, I got it. I'll do it right today.

497
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,500
Don't worry.

498
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,290
 But do we have any sandwich bread?

499
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:01,180
 Yes, we do, Mother.

500
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:06,710
Oh, you're here? I thought you would go straight to work.

501
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:10,510
Ah, I was going to change my clothes.

502
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:13,210
Are you alright?

503
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:16,600
Yeah, I'm a little better. Yesterday was such a shock.

504
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:20,300
Can you go and open the jam jar? Mom is struggling with it by herself.

505
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,310
Oh, okay.

506
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:24,420
Let's go.

507
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:30,470
Hyungnim! When did you get here?

508
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:33,750
Oh, a little while ago. I had something to get in my room.

509
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:37,180
You must be really tired from staying up all night. Wash up.

510
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,980
Yes, I feel a bit grimy.

511
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:41,260
Yeah, then wash up. I'm going.

512
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:44,500
You're leaving? Why? I thought you were eating breakfast.

513
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:47,540
I'll eat next time. I just remembered some groceries I have to get this morning.

514
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:50,400
Then what about the toast? Seon Woo!

515
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,880
That rotten kid is kidding me.

516
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,860
Why? Did Oppa leave?

517
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,130
He left!

518
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:02,410
Hey, the bread is burning. The bread is burning.

519
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:13,150
I can do this by myself. You should just rest.

520
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:18,460
No, I'm really much better because of you.

521
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:23,490
I shouldn't keep being a nuisance to you. But I have some things I still need to resolve.

522
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:30,140
Not at all. Lately, everything seems unsettled and my mind is not at ease, but

523
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:35,190
you being here is a big comfort and I'm not bored or lonely.

524
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:37,680
And you're like my daughter too.

525
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,990
Think of me as a daughter.

526
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:43,380
My parents died when I was young.

527
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:46,660
So I don't have any memories of my father.

528
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:51,210
I wish I had a father like you.

529
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:56,890
My goodness. Thank you. That's the first nice thing I've heard in a long time.

530
00:45:57,810 --> 00:46:02,900
But, why did your daughter...

531
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:06,280
Seeing the picture, she looked so bright.

532
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:10,660
She doesn't seem like someone who would do that to herself.

533
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,020
I know.

534
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:19,020
I still can't understand that myself.

535
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:25,370
I think she must have had something that was difficult in her own way.

536
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,450
If I had only answered the phone that day.

537
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:34,540
Phone?

538
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:36,690
On the night she died,

539
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:40,750
she had called but I couldn't answer because my battery had died.

540
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:43,910
I checked the voicemail later.

541
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:48,350
There were only strange noises without any talking.

542
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,910
And after that there was a text.

543
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:55,200
Saying she was sorry for going first.

544
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,280
I've had such deep regret over not answering the phone.

545
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:02,710
I still have that message and can't delete it.

546
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:05,110
And I never turn off my phone.

547
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:06,800
 Mr. Shin, come see me for a second.

548
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,640
Yes, okay! Just a minute.

549
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,610
Yes, Chef.

550
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,610
For the young man who doesn't believe in ghosts.

551
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:28,170
Here's a drink for you. And for the young lady who sees ghosts, too.

552
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:31,360
-Yes, thank you.
-Thank you.

553
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:35,430
This is the first time coming to a place like this, isn't it? Sorry it's so shabby.

554
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:38,190
Not at all. It's interesting.

555
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:44,420
But all those things inside there aren't real, are they?

556
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:47,290
You must be a ghost.

557
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:48,700
Chef.

558
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,710
Ah, also, please keep it a secret from my mom that I came here.

559
00:47:56,710 --> 00:48:00,240
I know. I have at least that much sense.

560
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,350
And I'm in a position that I can't say anything, too.

561
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:06,030
I'd like to see the diary first.

562
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:10,730
Ah, Chef. She wants to see the diary first.

563
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:27,030
And also, I brought this.

564
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:28,580
My father's cell phone?

565
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:32,820
Yeah, the day you died. He said you left a voicemail.

566
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:35,760
I thought it might give a clue.

567
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,580
Don't just talk between the two of you. Relay it to me, too.

568
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:43,060
So troublesome, whose lifetime will it take to relay everything?

569
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:46,520
Ghost, come on.

570
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:50,820
-What? 
-Possess my body, I'm saying.

571
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:53,800
I've never been inside someone like you.

572
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:58,490
Complains even when it's given to you. Is this a time to be picky?

573
00:48:58,490 --> 00:49:01,750
I get it. I'll give it a try.

574
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:22,900
Let's talk together now, Chef.

575
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:36,560
What evidence would be here?

576
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:41,510
Wait a second. On the last page.

577
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:44,860
2368

578
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:46,860
2368?

579
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,040
What is it? Is it a passcode?

580
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:53,200
No. It's a number I don't remember.

581
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:59,520
Anyway, since it's the last note I made, there's a high possibility it's a note that was made right before I died.

582
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,760
Then listen to this, too.

583
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:10,810
The voicemail you left.

584
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,060
I sent this to my father?

585
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:23,450
Yeah. You left this on August 25 at 9:10pm.

586
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:28,350
And that night at 11:55, he said you sent a farewell text saying you were sorry.

587
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:31,400
This sounds like the buttons of a cell phone.

588
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,240
Sounds of the buttons?

589
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:36,680
I think I've seen it on TV. They use these clues to catch criminals, too.

590
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:39,790
The tones are different for each cell phone button.

591
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:43,210
Oh, then, these button sounds

592
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:47,910
might be trying to give us a number.

593
00:50:57,660 --> 00:51:01,840
535 2368

594
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:08,270
535 2368. These two numbers have to be connected somehow.

595
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:09,810
Could it be a phone number?

596
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:12,540
535 2368

597
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,410
I think it's for Gangnam.

598
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:17,810
Gangnam?

599
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:21,200
 The number you dialed does not exist.

600
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,420
It's a number that doesn't exist.

601
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:28,660
Darn it. Then what is it? Trying to give a seven digit number.

602
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:32,650
Oh, why can't I remember when It's something I must have left behind.

603
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:34,650
Don't try too hard.

604
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:42,140
It's not like you're not remembering it on purpose.

605
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:48,970
Could it be, this 5, might not be a number, but spelled out,

606
00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:52,480
53 Oh 2368

607
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,750
It could be a car's license plate number.

608
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:56,440
Yeah, that's right!

609
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:59,000
-It could be that!
-Na Bong Seon!

610
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:07,330
Then I'll possess her and look into the license plate number.

611
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:09,930
Since it'll be difficult for regular people.

612
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:15,090
If the owner of that car is my brother-in-law,

613
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:17,410
what's going to happen?

614
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:22,470
Won't they have to do a formal investigation?

615
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:27,910
If there's a connection to Eun Hee's hit-and-run accident and that Unni's death.

616
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:33,250
I really hope it isn't the case. It will really complicate matters.

617
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:35,980
I wish it weren't the case, too.

618
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:44,090
I'm so uneasy, I wish you would go with me. If you don't want to stay in the storage room, you can stay in my room with me.

619
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:47,110
I should still give my proper greetings to Ahjussi.

620
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,280
I understand. Then call me.

621
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:56,340
Okay. Chef, bye then.

622
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:16,630
Oh, Seon Woo.

623
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:18,880
Oh, So Hyeong. What's up?

624
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,170
I came to eat and wanted to see you before I left.

625
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:26,170
I heard everything from Eun Hee. So much has been going on.

626
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:28,740
I'll let the two of you talk.

627
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:35,440
Still, it's a relief. It must be really hard on you.

628
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:38,870
Because of the pilot for the Chuseok special, it looks like our recording will be pushed back a week.

629
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:41,800
We can start recording from next week.

630
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:48,640
So Hyeong, I think I have to pull out of Chef versus Chef.

631
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,560
Why? Because of Bong Seon?

632
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:54,020
Is it serious? You still can't reach her?

633
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:59,400
That's not it. I'll tell you later when things get settled down.

634
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:03,020
I'm sorry things turned out like this. Please understand.

635
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:08,240
Okay. You wouldn't do that for no reason.

636
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:13,470
Well, I'll write a formal letter of apology. Or turn in a resignation.

637
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:16,860
Thanks.

638
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:26,340
Okay.

639
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:30,340
 Seoul Yongsan Police Station

640
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:33,810
 I'm sorry. I'm sure you're more sad than I am.

641
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:36,890
 I can't help these tears from coming.

642
00:54:36,890 --> 00:54:41,040
 How could this happen?

643
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:45,120
Officer Han was such a good person.

644
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:49,590
He should have been more careful!

645
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:53,140
Officer Han!

646
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:56,370
Why is she sticking to him like a wad of gum?

647
00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:59,180
Get away, get away. Come out, please.

648
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:03,010
I'm sorry!

649
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:09,270
Officer Han.

650
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:17,880
Okay.

651
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:24,930
Oh, these tears.

652
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:28,460
He'll think it's strange if I go in now.

653
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:30,660
Wait a second.

654
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:36,920
Okay.

655
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:44,610
Are you calmed down now?

656
00:55:56,730 --> 00:56:00,120
 Now what is this password?

657
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:18,650
 1986 July 17. 0717?

658
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:20,470
 It's not it.

659
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:29,240
 What is it? Darn it.

660
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:32,570
 I'm going to go crazy. What is it?

661
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:34,410
Sheesh.

662
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:51,270
 Automobile License Registration

663
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:02,290
Na Bong Seon, I found out.

664
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:06,110
53 Oh 2368. It was a car license plate number.

665
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:07,840
Officer Choi's car.

666
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:09,970
 R-really?

667
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:15,700
Right before I died, I think I wanted to note Officer Choi's license number using my diary and cell phone.

668
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:20,560
Tell Chef for now, Na Bong Seon. I'll be there later.

669
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:26,180
 I didn't know Officer Kang had so much interest in me.

670
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,670
 Why my car?

671
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:41,410
What are you so curious about?

672
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:45,090
N-n-nothing. Goodbye.

673
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:52,910
You. Who in the world are you?

674
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:51,670
Now you finally appear. Shin Soon Ae.

675
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:05,600
