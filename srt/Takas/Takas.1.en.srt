1
00:00:22,118 --> 00:00:25,169
Here! I made this for you.

2
00:00:25,463 --> 00:00:27,506
I stayed up all night to make this.

3
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:30,927
Promise me you'll keep this.

4
00:00:30,952 --> 00:00:32,536
Yours is a butterfly...

5
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,599
mine is an elephant.

6
00:00:34,624 --> 00:00:38,333
Thank you, Lexi.
You’re the best.

7
00:00:38,415 --> 00:00:40,709
That’s why you’re my only best friend.

8
00:00:41,172 --> 00:00:42,966
I really should be the only one.

9
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:44,132
For sure!

10
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,567
Angel, come here! Angel!

11
00:01:02,643 --> 00:01:06,305
Angel, you're such a brat!
Where are you?

12
00:01:35,908 --> 00:01:39,928
Let's hurry up,
Lexi is waiting for...

13
00:01:42,164 --> 00:01:45,292
Don't be stubborn,
I'm not done yet.

14
00:02:04,145 --> 00:02:05,813
I’m close!

15
00:02:20,452 --> 00:02:21,452
Come on.

16
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:28,610
My bestie! Hi!!

17
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,588
Did you wait long?

18
00:02:30,882 --> 00:02:33,760
We agreed to meet at 5 PM, right?
What took you so long?

19
00:02:33,785 --> 00:02:35,907
And why do you look like that?

20
00:02:36,064 --> 00:02:37,649
Aren't we going to church?

21
00:02:38,352 --> 00:02:40,688
Be grateful I agreed that
you'll come with us.

22
00:02:41,265 --> 00:02:43,266
I'm so sorry, Lexi!

23
00:02:43,559 --> 00:02:45,759
I forgot that it's our monthsary today.

24
00:02:46,078 --> 00:02:48,247
And we'll celebrate in town, later.

25
00:02:48,272 --> 00:02:50,191
Come on, get in the car.
Let's go.

26
00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:52,151
You should have told me.

27
00:02:52,556 --> 00:02:55,001
You know what,
I’ll just go home.

28
00:02:55,274 --> 00:02:57,258
Hey, hold on!

29
00:02:57,656 --> 00:02:59,491
Let's go! Don’t force her
if she doesn’t want to.

30
00:02:59,516 --> 00:03:01,680
You go ahead, it's okay.
I’ll follow.

31
00:03:02,595 --> 00:03:04,665
Lexi, please!

32
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,930
We’ll take you back home too.

33
00:03:07,266 --> 00:03:08,642
And there are lots of boys there.

34
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:10,516
You never know,
you might meet someone.

35
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,418
I’m not interested in those things.

36
00:03:13,877 --> 00:03:15,110
Lexi...

37
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,699
Are you really going
to say no to me?

38
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:24,078
Please, join us!

39
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:26,189
Okay, fine, Let's go.

40
00:03:26,255 --> 00:03:29,300
Thank you! I'll make it up to you
next time! Promise!

41
00:03:29,396 --> 00:03:30,606
Let's go!

42
00:03:35,425 --> 00:03:36,820
Are you always like that?

43
00:03:37,261 --> 00:03:38,614
Quiet?

44
00:03:39,195 --> 00:03:41,136
I have nothing to say.

45
00:03:41,456 --> 00:03:43,827
My friend's niece is like that too.

46
00:03:44,053 --> 00:03:45,471
She doesn't talk.

47
00:03:45,496 --> 00:03:48,425
Later we found out
that she's autistic.

48
00:03:48,617 --> 00:03:49,850
Eric!

49
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,175
Are we still far from the bar?

50
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,673
You know, I’m wondering about you.

51
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:56,126
You and Angel grew up together...

52
00:03:56,542 --> 00:03:59,698
but you’re so different
from each other.

53
00:03:59,982 --> 00:04:02,151
You’re more prude than my mom.

54
00:04:02,925 --> 00:04:04,206
Eric, stop it!

55
00:04:04,784 --> 00:04:06,792
Lexi is like that because...

56
00:04:07,142 --> 00:04:09,941
she has had
no boyfriend since birth.

57
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,814
That's why!

58
00:04:12,815 --> 00:04:14,066
Perfect timing, then!

59
00:04:14,527 --> 00:04:16,527
We have a worker
that's coming later.

60
00:04:17,433 --> 00:04:21,365
I'm sure, you'll be noisy too,
once you've tasted...

61
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,390
What?

62
00:04:27,808 --> 00:04:28,822
Hey!

63
00:04:28,847 --> 00:04:30,214
That's just a joke, okay?

64
00:04:30,457 --> 00:04:32,097
But maybe he's right!

65
00:05:06,831 --> 00:05:09,145
- The usual.
- Okay, sir.

66
00:05:24,042 --> 00:05:25,464
Cheers!

67
00:05:34,495 --> 00:05:35,901
You drink?

68
00:05:36,357 --> 00:05:38,011
I'm not that conservative.

69
00:05:39,012 --> 00:05:40,339
Come on, let’s dance!

70
00:05:41,397 --> 00:05:43,105
Lexi, join us.

71
00:05:43,369 --> 00:05:44,735
Let her be.

72
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,488
She'll follow if she wants.
She has feet, right?

73
00:06:40,163 --> 00:06:41,922
Come on, let’s get out of here.

74
00:06:41,947 --> 00:06:44,694
Later, Lexi is still here.

75
00:06:46,051 --> 00:06:48,345
You know I could
replace you easily, right?

76
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:11,184
Where are we going?

77
00:07:12,544 --> 00:07:14,037
Just follow me.

78
00:07:19,626 --> 00:07:23,288
- Hey! What's that?
- Energy booster.

79
00:07:53,345 --> 00:07:55,763
- Eric, what's that?
- Nothing.

80
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,672
- Hey!
- Just do what I say.

81
00:07:59,808 --> 00:08:02,753
- They say it's more erotic this way.
- What's this?

82
00:08:02,851 --> 00:08:03,851
Leave it to me.

83
00:08:04,549 --> 00:08:06,058
Hey, Eric!

84
00:08:08,471 --> 00:08:09,471
Eric!

85
00:08:10,675 --> 00:08:12,050
What's that?

86
00:08:12,484 --> 00:08:15,324
Hey! Eric, I don't like this!

87
00:08:15,605 --> 00:08:16,750
Eric!

88
00:08:16,962 --> 00:08:18,168
This will be fun.

89
00:08:19,182 --> 00:08:20,182
Eric!

90
00:08:21,152 --> 00:08:22,443
Eric!

91
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,378
Eric! Take this off!

92
00:08:26,878 --> 00:08:28,491
- Take this off!
- Do you like it?

93
00:08:30,231 --> 00:08:31,253
Eric!

94
00:08:32,164 --> 00:08:33,164
Shit!

95
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:36,138
I told you I don’t like these things!

96
00:08:36,163 --> 00:08:37,163
Okay, fine!

97
00:08:37,188 --> 00:08:38,188
Sorry!

98
00:08:38,855 --> 00:08:40,362
I got carried away.

99
00:09:03,591 --> 00:09:06,559
Hey, Eric! Damn it!

100
00:09:06,787 --> 00:09:08,294
Stop it!

101
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:11,903
I don’t want to anymore.
Let’s stop this.

102
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:13,771
I'm leaving!

103
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,714
You're acting tough, huh?!

104
00:09:37,402 --> 00:09:39,904
- You're not obeying me anymore!
- Eric!

105
00:10:00,704 --> 00:10:03,583
Where are you going? Come here!

106
00:10:20,893 --> 00:10:22,130
Lexi!

107
00:10:22,702 --> 00:10:24,044
Lexi!

108
00:10:24,243 --> 00:10:25,872
Screw you!

109
00:10:37,881 --> 00:10:39,443
What are we going to do?

110
00:10:39,468 --> 00:10:41,348
- Should we bring him to the hospital?
- No!

111
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,741
No! No!

112
00:10:43,804 --> 00:10:44,927
We can't!

113
00:11:04,409 --> 00:11:08,664
A man was found dead at the parking lot
of a bar in Quezon City.

114
00:11:08,689 --> 00:11:14,035
It’s suspected that he was hit on the head
with a metal pipe until he died.

115
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,623
There are no CCTVs in the area.

116
00:11:16,648 --> 00:11:19,658
The police are investigating
the possible motives

117
00:11:19,683 --> 00:11:23,982
behind the killing of the son
of former Congressman Sevillo.

118
00:11:30,711 --> 00:11:31,711
Here's my payment.

119
00:11:38,121 --> 00:11:39,121
Thank you.

120
00:11:40,108 --> 00:11:41,501
Miss, you know what?

121
00:11:41,526 --> 00:11:42,526
Just a tip.

122
00:11:42,763 --> 00:11:45,701
You might get more customers
if you smile often.

123
00:11:47,497 --> 00:11:49,047
What are you talking about?

124
00:11:52,037 --> 00:11:53,724
Just do what you want.

125
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,602
I can’t do that to you.

126
00:11:55,627 --> 00:11:57,591
Come on. Touch me.

127
00:11:57,669 --> 00:11:59,587
- Really?
- Yes!

128
00:14:40,358 --> 00:14:42,777
I only got to buy sautéed fish.

129
00:14:42,802 --> 00:14:45,267
They were already out of Bopis.

130
00:14:46,797 --> 00:14:48,439
Where have you been?

131
00:14:49,233 --> 00:14:51,181
I've been waiting for you!

132
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:57,204
I’m telling you,
we’re strangers here.

133
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:59,502
Don’t trust just anyone.

134
00:14:59,749 --> 00:15:02,919
There you go again,
being judgmental.

135
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:07,000
Lemuel hasn’t done
anything wrong to me. Relax.

136
00:15:09,758 --> 00:15:11,431
So, you know each other now?

137
00:15:12,854 --> 00:15:14,070
Hey, Angel!

138
00:15:14,492 --> 00:15:16,432
We've only been here
for months.

139
00:15:16,858 --> 00:15:18,360
- Does he know...
- Whatever!

140
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,133
He's different!
And besides...

141
00:15:21,217 --> 00:15:24,862
he’s still just courting me.
I haven’t answered him.

142
00:15:24,909 --> 00:15:26,009
Angel...

143
00:15:26,034 --> 00:15:27,785
I just don’t want you
to get into trouble.

144
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,220
I wouldn’t be able to take it.

145
00:15:29,716 --> 00:15:32,562
What if you experience
the same thing again?

146
00:15:33,134 --> 00:15:34,915
And I’m not there with you?

147
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,235
What's wrong with you?

148
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:38,022
I’ll be more careful, okay?

149
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,437
And besides...

150
00:15:40,254 --> 00:15:43,103
I wouldn’t know
what to do without you.

151
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,306
So, we’re okay now.

152
00:15:46,331 --> 00:15:48,118
Don’t be grumpy anymore.

153
00:15:48,143 --> 00:15:49,431
Okay, fine!

154
00:15:50,834 --> 00:15:52,078
You're too much!

155
00:15:52,524 --> 00:15:54,942
Come on, let's go eat.

156
00:15:54,967 --> 00:15:55,967
Come here.

157
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:02,376
Hey! We earned a lot!

158
00:16:02,401 --> 00:16:03,696
What did I tell you?

159
00:16:03,721 --> 00:16:08,634
Just a bit of hustle and charm,
we were able to sell everything!

160
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:11,467
You’re really good at that.

161
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,767
Even you got swept up.

162
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,268
I’ll help you close your stall.

163
00:16:19,351 --> 00:16:22,204
No need, we can manage.
Thank you.

164
00:16:22,236 --> 00:16:23,587
Lemuel, by the way.

165
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:34,146
This is Lexi, my best friend.

166
00:16:34,454 --> 00:16:37,251
Come on, help me with this.

167
00:16:37,276 --> 00:16:38,276
Sure!

168
00:16:38,985 --> 00:16:43,032
Angel, you might want to join us?
I earned a lot today.

169
00:16:43,183 --> 00:16:45,070
Bring your sister with you.

170
00:16:45,095 --> 00:16:47,462
I told you they’re not siblings.

171
00:16:47,487 --> 00:16:49,126
They're best friends!

172
00:16:49,788 --> 00:16:51,172
Hi! I'm Ramon.

173
00:16:52,438 --> 00:16:57,423
Hey! Don't waste your time on Lexi.
You're not her type.

174
00:17:00,141 --> 00:17:01,965
No one has ever said no to me.

175
00:17:02,974 --> 00:17:04,118
Or maybe...

176
00:17:04,297 --> 00:17:05,719
she wants something else.

177
00:17:05,874 --> 00:17:07,001
What did you say?

178
00:17:07,351 --> 00:17:08,351
Relax!

179
00:17:08,953 --> 00:17:12,318
Lexi is just old fashioned.

180
00:17:12,343 --> 00:17:16,274
And before you take your moves,
take a bath first!

181
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:18,837
Look at Lemuel,
he takes a bath. Right?

182
00:19:25,215 --> 00:19:26,555
I saved up for this.

183
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,009
It’s a bit expensive here.

184
00:19:30,501 --> 00:19:33,423
Hey, why are you laughing?
Do I have something on my face?

185
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:34,841
You know what?

186
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:37,078
You’re very different
from my exes.

187
00:19:37,728 --> 00:19:40,884
You don’t let me get hurt and...

188
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:44,508
this is the first time
someone took care of me like this.

189
00:19:47,317 --> 00:19:48,515
Your ex?

190
00:19:50,434 --> 00:19:51,595
It’s nothing.

191
00:19:52,463 --> 00:19:53,463
Cheers!

192
00:19:57,385 --> 00:19:58,428
You know what?

193
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,087
I want a stable relationship.

194
00:20:03,032 --> 00:20:04,579
I hope Angel...

195
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,048
you don’t compare me to your exes.

196
00:20:08,728 --> 00:20:11,087
Hey, of course not.

197
00:20:18,821 --> 00:20:20,968
We’re both orphans, right?

198
00:20:21,726 --> 00:20:24,976
That’s why I want a complete family.

199
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:27,976
How about Lexi?

200
00:20:31,848 --> 00:20:33,218
Is she also an orphan?

201
00:20:35,384 --> 00:20:37,203
What is your real relationship?

202
00:20:40,093 --> 00:20:42,578
You know, sometimes,

203
00:20:43,752 --> 00:20:45,515
I get jealous of her.

204
00:20:47,016 --> 00:20:48,336
Are you crazy?

205
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:49,872
You know,

206
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:54,213
Lexi and I are practically sisters.

207
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:59,961
Because since we were kids,
she's been there for me.

208
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:02,713
Partners in crime?

209
00:21:05,002 --> 00:21:06,212
Do you think...

210
00:21:08,117 --> 00:21:09,929
Lexi approves of me?

211
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,570
Me! You've got my vote.

212
00:21:35,606 --> 00:21:38,349
Hey, that’s our house.

213
00:21:38,491 --> 00:21:42,045
You’ve never been here,
so why do you know this place?

214
00:21:43,448 --> 00:21:44,657
You!

215
00:21:44,682 --> 00:21:46,301
See? You’re really drunk.

216
00:21:46,326 --> 00:21:48,146
You told me earlier.

217
00:21:50,371 --> 00:21:52,623
I didn't tell you anything.

218
00:21:55,793 --> 00:21:57,086
Come on.

219
00:22:00,691 --> 00:22:02,060
My slippers.

220
00:22:10,224 --> 00:22:11,224
Hey!

221
00:22:11,885 --> 00:22:16,357
Lexi! My best friend
that I love the most!

222
00:22:16,514 --> 00:22:18,646
This is Lemuel, by the way.

223
00:22:19,699 --> 00:22:21,123
I know him already.

224
00:22:21,415 --> 00:22:22,624
Come on, it’s late.

225
00:22:22,649 --> 00:22:24,151
Why did you let yourself get this drunk?

226
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,552
What did you do to Angel?

227
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:27,662
Don't scold him.

228
00:22:27,902 --> 00:22:31,459
Lemuel is a good guy.
He even brought me home.

229
00:22:31,484 --> 00:22:32,591
He's nice!

230
00:22:33,247 --> 00:22:34,888
I'm sorry, Lexi!

231
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,982
We just had a little bit of fun.
This won't happen again.

232
00:22:38,064 --> 00:22:39,713
Yes, this will not happen again.

233
00:22:39,885 --> 00:22:41,151
Can you carry her?

234
00:22:42,154 --> 00:22:43,390
Yes, you can go now.

235
00:22:43,942 --> 00:22:45,148
Okay, thank you.

236
00:29:38,133 --> 00:29:39,410
Angel?

237
00:29:42,658 --> 00:29:43,867
Angel?

238
00:30:05,866 --> 00:30:07,146
Good thing you're awake already.

239
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:13,874
I was sure Angel would have a hangover,
so I brought breakfast.

240
00:30:14,959 --> 00:30:16,144
Where’s Angel?

241
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,670
She's taking a bath.

242
00:30:18,596 --> 00:30:19,753
Here, have some coffee.

243
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:31,572
Oh, go ahead and eat.
I’ll just get dressed.

244
00:30:31,597 --> 00:30:33,539
- Okay.
- I’ll be quick.

245
00:30:33,564 --> 00:30:34,564
Come on, let’s eat.

246
00:31:29,964 --> 00:31:32,591
- Oh, Lexi.
- Angel.

247
00:31:33,283 --> 00:31:34,783
About last night…

248
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:39,756
Hey, I’m sorry. I didn’t
mean to get drunk.

249
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:42,645
And besides I didn’t puke, right?

250
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,650
Not that.

251
00:31:45,478 --> 00:31:49,190
What is it? Please don’t get mad. Please.

252
00:31:49,954 --> 00:31:52,235
No, I’m not mad.

253
00:31:52,707 --> 00:31:53,707
Then what?

254
00:31:56,604 --> 00:31:57,604
You know what?

255
00:31:58,892 --> 00:32:00,447
Lemuel and I are together.

256
00:32:02,089 --> 00:32:04,861
- What?
- Lemuel’s my boyfriend now.

257
00:32:05,493 --> 00:32:08,252
He’s so sweet!

258
00:32:09,526 --> 00:32:11,509
- Right?
- Angel!

259
00:32:11,736 --> 00:32:14,370
Why aren’t you happy for me?

260
00:32:15,121 --> 00:32:20,829
Lexi, I love Lemuel.
I hope you can accept him too.

261
00:32:38,343 --> 00:32:41,437
Lexi, you should eat too.
It might get cold.

262
00:32:43,012 --> 00:32:46,234
I know you were surprised
by all that’s happened.

263
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:50,350
But I promise, I won’t betray your trust.

264
00:32:51,086 --> 00:32:53,105
Angel and I love each other.

265
00:32:57,511 --> 00:32:59,820
Can you leave once you’ve eaten?

266
00:33:00,327 --> 00:33:03,070
I just want to have
a serious talk with Angel.

267
00:33:05,374 --> 00:33:06,374
Hey!

268
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:10,836
If you have anything to say,
say it to the both of us.

269
00:33:12,176 --> 00:33:15,000
That’s okay Angel.
I understand.

270
00:33:15,218 --> 00:33:16,568
It’s a family matter.

271
00:33:16,593 --> 00:33:18,781
No! Don’t leave!

272
00:33:19,437 --> 00:33:22,403
Angel, Lexi is right.

273
00:33:22,933 --> 00:33:24,518
I’ll let you two talk.

274
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,859
But our date tomorrow is still on, okay?

275
00:33:37,698 --> 00:33:38,698
Lexi.

276
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:44,953
Why can’t you understand me?

277
00:33:46,598 --> 00:33:51,492
Didn’t I tell you that
we need to be extra careful?

278
00:33:52,854 --> 00:33:55,726
Do I have to repeat myself
all the time?

279
00:33:55,787 --> 00:33:59,265
I know that.
We’re not kids anymore, Lexi.

280
00:33:59,568 --> 00:34:02,195
How long will I keep following your orders?

281
00:34:02,435 --> 00:34:04,492
I have my own life.

282
00:34:04,719 --> 00:34:06,511
I’m getting tired of you.

283
00:34:07,487 --> 00:34:09,343
Let me be happy.

284
00:34:11,452 --> 00:34:13,648
I’m just scared.

285
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:19,101
You have nothing
to be afraid of, Lexi.

286
00:34:19,561 --> 00:34:20,770
Trust me.

287
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:26,465
We’re going to Manila tomorrow.

288
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:28,218
Do you need anything?

289
00:34:30,747 --> 00:34:34,023
I told you not to worry.

290
00:34:42,368 --> 00:34:43,679
It’s settled, boss.

291
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:45,765
The rest will be easy.

292
00:34:46,788 --> 00:34:50,422
I’m just having a hard time with
the other one, but I’ll find a way.

293
00:34:51,393 --> 00:34:53,029
Yes, leave it to me, boss.

294
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:55,125
We’re leaving in a bit.

295
00:35:00,118 --> 00:35:02,851
Hey! Lexi, you’re there.

296
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,582
Where’s Angel?

297
00:35:05,654 --> 00:35:06,654
Why?

298
00:35:06,892 --> 00:35:08,843
Aren’t you leaving later?

299
00:35:10,068 --> 00:35:11,614
I was excited,

300
00:35:12,404 --> 00:35:13,884
so I woke up early.

301
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,680
Lemuel...

302
00:35:18,327 --> 00:35:21,398
I’m sorry about what happened
the other day.

303
00:35:21,593 --> 00:35:22,594
That’s okay.

304
00:35:22,677 --> 00:35:25,023
I know you’re just protecting Angel.

305
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,890
I hope we can be comfortable
with each other.

306
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:30,008
Of course.

307
00:35:30,794 --> 00:35:32,578
Where are you two headed later?

308
00:35:35,578 --> 00:35:39,015
Angel just wants to go around Manila.

309
00:35:41,726 --> 00:35:43,139
So, you two are going on a date.

310
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:44,358
That’s right.

311
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:47,351
Lexi, I’ll just use the restroom.

312
00:38:14,915 --> 00:38:16,336
What the hell!

313
00:38:16,556 --> 00:38:18,095
You pigs!

314
00:38:18,353 --> 00:38:21,330
Get out of here, you swine!

315
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:25,988
- Damn you!
- Hold on. Let me explain.

316
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:27,611
You’re both disgusting!

317
00:38:28,871 --> 00:38:29,871
And you!

318
00:38:30,164 --> 00:38:32,683
Damn you! Come here!

319
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:34,155
How dare you?!

320
00:38:34,471 --> 00:38:36,539
So the real reason
you don’t like Lemuel for me

321
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,374
is because you want him
for yourself!

322
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:39,845
Damn you!

323
00:38:41,108 --> 00:38:44,415
Let me explain, Angel.
I didn’t want this.

324
00:38:44,814 --> 00:38:46,905
Lemuel was behind everything.

325
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:48,494
I could never do that to you.

326
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:51,103
I was surprised she joined me
in the restroom.

327
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:53,853
Believe me. She’s a liar.

328
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:55,962
You're an asshole!

329
00:38:56,633 --> 00:38:58,267
- Damn you!
- Angel...

330
00:38:58,292 --> 00:39:00,009
Let’s go our separate ways!

331
00:39:00,376 --> 00:39:01,765
Angel, I love you.

332
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:03,962
Just stop it!

333
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:06,509
You don’t understand me.

334
00:39:06,902 --> 00:39:08,564
What are you talking about?

335
00:39:09,237 --> 00:39:10,517
Since we were kids,

336
00:39:11,299 --> 00:39:12,681
I've been inlove with you!

337
00:39:13,122 --> 00:39:14,580
Are you crazy?

338
00:39:15,009 --> 00:39:16,392
Damn it!

339
00:39:16,751 --> 00:39:17,751
I’m sorry!

340
00:39:17,876 --> 00:39:19,149
I’ll admit it.

341
00:39:19,542 --> 00:39:21,330
I was behind all this.

342
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:26,322
Because I didn’t want you
to go with Lemuel.

343
00:39:27,501 --> 00:39:30,573
Because I couldn’t accept that
you’ll go with this kind of man!

344
00:39:30,598 --> 00:39:31,598
That’s enough!

345
00:39:32,186 --> 00:39:35,064
From now on,
I’m staying with Lemuel.

346
00:39:35,089 --> 00:39:36,720
- Angel!
- I’ll leave you alone!

347
00:39:41,442 --> 00:39:44,853
Angel!

348
00:39:45,488 --> 00:39:47,115
Angel!

349
00:39:48,157 --> 00:39:51,415
Angel!

350
00:39:53,413 --> 00:39:56,658
Angel!

351
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:03,087
Angel!

352
00:40:06,855 --> 00:40:09,314
Angel!

353
00:40:16,338 --> 00:40:20,103
Too bad we’re not able
to go to Manila today.

354
00:40:20,493 --> 00:40:22,212
There will be other chances,

355
00:40:22,555 --> 00:40:24,540
since we’ll be together from now on.

356
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,447
But I have a request for you.

357
00:40:27,178 --> 00:40:28,998
Once you’ve calmed down,

358
00:40:29,249 --> 00:40:31,188
you should speak to Lexi.

359
00:40:32,044 --> 00:40:35,555
I want us to live with no enemies.

360
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:38,821
Lexi is your only family, right?

361
00:40:41,686 --> 00:40:43,354
But what about the…

362
00:40:43,379 --> 00:40:46,219
Lexi’s confession is nothing to me.

363
00:40:46,728 --> 00:40:49,259
Who wouldn’t fall
for someone like you?

364
00:40:49,844 --> 00:40:50,844
You’re beautiful,

365
00:40:51,086 --> 00:40:52,086
kind,

366
00:40:52,301 --> 00:40:53,301
and sweet.

367
00:40:54,057 --> 00:40:55,057
But most of all,

368
00:40:55,657 --> 00:40:56,683
sexy.

369
00:40:59,273 --> 00:41:01,690
So, do you want more coffee?

370
00:42:51,045 --> 00:42:52,087
Lexi!

371
00:43:03,112 --> 00:43:05,055
I’m glad you came back.

372
00:43:06,622 --> 00:43:07,765
Let’s sit.

373
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:09,382
No, I won’t stay long.

374
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:13,273
I’m sorry I have nothing to offer.

375
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:16,680
It’s been days since I went out.

376
00:43:17,347 --> 00:43:18,492
That’s alright.

377
00:43:20,328 --> 00:43:21,328
Angel...

378
00:43:21,353 --> 00:43:23,556
there’s something you need
to know about Lemuel.

379
00:43:23,581 --> 00:43:27,468
Lexi, you don’t need
to lie about Lemuel.

380
00:43:27,845 --> 00:43:30,317
That was long ago.
We’ve talked about it.

381
00:43:30,342 --> 00:43:32,015
It’s nothing to him, now.

382
00:43:33,556 --> 00:43:37,453
Lexi, I might not be able
to return your feelings,

383
00:43:37,558 --> 00:43:40,796
but I want to save our friendship.

384
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:42,015
Thank you.

385
00:43:42,539 --> 00:43:44,452
Let me make it up to you.

386
00:43:44,648 --> 00:43:47,101
Tomorrow, we’ll have dinner together.

387
00:43:47,271 --> 00:43:49,492
with Lemuel, okay?

388
00:43:59,492 --> 00:44:01,703
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

389
00:44:03,955 --> 00:44:05,750
Someone’s here.

390
00:44:11,823 --> 00:44:13,093
Come in.

391
00:44:16,425 --> 00:44:17,425
Go ahead.

392
00:44:21,222 --> 00:44:23,000
Lexi!

393
00:44:27,395 --> 00:44:29,093
I’m glad you came.

394
00:44:29,814 --> 00:44:31,460
We’re drinking together!

395
00:44:32,445 --> 00:44:34,929
We’re getting drunk! Let’s go!

396
00:44:34,954 --> 00:44:36,695
Sit here, Lexi.

397
00:44:37,195 --> 00:44:38,195
Come on.

398
00:44:38,514 --> 00:44:39,757
Sit down.

399
00:45:00,814 --> 00:45:02,156
Want to join?

400
00:45:19,739 --> 00:45:21,296
So, you’re joining in.

401
00:45:49,268 --> 00:45:50,367
You son of a bitch!

402
00:46:19,715 --> 00:46:20,715
Angel...

403
00:46:21,163 --> 00:46:22,568
be careful of Lemuel.

404
00:46:22,593 --> 00:46:24,111
He’s one of Eric’s family’s men.

405
00:46:24,136 --> 00:46:25,726
He’s being paid...

406
00:46:25,846 --> 00:46:27,648
to follow us.

407
00:46:27,944 --> 00:46:30,921
He’s probably planning something bad.

408
00:46:57,799 --> 00:47:00,562
Wait for me, Lexi!
