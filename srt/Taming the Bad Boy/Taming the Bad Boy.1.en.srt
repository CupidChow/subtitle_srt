1
00:00:00,792 --> 00:00:03,795
My name is Park Jin-woo, and I'm a transfer student.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,883
This guy is called Ko Tae-seop.

3
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:13,430
He's the most popular delinquent in our school.

4
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:23,023
And.

5
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:26,026
He's also my boyfriend.

6
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:15,617
Mom, what is all this?

7
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,620
Jin-woo, what are we going to do now?

8
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:22,624
What are we really going to do?

9
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,292
What is this? Why is this happening?

10
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:27,962
Your dad borrowed money to pay off the settlement.

11
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:31,299
He borrowed money from private lenders.

12
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:36,387
Your dad is on the run right now.

13
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,517
I thought it was resolved!

14
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:43,978
What do we do now...?

15
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:47,107
I don't know... I really don't know anymore.

16
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:52,070
Mom, mom, calm down for now.

17
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,490
Please try to calm down, Mom.

18
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:15,135
Wow, this house is nice.

19
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,096
Careful, careful.

20
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,184
Jin-woo.

21
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:25,228
You know what matters from now on, right?

22
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,396
Please, I'm begging you.

23
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,399
Stop hitting your friends and just graduate quietly.

24
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,025
Got it?

25
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,527
Got it.

26
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,529
But I told you, I didn't hit anyone.

27
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,865
This kid just doesn’t get it.

28
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,868
Whether it's a friend or a thug from another school, are you some kind of hero of justice?

29
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,203
But they were bullying students from your school.

30
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,955
Why did you go after them for revenge?

31
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,208
We should help neighbors in need without conditions.

32
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,085
That's what the ethics teacher said.

33
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:52,088
Are you telling me to ignore the teacher's wise teachings?

34
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:56,342
Ah, this kid...

35
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,760
Make yourself at home.

36
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,765
Hey, Park Jin-woo. I'm watching you.

37
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:05,310
If you make Aunt cry again...

38
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,979
I won't let it slide, got it?

39
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,982
Got it... Let's go.

40
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:24,078
Here's your room.

41
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,539
There are some of my things here, though.

42
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,083
You don't usually clean, do you?

43
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,461
Oh, this guy...

44
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,087
Ugh... It stinks...

45
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,506
Clean it up.

46
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:39,010
Is this really the time to argue about that?

47
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,095
Seriously...

48
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,806
But what's this, sis?

49
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,809
Is it a book you used to study with?

50
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,897
Yeah, but I forgot everything.

51
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,649
Still, thanks to my hard work in school...

52
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,108
I could afford a house in Seoul.

53
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:57,070
Isn't that something?

54
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,155
Oh~ So now all that's left is to get married, right?

55
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:01,032
What?

56
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,033
I mean, just get married.

57
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,452
This guy just says whatever he wants.

58
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,621
Ouch! Stop it! It hurts!

59
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,623
If it hurts, then it’s working.

60
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:11,417
Seriously, stop! It really hurts!

61
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:15,129
Anyway, families like ours have no other choice.

62
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:18,258
Studying never betrays you.

63
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,760
So stop causing trouble and focus on something.

64
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,804
On something?

65
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:23,680
Yeah, something.

66
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,516
Sis...

67
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:29,519
If I go to Seoul National University, can I buy a house before I turn 30?

68
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:34,107
Hey... I'm not telling you to buy a house.

69
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,527
Then what are you saying?

70
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,530
Well, at least you’ll be able to make a living.

71
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,700
Make a living? Why would I paint my mouth?

72
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,746
You're hopeless.

73
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:10,393
What, are you some kind of Miss Korea pageant winner?

74
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:16,149
Hey, act like a man if you’re a man, you punk.

75
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:17,984
Are you a girl?

76
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,987
And seriously, hey.

77
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,488
Didn't I tell you to make the project quickly and send it?

78
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,491
Why haven’t you sent it yet? People are busy!

79
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,953
Hurry up and send it, okay?

80
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:31,831
You know my email, right?

81
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,792
It still needs a bit more work.

82
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,211
Hurry up!

83
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:40,173
You’re really making me wait forever.

84
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,654
Oh, Tae-seop, you’re here?

85
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,365
Let’s go.

86
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:11,371
See you later. Pick it up.

87
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:43,277
Hey, hey, the teacher's coming!

88
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,364
Alright, quiet down.

89
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:50,535
Alright, we’ve got a new face today.

90
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,538
His name is Jin-woo, and he’s from Incheon.

91
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,707
Introduce yourself.

92
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,001
I’m Park Jin-woo.

93
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:02,004
Please take care of me.

94
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,631
I’ll just be studying.

95
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,634
Please don’t bother me.

96
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,386
You heard him, right?

97
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,720
Don’t pick on him.

98
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,265
Help him out, and he can sit in that empty seat.

99
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,018
Who’s on duty today?

100
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:19,021
(Me, teacher.) Make sure to clean the board later.

101
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,191
Everyone, open your books.

102
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:29,323
That’s it for today. No homework.

103
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:31,617
Thank you.

104
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:46,257
Hey, friend.

105
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:53,931
Damn it, when someone calls you, at least look.

106
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,641
That’s basic manners, right?

107
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,894
Didn’t they teach you that at home?

108
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,897
Min-hyuk, shut up. It’s the first day.

109
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:04,358
Huh? Oh...

110
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,488
Jin-woo, make sure you respond tomorrow.

111
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,657
Got it?

112
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,769
Hey!

113
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,732
Oh, you. What’s up?

114
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:45,566
What do you mean, what’s up?

115
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:48,569
I’m just saying hi to warmly welcome our new student.

116
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,197
You’re in our class, right?

117
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,740
Yeah, hi.

118
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,616
Hi.

119
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,993
Oh!

120
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,996
But why are you being so nice to him?

121
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,708
Wait, who are you talking about?

122
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,834
Tae-seop, right?

123
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,837
The little punk?

124
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:10,049
Watch your mouth...

125
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,926
I don’t know much, but...

126
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,511
Why are you so scared?

127
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:17,056
Scared? Tae-seop...

128
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:21,018
Some say he’s the hidden son of a chaebol.

129
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:22,395
Or...

130
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,356
The only son of the Yamaguchi-gumi boss in Japan.

131
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:28,526
Right, Chang-min? (What?) About Tae-seop.

132
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:32,196
I was just telling him some scary backstories about him.

133
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,657
Yeah, Tae-seop has been fluent in six languages...

134
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,117
Since elementary school.

135
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,661
There’s no country his passport hasn’t been stamped in.

136
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,371
And his father’s a diplomat, so...

137
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,205
Ever since he was young...

138
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:44,834
He’s been moving and traveling. (So what does that have to do with me?)

139
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,962
What’s clear is that his family is one of the powerhouses in Seoul.

140
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,965
If you mess with them, you’ll disappear without a trace.

141
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,801
And that scary-looking guy following him around...

142
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:57,888
Jung Min-hyuk, he's been notorious since middle school.

143
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,642
But now he's busy taking care of Tae-seop, right?

144
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:05,521
Anyway, I think that's enough advice for now.

145
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,941
So, I'll take my leave.

146
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:11,736
Not leaving?

147
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,739
Oh, I’m leaving.

148
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,409
Jin-woo.

149
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,202
Bye.

150
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:23,205
Come on.

151
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:24,707
So, he's with the yakuza?

152
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,043
What?

153
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:30,046
I don’t know!

154
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:38,220
Jin-woo, hey!

155
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,806
Jin-woo, I told you yesterday.

156
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,850
You have to answer me today.

157
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,602
I need to study.

158
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:48,272
Hey, can’t you hear me? (I can hear you perfectly.)

159
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,776
Heh, cute.

160
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,655
What’s up with you guys?

161
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,406
Are you guys playing bullies?

162
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:00,409
It’s so childish. Play by yourselves.

163
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:06,207
What?

164
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,210
Are you like Tae-seop or something?

165
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:14,006
Sorry, just leave me alone.

166
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,344
What?

167
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,347
He said sorry, didn’t he?

168
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,893
Damn it, this bastard...

169
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,398
Hey!

170
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:35,986
Wow!

171
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,030
You know...

172
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,992
Starting today, (Hey... Hey!) you’re the class mutt. (What is this!)

173
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:43,536
Hey!

174
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,704
Hey! Hey!

175
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,876
Hey, come here! Hey!

176
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,042
Friend.

177
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:42,344
Tear it apart.

178
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:45,639
Wow, crazy.

179
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:53,874
Damn it.

180
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,936
Son~

181
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,563
Today’s the big test day.

182
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,856
I’m so excited.

183
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,817
My son studied so hard, after all.

184
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:21,735
Not really.

185
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:24,947
Just be confident, Jin-woo. You just don’t study enough.

186
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,199
You’ve always been smart since you were young.

187
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,743
You talked earlier than other kids...

188
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,829
You memorized multiplication tables in kindergarten...

189
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,998
All the neighborhood ladies said you’d go to Seoul National University.

190
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:34,832
I’m telling you!

191
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,751
(The neighborhood ladies...) But I,

192
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:40,754
I don’t even expect you to be first in the whole school.

193
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,840
Since you only started studying recently,

194
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,843
I’d be happy if you just made it to the middle of the class.

195
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,055
(Middle is really... ) Since it's a big day for my son,

196
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:53,058
Mom will get beef...

197
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,521
Korean beef! (No, mom, please...)

198
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,272
Okay, I’ll get Korean beef!

199
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:01,025
Oh, you're going to be late.

200
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:04,528
Do well on your test and have a good day.

201
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:08,324
Mom, I’d rather have pork than beef.

202
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,074
Chicken would be good, too.

203
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,410
I think chicken would be even better.

204
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,121
You had chicken yesterday and the day before!

205
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,081
So chicken today, chicken tomorrow...

206
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,333
I really love chicken, mom.

207
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,336
Okay, go on.

208
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:25,090
Alright, son, good luck!

209
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:29,720
Mom, I really love chicken. I really love chicken.

210
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,180
Alright, alright!

211
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,516
You're going to be late! Hurry!

212
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,603
I really said I love chicken!

213
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,606
Hurry up and go!

214
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,149
Wow, third place again?

215
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,404
Everyone's just so good.

216
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,990
Hey.

217
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,998
Hey, come out.

218
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,792
Why should I?

219
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:42,793
Come out if I tell you to.

220
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:45,796
Unless you want to sit and chat.

221
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,224
Why?

222
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:00,227
Hey, I said it’s all my fault. (What?)

223
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:01,979
Just, just everything.

224
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,897
What exactly?

225
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:06,442
Can’t you just let me study?

226
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,569
Did I commit some crime?

227
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,195
Who do you think you are, huh?

228
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:13,157
That’s not how you ask for a favor, is it?

229
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:16,160
...Could you just stop?

230
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,245
I’ll do whatever you tell me.

231
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:21,248
Alright.

232
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,043
Then from now on,

233
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,046
you’ll be my personal mutt.

234
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,380
No one will bother you.

235
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,383
I’ll let you study in peace.

236
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,305
Why?

237
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,308
Don’t like it?

238
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,490
Hey, aren’t you going to be late?

239
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,627
You’re here?

240
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,849
Hey, mutt!

241
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,936
Hi?

242
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,271
Grab your bag and stuff,

243
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:36,740
and sit over here.

244
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:40,702
A mutt should stick close to its master. (Oh...)

245
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:50,587
Isn't “oh” informal speech?

246
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,925
Yes...

247
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,928
Give me your paw.

248
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,597
Hey, come on.

249
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:03,267
Even for a joke, that's too much, right?

250
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,143
I’m just kidding.

251
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,146
You're kind of cute, aren't you?

252
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,278
Ah, third-year Ko Tae-seop.

253
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:17,281
Please report to the staff room.

254
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,074
Ugh, what do they want now?

255
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,202
Hey, mutt, do I look okay?

256
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:25,873
Yeah, why are you so careless? Look closely.

257
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:28,750
Shirt. (It’s fine.)

258
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,878
Pants. (They’re fine.)

259
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:34,006
Tie. (Looks fine.) Are you messing with me?

260
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,134
Don’t I have a tie?

261
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:40,137
I think I have one somewhere.

262
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,930
What do you mean “I think”?

263
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,473
Isn’t it your stuff?

264
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,309
It’s probably stuffed somewhere at home.

265
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,644
How should I know?

266
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:51,481
Want to borrow mine? (Yeah, give me yours.)

267
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:55,652
No, you tie it for me! (Huh? You do it, it’s easy.)

268
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:58,822
Ugh... Just shut up and do it, mutt.

269
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,918
You know what?

270
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,921
You’re even more annoying because you’re handsome.

271
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:21,345
Done? (Yeah.) Thanks, I’m off.

272
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,660
Oh.

273
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,912
Do I have to do your homework too?

274
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,915
If you want me to, you should pay me...

275
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,172
Wow, seriously amazing.

276
00:20:57,172 --> 00:21:01,301
Jung-beom, I’m so proud to be your friend.

277
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:04,888
How do you even do it?

278
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:07,099
At this rate, Jung-beom,

279
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,102
you’ll end up at Google or Microsoft.

280
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,313
What?

281
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,733
Microsoft?

282
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:17,734
Really?

283
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:20,737
Yeah, for sure!

284
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,583
Hey, go ahead without me.

285
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:42,092
Hey, mutt! How’s it going?

286
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,971
Just checking on you.

287
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,308
But hey, should you really give tasks like this to someone like me?

288
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,227
Are you dumb?

289
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:55,230
I’m ranked 188th in the school.

290
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,984
Oh, it's solid. (Ouch.)

291
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,988
And I'm really bad at studying.

292
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:08,368
You do look the part, though.

293
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,707
Do your best.

294
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:24,801
Hey..!

295
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,098
Pay up and leave.

296
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:40,359
Ah~ Finally done.

297
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,072
Ugh...

298
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,656
It's Wednesday, huh? (Why?)

299
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:51,036
It's laundry day. After Min-hyuk's errand, it's Tae-seop's.

300
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:54,122
Like they say, “One mountain after another.”

301
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,502
Is it shirt-pickup day?

302
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,087
Yeah, it's annoying.

303
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:05,884
Wait a minute?

304
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:10,347
Isn't it?

305
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:22,192
Mutt.

306
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,071
Mutt?

307
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,906
Call me that one more time and you're dead.

308
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,909
Look at me nicely.

309
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,245
If you have something to say, say it quickly and leave.

310
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,542
You need to go to the laundry today.

311
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:41,670
(Why me?) You need to pick up Tae-seop’s shirt.

312
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,923
(Why should I?) It used to be my job once a month.

313
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:48,677
But now you’re the class mutt, so it’s yours. (So?)

314
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,807
I dropped it off the other day, by the way.

315
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,936
So you should be the one to pick it up.

316
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:01,815
Seriously? I did you a favor by dropping it off.

317
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:02,774
And now,

318
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,568
the one handling dry cleaning is you.

319
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,695
That’s only fair, isn’t it?

320
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,780
Well, unlike some people,

321
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,823
I’m going to join Microsoft in ten years.

322
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:12,701
You seem to have nothing better to do, so this is perfect.

323
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,870
Alright, I’m off.

324
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,163
Thanks. (Hey!)

325
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:25,839
Ugh, seriously...

326
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:29,176
This is so stressful.

327
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:32,179
Ugh, really...

328
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,229
Doesn’t this guy have hidden cash somewhere?

329
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:50,197
What the...?

330
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,616
He's good at studying, too?

331
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:55,619
That’s seriously annoying.

332
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,751
Sun-yu.

333
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,710
Did you memorize the routine?

334
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,546
I’m going to check.

335
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:08,089
And also,

336
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:11,092
don’t stand out more than me.

337
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:13,595
Alright! With confidence, two, three!

338
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,055
A thrilling feeling towards you,

339
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:19,684
from today, we dream...

340
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,647
Hey, did you rent this place or something?

341
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:26,149
Keep it down.

342
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:27,609
Respect is important, you know.

343
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,611
Between friends.

344
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,029
Oh, sorry, Min-hyuk.

345
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,160
But... you guys do look pretty gay dancing like that.

346
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:44,042
Are you guys... really gay?

347
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,965
No... we're not!

348
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:56,429
Ah, just kidding. Why are you so scared?

349
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,849
Imagine if there were a gay guy in an all-boys school.

350
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:02,811
It’d be creepy, wouldn’t it?

351
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:06,106
So maybe stop dancing like girls

352
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,065
and get ready for the next class.

353
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,821
Ah, Chang-min...

354
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,948
You're too timid for how you look.

355
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,914
Oh, Tae-seop, you’re here?

356
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,917
Yeah, do what you need to do.

357
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,964
Mutt.

358
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:33,300
I got bangs yesterday. What do you think?

359
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,260
Looks good.

360
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,845
Did our mutt eat crap or something?

361
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,681
Your answer’s a bit short.

362
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,558
Where did you get it done?

363
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:45,270
Would you know if I told you? (Of course not.)

364
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,273
Then why ask if you don’t know?

365
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:48,898
Listening to you...

366
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:50,275
It’s ridiculous.

367
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,027
You said not to answer briefly, right?

368
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,529
Damned if I do, damned if I don’t.

369
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,114
What do you want me to do?

370
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,909
Alright, alright.

371
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:02,495
I’m sorry.

372
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:05,498
So, what do you think of my bangs?

373
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,962
Ah... Here’s your shirt!

374
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,757
Oh, mutt~ Thanks.

375
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:16,760
Mutt this, mutt that, every time.

376
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:26,353
By the way,

377
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:29,564
Do you have a tutor? You seem to slack off all the time.

378
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:32,567
How are your grades so good?

379
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:35,737
If I spent money like that, could I be top 3 in school too?

380
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:40,200
Man, I wish I had money.

381
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,871
Hey.

382
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:46,456
What’s up with you?

383
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,958
Hey.

384
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:51,961
Hey!

385
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,676
Hey!

386
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:00,679
Did I say something wrong? Your family’s rich, right?

387
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:04,391
Where’d you hear that? (It’s a common rumor.)

388
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,519
Your dad works in the Foreign Ministry? Grandfather’s a chairman?

389
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,689
That’s what they say.

390
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,151
Why are you acting up when your grades are good?

391
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:16,986
Shut up.

392
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,905
If I had those grades, I’d show my parents right away.

393
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:21,741
Guess you wouldn’t know since you’ve never been poor.

394
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:30,625
Never mind.

395
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:33,586
Hey, are you mad?

396
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:36,047
I’m sorry. I said I’m sorry.

397
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,882
What the hell do you know, you bastard?

398
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,885
Damn it...

399
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,984
Hey...

400
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:01,489
What’s going on? I need to know if I did something wrong.

401
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:04,492
So I don’t mess up again.

402
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:11,166
Are you okay?

403
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,876
Hey, why keep the mutt around if you’re not going to use him?

404
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:15,879
Now’s the time to put him to work.

405
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,274
It wasn’t my grandfather...

406
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:40,653
It was my dad who’s a diplomat.

407
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:43,740
Because of that,

408
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,743
I’ve never stayed home for long.

409
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,623
I don’t even know if the woman I call Mom

410
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,624
is my real mom or my aunt.

411
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,668
Damn it.

412
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:58,671
Giving birth is the easy part.

413
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,507
That’s why I hate the word “sorry.”

414
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:03,510
It’s never really meant.

415
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:07,263
I won’t do anything I need to apologize for.

416
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:15,480
Do you like guys?

417
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,378
Do you?

418
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:45,593
No.

419
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:48,596
Then...?

420
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,852
Do you like me?

421
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,855
I think I do.

422
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:04,612
Then...

423
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,702
From now on, you’ll be my mutt.

424
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:31,806
Hey, guys!

425
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,558
You know who I am, right?

426
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:37,228
Who am I? (The sex-ed teacher!)

427
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,898
Sex-ed?

428
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,984
How many times do I have to tell you, I’m the school nurse, not the sex-ed teacher?

429
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,321
Well, thanks.

430
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,655
For remembering.

431
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:49,407
So today,

432
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,785
we’ll learn about healthy sexual activity.

433
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:55,955
Ugh, sex ed again.

434
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:59,042
At this point, aren’t you really the sex-ed teacher?

435
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,502
Shall we jump straight to the practical lessons?

436
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:08,009
So, to maintain a healthy sex life,

437
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:11,638
what’s the most important thing? Anyone know?

438
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:15,058
Answer! Grilled eel.

439
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:18,061
Let’s eat that together!

440
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:21,272
Answer! Condoms.

441
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,191
Oh, Gi-jong!

442
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:26,694
You suck at studying, but with this,

443
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:29,906
you’re spot on—condoms are correct!

444
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:33,076
Alright, applause!

445
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:36,079
Gi-jong,

446
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,914
you just need to study well now.

447
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:42,251
You nailed it—condoms are the answer.

448
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:45,588
When it comes to condoms,

449
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:49,801
they play a vital role in contraception.

450
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:53,638
They also help prevent sexually transmitted diseases.

451
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,140
Let’s talk a bit about STDs.

452
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,017
Anyone know some?

453
00:32:58,017 --> 00:33:00,228
How about herpes?

454
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:04,565
Syphilis, AIDS, gonorrhea...
(AIDS only affects gay people, right?)

455
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:09,487
Gay people? Homosexuals?

456
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,197
Wow.

457
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,323
That’s prejudice.

458
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:15,326
Listen, AIDS doesn’t discriminate.

459
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,870
If you have sex with someone with AIDS,

460
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,873
whether they’re a man, a woman, or anyone,

461
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,543
you can catch it.

462
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:26,462
No way, they say only gay people get it!

463
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:28,631
No, they don’t, idiot.

464
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,508
The more gay people there are,

465
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:33,511
the more AIDS spreads. Shouldn’t we ban gay people by law?

466
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,764
We should ban your mouth first.

467
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:39,767
Hey, Chang-min, didn’t you say this?

468
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,478
Huh?

469
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:44,313
This kind of stigma forces people with AIDS

470
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:47,608
into the shadows.

471
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,360
It makes them hide.

472
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,739
Min-hyuk, where did you even get that information?

473
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,867
Earlier... from the internet...

474
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,870
Ah, the internet is the problem.

475
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:02,749
Fake information, misinformation—that’s the real issue.

476
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:03,791
Min-hyuk,

477
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:07,253
I have tons of resources.

478
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:10,506
Come by the nurse’s office after class.

479
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:13,843
I’ll print all 14,500 pages for you.

480
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:17,555
Oh, it's a foreign text—you’ll have to translate it yourself.

481
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,725
What do you think? Awesome, right?

482
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,728
Isn’t it amazing?

483
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:27,440
Min-hyuk, you’re impressive.

484
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:30,485
Ugh, what an idiot.

485
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,306
What are you looking at so intensely?

486
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:03,309
Uh... It’s nothing...

487
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:07,313
Wow, you’re way more of a pervert than I thought.

488
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:08,731
(It’s not like that!) Oh really?

489
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:11,609
This isn’t mine, I didn’t even know it was here.

490
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:14,946
Aww, our mutt is a little pervert.

491
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,447
I swear, it was just lying here!

492
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,657
I was just curious about what it was!

493
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,033
You’re just adorable.

494
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:22,537
Come on, let’s look at it together.

495
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:26,457
You really want to? Where are you going? (Come on, follow me!)

496
00:36:58,758 --> 00:36:59,675
Hey

497
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,678
Park Jung Bum, was he gay for real?

498
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,263
I watched that too

499
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,057
The one you saw through Airdrop, right?

500
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,183
Wow, gees

501
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:08,226
Send me that

502
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,361
Shouldn’t I be the one to stop it?

503
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,281
Do you have plenty of time?

504
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,574
Mind your own business

505
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,327
I heard you messed up at your last school by interfering in other's business

506
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,539
Just don't do anything

507
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,044
Let's have a talk a lit bit

508
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,465
What's wrong with you, sigh

509
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,398
Is this right?

510
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,358
What

511
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:41,819
We should help him, no?

512
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,195
So what

513
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:46,032
What does it have to do with us, no matter what happens to him?

514
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,784
Were you this kind of person?

515
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,456
Jinwoo

516
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:55,875
I don't wanna make things big

517
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,377
Let's just stay calm just two of us

518
00:38:59,086 --> 00:38:59,837
Okay?

519
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:01,922
If something goes wrong,

520
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,133
you might not go the university

521
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:07,219
You finally are on your track back

522
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,055
Do you wanna mess up all these things?

523
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:14,435
By the way

524
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,248
Shut your mouth

525
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:38,834
You'll get in trouble If you make a sound

526
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,883
Rethink about helping Jung Bum

527
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:49,845
I wish you could at least be a decent human being

528
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,100
You know what I mean

529
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,501
5, 6, 7, 8

530
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:24,255
Fluttering feelings for you,
From today, ♪

531
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:28,634
We dreaming and praying,
From today, ♪

532
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:32,263
In the glow of the sunset carried by the breeze,
I’ll send my heart to you ♪

533
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,389
Ah!

534
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:34,765
Oh, Jung Bum!

535
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:38,436
We don't need to do this today

536
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:40,646
Yeah, it's okay to have a rest in this time

537
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:41,480
No

538
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:42,857
Ah...

539
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:50,364
As a man, I should live confidently

540
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:53,242
I will never be discouraged by those clumsy scheming

541
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,870
Isn’t it really unfair?

542
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:57,746
Poong Ja unni appears on public TV now

543
00:40:57,746 --> 00:41:00,124
and even there's a dating program for queer

544
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,501
It's not your fault

545
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:08,174
I know right? Taiwan can even marry with same sex.
Then why do we date secretly?

546
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,550
I know

547
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,929
But true. Your words make sense always

548
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:18,976
Anyway...It feels like time is moving backwards only in our country

549
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,856
Wait and see

550
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:27,318
Let me change this brutal world no matter what

551
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,488
So you guys must be my side, forever

552
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,655
You got it?

553
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:32,948
Of course

554
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,117
Sure

555
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:40,956
Hey

556
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,458
- Why...?
- Show me your hand

557
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,084
My hand? W...why?

558
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:45,503
Just show me

559
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:50,132
This bastard's index finger and ring finger are the same length, huh?

560
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:51,842
Are you gay?

561
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:53,093
No, I'm not

562
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,762
Give me your phone

563
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,180
My phone, w...why?

564
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,057
- Just give me that
- No...

565
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,059
I think he downloaded an app for gay

566
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:02,061
Give it to me when we're kind

567
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,479
We're tired too

568
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,314
You cooperate with us, don't you?

569
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,399
Give it to me, quickly

570
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:11,820
What's this?

571
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,614
You bastard, are you Otaku?

572
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:15,282
There are full of animations only

573
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:17,993
I heard there are a few more characteristics

574
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,996
When they are asked to name female singers they like,

575
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:25,501
instead of IU or Taeyeon,
if they name Lee Hyori, BoA, or Uhm Jung Hwa, It means they are gay

576
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,213
If they say Won Bin isn't that handsome, it means they are gay

577
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,715
If they prefer eco back than cross-back, It means they are gay

578
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:35,302
and If they hang out exclusively with other guys, It means they are gay

579
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:05,958
What are you doing here?

580
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,793
Ah, fxxk

581
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:10,462
Anyway, I knew everything

582
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:11,880
You, break up with your bastard

583
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,674
Bullshxt. What are you...

584
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:15,676
Don't try to lie

585
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,553
Why, are you gonna marry him?

586
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,763
Hey Tae Seop. The good times are all gone

587
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:22,975
I already can’t stand the way homosexuals act out

588
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:24,935
I have no idea what are you talking about

589
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,145
Ah, yeah?

590
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:36,030
Your father has important work to do. he can't stop here, right, Tae Seop?

591
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:42,536
I thought a lot about whether to expose this or not

592
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:47,374
I'm letting it slide this much out of consideration for the time we've spent together

593
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,628
Enough. You understand?

594
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:52,963
What’s the reason you’re doing this to me?

595
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:56,508
I already told you. I just don't like homo-fxxkin-sexuals

596
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,887
You're smart guy

597
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:01,472
Don't cross the line

598
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:04,850
Your mom may know about this

599
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:05,643
Bye

600
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:09,521
You son of a bxxch

601
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:25,079
Hmm?

602
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,716
Why didn't you come to the rooftop yesterday? You even didn't pick up the phone

603
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:40,803
I'm busy though

604
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:42,971
And what's wrong with my seat?

605
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:46,016
Your seat is there originally

606
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:48,727
Did I do something wrong to you?

607
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,522
Times up

608
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,524
Sit down everyone

609
00:44:58,153 --> 00:45:00,114
Bye

610
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:07,287
Come out

611
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:10,874
Hey, where are you going?

612
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,210
Park Jinwoo! Ko Tae Seop!

613
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,176
What's wrong with you?

614
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:22,803
Nothing

615
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,638
Keep saying. What's wrong with you?

616
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,348
I said "nothing"

617
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:27,766
I'm sick of you

618
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,310
Is that a reason?

619
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:33,897
Yeah, we may sick of people sometimes

620
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:35,524
Are you serious?

621
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:36,650
Yeah

622
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,611
Do you think this is a proper manner?
You don't even care about me

623
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,280
Why should I?

624
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:42,990
Why did you change so much like this?

625
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:44,450
This is me

626
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,952
You already know, didn't you?

627
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:49,663
No

628
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:52,875
You need to think more carefully

629
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,252
Think a lit bit

630
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:56,670
As you wish

631
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:14,271
Son of a bxxch

632
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:25,032
I broke up with him. Keep your promise

633
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:29,620
Ah, fxxk

634
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:38,837
Hey

635
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:48,472
J...Jung Bum

636
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:53,644
Are you...leaving now?

637
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:56,021
Yes

638
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:57,523
Why are you leaving? Let me talk to the homeroom teacher...

639
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:58,649
With homeroom teacher...

640
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:01,693
we already talked about this

641
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:04,488
All I need to do is to sign the document

642
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:11,203
Can we... meet you again?

643
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:14,998
Maybe?

644
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:19,670
Contact me please. I will contact you too

645
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:20,838
Got it

646
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:23,757
Hey

647
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:29,137
Did you get sexually aroused when you saw me changing clothes during gym class?

648
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,187
My gift

649
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,064
You like that, don't you?

650
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:46,905
Our classroom became cleaner

651
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:49,283
since that virus left

652
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:54,454
Somewhat...even the air became fresh, no?

653
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:57,791
Hey Seon Yoo, Chang Min, right?

654
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:02,921
I feel like it’s a bit easier to breathe now that he left

655
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,383
Is this just because of my feeling?

656
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,595
How about you, Seon Yoo?

657
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:12,639
Oh, wow!

658
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,850
Look at your face. You look fxxking scary

659
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:17,144
You are about to hit me, huh

660
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:20,522
Chang Min, how about you?

661
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,566
You feel good too, right?

662
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:28,196
To be honest, even if Jung Bum was kind of girlish,
but I never thought that he is gay

663
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:31,491
You were disappointed in him too, right?

664
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:34,411
Yeah...yes

665
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:38,290
Cool! Chang Min is honesty

666
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:40,292
Hey Seon Yoo. You should learn from him

667
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:44,254
Tell me honestly. You didn't want to hang out with that gay

668
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:47,507
You did well so far

669
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:49,009
You son of a bxxch...

670
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:56,016
Hey!

671
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,727
Jinwoo, stop!

672
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:01,438
Fxxk, Stop! You have no idea how I stopped him!

673
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:06,318
Come out

674
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:13,367
Ah, motherfxxker. You fight too good

675
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:17,120
Fxxk

676
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:18,622
But guys

677
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,542
Who will be the next one leaving this school after Jung Bum?

678
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,007
Do you see this?

679
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:32,260
"I broke up with him. Keep your promise"

680
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:36,264
Guess who sent me this

681
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:43,146
Guys, do you know the secret between Tae Seop and Jinwoo?

682
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,482
It's a top secret though

683
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,654
There's everything in this phone

684
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,323
The top bully at our school, Tae Seop

685
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:56,326
and his best friend, Jinwoo's secret

686
00:49:57,452 --> 00:49:58,620
Coming soon!

687
00:49:58,829 --> 00:49:59,997
You can expect it, guys

688
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,999
You motherfxxker...

689
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:04,459
Let it go. I said let go

690
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:05,502
Watch this carefully

691
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:19,182
Fxxk

692
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:21,727
No...

693
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,730
That's not me...

694
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:27,065
Fxxk, I told you, that's not me

695
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:33,613
You motherfxxkers

696
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,035
Do you think I'm a fxxking homosexual?

697
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,746
How can man love man, fxxk!

698
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:48,879
They are gay

699
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:51,840
Ko Tae Seop and Park Jin Woo. They are couple

700
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:57,012
I saw they were acting out with a leash in the gym

701
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:05,353
You motherfxxker

702
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:12,861
Jinwoo...are you happy, huh?

703
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:15,781
You motherfxxker!

704
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:16,490
What are you guys doing!

705
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:18,867
Sit down

706
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:22,287
You two, come follow me

707
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,581
Hey, go ahead

708
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:27,209
Teacher is calling you

709
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:30,670
Fxxk

710
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,052
Are you okay?

711
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:38,970
I don't think so

712
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:42,015
We can see Jung Bum after school

713
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:44,309
I don't know

714
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:49,564
Hey, I'm back

715
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,566
- Oh?
- Hey, Park Jung Bum

716
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,825
Hey, what are you?

717
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:01,910
Didn't you quit the school?

718
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,454
Ah, here's an amazing news.
Jung Min Hyuk was dragged to the teacher's office

719
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:06,790
- A few mins ago, Jung Min Hyuk was...
- I know everything

720
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,838
Is there anything I don't know about?

721
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:19,261
The truth is...

722
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,514
Hey

723
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:25,809
Hey

724
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,105
Yes?

725
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:31,439
What are you doing?

726
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,942
I'm just making something

727
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:35,402
Making what?

728
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:38,697
Just a simple program...

729
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:41,658
A simple program?

730
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,328
You seem that you are good at this

731
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:47,497
Nah, just simply

732
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:49,749
You said you are making something

733
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,626
Then you must play games well, right?

734
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:53,503
Yeah

735
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:55,505
It would be simple making something inside the game to you

736
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:57,340
...yes

737
00:52:57,883 --> 00:53:01,553
You know how much I like playing games. Can you make a special program for me?

738
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:03,930
But that's an illegal...

739
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,433
Since you play a game anyway, you should do it in a way that makes you feel good

740
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:08,226
You're right...

741
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:10,478
Right? You can deal with the illegal part anyway

742
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:12,856
- Why, do you feel bad?
- No, I don't

743
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,399
Then why your face looks bad

744
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,818
I think I can make it soon

745
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:54,689
The truth was like this. Why should I quit the school? Am I crazy?

746
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:56,691
Do you think I would die over something like this?

747
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:59,152
That doesn't make sense

748
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,032
Don’t ever play that kind of prank again

749
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:05,116
Jung Bum

750
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:07,577
I'm sorry

751
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:10,580
Sorry for what, bxxch

752
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:12,958
Just...everything

753
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,042
Nah

754
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:17,754
I’m more sorry

755
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:21,007
Nah, I'm more more sorry

756
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:26,304
Love you guys...!

757
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:34,187
Are you kidding me?

758
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,315
Jinwoo, let me explain everything

759
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:39,276
No, you don't

760
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:43,238
- I can explain everything...
- I can see what happened to you, so don't explain it

761
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:45,115
Yes?

762
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:52,706
You must be stressed out

763
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:57,252
Jinwoo

764
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:00,547
Will you meet me again?

765
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:03,258
Are you asking that as a question?

766
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,260
Of course we...

767
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:10,890
Of course I meet you again

768
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,947
Finally, the vacation has come

769
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,615
True

770
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:29,159
Jinwoo, what's your plan?

771
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:30,869
Plan? We just have to study, guys

772
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:32,495
What the fxxk

773
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:35,123
- Ah, how about going to travel?
- Travel? Where?

774
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:38,001
Gangneung or water leisure would be nice,
or how about Busan?

775
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:40,462
Hey, hey. Do you have a time?

776
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:42,130
Why would a high school senior go on a trip?

777
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,631
I should study

778
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:47,886
So when is Tae Seop coming?
Does he think that he is a main character?

779
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:49,637
The princess of this area is me

780
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:51,765
Princess? Didn't you a queen?

781
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:52,849
Why are you so confident LOLL

782
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:55,310
Too talkative. It’s really boring, isn’t it?

783
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,688
Do you guys wanna die?

784
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:03,068
He is coming. Tae Seop, here

785
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:06,571
Aww, my puppy has come already

786
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:10,867
You’re all messing around

787
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:12,994
Tae Seop. Shall we go on a trip?

788
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,579
- No
- Ah, why!

789
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,873
Hey, Park Jin Woo. Did you tell them to go on a trip?

790
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:17,832
No, I didn't

791
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,668
Trip? We should go to university

792
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:23,963
It's not me. I didn't say anything for real

793
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,507
They... they

794
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:27,926
Bad bxxches

795
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,637
Ah, did you heard about Jung Min Hyuk?

796
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:32,138
No, what is it?

797
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:34,140
They said he might transfer to another school

798
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,393
I don't care anymore

799
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:38,144
You're right

800
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:40,480
Looks like the school will be a bit quieter now

801
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:43,274
Right? it will be quieter from now

802
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:46,319
- It should be
- I should've beat him more

803
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:48,530
I know right?

804
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:50,824
Ah, that bastard...

805
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:54,911
I cried because of him. You may don't know

806
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:57,455
But you didn't see how he was beaten

807
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:58,665
You weren't there

808
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:00,083
I saw it from a distance

809
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,377
Seon Yoo got hit too

810
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:03,711
Yeah, he got hit

811
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:05,922
He's right

812
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:08,883
He rushed to him but he couldn't hit any

813
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:11,678
He climbed on me and...

814
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,640
I can see what happened even if I didn't watch

815
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:42,519
Min Hyuk

816
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:44,020
It's been a long time

817
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:49,567
I was too busy dealing with Tae Seop's thing

818
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,570
I'm sorry for the last thing

819
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:54,781
Let's bury the memory of that day

820
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:58,493
My master...ah

821
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:01,287
Tae Seop's father also said it's okay

822
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:06,960
It’s because some weird guy got involved in the middle,
and the work wasn’t handled properly

823
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:09,379
Am I right?

824
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:11,589
I'm sorry

825
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:13,550
Don't say sorry again

826
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:15,760
Let's focus on productive thing

827
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:26,604
Min Hyuk, I hope it goes smoothly this time without any failure

828
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:28,940
Yes?

829
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:35,488
There’s no parent who would want their child to go down the wrong path

830
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:39,200
That is from my master

831
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:43,121
That’s the payment for the work you did last time. Just take it

832
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:46,040
I will contact you again

833
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,257
Okay, sir
