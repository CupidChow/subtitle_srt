the

11
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,080
the

12
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,080
the

13
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,080
the

14
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,080
the

15
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:33,080
the

16
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,080
the

17
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,080
the

18
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,080
the

19
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,080
the

20
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,080
the

21
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,080
the

22
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:59,080
the

23
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:04,080
the

24
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,080
the

25
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,080
the

26
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,080
the

27
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,080
the

28
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,080
the

29
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,960
Come in.

30
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,420
Let's go.

31
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,800
in the house.

32
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:45,840
Really.

33
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,840
It's time to redress your badge.

34
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,840
Steady you up in the morning.

35
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,420
I already sent you over here the next day.

36
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,940
I know what you mean.

37
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,160
Shui.

38
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,020
Get out!

39
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,700
Shui.

40
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,500
Get out!

41
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,160
Leave or I will shove him over there!

42
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,060
Again...

43
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,200
Leave!

44
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,800
It's a good thing.

45
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,960
It's a good thing to drink.

46
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,800
You can't open the door when you're busy.

47
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,800
And,

48
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,000
look at the two shops on the other side.

49
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,760
Get ready to go.

50
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,440
Where's Wen Yun?

51
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,080
Where's Ta Xue?

52
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,080
Where's Shan Dian?

53
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,360
You said it in a calm tone last year.

54
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,640
If you come back,

55
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,360
you'll definitely make money and bring me back.

56
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,080
Let me ask you.

57
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,720
Where's Ma?

58
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,360
Ma,

59
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,840
you're not here.

60
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,840
Why are you here?

61
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,840
I'm here to see the patient.

62
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,840
I'm here to see the patient.

63
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,840
Take your hand.

64
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,840
I'm really here to see you.

65
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,840
Take your hand.

66
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,840
I'm really here to see you.

67
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,840
I'm really here to see you.

68
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,840
Tomorrow,

69
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,840
I'll get Ma Chang out of here tomorrow.

70
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,840
Look at what you're wearing.

71
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,840
It's like a North Gate's Qisong.

72
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,840
It's even more like a horse.

73
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,840
It's mine.

74
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,840
You're the one who's not good for my family.

75
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,840
You're the one who's not good for my family.

76
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,840
You're the one who's not good for my family.

77
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,500
Stop there.

78
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,840
At arrow time,

79
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,840
I went to Chang'an for construction.

80
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,840
Then I went with all theanyak �ы MTV staff.

81
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,420
Was a pair of birds,

82
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,840
a middle-aged rat,

83
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,840
it went with the signs.

84
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,340
I went by a lot in the countryside,

85
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,060
harsh tremendous challenges and pl responsibilty

86
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,540
and it was very hard.

87
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,340
Before my father died,

88
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,840
I was the first to return to the Imperial Palace.

89
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,840
As if, inHA,

90
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,840
which is something boring for me.

91
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,840
Now, I'm going to lose.

92
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,840
I'm really a loser.

93
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,840
Look at me.

94
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,840
I lost to a mother.

95
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,840
It's my fault.

96
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,840
It's my fault.

97
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,840
I was killed by someone

98
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,840
by the previous leader.

99
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,840
I'm sorry for what I did.

100
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,840
I lost.

101
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,840
I was too weak.

102
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,840
You are a great horse.

103
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,840
Who else

104
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,840
can be like you

105
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,840
in Gao Zhou?

106
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,840
The law.

107
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,840
I have a chance.

108
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,840
I want to be a good man.

109
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,840
Do you still want to be a good man?

110
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,840
Before you die,

111
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,840
how good

112
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,840
is it to meet someone who is a good man?

113
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,840
It's like a good horse.

114
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,840
Don't run away from me.

115
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,840
Or

116
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,840
there is a flying bird

117
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,840
who has never seen before.

118
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,840
You have been flying before.

119
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,840
Heart beating.

120
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,840
Heart beating.

121
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,840
This matter

122
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,840
is not legal.

123
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,840
What do you think?

124
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,840
Amita

125
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,840
wants to make this deal.

126
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,840
What if the soldier says something?

127
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,840
I will

128
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,840
take out the dagger.

129
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,840
Amita will know

130
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,840
the wound of the death.

131
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,840
Amita

132
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,840
has been with me for so long.

133
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,840
Ten years?

134
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,840
It's still a small...

135
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,840
a small girl.

136
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,840
She is

137
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,840
so big.

138
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,840
Minister Zhao

139
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,840
look at this crab.

140
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,840
Is it a rare thing?

141
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,840
I am surprised.

142
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,840
This matter is surprising.

143
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,840
The crab can't see it.

144
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,840
But if the crab has a heart,

145
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,840
it can't handle it.

146
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,840
I am afraid it can't handle it.

147
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,840
Amita wants this order.

148
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,840
Give it to me.

149
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,840
This is a flower.

150
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,840
This is a bottle.

151
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,840
Minister Li.

152
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,840
Amita

153
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,840
Minister Li.

154
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,840
Minister Li.

155
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,840
My family's salesman told me to send you a message.

156
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,840
He has done his thing.

157
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,840
So fast?

158
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,840
Then when will Minister Li come to the meeting tomorrow?

159
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,840
I am busy recently.

160
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,840
I am very busy.

161
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,840
Can you let the salesman

162
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,840
go to the meeting of Xiao Dongmen?

163
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,840
He can meet the one he wants to meet.

164
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,840
Minister Li is very thoughtful.

165
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,840
He is very generous today.

166
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,840
Okay.

167
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,840
As you said,

168
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,840
see you at the meeting tomorrow at 4 p.m.

169
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,840
Goodbye.

170
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,840
How can I see him?

171
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,840
I am very busy.

172
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,840
This is a mess.

173
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,840
Xiao Hua, where is Minister Li?

174
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,840
He is upstairs.

175
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,840
Okay, let's go.

176
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,840
The curtains are a little tight.

177
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,840
Minister Li.

178
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,840
Minister Li.

179
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,840
Minister Zhao.

180
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,840
Why are you here?

181
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
The curtains are open.

182
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,840
So,

183
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,840
Minister Li,

184
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,840
please help those soldiers.

185
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,840
Okay.

186
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,840
We will not pursue this matter.

187
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,840
The superior order

188
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,840
will also be responsible for the heavy rain.

189
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,840
So, those soldiers are free?

190
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,840
That's what you mean.

191
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,840
Thank you.

192
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,840
Where are those people?

193
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,840
Let me see.

194
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,840
I don't know where they are.

195
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,840
I don't know them.

196
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,840
I have to tell the superior

197
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,840
about this news.

198
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,840
But no matter what,

199
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,840
you should tell the superior

200
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,840
to thank him for his kindness.

201
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,840
They are not here.

202
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,840
They are not here.

203
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,840
But I ran up the plane.

204
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,840
You are so...

205
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,840
Thank you.

206
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,840
Minister Li, thank you.

207
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,840
I think I saw them.

208
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,840
Okay.

209
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,840
Goodbye.

210
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,840
Thank you.

211
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,840
Let's go.

212
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,840
My goodness.

213
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,840
Mr. Yan.

214
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,840
Yajuan, you are free.

215
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,840
You don't have to hide anymore.

216
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,840
Minister Li.

217
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,840
Minister Li, I have no intention of doing this.

218
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,840
Don't do this.

219
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,840
Go and get the dagger.

220
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,840
Go.

221
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,840
Yifu.

222
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,840
What's wrong?

223
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,840
Amika.

224
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,840
This is the dagger

225
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,840
I took back from the soldier.

226
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,840
He said

227
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,840
the dagger's owner

228
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,840
was the one who took the medicine.

229
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,840
I don't know

230
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,840
if he is the one who took it.

231
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,840
But I don't know

232
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,840
if he is the one who took it.

233
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,840
I don't know.

234
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,840
I don't know.

235
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,840
I don't know.

236
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,840
I don't know.

237
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,840
But this dagger's owner

238
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,840
took the medicine.

239
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,840
Yifu, take a good look.

240
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,840
Is this the dagger

241
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,840
my father gave you?

242
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,840
Leave it.

243
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,840
I didn't expect that

244
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,840
after so many years,

245
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,840
he could still be the owner of the turtle.

246
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,840
Yifu.

247
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,840
Do you have any

248
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,840
dreams that you want to explain to me?

249
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,840
Yifu,

250
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,840
I don't know

251
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,840
what you want to explain

252
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,840
to me.

253
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,840
I don't know

254
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,840
what you wanted to tell me

255
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,840
when you took the medicine.

256
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,840
I'm sorry, father.

257
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,840
Amika.

258
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,840
You came here

259
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,840
because you wanted to

260
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,840
save me, right?

261
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,840
You must chase after me.

262
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,840
I can tell you the truth.

263
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,840
But I tell you,

264
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,840
after I know the truth,

265
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,840
you may be more difficult.

266
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,840
Yifu, please tell me.

267
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,840
Okay.

268
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,840
You were so kind

269
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,840
back then.

270
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,840
You were eager to

271
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,840
kill a sea turtle.

272
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,840
I want to be a good soldier

273
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,840
in the south.

274
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,840
But he is a sea turtle after all.

275
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,840
He is not a merchant.

276
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,840
He promised the people

277
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,840
that he would do nothing

278
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,840
to protect him.

279
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,840
But he is

280
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,840
getting less and less

281
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,840
with the fire in his hand.

282
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,840
If he keeps on

283
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,840
being in a daze,

284
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,840
it will be a loss.

285
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,840
I don't want to see him fighting.

286
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,840
But there are things

287
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,840
that he can't do

288
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,840
on the stage.

289
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,840
I can do it.

290
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,840
I am just

291
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,840
a big man.

292
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,840
In this way,

293
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,840
I can

294
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,840
help you and your father

295
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,840
through the crisis.

296
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,840
I originally thought

297
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,840
that after I make up

298
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,840
the money,

299
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,840
I will tell your father

300
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,840
that I will be in the capital

301
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,840
and ask for the most.

302
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,840
Who knows

303
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,840
that the seven-storey building

304
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,840
will be in a big fire.

305
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,840
Your father can't get out.

306
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,840
You know what happened.

307
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,840
I took my brothers

308
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,840
and took the government

309
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,840
and made it successful.

310
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,840
It was a success

311
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,840
that your father wanted to do,

312
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,840
but he didn't.

313
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,840
Amita,

314
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,840
I have never told you

315
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,840
because your father is dead.

316
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,840
I hope that he will

317
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,840
be perfect

318
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,840
in your heart.

319
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,840
Remember,

320
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,840
sometimes

321
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,840
the truth is more hurtful than lies.

322
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,840
After you grow up,

323
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,840
you should understand

324
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,840
my bitter heart.

325
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,840
No matter how cruel the truth is,

326
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,840
I don't want to live in the wilderness.

327
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,840
Wait.

328
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,840
You guys,

329
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,840
watch out.

330
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,840
Be careful.

331
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,840
He is gone.

332
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,840
He is gone.

333
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,840
Why hasn't he died?

334
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,840
How long will he live?

335
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,840
It's a miracle.

336
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,840
When I was in the hospital,

337
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,840
I found a suitable opportunity

338
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,840
to get rid of this disease.

339
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,840
You remember me.

340
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,840
There is no wind at all.

341
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,840
The fairy of Li has become a fairy.

342
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,840
Wind is coming.

343
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,840
It's the plant-based art style

344
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,840
that the Jiangnan Water香 is blowing.

345
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,840
There is a western wind blowing in the west.

346
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,840
The good brand is with the new one.

347
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,840
It's more windy in the afternoon.

348
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,840
When did you get this?

349
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,840
The top-class clothes

350
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,840
are sold out.

351
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,840
The big brand clothes are bought in three.

352
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:56,840
And you can also buy it at mercado

353
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,840
I think what you said is true.

354
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,840
I dare not forget.

355
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,840
I only know that

356
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,840
He Sishi has always put his hands on the ground.

357
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,840
Everyone has seen the care of the unknowing hand.

358
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,840
I believe He Sishi will not lie to you.

359
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,840
But he said that the cure is to help my father fill the void.

360
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,840
But how much can this medicine be sold?

361
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,840
I have solved his crisis.

362
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,840
And only after the fire in Qi Jingluo, my father was in a hurry.

363
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,840
This is really just a coincidence.

364
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,840
Hangshou, I can't find out anything.

365
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,840
Don't bother yourself.

366
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,840
Yan Xia is a good girl.

367
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,840
We are still preparing for the super meeting.

368
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,840
I will find the truth.

369
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,840
You are all here.

370
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,840
We are all leaders of the earth.

371
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,840
We are all leaders.

372
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,840
We are all leaders.

373
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,840
Only one problem.

374
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,840
The experiment is going to be a success.

375
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,840
If we are going to be lucky, it will be a success.

376
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,840
The road is rough.

377
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,840
The moon is bright.

378
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,840
The night is dangerous.

379
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,840
The year is hard.

380
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,840
The fire is hard.

381
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,840
The oil is hard.

382
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,840
I will give you the money.

383
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,840
Li Shande.

384
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,840
Mr. Su is here.

385
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,840
Mr. Li.

386
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,840
Mr. Su.

387
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,840
My subordinates.

388
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,840
Mr. D.

389
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,840
They used to be the horse-drawn horses.

390
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,840
They left them for you.

391
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,840
They took care of your horses.

392
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,840
That's good.

393
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,840
That's good.

394
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,840
Then we will be in trouble.

395
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,840
Let me introduce you to Mr. D.

396
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,840
This is Tong.

397
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,840
Mr. Li, if you need anything, just ask them.

398
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,840
Listen to them.

399
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,840
Please.

400
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,840
That's great.

401
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,840
If Mr. Yan has more than a few horses,

402
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,840
it will be even better.

403
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,840
Don't be so angry.

404
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,840
Just like Mr. D.

405
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,840
You should be a good horse-drawn horse.

406
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,840
Don't talk.

407
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,840
Go ahead.

408
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,840
Lvlamo is running around the city.

409
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,840
This kind of experiment

410
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,840
should not be done only once.

411
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,840
Yes.

412
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,840
The more you do, the more you will be able to do it.

413
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,840
I understand.

414
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,840
But if you do it once,

415
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,840
you will have to spend hundreds of millions.

416
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,840
Today hundreds of millions.

417
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,840
Tomorrow hundreds of millions.

418
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,840
I will be in the next two or three.

419
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,840
I will be in the next generation.

420
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,840
I have a new way.

421
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,840
Guess what it is.

422
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,840
You won't be in the next generation, right?

423
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,060
I will never ask for your

424
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,840
dress again.

425
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,840
This time, I will get a few

426
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,840
Prince Iron King horses from the back.

427
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,840
Can they help?

428
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,840
But don't worry.

429
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,840
I will be willing to do it.

430
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,840
I will do it.

431
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,840
I understand.

432
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,840
They will understand this.

433
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,840
As long as they see the magic power of the master,

434
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,840
they will give the Prince Iron King horses

435
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,840
the Prince Iron King horses.

436
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,840
Leave it to us.

437
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,840
Mr. Su,

438
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,840
look.

439
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,840
I have a lot of pressure

440
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,840
on this experiment.

441
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,840
You say...

442
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,840
I understand.

443
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,840
Master,

444
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,840
I think

445
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,840
you are the only one who can do it.

446
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,840
If you succeed,

447
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,840
we can't be too angry.

448
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,840
The master will do his best.

449
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,840
I will do my best.

450
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,840
I will do my best.

451
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,840
Come on.

452
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,840
Come on.

453
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,840
The merchants will have a business

454
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,840
that they want to do every year.

455
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,840
Who can make everyone make money,

456
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,840
who can get more support?

457
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,840
Go and make some noise.

458
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,840
What about the hot pot?

459
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,840
I don't need to make noise.

460
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,840
Everyone will support Amita.

461
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,840
Who dares to be the team with the Sichifu?

462
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,840
No one dares to,

463
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,840
it doesn't mean they don't want to.

464
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,840
Those merchants have already pressed the button.

465
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,840
You are just like the stone's identity

466
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,840
to stir up this mess.

467
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,840
If Amita is not in a good position,

468
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,840
she will become a waste of time

469
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,840
and friendship.

470
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,840
Have you succeeded?

471
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,840
Amita is so pitiful.

472
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,840
She has done everything for He Youguang.

473
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,840
She has been considered a pawn by He Youguang.

474
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,840
Why?

475
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,840
She is just a heartless person.

476
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,840
No, no.

477
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,840
I just have some feelings.

478
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,840
When can she understand?

479
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,840
When can she be capable?

480
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,840
Just like the master.

481
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,840
She has the ability to live

482
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,840
and can be a little bit more powerful.

483
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,840
She won't be in a mess like this.

484
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,840
Don't say that you seem to know me very well.

485
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,840
I want to know.

486
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,840
Master Li.

487
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:38,120
My

488
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,840
Tongcai is here.

489
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,840
Master Li, thank you for your kindness.

490
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,840
When we are in a hurry,

491
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,840
we will make sure that we are on the right track.

492
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,840
Listen to Master Li.

493
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,840
Listen to Master Li.

494
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,840
Hurry up.

495
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,840
Don't be so hasty.

496
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,840
It's good that you are here.

497
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,840
It's good that you are here.

498
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,840
You are my savior.

499
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,840
With your help,

500
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,840
I can finally get to the bottom of my heart.

501
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,840
Let's not stay here.

502
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,840
I will go to the small cave.

503
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,840
Let's go.

504
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,840
These days,

505
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,840
we are busy with our work.

506
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,840
It's hard work.

507
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,840
Tomorrow,

508
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,840
we will be the first to make a good impression.

509
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,840
Good.

510
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,840
Master Li.

511
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,840
Master Li.

512
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,840
If it's raining tomorrow,

513
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,840
will it still rain?

514
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,840
Yes.

515
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,840
Tomorrow,

516
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,840
no matter what it is,

517
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,840
we will have to try.

518
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,840
God will help us to improve our difficulty.

519
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,840
It's good.

520
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,840
The number we count...

521
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,840
Is it accurate?

522
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,840
Yes.

523
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,840
Good.

524
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,840
That's it.

525
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,840
I was thinking that

526
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,840
one person will be able to complete

527
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,840
the experiment in a single horse.

528
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,840
I was left alone.

529
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,840
This time,

530
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,840
two people will be able to do the experiment in two horses.

531
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,840
If there is a horse,

532
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,840
it will lose its weight.

533
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,840
Or something will happen.

534
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,840
Or there is a new difficulty.

535
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,840
We can't predict.

536
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,840
The horse behind

537
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,840
can make it up.

538
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,840
Right?

539
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,840
We can continue to do this experiment.

540
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,840
It's like a insurance.

541
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,840
Then we have to prepare

542
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,840
more paper.

543
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,840
Yes.

544
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,840
We have to make more paper.

545
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,840
So,

546
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,840
we have to inform the paper

547
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,840
to bring the rest of the double-diamond.

548
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,840
Good.

549
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,840
In the three classes,

550
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,840
all the new paper of the experiment

551
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,840
will be sent to the small cave.

552
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,840
The time for the horse is approaching.

553
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,840
At the moment of the horse,

554
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,840
the preparation is ready.

555
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,840
All the horses of the experiment

556
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,840
will be sent to the small cave.

557
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,840
Let me say one more thing.

558
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,840
Yes.

559
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,840
The horse of the experiment is the hardest one.

560
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,840
So, we have to make sure

561
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,840
that they are eating.

562
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,840
Okay.

563
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,840
The ingredients must be washed repeatedly.

564
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,840
To choose fresh ones.

565
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,840
You have to tell the palm of your hand.

566
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,840
You have to pay attention to the hygiene.

567
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,840
You can't eat bad things.

568
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,840
Don't worry.

569
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,840
You have to take responsibility for this.

570
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,840
Okay.

571
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,840
When it comes to this,

572
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,840
we will change it to four meals a day.

573
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,840
The horse of the experiment

574
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,840
will be eaten at noon,

575
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,840
at noon,

576
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,840
and at noon.

577
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,840
You have to work hard.

578
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,840
You can't lose two people.

579
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,840
Okay.

580
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,840
What about Hao?

581
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,840
Where is he?

582
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,840
Hao, you have to move the water and change the water.

583
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,840
Remember,

584
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,840
you must seal the double-diamond.

585
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,840
When you put it on the horse,

586
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,840
you have to tie it tightly.

587
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,840
Okay.

588
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,840
Seal it tightly.

589
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,840
Adi, you have to seal the horse.

590
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,840
If you don't run around,

591
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,840
you can change the horse.

592
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,840
Adi will cooperate with you

593
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,840
to brush the horse and wash the horse.

594
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,840
Change the grass and the grass.

595
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,840
Okay.

596
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,840
Right, Adi.

597
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,840
From lunchtime,

598
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,840
light the fire in the mountains

599
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,840
for these horse riders.

600
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,840
Professor Li,

601
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,840
he said he can change people in a few laps.

602
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,840
But, in two laps,

603
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,840
the believe no trekkers can really close the horses.

604
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,840
I think in one circle for one person,

605
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,840
it will be filmed in three circles,

606
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,840
so they will can run more,

607
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,840
and equals it to eat more.

608
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,840
If it turns out like this,

609
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,840
the horse can run to the bone to death.

610
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,840
What do you think?

611
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,840
As you order.

612
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,840
Me assessment!

613
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,840
The horse is 3,000 yuan.

614
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,840
Tomorrow,

615
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,840
Brother Lang and Brother Yan

616
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,840
will take the two pairs of 1000-meter-long

617
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,840
and fight for the victory.

618
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,840
I will write down the rest of the chess pieces

619
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,840
on the screen.

620
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,840
You can see it clearly.

621
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,840
If the chess pieces are in the front,

622
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,840
the chess pieces on the back

623
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,840
will be kept in order.

624
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,840
I will say it again.

625
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,840
When you try it,

626
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,840
the chess pieces are the hardest.

627
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,840
You must ensure their rest and sleep.

628
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,840
When they are going to sleep,

629
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,840
we don't want to disturb them.

630
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,840
The chess pieces are also

631
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,840
as fast as they can.

632
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,840
What else?

633
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,840
Anyway,

634
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,840
there will be

635
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,840
some problems

636
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,840
that we can't think of.

637
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,840
When that happens,

638
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,840
we will cooperate.

639
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,840
If you have any questions,

640
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,840
please let me know.

641
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,840
If I have any questions,

642
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,840
please let us know.

643
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,840
We will talk more.

644
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,840
Okay?

645
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,840
Okay.

646
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,840
We will thank you

647
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,840
in advance.

648
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,840
Okay.

649
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,840
Tomorrow,

650
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,840
we will thank you

651
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,840
for your hard work.

652
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,840
We will not

653
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,840
lose a single result.

654
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,840
Okay.

655
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,840
Okay, Okay.

656
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,840
We will work, then.

657
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,840
Come on.

658
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,840
I'm going to kill you.

659
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,840
I'm going to kill you.

660
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,840
I'm going to kill you.

661
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,840
I'm going to kill you.

662
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,840
A'Li.

663
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,840
Don't just let him eat.

664
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,840
You can eat it yourself.

665
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,840
A'Li.

666
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,840
A'Li.

667
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,840
A'Li.

668
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,840
A'Li.

669
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,840
A'Li.

670
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,840
A'Li.

671
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,840
A'Li.

672
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,840
It must be the new day.

673
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,840
Or the new day.

674
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:53,840
One심职子向下万睐.

675
00:31:54,840 --> 00:32:02,840
Change color with the uniform Jesus.

nationalism.

677
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,840
One day and you are there.

678
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:17,840
I'm tired of the cold, I'm just a little tired

679
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:23,840
I'm just a little tired of the cold, I'm just a little tired

680
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,840
I'm just a little tired

681
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,840

I'm afraid.

732
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,840
I've never spent so much money

733
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,840
on such a useless thing.

734
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,840
Throwing out stones and shooting out arrows.

735
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,840
What's the use of you worrying so much now?

736
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,840
You won't sleep for a while.

737
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,840
How will you survive in the future?

738
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,840
I'm fine.

739
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,840
I've been working on it for a while.

740
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,840
I've been working on it for a while.

741
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,840
I've been working on it for a while.

742
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,840
I'll be back soon.

743
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,840
Here, eat some.

744
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,840
Eat some.

Hurry up.

746
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,840
Hurry up.

747
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,840
Hurry up.

748
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,840
Come on.

749
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,840
Hurry up.

750
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,840
Hurry up.

751
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,840
Hurry up.

752
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,840
Hurry up.

753
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,840
Be careful.

754
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,840
Lv Shengde, come and eat.

755
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,840
Come on.

756
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,840
Come on.

757
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,840
Come on.

758
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,840
Come on.

759
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,840
Come on.

760
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,840
Don't smell it.

761
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,840
It smells so good.

762
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,840
Lv Shengde, have some bananas.

763
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,840
Okay.

764
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,840
Master Li.

765
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,840
Master Li.

766
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,840
Come here.

767
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,840
Come and eat.

768
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,840
Come here.

769
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,840
Come here.

770
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,840
Let's go.

771
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,840
Look at our staff.

772
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,840
You can't survive in the grass.

773
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,840
You have to live in the soil.

774
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,840
You can't live in the sun for a few days.

775
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,840
You'll be caught in the soil.

776
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,840
Hurry up.

777
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,840
Hurry up.

778
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,840
Come on.

779
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,840
Come on.

780
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,840
Come on.

781
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,840
Come on.

782
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,840
Come on.

783
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,840
Come on.

784
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,840
Come on.

785
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,840
Okay.

786
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,840
Okay.

787
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,840
Okay.

788
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,840
Okay.

789
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,840
I've seen it all.

790
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,840
I can see the result of the experiment.

791
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,840
I've made a mark

792
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,840
with four colors.

793
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,840
This black circle doesn't change.

794
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,840
Give me the stick.

795
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,840
It's different from the other side.

796
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,840
It's different from the other side.

797
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,840
It's different from the other side.

798
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,840
It's the same as the other side.

799
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,840
How far did the horse go?

800
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,840
How is the state of the horse?

801
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,840
You guys know nothing.

802
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,840
Tell me.

803
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,840
And...

804
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,840
Don't cut my hair.

805
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,840
Don't cut my hair.

806
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:33,840
We hang a stick on the wall every day.

807
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,840
The experiment is for the next few days.

808
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,840
Everyone is happy.

809
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,840
Do you understand?

810
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,840
Yes.

811
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,840
Okay, we'll do it.

812
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,840
Okay.

813
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,840
Why is he coming?

814
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,840
Get up.

815
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,560
Come on, get up.

816
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,800
We're not here.

817
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,160
Let's go.

818
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,120
Congratulations, He Si Shi.

819
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,080
Congratulations, He Si Shi.

820
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,960
All of you, get up.

821
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,680
Congratulations, He Si Shi.

822
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,200
Mr. Li,

823
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,760
you've been in charge of the experiment today.

824
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,000
He Si Shi came here to take the job.

825
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,760
Mr. He,

826
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,000
you're not going to let me in?

827
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,680
Mr. Li,

828
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,440
you're so generous.

829
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,440
It's a big deal

830
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,560
to transfer your fortune to the government.

831
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,600
Of course,

832
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,680
it's also a big deal that I'm interested in.

833
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,320
Next time is now over.

834
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,520
Congratulations, He Si Shi.

835
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:52,960
What?

836
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,520
We're selling the fortune today.

837
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,160
This is not fair.

838
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,220
Let's call gifts.

839
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,580
For the wealth of the future generations.

840
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,540
I Balkan,

841
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,280
Taiwan,

842
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,600
Yo Tao Mao,

843
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:12,600
No one knows that Lin Nanji Chang'an is 5,000 miles away.

844
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,000
And Li Zhi is 3 days away.

845
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,600
How can we send him off?

846
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,800
Yes, yes.

847
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,600
Mr. Li, you have a way.

848
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:29,000
Mr. Li, you need to use our little East Gate to make a test.

849
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,800
Once the test is successful,

850
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,200
then our highland Li Zhi will be the world's best.

851
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:42,000
Good, good.

852
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Thank you for your support.

853
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I dare not delay.

854
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,200
I dare not let the emperor down.

855
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,800
Let us, the master of the test,

856
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,600
help master Li to make it.

857
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,000
Good, good.

858
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,600
Good, good.

859
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,600
Good, good.

860
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,600
Good, good.

861
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,600
Good, good.

862
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,600
Good.

863
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,200
Good, good.

864
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,000
Wait for me.

865
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,000
If I knew that you have always been lucrative,

866
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,200
I heard that you have even changed your names.

867
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,200
I was still young back then.

868
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,200
I was hit by a Soul-Bomb and got a punch.

869
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,200
That's why I got a problem.

870
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,200
You're really a Soul-Bomb.

871
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,200
But you lost to a White-Bomb.

872
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,200
This time, you'll take out the anger of the Soul-Bomb factory

873
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,200
and hit a person who's good at selling power,

874
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,200
who's good at selling people, who's good at selling people.

875
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,200
It's useless.

876
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,200
Do you understand?

877
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,200
The Chief said that

878
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,200
Fang Jie will be my first leader and leader.

879
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,200
I don't want to ride too hard.

880
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,200
They can say that I'm not good at fighting,

881
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:32,200
but I don't like to hear them think that I'm not good at riding.

882
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,200
They're all hypocrites.

883
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,200
Back then, your father had money.

884
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,200
He lost to you.

885
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,200
He was like your father's reward.

886
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,200
You're still young.

887
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,200
Think about it.

888
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,200
Did you win after you got the makeup?

889
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,200
If it wasn't for He Zi Shi who took care of your business,

890
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,200
would you have won today?

891
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,200
Think about it.

892
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,200
You always think about it.

893
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,200
From now on, you're He Zi Shi's useless.

894
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,200
Keep going.

895
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,200
Watch your step.

896
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,200
I'll help you.

897
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,200
Chief Li!

898
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,200
Help me!

899
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,200
Brother!

900
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,200
Go!

901
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,200
Brother Lan,

902
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,200
come with me and come to the road.

903
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,200
You mean I have to run behind you, right?

904
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,200
I mean, I'm familiar with the road.

905
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,200
If I can't see you when I get back,

906
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,200
you have to run yourself.

907
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,200
Brother Lan is a good man.

908
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,200
He thinks you're old and you don't have the strength to do it.

909
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,200
You're quite good.

910
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,200
I'm good.

911
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,200
Fine.

912
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,200
I'll go with Brother Lan later.

913
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,200
Chief Li.

914
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,200
Chief Li.

915
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,200
Chief Li.

916
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,200
If the fresh corn has reached Chang An,

917
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,200
if the Noble Consort had eaten the fresh corn,

918
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,200
she would say,

919
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,200
it's delicious.

920
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,200
She still wants to eat it.

921
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,200
She still has it?

922
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,200
Think about it.

923
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,200
What kind of business is this?

924
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,200
Do you know what kind of business it is?

925
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,200
What about the horse?

926
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,200
The horse is gone.

927
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,200
It's been half a day since the last time.

928
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,200
I've had a corn before.

929
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,200
How about a great meal?

930
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,200
How about a good meal?

931
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,200
The new new is coming.

932
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,200
I hope it can be a good meal.

933
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,200
As you said,

934
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,200
if it's just a good meal,

935
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,200
you can be angry.

936
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,200
Another thing you know is that you must be careful.

937
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,200
What do you know?

938
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,200
Be careful?

939
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,200
Why do you know that?

940
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,200
You must be careful.

941
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,200
The new new?

942
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,200
What's the problem?

943
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,200
The new new is coming.

944
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,200
The new new is coming.

945
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,200
You must be careful.

946
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,200
The new new is coming.

947
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,200
Full of new new.

948
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,200
Wonderful.

949
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,200
The new new is coming.

950
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,200
It's a good meal.

951
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,200
It's better than the new.

952
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,200
There are different new flavors.

953
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,200
You can choose.

954
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,200
Chief Li.

955
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,200
The new new is coming.

956
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,200
I want it all.

957
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,200
The new new is coming.

958
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,200
It's better than the new.

959
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,200
I'm afraid that Chang An

960
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,200
will never come back.

961
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,200
The new new is coming.

962
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,200
I'm in a dream on this road.

963
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:02,200
I can't hear the sound of my crazy voice.

964
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:07,200
I want to see the world of the red-and-white legend.

965
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,200
But I only see a man's heart.

966
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:16,200
A little bit, a little bit, a little bit.

967
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:20,200
We can't take it easy.

968
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,200
The new is coming.

969
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,200
You can be careful.

970
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,200
The new is coming.

971
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,200
I'm afraid that Chang An will not come back.

972
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,200
The new is coming.

973
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,200
I'm afraid that Chang An will not come back.

974
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:35,200
I want to see the world of the red-and-white legend.

975
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:40,200
But I only see a man's heart.

976
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:44,200
A little bit, a little bit, a little bit.

977
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,200
We can't take it easy.

978
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,200
We can't take it easy.
