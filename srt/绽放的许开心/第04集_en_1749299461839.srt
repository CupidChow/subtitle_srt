1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I see your pain as you're braying too

2
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Some things we cannot just embrace

3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And there's no time to guess the count of us

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Greater daylight, go to the free

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let's cross the wind, dancing ring Let the stars in the moon and night away

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh, this a piece of happiness

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
They are all bought off a journey

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Ooh, ooh, ooh

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Ooh, ooh, ooh

10
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You can eat with your mouth open

11
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The mouth is full of your eyes

12
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The mouth is full of your eyes

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Bikan K tra

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,460
Oh

15
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,000
Get here get here go

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I make so mad

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,340
All this from you

18
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,000
You going through this

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,720
but not the expense

20
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,000
How could you carry this much?

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I only bought myself one

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,500
and never crossed the payment

23
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,800
I just want to have a place to shop

24
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,800
just spent it

25
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,300
Don't get angry

26
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,000
None of this brings me work

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,300
I was just not here

28
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,800
I make good mood

29
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,800
I'm so hungry.

30
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,800
I'm so hungry.

31
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,800
I want to go to the toilet.

32
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,800
Go ahead. I'll go with you.

33
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,800
No, I'm not a child. I'll be back in a minute.

34
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,800
Okay, wait for you.

35
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,800
Okay.

36
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,800
Honey, you're so smart.

37
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,800
You're so smart.

38
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Mom, you're so smart.

39
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,800
So smart.

40
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,800
Look at you. You're so rich.

41
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,800
You're so smart.

42
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,800
Mom, you're so smart.

43
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,800
Money, money.

44
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,800
Honey, I'll make up for you later.

45
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,800
Mom, come here.

46
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,800
Wait a minute.

47
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,800
Talk to me if you need anything.

48
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,800
Hello, mom.

49
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,800
I just said that you must not be angry.

50
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,800
Mom, don't worry.

51
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,800
My dad treated me well this time.

52
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,800
He bought me a lot of things.

53
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,800
I paid for all the expenses I paid for the other main units.

54
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,800
My dad gave me all of them.

55
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,800
Uncle Tasha, let me call you back.

56
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,800
Mom, I'll call you back when I get home.

57
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,800
I won't tell you. I'm leaving.

58
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,800
Then stay safe.

59
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Don't play with him.

60
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,800
Xu Kaixi.

61
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,800
I'm not wrong.

62
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,800
I'm the daughter of the child.

63
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Boss.

64
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,800
I want to buy a fruit basket.

65
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,800
Yes, yes.

66
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,800
I'll get some apples and fruits.

67
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,800
And some fruits.

68
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,800
I'll get some fruits that are a little expensive.

69
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Anyway, this is my family.

70
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,800
Okay, okay.

71
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,800
You wait here, okay?

72
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,800
I'll get them for you.

73
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,800
Okay.

74
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,800
I'll get the fruit.

75
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,800
I'll get the fruit.

76
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,800
It's not appropriate to be 7 or 8 years old.

77
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,800
This is for me.

78
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,800
Xu Kaixi,

79
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,800
when will I buy it for you?

80
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,800
I'll get it for you.

81
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,800
I don't care.

82
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,800
I'll get it for you.

83
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
You can eat it.

84
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,800
Okay.

85
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,800
I want to eat apples.

86
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,800
I'm sorry.

87
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,800
I'm sorry.

88
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,800
I'm sorry.

89
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,800
Why are you so common with girls?

90
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,800
I don't have any ideas.

91
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,800
Where is she?

92
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,800
She looks so pretty.

93
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800
I'm not pretty.

94
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,800
Wang Wang, be careful.

95
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
Your mission is

96
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,800
to find the leader's shoes.

97
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,800
If you find it,

98
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,800
you can reward her.

99
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,800
Now, the leader is announced.

100
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,800
Wang Wang team,

101
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,800
go.

102
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,800
Did you find it?

103
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,800
No.

104
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,800
Hurry up.

105
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,800
Go.

106
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,800
I found it.

107
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,800
Take it out.

108
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,800
You're so good.

109
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,800
I'm just taking a break.

110
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,800
I don't know.

111
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,800
I almost got a heart attack

112
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,800
for these two groups.

113
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,800
Who is he?

114
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,800
He ran to the next building

115
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,800
to take the child.

116
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,800
He's so lazy.

117
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,800
He's so lazy.

118
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,800
Think about it.

119
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,800
There are three big family members

120
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,800
in our family.

121
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,800
They don't have any motive

122
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,800
except for breaking up.

123
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,800
I remember

124
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,800
Yu'an and Yu Le

125
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,800
and Yu'an and her sister.

126
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,800
They are good.

127
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,800
They are good.

128
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,800
Besides,

129
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
Mei Chen and Yi Xiang are going to get married.

130
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,800
We don't know

131
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,800
what they are doing.

132
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,800
Will they

133
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,800
have a baby like us?

134
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,800
What if they are a little bit ashamed?

135
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,800
I don't have to be more impulsive.

136
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,800
You're so mean.

137
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,800
You two are so sweet.

138
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,800
You are so good.

139
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,800
You have a lot of children.

140
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,800
You're afraid of them.

141
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,800
That's not true.

142
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,800
It's high.

143
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,800
It's a big trouble.

144
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,800
Oh, my.

145
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,800
You're so lucky.

146
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,800
You're old. You're wrong.

147
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Why are you unhappy?

148
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,800
You're wrong.

149
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,800
Hello.

150
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,800
What are you doing here?

151
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,800
I'm here to see the grandchild.

152
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,800
Are you here to take the child?

153
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,800
We have the surveillance here.

154
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,800
No way.

155
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,800
How could I take it?

156
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,800
We are all bad people.

157
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,800
I'm here to see

158
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,800
the little rice.

159
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,800
Look.

160
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,800
Look.

161
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,800
The rice I bought for you.

162
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,800
The rice you like the most.

163
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,800
What's wrong with you?

164
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,800
Why don't you know me?

165
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
I don't love you.

166
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,800
You're so mean.

167
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,800
You're the one I love the most.

168
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,800
You're my life.

169
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
I know.

170
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,800
I never give you a raise.

171
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,800
I'm your mother.

172
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,800
You don't love me.

173
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,800
There's no such thing.

174
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
I want to give you a big one.

175
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,800
A big one.

176
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,800
A big one.

177
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,800
What do you think?

178
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,800
We're going to the house.

179
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,800
I need to clean up.

180
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,800
Don't touch you.

181
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,800
Come on.

182
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,800
Yanyan.

183
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,800
Get up.

184
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,800
Yanyan.

185
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,800
Get up.

186
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,800
What's wrong with the house?

187
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,800
I don't know why I came out.

188
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,800
I can't wash my face.

189
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,800
Get up.

190
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,800
What are you doing?

191
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,800
You're tired of looking for the child?

192
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,800
You have a grudge against Yanyan?

193
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,800
What's wrong with the lazy girl?

194
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,800
What are you doing?

195
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,800
You're the one who's blaming her.

196
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,800
What's wrong with her?

197
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,800
She's mad at you.

198
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,800
She's mad at you?

199
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,800
Who's the one who's been with her for more than 20 years?

200
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,800
She doesn't work.

201
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,800
She doesn't work every day.

202
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,800
Why don't you work?

203
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,800
She's the senior manager of the house.

204
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,800
She's the senior manager of the house.

205
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,800
Do you understand?

206
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,800
I'm just a boss.

207
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,800
Who needs a manager?

208
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,800
She's the senior manager.

209
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,800
Besides, even if you want to get a job,

210
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,800
you have to work hard.

211
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,800
I'm not asking for a rent.

212
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,800
You can't afford to pay for it.

213
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,800
I'm not asking for anything.

214
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,800
She's the one who's been with me.

215
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,800
If you want to do something,

216
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,800
you can pay for it.

217
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,800
Find a reason to pay for it.

218
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,800
I'm willing to do it.

219
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,800
You have to help me.

220
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,800
You're a good person.

221
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,800
I'm telling you the truth.

222
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,800
You're not coming with me.

223
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,800
Shut up.

224
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,800
You'll regret it one day.

225
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,800
Are you satisfied?

226
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,800
Yes.

227
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,800
I'm happy.

228
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,800
Hello, uncle.

229
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,800
Okay.

230
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,800
What's up?

231
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,800
Uncle wants us to go to his house for dinner.

232
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,800
Go. Go with uncle.

233
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,800
I'll go with uncle.

234
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,800
Well,

235
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,800
I have something to do this year.

236
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,800
You go back to your mother's house, okay?

237
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,800
When I'm done with my work,

238
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,800
I promise to come back anytime.

239
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,800
Okay.

240
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,800
How about this?

241
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,800
500 yuan.

242
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,800
It's the gift from your father.

243
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,800
It's a gift from Ling Hua.

244
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,800
Take good care of it.

245
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,800
Okay.

246
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,800
Can you have your own room?

247
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,800
I don't want to sleep on sofa.

248
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,800
Of course.

249
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,800
I promise.

250
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,800
I'll arrange it.

251
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,800
Okay.

252
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,800
Here, put it in the freezer.

253
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,800
Let's go.

254
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,800
Sister Yu, you're back.

255
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,800
Sister Li, what's wrong?

256
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,800
His mother came.

257
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,800
Why did he come?

258
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,800
He didn't take Xiao Mi away.

259
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,800
I only went to see him.

260
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,800
Mom, I'm in the car.

261
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,800
No, no, no.

262
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,800
Don't come out.

263
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,800
I'll wipe it for you.

264
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,800
It's okay.

265
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,800
Here.

266
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,800
Enjoy.

267
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,800
Honey, thank you for the cake.

268
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,800
You're here for a set of

269
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,800
a set of 6,000 yuan.

270
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,800
We bought a pair of clothes, a play具,

271
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,800
and a toy.

272
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,800
They cost 5000 yuan.

273
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,800
Honey, you gave them 500 yuan.

274
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,800
We'll take the money back.

275
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,800
You have to take it as a loan.

276
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,800
How can I?

277
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,800
It's not that expensive.

278
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,800
It's only a year.

279
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
You can't take it twice.

280
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,800
Here, give it to me.

281
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,800
This time, this time, this time.

282
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,800
Next time, next time.

283
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,800
If you give them the money

284
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,800
from my uncle,

285
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,800
we can't live on.

286
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,800
No, I'm not stupid.

287
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,800
I'll give them a chance.

288
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,800
I promise.

289
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,800
You're stupid.

290
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,800
You and your mother are going crazy.

291
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,800
You're being bullied by them.

292
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,800
Honey,

293
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,800
you're just like him.

294
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,800
We're just like the big kids

295
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,800
who died because of you.

296
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,800
Xue Meiya.

297
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,800
If they really come back,

298
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,800
I'll be the one to live.

299
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,800
It's okay.

300
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,800
Why are you getting mad again?

301
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,800
Yes, you're not looking good.

302
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,800
Right?

303
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,800
Don't worry.

304
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,800
Congratulations on your first place.

305
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,800
Okay?

306
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,800
Next time, I'll go to your uncle's house.

307
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,800
This one.

308
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,800
I can't get out.

309
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,800
You're not done yet, right?

310
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,800
You didn't stand on his side

311
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,800
when you were being bullied by me.

312
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,800
I'll be the second.

313
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,800
I'll be the second.

314
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,800
I'll be the second.

315
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,800
The second place is good.

316
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,800
I'll be the second

317
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,800
as long as I don't fall down.

318
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,800
High five.

319
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,800
I'm scared.

320
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,800
I'm scared.

321
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,800
How is it?

322
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,800
It's good.

323
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,800
It's good.

324
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,800
I'm still scared.

325
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,800
Your dear is going to pay you small initials to pay off your debt...

326
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:42,800
all of his debts from his mother's family and grandfather's.

327
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,800
My dinheiro is getting packed.

328
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,800
You shouldn't have brought a dime to my house for me.

329
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,800
Don'tgi.

330
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,800
You're making my money with a sugar tax?

331
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,800
Change it first if you're not damn wealthy.

332
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,800
Why are you here?

333
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,800
I'm done talking.

334
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,800
It's good to talk.

335
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,800
Then I'll change.

336
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,800
Miss Xu, come and have a look.

337
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,800
Did you see that in my bag that day?

338
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,800
Then you told this wedding worker, right?

339
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,800
We are good friends.

340
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,800
This is my best friend.

341
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,800
I'll share it with you between the two.

342
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,800
Oh, secret.

343
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,800
Take a look.

344
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,800
This is the product solution.

345
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,800
My work is very well done in the details of the product.

346
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,800
I'm the head of the shop.

347
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,800
These products are the products that are on sale at the end of the day.

348
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,800
I especially talked to those companies

349
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,800
and took these products with me to deliver them.

350
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,800
You were so weird that day.

351
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,800
I thought I should explain to you.

352
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,800
You said you didn't want it.

353
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,800
You said I was the king of the sea and I was the boss.

354
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,800
Then this worker thought it was your destiny.

355
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,800
He treated me like a fool.

356
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,800
Since you know it's my fault, you still want to go.

357
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,800
Then you can't count as a wedding worker.

358
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,800
This solution is really like a punishment.

359
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,800
It's too much.

360
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,800
Too much.

361
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,800
What are you doing?

362
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,800
Mr. Wei,

363
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,800
I didn't investigate this matter clearly.

364
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,800
I'm really sorry to you.

365
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,800
If someone makes a big mistake on this matter,

366
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,800
I can explain it to you.

367
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,800
How about I ask you to eat something?

368
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,800
Or I'll compensate for your mental loss.

369
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,800
Anyway, this matter,

370
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,800
how do you feel happy about this matter?

371
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,800
How do we solve it?

372
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,800
Okay?

373
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,800
I don't need anything.

374
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,800
I just need you two to stay away from me.

375
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,800
Don't come to each other.

376
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,800
I came here today.

377
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,800
I don't want to be caught up in the trap.

378
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,800
Do you understand?

379
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,800
You're here.

380
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,800
Xu Kexin.

381
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,800
You're the one who lost your memory.

382
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,800
Didn't you lose your memory with you?

383
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,800
I...

384
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,800
I can't believe I can give it to someone like you.

385
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,800
I'll do it for you.

386
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,800
In the morning,

387
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:42,800
your daughter's son has been taking all the money from your daughter.

388
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,800
You're a cute child.

389
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,800
I'm also a mother.

390
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,800
Who can be the one to take care of this kind of woman?

391
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,800
I hope this life will be full of you.

392
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,800
Come on, Xiaojiao.

393
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,800
Have some fresh food.

394
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,800
Your auntie is already so busy in the morning.

395
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,800
She said she missed Xiaojiao.

396
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,800
She asked me to teach you to come and eat.

397
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,800
In your auntie's heart,

398
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,800
Xiaojiao is our lucky guy.

399
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,800
Uncle, I'll toast you.

400
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,800
Xiaojiao is thin.

401
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,800
Uncle, I'm losing weight.

402
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,800
Hurry up and toast you.

403
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,800
Uncle.

404
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,800
You're always making me laugh.

405
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,800
Uncle, you're joking.

406
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,800
Xiaojiao is our family's treasure.

407
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,800
We're not even a child.

408
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,800
Qianhao,

409
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,800
we're all from the south.

410
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,800
I'm afraid I'll have to look for you

411
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,800
for the rest of my life.

412
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,800
Just remember one thing.

413
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,800
We have no children.

414
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,800
Xiaojiao's parents are often working abroad.

415
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,800
They say Xiaojiao is our lucky guy.

416
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,800
If she's a daughter,

417
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,800
she won't be a daughter.

418
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,800
If she doesn't feel happy,

419
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,800
I won't be happy.

420
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,800
I understand, uncle.

421
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,800
Don't worry.

422
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,800
I'll treat you well.

423
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,800
I'll be fine.

424
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,800
I'm doing well, uncle.

425
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,800
Don't worry.

426
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,800
Don't be so careless, uncle.

427
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,800
Hurry up and eat.

428
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,800
Don't be so serious.

429
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,800
Hurry up and eat.

430
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,800
It's so delicious.

431
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,800
Go ahead.

432
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,800
Come on, let's take a picture.

433
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,800
Don't bother him.

434
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,800
You can eat it yourself.

435
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,800
You can eat it.

436
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,800
I'll eat it all.

437
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,800
Now the sky suddenly falls.

438
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,800
I'm in a bad mood.

439
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,800
Who's the one who has to do the iron attack?

440
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,800
Do you think we can use the money of the rich?

441
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,800
The rich have so many bad ideas.

442
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,800
I'm afraid it's a conspiracy.

443
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,800
Use? Why not?

444
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,800
The rice and rice are originally the children of the rich.

445
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,800
They are rich and have a lot of money.

446
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,800
According to the court, every month, two thousand, one year, four thousand and eight thousand.

447
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,800
We have been divorced for almost four years.

448
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,800
These are not enough.

449
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,800
Besides, when we divorced,

450
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,800
he transferred a property and took away the house.

451
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,800
I'm going to settle these debts with him.

452
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,800
One for one.

453
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,800
Since it's paid for the raise,

454
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,800
it's also right to think about the children's actions.

455
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,800
Besides, there are several people in this world who love these two children.

456
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,800
It's always good.

457
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,800
Hi!

458
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,800
쓰는

459
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,800
Hey, brother-in-law!

460
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,800
What's wrong?

461
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,800
Where's my parents?

462
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,800
The house is almost demolished.

463
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,800
My parents have been to the park.

464
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,800
Something's wrong.

465
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,800
What's wrong?

466
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,800
Did you fight with your dad again?

467
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,800
My dad is right.

468
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,800
I'm a useless person.

469
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,800
What kind of housekeeper?

470
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,800
I'm the excuse I'm looking for.

471
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,800
If I go out for a movie,

472
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,800
I'm afraid my parents won't be able to see me.

473
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,800
I won't let you do that.

474
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,800
You really have to go out for a walk.

475
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,800
You can't be alone with this society.

476
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,800
You come back from abroad.

477
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,800
You have a lot of experience.

478
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,800
You have a high score.

479
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,800
It's not hard for you to get back into the society.

480
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,800
Do you know why I became like this?

481
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,800
Because of you.

482
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,800
How did you know?

483
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,800
I came here like this.

484
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,800
I met you when I was 19.

485
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,800
I met you when I was 19.

486
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,800
It's been 16 years.

487
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,800
Your sister is like a tree.

488
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,800
So gentle.

489
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,800
So powerful.

490
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:53,800
You know we're very close.

491
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,800
Suddenly,

492
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,800
I can't get out.

493
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,800
Besides, there's also entertainment.

494
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,800
No matter what, I have to stand up.

495
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,800
You're right.

496
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,800
My sister

497
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,800
has always been like a light.

498
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,800
She seems to be always working hard.

499
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,800
She's working hard to get love.

500
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,800
Although my parents have always liked my sister,

501
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,800
I never get jealous.

502
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,800
Because I know

503
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,800
she loves me.

504
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,800
I just don't understand

505
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,800
why the people who work hard to live are like this?

506
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,800
What's the point of my hard work?

507
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,800
People are going to die anyway.

508
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,800
I'd rather do something than do something.

509
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,800
Don't make yourself feel wronged.

510
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,800
You're a different person.

511
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,800
Since you're going to die,

512
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,800
why don't you do something you want to do?

513
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,800
I don't know what I like.

514
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,800
I want to do something.

515
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,800
Then you can find it.

516
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,800
At least you have to go out first.

517
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,800
Your sister is your sister.

518
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,800
If you really want to see her,

519
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,800
you can go out and look for her.

520
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,800
Go and see where she used to like.

521
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,800
Isn't that great?

522
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,800
Don't be sad.

523
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,800
Look at her.

524
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,800
She's nice to us.

525
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,800
She's just a knife-tongued heart.

526
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,800
Her mouth is sharp.

527
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,800
If you say that,

528
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,800
you'll be in trouble.

529
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,800
We have to thank my uncle.

530
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,800
Are you happy?

531
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,800
I'm waiting for you here.

532
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,800
What are you doing?

533
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,800
I'm going to my mom's place.

534
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,800
Then I'll go with you.

535
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,800
No, no, no.

536
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,800
My mom won't talk.

537
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,800
If she's making you feel bad,

538
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,800
I can't make you feel bad.

539
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,800
Qianhao!

540
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
Qianhao, don't kill me!

541
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,800
I won't give you a single penny.

542
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,800
Brother-in-law,

543
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,800
did my parents ask you to bring your girlfriend

544
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,800
to dinner on weekends?

545
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,800
They said it was on weekends.

546
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,800
Don't worry.

547
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,800
I've arranged it.

548
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,800
I've found a friend who's learning to perform.

549
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,800
Help me drive.

550
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,800
It's free.

551
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,800
It's not that simple.

552
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,800
Your date was taken by my dad's colleague.

553
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,800
If you don't want to show up,

554
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,800
you can only find that woman that day.

555
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,800
What?

556
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,800
That woman?

557
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,800
She's in the drama.

558
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,800
Mom, you're back.

559
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,800
You sleep.

560
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,800
You're at home.

561
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,800
Didn't you say you'd stay with me for a few days?

562
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,800
My dad said he had two things to do.

563
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,800
He told me to come back and hang out.

564
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,800
Mom, I'm not lying.

565
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,800
I've checked the card and the gift.

566
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,800
I can't find a better one.

567
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,800
Okay, I'll go and talk to you.

568
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,800
Dad, Mom, you don't have to help me.

569
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,800
We're going to help you.

570
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,800
You two,

571
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,800
let's go.

572
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,800
I've got clothes for you.

573
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,800
Here, you.

574
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,800
Come on, Dad.

575
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,800
I'll help you get it.

576
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,800
Look at these two beautiful girls.

577
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,800
You're just playing with your grandpa's wife.

578
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,800
You're just like your dad.

579
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,800
You're like two little white rabbits.

580
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,800
You can't even work.

581
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,800
You're so smart.

582
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,800
Jingrong, don't be so loud.

583
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,800
Look, we just found an excuse.

584
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,800
You said he's out of work.

585
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,800
He's sick.

586
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,800
Just get rid of him.

587
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,800
It's no use.

588
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,800
He's your real sister.

589
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,800
You don't know him?

590
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,800
You can hide from Chu Yi and 15.

591
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,800
He should have known about this sooner.

592
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,800
He's going to get a new one.

593
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,800
We have to make it together.

594
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,800
Then there's a way.

595
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,800
You can get the girl's WeChat back.

596
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,800
You can ask her for help.

597
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,800
Let's go.

598
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,800
Have some water.

599
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,800
Okay.

600
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,800
Here, have some water.

601
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,800
First, it's comfortable.

602
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,800
I bought it for you.

603
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,800
Didn't you say you'd go back with your dad?

604
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,800
Mom, you're not stupid.

605
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,800
You're a new father and a father-in-law.

606
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,800
You're not talking about your husband in the mall.

607
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,800
Aunt Hu Xiaoxiao is my dad's wife.

608
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,800
You can't bully her.

609
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,800
You should have a life.

610
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,800
Money is important.

611
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,800
But as a person...

612
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,800
Ask again.

613
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,800
Do you still have to live?

614
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,800
I don't know.

615
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,800
Come back.

616
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,800
You're so suspicious.

617
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,800
You want to be your brother?

618
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,800
No, I have to worry about the whole family.

619
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,800
My brother is smarter than you.

620
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,800
He's a little bit smart.

621
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,800
He's a good boy.

622
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,800
You're really a good boy.

623
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,800
You're so full of food every day.

624
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,800
Mom.

625
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,800
I think it's a little bit of a coincidence.

626
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,800
What's wrong?

627
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,800
I think it's right.

628
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,800
But it's not over yet.

629
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,800
It's over $10,000.

630
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,800
If he's really going to spend another year

631
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,800
to get some family,

632
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,800
he'll have to spend all the money.

633
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,800
He's not a good boy.

634
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,800
He can't bear the child.

635
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,800
He's jealous of your father.

636
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,800
You know,

637
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,800
Xu KaiXin is a big and foolish girl.

638
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,800
Otherwise,

639
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,800
you wouldn't have been so miserable.

640
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,800
I...

641
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,800
Xu KaiXin, I'm not worried.

642
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,800
But don't forget.

643
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,800
He's keeping the money from our old family.

644
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,800
It's a little bit of a surprise.

645
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,800
I'm a little bit confused.

646
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,800
It's not easy.

647
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,800
That's right.

648
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,800
It means we're smart, right?

649
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,800
We'll spend some money for our grandchild.

650
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,800
That's the best thing about the world.

651
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,800
What else?

652
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,800
You know,

653
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,800
I can still live for a few days.

654
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,800
Money is all about the outside world.

655
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,800
Right?

656
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,800
I'm thinking,

657
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,800
how can money be spent on you?

658
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,800
It's not like that.

659
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,800
We need to change the way we spend it.

660
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,800
We're not going to be a fool.

661
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,800
We'll have to pay more than $1,000

662
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,800
before the child's recovery.

663
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,800
Otherwise,

664
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,800
I'll go and talk to Xu KaiXin.

665
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,800
He can't afford it.

666
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,800
He can give us the money.

667
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,800
It's useless.

668
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,800
I know Xu KaiXin best.

669
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,800
If we really have to solve the problem in the future,

670
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,800
it's fine to give him the half-dead house.

671
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,800
But women...

672
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,800
They're like a general.

673
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,800
They're like a king.

674
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,800
If we're not a fool,

675
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,800
we'll have to think about other things.

676
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,800
I have to make him feel

677
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,800
that it's too much pressure to have a child alone.

678
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,800
I have to make him pay

679
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,800
for the money he's spent on the house.

680
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,800
Fine. I'll listen to you.

681
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,800
As long as you can bring Xiao Mi here,

682
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,800
I'll listen to you.

683
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,800
Here.

684
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,800
Take a look.

685
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,800
$560,000.

686
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,800
So much money.

687
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,800
I was going to work hard this year.

688
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,800
I could make $400,000 or $500,000.

689
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,800
I didn't expect that

690
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,800
the two of us would be so rich.

691
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,800
We can't be so stupid.

692
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,800
When we were in the spring,

693
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,800
the house in the cake shop was a joke.

694
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,800
And the house in our house...

695
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,800
You know,

696
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,800
I used to buy a car

697
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,800
and pay for the house.

698
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,800
What's wrong with you?

699
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,800
What are you doing?

700
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,800
$300,000.

701
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,800
$300,000?

702
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,800
I'm not a young lady.

703
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,800
When did you spend so much money?

704
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,800
I've grown up.

705
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,800
And you've been in the cake shop for two years.

706
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,800
I've got less money.

707
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,800
And I have these old things.

708
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,800
So, we have $800,000.

709
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,800
I feel like I'm a rich man.

710
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,800
I feel like a rich man.

711
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,800
I'm rich.

712
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,800
How can I use these money?

713
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,800
I bought a house.

714
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,800
Although it's not much,

715
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,800
I can't afford to buy a small house.

716
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,800
No.

717
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,800
That lady said she wanted to buy a car.

718
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,800
So, I don't need to buy a car.

719
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,800
I think it makes sense.

720
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,800
And I can take you out to play when it's weekend.

721
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,800
The house is not as good as we live.

722
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,800
We can have a little bit of a break.

723
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,800
Oh, my God.

724
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,800
What's wrong with me today?

725
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,800
I feel like I'm flying.

726
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,800
And then...

727
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,800
I'm flying.

728
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,800
Soon, the little Jiang Mianren

729
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,800
ran to the end of the road.

730
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,800
And he kept running.

731
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,800
He ran over the road.

732
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,800
It smelled so good.

733
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,800
Don't run. Come back.

734
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,800
The little Jiang Mianren

735
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,800
turned around and laughed.

736
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,800
Run, run.

737
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,800
Run fast.

738
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,800
I can't chase after you.

739
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,800
The little Jiang Mianren

740
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,800
flew to the end.

741
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,800
Who said he couldn't go far?

742
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:21,800
There are just a few

743
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,800
few hopes.

744
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,800
There are just a few hopes.

745
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,800
The new full moon is still new.

746
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,800
It's hard to come

747
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,800
to the end of the moon.

748
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,800
You're the one.

749
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,800
You're the one.

750
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,800
You're the one.

751
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,800
Bye.

752
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,800
Bye.

753
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:14,800
I'm going to exchange the things that I have.

754
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,800
The wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild

755
00:35:44,800 --> 00:36:14,800
wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild wild

756
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,720
And it's small.

757
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:31,640
in many places.

758
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:39,720
난

759
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,720
The rich family partner

760
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,720
Family partner

761
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,720
Family partner is still the same

762
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:04,920
Aunt

763
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,720
I'm sleeping here today, why don't you go back

764
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,120
What's wrong? Did you have a fight with Hu Xiaojiao?

765
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,120
No, I just want to be alone

766
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:14,920
OK

767
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,120
That Hu Xiaojiao asked you

768
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,520
You said you were not feeling well

769
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,120
I'm here with you, don't talk about it

770
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,320
He dare to ask me

771
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,120
He wants to ask me

772
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,920
My son is waiting for you

773
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,120
My son went to find other little demons

774
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,920
That's not necessary

775
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,720
Think about it

776
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,720
I'm not going to go back to the house

777
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,720
I'm going to go back to the house

778
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,720
I'm going to go back to the house

779
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,720
I'm going to go back to the house

780
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,720
I'm going to go back to the house

781
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,720
I'm going to go back to the house

782
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,720
I'm going to go back to the house

783
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,720
I'm going to go back to the house

784
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,720
I'm going to go back to the house

785
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,720
I'm going to go back to the house

786
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,720
I'm going to go back to the house

787
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,720
I'm going to go back to the house

788
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,720
I'm going to go back to the house

789
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,720
I'm going to go back to the house

790
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,720
I'm going to go back to the house

791
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,720
What's wrong?

792
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,720
Don't be angry

793
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,720
I want to go back to the house and see the phoenix

794
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,720
Hello

795
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,720
Hello

796
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,720
Hello

797
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,720
Where are you?

798
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,720
I miss you

799
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:25,720
My mom is not feeling well today

800
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,720
I'll stay with her for a night

801
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,720
I'll go back tomorrow

802
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,720
What do you mean?

803
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,720
What do you mean?

804
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,720
I'm not feeling well

805
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,720
I'm not feeling well

806
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,720
I'll stay with my son for a night

807
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,720
What do you mean?

808
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,720
Your daughter came

809
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,720
She asked you to stay with her

810
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,720
Your mom is not feeling well

811
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,720
You stay with your mom for a night

812
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,720
You'll stay with your mom for a night

813
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,720
You'll stay with your dad for a night

814
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,720
What do you mean?

815
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,720
I'll stay with anyone

816
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,720
Right?

817
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,720
I told you

818
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,720
I just want to stay with you

819
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,720
I just want to stay with you

820
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,720
I'm really annoyed

821
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,720
Dad

822
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,720
We are just a liar

823
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,720
You are the one who said

824
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,720
I'm better than you

825
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,720
But you lied to me

826
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,720
You'll get sick if you have a disease

827
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,720
Why are you blowing with me today?

828
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,720
Fine, I don't want to teach you

829
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,720
I'll let you get a beating

830
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,720
I'll write my name

831
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,720
Your name?

832
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,720
Where?

833
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,720
I don't know

834
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,720
I'm so sorry

835
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,720
Good morning

836
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,720
Why are you here?

837
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,720
Where are you going tonight?

838
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,720
I'm going to call my girlfriend

839
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,720
Who told you to leave me alone?

840
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,720
Don't change the topic

841
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,720
Go to the bathroom

842
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,720
I'm going to call my girlfriend

843
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,720
I'm going to call my girlfriend

844
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,720
Don't change the topic

845
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,720
Where are you going?

846
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,720
I'm going to find someone else

847
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,720
I'm going to call my girlfriend

848
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,720
You are sick again

849
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,720
You can't do this

850
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,720
I called you all night

851
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,720
I'm not in the service area

852
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,720
I didn't sleep all night

853
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,720
Do you know how anxious I am?

854
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,720
I'm in a bad mood

855
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,720
I went to drink with Kai

856
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,720
You didn't have his phone

857
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,720
I don't want to go home

858
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,720
I'm so tired

859
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,720
I'm all alone

860
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,720
I don't have a place to go

861
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,720
I can only watch a movie

862
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,720
I went to bed

863
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,720
Husband, do you know how I woke up this morning?

864
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,720
I woke up because of the staff

865
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,720
I was sitting on the hard stool

866
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,720
I slept all night

867
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,720
My neck hurts

868
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,720
My waist hurts

869
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,720
I can't breathe

870
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,720
My heart hurts

871
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,720
I told you

872
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,720
No matter what you do

873
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,720
You have to find me

874
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,720
Do you know?

875
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,720
I'm so anxious

876
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,720
If you are angry

877
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,720
I can't find you

878
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,720
Try again

879
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,720
I'm going to bed

880
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,720
I'm going to sleep

881
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,720
Go

882
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,720
Husband

883
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,720
Do you want to go with me?

884
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,720
I'll make breakfast for you

885
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,720
I'm so tired

886
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,720
I can't sleep

887
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,720
I'm so tired

888
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,720
I can't sleep

889
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,720
I'm so anxious

890
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,720
I can't breathe

891
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,720
I'm so anxious

892
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,720
I can't breathe

893
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,720
I'm so anxious

894
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,720
I can't breathe

895
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,720
I'm so anxious

896
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,720
I can't breathe

897
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,720
I'm so anxious

898
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,720
I can't breathe

899
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,720
A memory

900
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:09,720
A passing of time

901
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:13,720
I'm always half-hearted

902
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:17,720
Half-happy

903
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,720
Who said

904
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:25,720
I'm not the one who's been bullied

905
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,720
Who said

906
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:31,720
I'm not the one who's been bullied

907
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:35,720
Who's story

908
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:39,720
Can be heard

909
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,720
How can I be half-hearted

910
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:47,720
Half-happy

911
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,720
At that time

912
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:55,720
How many times did I walk

913
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,720
And the ice melted

914
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:01,720
How many days have I been through

915
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,720
And the lightning

916
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:07,720
The time has come

917
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:11,720
To be a person

918
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:15,720
Until everything is clear

919
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:19,720
And then I'm heartbroken

920
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:23,720
If I'm brave and not afraid

921
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:27,720
I'll be broken

922
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:31,720
I'm not afraid

923
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,720
I'm sorry

924
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:37,720
The time is gone

925
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:41,720
I'm not the one who's been bullied

926
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,720
Half-happy

927
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:47,720
I'm always half-hearted

928
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:51,720
Half-happy

929
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,720
Half-happy
