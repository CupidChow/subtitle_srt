1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I see your pen as your bray-ray too

2
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Some things we cannot just embrace

3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And there's no time to guess the ground above

4
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Create a daylight, go to the free

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let's cross the wind, dancing rain, let it start to rule my night away

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,520
Oh disaorders happiness Disney or Buddha, on journey

7
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:49,500
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

8
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I told you not to let them see it.

9
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What time is it?

10
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Why hasn't your brother-in-law come back yet?

11
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Home work.

12
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's getting late.

13
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Listen to me.

14
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
If your father comes to our house to eat with an aunt tomorrow,

15
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
will you be happy?

16
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yes!

17
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Happy?

18
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
This is even more happy.

19
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What do you like about Yu-an?

20
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I like the shrimp and the shrimp soup.

21
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Wrong!

22
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I like the shrimp soup and the shrimp soup.

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I sent you the information and you saw it.

24
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You sent me the information and you got the wrong idea.

25
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You sent me the information secretly.

26
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I got the wrong idea.

27
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I have to get 90% of the information.

28
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm so close to you.

29
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Do you want to know who this aunt is?

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Of course I know. She's my girlfriend.

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I know.

32
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Do you know that if they are going to be together,

33
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
they will be your stepmother?

34
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You forgot it.

35
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
When you were little, your grandpa told you about the story.

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Who wanted to harm the white blood?

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The Queen of Hongma.

38
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yes.

39
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Who wanted to harm the girl?

40
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's also the Queen of Hongma.

41
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Of course. You are not afraid.

42
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So, we three will be together tomorrow.

43
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Let my dad bring me back to this aunt.

44
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I dare to be your Queen of Hongma.

45
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Then why can aunt be my Queen of Hongma?

46
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Dad, is there a girl in this house?

47
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Help me.

48
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You have to go to your room to eat.

49
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Don't bother about our situation.

50
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's our business.

51
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You told the kid that there is a girl.

52
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Aunt is mom's little sister.

53
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So, even if she is your stepmother,

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
she will treat you well.

55
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Tomorrow, we will play together.

56
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Come on.

57
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
We will play the game.

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Let her dare not come up here.

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Okay?

60
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Play the game.

61
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Play the game.

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Come on.

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Okay.

64
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Brother-in-law, I can only help you here.

65
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Okay. I will eat.

66
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Thank you.

67
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Wait a minute.

68
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Sit down.

69
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
What do you mean?

70
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You are so polite.

71
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You are more obedient than a singing.

72
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Your family's business is too high.

73
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Only three.

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I have no big business.

75
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I can't afford to pay.

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Don't be modest.

77
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
We know each other better.

78
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I know your business.

79
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Yu'an and Le are good kids.

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I will talk to her tonight.

81
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Besides, we are not real lovers.

82
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You are done with your business.

83
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You can have six of them.

84
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What will you do next time?

85
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
We can have a good time.

86
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Maybe I will find a boyfriend.

87
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
They won't be laughing at me.

88
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The most important thing is to stop them from thinking about Yang Yongku.

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You just explain it to him.

90
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
He won't talk about Yang Yongku.

91
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Why don't you know my father-in-law?

92
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Have you seen the love story of Xiangzhu?

93
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yes.

94
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
That's my favorite.

95
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I always thought that the movie was a drama.

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's written by his original voice.

97
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
That's the character.

98
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's the character.

99
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Forget it.

100
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
No matter who it is,

101
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
the character's character is his table and the character's strength.

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You know what?

103
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It seems that you are a good person.

104
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What do you mean?

105
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
People say that the marriage is like a fire pit.

106
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You can put two of them in this one pit.

107
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It means that he will recognize you.

108
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I beg you.

109
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Please put me in this pit.

110
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Please put me in it.

111
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Come on.

112
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I beg you.

113
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Our main theme this time is to be right with the stepmother.

114
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The point is that

115
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
if he likes it,

116
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
you all don't like it.

117
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
He doesn't like it.

118
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You all have to do it.

119
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Do you understand?

120
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Okay.

121
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
The grandpa will make you a show.

122
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
He will tell you the truth.

123
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
He wants to be quiet.

124
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Then we will jump and shout.

125
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
That's right.

126
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
If he wants to be with dad,

127
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
then we will not give him a chance to marry.

128
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
He is so smart.

129
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Okay.

130
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Give me a thumbs up.

131
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Let's do it again.

132
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Suppose he wants to eat some food on the table.

133
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Then we will eat that food.

134
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
We won't give him a chance to eat it.

135
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
That's great.

136
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Okay.

137
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The grandpa will announce that we have a small team.

138
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Victory.

139
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Victory.

140
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I will call you tomorrow.

141
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
If you call him in front of the old man,

142
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
he will feel sorry for you.

143
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You are so sorry for him.

144
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
For him,

145
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
that's the chance to eat some food.

146
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I will call you tomorrow.

147
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Okay.

148
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Don't go that way.

149
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's going to fall.

150
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You have to get used to it.

151
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
We are lovers.

152
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
If you do this,

153
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
you will be exposed to the sun.

154
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Eyes.

155
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Eyes.

156
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
God,

157
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
why are the men so cute?

158
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Xu Kexin.

159
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
God has sent such a good man to you.

160
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Can you say it in your hand?

161
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Xu Kexin,

162
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
even though he looks like a man,

163
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
he is still so cute.

164
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
He is so cute.

165
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Xu Kexin,

166
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
even though he looks unreliable,

167
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
he is still a good man.

168
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
He is a woman who can help me.

169
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I can't take the responsibility of a man.

170
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Dear students,

171
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
on the next week's school holidays,

172
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
we will have a lot of fun.

173
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Please register in the group.

174
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Who will come?

175
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
We have been graduating for ten years.

176
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's worth a lot of money.

177
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Hello.

178
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
The monitor sent a picture in the group.

179
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
She said she was going to have a meal.

180
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I didn't see her.

181
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What's wrong?

182
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Why are you talking so loudly?

183
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Talk well.

184
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I am busy with your work.

185
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Are you a man?

186
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yes.

187
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I know him.

188
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Okay, I will take my leave.

189
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I will not delay your good news.

190
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Are you okay?

191
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I am fine.

192
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Then I will take you home.

193
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You can take me back to the coffee shop.

194
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Okay, then.

195
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Face the monitor.

196
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Okay.

197
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The next day...

198
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What are you thinking?

199
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,440
What do you want to eat tomorrow?

200
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,240
Or do you have any plans?

201
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,440
I'm a person who eats everything.

202
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,240
Oh, that's good.

203
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,240
Good health.

204
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,120
Suddenly, Chen Mo suddenly got into trouble and looked for a topic.

205
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,960
If there are these two situations in the relationship between you and Yixing,

206
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,200
he or she will congratulate you.

207
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,960
Or it's your heart.

208
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,360
Or it's his heart.

209
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,160
Of course, the most beautiful dream has been to move with you.

210
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,200
Next, let's listen to a song that makes people move.

211
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,200
Let's listen to it.

212
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:30,200
I can't come over the blanket.

213
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:36,440
I never leave my love.

214
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,480
Actually, yesterday,

215
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,640
that little dance.

216
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,960
You've heard it, right?

217
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,840
I used to be blind.

218
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,920
I can't come over the blanket.

219
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:56,760
I can't come over the blanket.

220
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:04,400
I'm going to exchange my life with you.

221
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:11,400
The beautiful eyes are accompanied by the long road.

222
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:18,400
I can't come over the blanket.

223
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:48,400
I'm going to go.

224
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,400
See you tomorrow.

225
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,400
Okay.

226
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,400
Bye-bye.

227
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,400
Bye-bye.

228
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,400
Bye-bye.

229
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,400
Bye-bye.

230
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,400
Bye-bye.

231
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,400
Where are you?

232
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,400
You're working, right?

233
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,400
I'll be back to report the situation.

234
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,400
The weather is good today.

235
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,400
There's blue sky and white clouds.

236
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,400
Our music is good too.

237
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,400
It's a good time to chat.

238
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,400
In this day and age,

239
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,400
the name you want to think of may be the person you're moving.

240
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,400
I'm going to go.

241
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,400
I'm going to go.

242
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,400
I'm going to go.

243
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,400
I'm going to go.

244
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,400
I'm going to go.

245
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,400
I'm going to go.

246
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,400
I'm going to go.

247
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,400
I'm going to go.

248
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,400
I'm going to go.

249
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,400
I'm going to go.

250
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,400
I'm going to go.

251
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,400
I'm going to go.

252
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,400
I'm going to go.

253
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,400
I'm going to go.

254
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,400
Why is the liver so bitter?

255
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,400
It's like a human.

256
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,400
I don't think you'll come.

257
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,400
I'm here.

258
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,400
I heard you're not happy.

259
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,400
I came to see if you're unhappy.

260
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,400
I'm happy.

261
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,400
Forget it.

262
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,400
We've been friends for so many years.

263
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,400
Don't say such a bad thing.

264
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,400
Don't mention it to me.

265
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,400
You've been happy for so many years.

266
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,400
You two have been married since you were in love.

267
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,400
You're still a child.

268
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,400
What kind of person are you?

269
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,400
You're a couple.

270
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,400
You're even more like me.

271
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,400
You're like a salesman.

272
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,400
You're talking nonsense.

273
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,400
Who are you talking to?

274
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,400
Is it Mr. Li?

275
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,400
You're still going to talk about Mr. Li?

276
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,400
Didn't I tell him that we're dating?

277
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,400
He put me and you in the same box

278
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,400
and threw you in the trash bin.

279
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,400
You've been with me for more than three years.

280
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,400
You're talking nonsense.

281
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,400
You can't blame me.

282
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,400
I can't take full responsibility.

283
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,400
I'm just a little responsible.

284
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,400
No, no, no.

285
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,400
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

286
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,400
Let go.

287
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,400
Cheng Ruan, I'm sorry.

288
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,400
I'm not hiding it from you.

289
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,400
The company has been back for months.

290
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,400
I don't have the guts to contact you.

291
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,400
I know you're not happy with it.

292
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,400
But I'm in a bad mood recently.

293
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,400
I just want to talk to someone.

294
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,400
You can come. I'm actually quite happy.

295
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,400
You can scold me if you want to.

296
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,400
I know you. I'll listen to you.

297
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,400
Okay?

298
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,400
One more glass.

299
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,400
Just one glass.

300
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,400
Okay, let's go.

301
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,400
Let's go.

302
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,400
Are you regretting it?

303
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,400
I'm not regretting it.

304
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,400
I've been through this all my life.

305
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,400
I've been through this all my life.

306
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,400
Otherwise, I can't leave the second time.

307
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,400
As for that,

308
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,400
I think Xiaojiao is in a relationship with her friend every day.

309
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
Maybe she thinks it's nothing.

310
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,400
But I'm really forced to the limit.

311
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,400
Sometimes, this person is a criminal.

312
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,400
When you're with Happy,

313
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,400
I think he's very relaxed.

314
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,400
When you're with Xiaojiao,

315
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,400
he's under all the pressure in his career and life.

316
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,400
He's just a spoiled girl.

317
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,400
You know?

318
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,400
He's just forgetting to talk to my mom.

319
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,400
He's just a couple.

320
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,400
Be careful.

321
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,400
You said these two are my colleagues.

322
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,400
That's right.

323
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,400
He used to be very temperamental.

324
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,400
I can bear it.

325
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,400
But now, he's different.

326
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,400
My mom is sick.

327
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,400
How long has she been with you?

328
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,400
I know you all think I'm a spoiled girl.

329
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,400
But you said...

330
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,400
You said that now,

331
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
you're just a human being.

332
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,400
You're a bit human.

333
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,400
You can't choose.

334
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,400
Okay, okay.

335
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
My mom is sick.

336
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,400
She's sick.

337
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,400
She'll get better after the treatment.

338
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,400
And Xu Happy.

339
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,400
You haven't seen him for a long time.

340
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,400
Do you know what he's like now?

341
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,400
Cold blood,

342
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,400
cold blood,

343
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,400
cold blood,

344
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,400
and a lot of shame.

345
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,400
Today,

346
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,400
he's taking his new boyfriend

347
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,400
to come to me to have a fight.

348
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,400
I shouldn't be so childish.

349
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,400
My mom is already like this.

350
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,400
She's not willing to do anything else.

351
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,400
She just wants to go back to our old family.

352
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,400
Is that right?

353
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,400
Do you know what Xu Happy told me?

354
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,400
He told me to get half a house and change the kid.

355
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,400
No.

356
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,400
Xu Happy isn't like that.

357
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,400
Right?

358
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,400
Yes.

359
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,400
He's not like that in my memory.

360
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,400
But he told me to say that.

361
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,400
Who do you blame?

362
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,400
Isn't it your own way?

363
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,400
Dad,

364
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,400
if you really want to find a man

365
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,400
who doesn't have any emotions in marriage,

366
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,400
you can only find a man who's in a rush.

367
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,400
Episode 17

368
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,400
I'll listen to you.

369
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,400
Cheng Yi and I signed the contract.

370
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,400
I just called you.

371
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,400
You're still a kid.

372
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,400
Are you sick?

373
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,400
I was a little bit jealous of him.

374
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,400
Now it's Cheng Yi.

375
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,400
You're a little bit ridiculous.

376
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,400
Who do you think he is?

377
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,400
Who doesn't get confused?

378
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,400
As a normal woman,

379
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,400
I don't know if you know what you're thinking.

380
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,400
What's wrong?

381
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,400
I don't know.

382
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,400
Tell me.

383
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,400
Hurry up.

384
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,400
Do you feel it?

385
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,400
It's going to explode.

386
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,400
It's going to explode.

387
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,400
It's going to scare me.

388
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,400
It's going to scare me.

389
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,400
I feel it.

390
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,400
I feel like the spring of Mr. Dao's life is about to come.

391
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,400
The rush is coming.

392
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,400
What?

393
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,400
You believe in love again?

394
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,400
Please don't use those dirty words

395
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,400
that you use to insult my pure heart.

396
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,400
Don't just stand there

397
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,400
and just think of our relationship

398
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,400
that we want to know each other.

399
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,400
I love you.

400
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,400
I'm not a fool.

401
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,400
I'm a fool.

402
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,400
I'm not a fool.

403
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,400
I'm just a little bit jealous.

404
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,400
But I don't have any proof.

405
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,400
Don't be suspicious.

406
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,400
You're right.

407
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,400
As a normal woman,

408
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,400
I'm a little bit confused.

409
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,400
What's wrong?

410
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,400
I don't know.

411
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,400
Tell me.

412
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,400
Who's the one you're talking about?

413
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,400
I don't know.

414
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,400
I'm talking about you.

415
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,400
What?

416
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,400
What?

417
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,400
What's wrong?

418
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,400
What's wrong?

419
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,400
Just a little bit.

420
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,400
You used to call me a devil.

421
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,400
Look at your hair.

422
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,400
Now it's still long.

423
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,400
I'm a little bit jealous.

424
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,400
What's wrong with your hair?

425
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,400
What's wrong with your hair?

426
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,400
Just a little bit.

427
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,400
You're a little bit jealous.

428
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,400
Okay, okay.

429
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,400
You're here again.

430
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,400
I'm telling you.

431
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,400
If time can run out,

432
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,400
I will never be happy

433
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,400
to divorce you.

434
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,400
I'm so happy.

435
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,400
I'm not going to divorce you.

436
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,400
My wife and child are fighting.

437
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,400
My mom is helping my grandson.

438
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,400
My mom's uncle is not going to marry him.

439
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,400
He's going to call me every day.

440
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,400
I'm not even going to divorce you.

441
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,400
Okay, okay.

442
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,400
I'm going to ask you a question.

443
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,400
The monitor asked you.

444
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,400
Do you know that you're going to be

445
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,400
a part of this class?

446
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,400
No.

447
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,400
You're right.

448
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,400
You're too smart.

449
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,400
You know what?

450
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,400
You three are related to each other.

451
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,400
You're going to fight.

452
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,400
Here.

453
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,400
I called you because you wanted to help.

454
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,400
Here, take this.

455
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,400
Take this.

456
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,400
I'll help you.

457
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,400
Take this.

458
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,400
Take this.

459
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,400
I'll make them see me now.

460
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,400
I'll make them hear her voice.

461
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,400
My mom once told me

462
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,400
that she's being polite.

463
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,400
She said that after I was with her,

464
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,400
something bad happened.

465
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,400
I said that this is a superstitious thing.

466
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,400
But...

467
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,400
I'm not being too careful.

468
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,400
You know what?

469
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,400
I'm being careful.

470
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,400
It's really...

471
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
It's really something.

472
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,400
She's really being polite.

473
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,400
She's being polite.

474
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,400
I'm being polite.

475
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,400
Come on, take this.

476
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,400
Take this.

477
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,400
You're a man.

478
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,400
What are you talking about?

479
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,400
What are you talking about?

480
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,400
What are you talking about?

481
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,400
What are you talking about?

482
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,400
What are you doing?

483
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,400
Hello, honey?

484
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,400
Where are you?

485
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,400
Are you in the class?

486
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,400
Can you call me?

487
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,400
Why are you calling me?

488
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,400
I'm asking you.

489
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,400
Do you love Hu Xiaojiao?

490
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,400
You're a middle-aged man.

491
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,400
You love her.

492
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,400
Brother Ran.

493
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,400
Let me tell you the truth.

494
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,400
Back then,

495
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,400
if it wasn't for Hu Xiaojiao's

496
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,400
family's iron plate,

497
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,400
Xu Kaiqing was stronger.

498
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,400
His uncle could help me in the world.

499
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,400
He wouldn't have divorced Xu Kaiqing.

500
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,400
I'm so tired.

501
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,400
I want to go to the end.

502
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,400
I can't stand it.

503
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,400
It's not something.

504
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,400
Get up.

505
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,400
Listen,

506
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,400
if I didn't see you drinking too much,

507
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,400
I would beat you up now.

508
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,400
Let's go.

509
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,400
Let's go.

510
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,400
Let's go.

511
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,400
Are you married?

512
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,400
You can get upset.

513
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,400
Don't make me angry, okay?

514
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,400
I didn't get married.

515
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,400
I'm a loser.

516
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,400
I'm in your debt.

517
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,400
You're still mentioning this?

518
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,400
Good thing.

519
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,400
Good thing.

520
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,400
God gave you a warning.

521
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,400
He gave me a chicken.

522
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,400
I'm that chicken.

523
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,400
Okay, you're chicken.

524
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,400
If you marry Xu Kaiqing,

525
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,400
you can't force

526
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,400
the little guys to marry you.

527
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,400
You two should be happy.

528
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,400
Don't worry.

529
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,400
I'll protect you for the rest of my life.

530
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,400
You're the one who's going to teach me.

531
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,400
Okay, I'm leaving.

532
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,400
I'm leaving.

533
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,400
I'm leaving.

534
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,400
Dad!

535
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,400
Dad!

536
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
How was your performance today?

537
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,400
Didn't you give the grandpa a good time?

538
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,400
No.

539
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,400
Grandpa, grandpa, did you show us?

540
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,400
What?

541
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,400
You're still so smart.

542
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,400
Why are you so smart?

543
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,400
It's okay.

544
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,400
I'm fine.

545
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,400
I'm fine.

546
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,400
I'm fine.

547
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,400
I'm fine.

548
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,400
I'm fine.

549
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,400
I'm fine.

550
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,400
I'm fine.

551
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,400
I'm fine.

552
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,400
I'm fine.

553
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,400
I'm fine.

554
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,400
I'm fine.

555
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,400
I'm fine.

556
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,400
I'm fine.

557
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,400
I'm fine.

558
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,400
I'm fine.

559
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,400
I'm fine.

560
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,400
I'm fine.

561
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,400
I'm fine.

562
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,400
I'm fine.

563
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,400
I'm fine.

564
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,400
I'm fine.

565
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,400
I'm fine.

566
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,400
Dad, mom, you've worked hard.

567
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,400
Tomorrow...

568
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,400
Tomorrow, I've prepared everything for you.

569
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,400
A delicious meal.

570
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,400
I hope you'll bring it.

571
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,400
Okay.

572
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,400
What's your girlfriend's name?

573
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,400
Xu Kexin.

574
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,400
Xu Kexin?

575
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,400
Yes.

576
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,400
This name is quite interesting.

577
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,400
It's special.

578
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,400
Okay, go back.

579
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,400
Don't play with it.

580
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,400
Okay.

581
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,400
Okay.

582
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,400
Okay.

583
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,400
See you later.

584
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,400
Okay.

585
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,400
See you later.

586
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,400
Okay.

587
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,400
Have a good day.

588
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,400
Okay.

589
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,400
Okay.

590
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,400
Xu Kexin.

591
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,400
Okay.

592
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,400
I think they're still happy.

593
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,400
It's here.

594
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,400
It's here.

595
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,400
Drink it.

596
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,400
Drink it.

597
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,400
Drink it.

598
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,400
What? Drink it.

599
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,400
Drink it.

600
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,400
Drink it.

601
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,400
Drink it.

602
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,400
Drink it.

603
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,400
It's here.

604
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,400
Drink it.

605
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,400
Drink it.

606
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,400
Drink it.

607
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,400
Here.

608
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,400
Take off your clothes.

609
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,400
Take off your shoes.

610
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,400
Drink it.

611
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,400
Drink it.

612
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,400
Look, I owe you.

613
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,400
Drink it.

614
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,400
Drink it.

615
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,400
Kexin.

616
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,400
Xiaojiao.

617
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,400
The money is too much.

618
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,400
I gave it back to my family.

619
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,400
Where are you?

620
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,400
Take off your clothes.

621
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,400
What did I say?

622
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,400
The money is not pure from the beginning.

623
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,400
You're so smart.

624
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,400
I know I was wrong, right?

625
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,400
Xiaojiao said he didn't love me at all.

626
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,400
He was with me because I was better than Xu Kexin.

627
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,400
I can help him.

628
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,400
He said he loved me every day.

629
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,400
He loved me.

630
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,400
He was so stupid.

631
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,400
He was kneeling in front of me this time.

632
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,400
I can't live without him.

633
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,400
Fine.

634
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,400
The money is too much.

635
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,400
You don't know who your uncle and aunt are.

636
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,400
Look at me.

637
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,400
Darling, don't say that.

638
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,400
People are all looking for you in the fall.

639
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,400
You think everyone is like you.

640
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,400
You can find a reliable husband like me.

641
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,400
Fine.

642
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,400
I don't care about money.

643
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,400
Don't tell me what he's going to do.

644
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,400
Don't be angry with me.

645
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,400
I don't care.

646
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,400
Xiaojiao, are you feeling unwell?

647
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,400
I'm feeling unwell recently.

648
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,400
I'm so upset.

649
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,400
Xiaojiao, are you pregnant?

650
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,400
What are you talking about?

651
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,400
I told you before.

652
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,400
You can talk about money.

653
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,400
Xiaojiao.

654
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,400
What are you doing?

655
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,400
I told you before.

656
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,400
What are you doing here?

657
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,400
Mom, you have a situation.

658
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,400
I told you that you have a lot of questions.

659
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,400
What are you thinking about every day?

660
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,400
If you talk like that again,

661
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,400
I'll deduct your pocket money.

662
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,400
Mom, calm down.

663
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,400
You don't know anything.

664
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,400
What are you doing in the morning?

665
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,400
I care about you.

666
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,400
Are you in love with him?

667
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,400
Do you want to get married with me?

668
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,400
You have the right to say that.

669
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,400
You're so good-for-nothing.

670
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,400
Mom, you're so mean.

671
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,400
You don't know how to be nice to me.

672
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,400
You're so caring.

673
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,400
Are you done?

674
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,400
Mom, do you have a date tomorrow?

675
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,400
Yes.

676
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,400
Do you want to leave us tonight?

677
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,400
I'm going to the concert.

678
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,400
I heard that you don't need to study

679
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,400
every day.

680
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,400
Are you raising your child?

681
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,400
Mom, don't hit me.

682
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,400
Don't hit me.

683
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,400
Tell me.

684
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,400
How did you know?

685
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,400
It's not easy.

686
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,400
You're so kind to yourself.

687
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,400
You can't bear to use

688
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,400
the kind of clothes you're wearing tonight.

689
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,400
You have to be careful.

690
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,400
What if I have something important

691
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,400
to do at work?

692
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,400
I'm not that bad.

693
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,400
I'm not a three-year-old.

694
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,400
I'm eight years old.

695
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,400
I can't lie.

696
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,400
But the women who met

697
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,400
the emperor in the theater

698
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,400
are all in your state.

699
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,400
You're not smiling.

700
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,400
You're smiling all over.

701
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,400
I think you're obviously

702
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,400
addicted to the idol drama.

703
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,400
Let me tell you.

704
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,400
I'll go back and

705
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,400
seal your account.

706
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,400
Mom, let's talk about the future.

707
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,400
Do you have a photo?

708
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,400
You're my partner.

709
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,400
Let's ask you to take a photo.

710
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,400
Why do you care so much about the little girl?

711
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,400
Do you have to take care of this?

712
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,400
Of course.

713
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,400
If you choose someone,

714
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,400
we can't drink.

715
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,400
If not, tell me.

716
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,400
It's a waste of emotion.

717
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,400
It's a waste of energy.

718
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,400
So, anyway,

719
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,400
I should be responsible

720
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,400
for both of you.

721
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,400
I should be responsible for you.

722
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,400
But it's a little reasonable

723
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,400
for me to be in love.

724
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,400
Mom, look at me.

725
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,400
Look at me.

726
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,400
Look at me.

727
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,400
Look at me.

728
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,400
Okay, okay.

729
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,400
I'll tell you the truth.

730
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,400
Mom,

731
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,400
is there something wrong with Uncle?

732
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,400
What's wrong?

733
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,400
Why is he looking at you?

734
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,400
He has a problem.

735
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,400
I have a problem with him.

736
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,400
We're very close.

737
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,400
Okay.

738
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,400
Go to sleep.

739
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,400
I'm not sure.

740
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,400
I really...

741
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,400
I have to go out.

742
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,400
What problem?

743
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,400
He's just sleeping.

744
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,400
Then,

745
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,400
he quickly left

746
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,400
the big gray wolf's belly

747
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,400
and saved Uncle and Little Red.

748
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,400
They didn't hurt at all.

749
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,400
Because the big gray wolf

750
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,400
swallowed them all.

751
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,400
Uncle gave everyone tea.

752
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,400
They were drinking tea

753
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,400
and eating Little Red's

754
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,400
cake.

755
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,400
Since then,

756
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,400
they've been happy.

757
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,400
Okay,

758
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,400
it's time to sleep.

759
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,400
Good night.

760
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,400
Good night.

761
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,400
Good night.

762
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,400
Oh, right.

763
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,400
Tomorrow,

764
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,400
Dad will take Auntie

765
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,400
to grandpa's house for dinner.

766
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,400
Can you be nice?

767
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,400
I'll be nice.

768
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,400
Can you be nice?

769
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,400
Okay, eat.

770
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,400
Dad,

771
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,400
Auntie is the stepmother.

772
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,400
Mom is the stepmother.

773
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,400
Auntie is the stepmother.

774
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,400
There's nothing to be proud of.

775
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,400
Okay, go to sleep.

776
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,400
Good night.

777
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,400
Good night.

778
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:47,400
I've loved you before.

779
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,400
The time I spent with you

780
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,400
is not just

781
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:57,400
thousands of times.

782
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,400
There's still that young me

783
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,400
who's waiting for me.

784
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,400
I'm sorry.

785
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,400
So long?

786
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,400
Xiaojiao, are you done?

787
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,400
What's going on?

788
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,400
Isn't the money...

789
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,400
It's just that the patient is cured.

790
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,400
Well,

791
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,400
there's a child.

792
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,400
Let's not talk about this.

793
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,400
Mom, this is a bad thing.

794
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,400
I'm just too tired.

795
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,400
Xiaojiao,

796
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,400
your aunt is right.

797
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,400
You're so young.

798
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,400
You're so young.

799
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,400
You're so young.

800
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,400
You're so young.

801
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,400
It's not easy for this child to come.

802
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,400
This matter needs to be remembered.

803
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,400
Mom.

804
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,400
Youyou,

805
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,400
I'm going to sleep.

806
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,400
Get up.

807
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,400
Put the bed on.

808
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,400
Put the table on.

809
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,400
It's been a few hours.

810
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,400
You're still sleeping?

811
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,400
Get up.

812
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,400
Get up.

813
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,400
Mom,

814
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,400
you don't like your dad's girlfriend.

815
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,400
What are you talking about?

816
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,400
I don't like her.

817
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,400
You don't like her,

818
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,400
but you don't like her.

819
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,400
You can't make your family

820
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,400
get sick on your face.

821
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,400
Get up.

822
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,400
Dad!

823
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,400
What are you doing?

824
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,400
Why are you so quiet?

825
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,400
What's wrong with your family?

826
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,400
Get up.

827
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,400
Mom.

828
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,400
Sister Lily,

829
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,400
I'm going out for dinner.

830
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,400
I'm going back to work.

831
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,400
You're so formal.

832
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,400
My mom is dating a handsome guy.

833
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,400
dating?

834
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,400
What do you mean?

835
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,400
They're all the same.

836
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,400
Don't talk nonsense.

837
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,400
You're handsome.

838
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,400
Your dad is handsome.

839
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,400
Is he worse than your dad?

840
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,400
Sister Lily,

841
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,400
don't talk nonsense.

842
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,400
You two can talk.

843
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,400
I'm going.

844
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,400
Bye.

845
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,400
Bye.

846
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,400
Bye, mom.

847
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,400
I'm going to work.

848
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,400
I'm going to work.

849
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,400
Why are you here?

850
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,400
You're so shy.

851
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,400
You drank too much last night.

852
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,400
I brought you home.

853
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,400
I'm not home.

854
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,400
I'm afraid you didn't leave.

855
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,400
You brought me home.

856
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,400
You brought me to my bed.

857
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,400
What's wrong with you?

858
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,400
You're so shy.

859
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,400
Your sofa is so hard to sleep on.

860
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,400
I think he didn't come home.

861
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,400
He didn't come home.

862
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,400
He didn't come home.

863
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,400
Look,

864
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,400
You dropped the phone yesterday.

865
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,400
And…

866
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,400
I can't see you.

867
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,400
Your phone bugged me.

868
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,400
Don't make jokes.

869
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,400
You're heart broken.

870
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,400
I'm looking for it.

871
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,400
Take it back.

872
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,400
Why are you…

873
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,400
Whynya and me?

874
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,400
Are you mad at each other?

875
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,400
Where are we now?

876
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,400
Aren't you at home?

877
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,400
Just think about it.

878
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,400
I'll send you when 9 p.m.

879
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,640
Okay, uncle. I'll come over tonight.

880
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,640
I'll see you later.

881
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,320
Okay.

882
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,120
I didn't ask you to take me out last night.

883
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,160
Okay.

884
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,760
This is the last time I've had a drink.

885
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,440
I'm not doing it on purpose.

886
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,880
You asked me to drink.

887
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,800
Be careful. You'll get hit by a car.

888
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,800
Don't talk nonsense.

889
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,720
Mom.

890
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,840
Bai Zi.

891
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,240
I want to discuss something with you.

892
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,000
It's about the thing that mom said about Hu Xiaojiao's house.

893
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,760
Yes.

894
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,880
What's wrong?

895
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,000
Mom told you that mom has a disease, right?

896
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,720
Someone is in the hospital.

897
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,640
The doctor said she couldn't cure it.

898
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,560
But you know, she found a master and she's finally cured.

899
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,360
And she's finally cured.

900
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,760
What are you talking about? What master?

901
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:07,760
Son, mom knows about this disease.

902
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,600
It's a good thing that she saw the head of the doctor.

903
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,160
But she still wants to find a hope.

904
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,240
Don't say that mom is superstitious.

905
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,440
That group of friends is really cured.

906
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,200
I heard that master is just for the people around.

907
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,360
You should try to take mom to see, okay?

908
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,800
When?

909
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,920
I heard that master is resting nearby.

910
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,400
Let's go there right away, okay?

911
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:42,560
Okay, okay. I'll pack up. I'll go out right away.

912
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,520
Uncle, I can't drink anymore.

913
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,040
You saved mom's breakfast and went to the supermarket to buy you a chicken.

914
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:03,760
You're already fat. You must be hungry.

915
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,080
That's right. You have to eat something.

916
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:15,040
Otherwise, the child won't be able to eat.

917
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,640
Uncle, mom, I can't take this child.

918
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,840
When it's time to pull, you say I'm a confused child.

919
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,600
Xiao Jiang, when you were taking a bath, Qian Hao called.

920
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,840
I asked him to come over to talk.

921
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:37,440
No matter what, we have to talk about this child.

922
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,680
No, you can't let him know about this.

923
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,280
Why?

924
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,640
Why can't Qian Hao know about this?

925
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,640
That's right. Why?

926
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,440
Isn't there a child's good thing?

927
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,400
Say something.

928
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,840
This child is not Qian Hao.

929
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,400
What? You...

930
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,800
Who are you talking about? You have to find this person.

931
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,800
You have to be responsible.

932
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,920
If you kill the child and get sick,

933
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,920
you think you can't take care of the child?

934
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,240
That's right. Who is that person?

935
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,240
Don't ask. I don't know either.

936
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,040
I had a drink that day. I woke up and left early.
