1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
let's continue watching

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I see your pain

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And your brain, way too

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Some things we cannot just embrace

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And there's no time to get stuck on the past

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Create a day line, go to the free

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let's cross the wind, dance in rain

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Let the stars in the room and never wait

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh, this I feel is happiness

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
They are all about our journey

11
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Let's go

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Mi, let me pick you up

13
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Let's go

14
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Get off the car

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Mi, get off the car

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I have a lot of homework to do, I'm going to go now

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Then come to grandma's house after you finish your homework

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Okay, you guys go up first

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'll call mom next time

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Okay, mom

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Happy, wait

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Wait for dad here

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I know you and your boyfriend don't have any plans to get married

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So I want to ask you one last time

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Can you give the kids a harmonious reunion

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The future of parents living together

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I think for the future

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
If you keep being like this

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
If you keep being like this

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'll come to you in the future

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Mi, listen to me, okay?

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Okay, mom

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Then don't blame me

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You're so mean

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Why don't you want to be sad

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I don't care if I go or not

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You're sad because you've paid

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Didn't get a fair treatment

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So sad

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Remember in the future

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Unworthy things should be stopped in time

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What about the time?

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Better than a time

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
People have to suffer in this life

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
But mom hopes you can suffer less and better

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Do you know

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Then Mi is a traitor

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Look, this is your wrong

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
No one can stand by your side forever

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Mom won't?

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Mom will make mistakes

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Xin wants to stand by your side

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But what if she does something wrong?

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Do you want to eat ice cream?

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yes

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Go

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Okay

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Have a big house

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Thank you

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I like it

61
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
leadership

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Hey, you look so handsome.

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Very good.

64
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Hello, Ms. Li.

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Here, please.

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's strawberry flavored.

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You like it?

68
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'll take you to the hospital.

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Let's talk here.

70
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I think your shop is well-designed.

71
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Are you here to see me and praise my shop?

72
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
After the cold period with Qian Hao,

73
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
we're going to divorce.

74
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Do you want to get back at me?

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I know now that you're more thorough than I am.

76
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And you're living a happy life.

77
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I think it's funny.

78
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I worked so hard to get a scumbag back

79
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
and hurt myself all over.

80
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
This is probably retribution.

81
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I called you here today

82
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
to say sorry to you in person.

83
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
After the divorce,

84
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I might leave the country

85
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
and never come back.

86
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You're sincere,

87
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
but I won't accept it.

88
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm kind,

89
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
but I'm not.

90
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
If I forgive you,

91
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
it's not fair to Li Li and her kids.

92
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But I won't forgive you

93
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
and I won't lose my baby.

94
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
After all, I have my own life.

95
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I understand.

96
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
This is for you.

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
To be honest,

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I don't want to stand against Qian Hao.

99
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's a relationship.

100
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's my choice.

101
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So I don't hate him.

102
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
But we did a lot of things.

103
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You might need this.

104
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Just take it as my apology

105
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
and not for Qian Hao.

106
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Tian needs more future!'

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Be nice.

108
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Be patient.

109
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I've long lost some feelings for Xu Kai Xing.

110
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
For the divorce,

111
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I learned to get a house now.

112
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But I don't care about your house

113
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
or your money.

114
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I want you to get a divorce.

115
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,720
I'm rich. I'm not that bad.

116
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,120
But I'm a man.

117
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,200
I need a house to marry you.

118
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,240
She's easy to fool.

119
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,560
Be patient, okay?

120
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,520
Besides,

121
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,920
most of the money is mine.

122
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,520
But Happy is raising a child.

123
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,160
If you feel sorry for her,

124
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,560
let's stop here.

125
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,440
It's not good for her to return.

126
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,360
No.

127
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:58,960
Boss.

128
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,840
Boss.

129
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,680
Happy.

130
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,760
Boss.

131
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,480
Here they are.

132
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,120
Hello.

133
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,600
Hello.

134
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,680
Get me a cake.

135
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,320
Okay. Wait a minute.

136
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,120
Cheng Yi.

137
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,680
I know there are many things

138
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,440
I shouldn't have done.

139
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,640
But we're different after all.

140
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,120
We're different.

141
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,160
You can leave a way for me.

142
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,720
I'll pay you back

143
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,880
for what I did to you.

144
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,200
Don't worry.

145
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,920
I won't cause you any trouble.

146
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,400
I can't believe you.

147
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,200
Is that all you want?

148
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,920
I don't have much money.

149
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,040
I'm not sincere.

150
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,120
I never thought I'd be able to teach my disciple

151
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,320
a good lesson.

152
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,360
You really want to kill me, right?

153
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,600
I stopped you when the company wanted to fire you.

154
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,320
I really did.

155
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,720
I said all the good things.

156
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,120
But I couldn't stop you.

157
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,880
I said everything I should.

158
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,680
Right?

159
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,560
I had no choice

160
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,040
but to help them.

161
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,320
But they

162
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,640
were so insolent

163
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,120
that they turned to me.

164
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,080
Cheng Yi, listen to me.

165
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,640
You're a good young man.

166
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,880
You have a great son-in-law.

167
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,880
You can go anywhere.

168
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,880
But I'm different.

169
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,120
Your nephew is abroad.

170
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,480
He spends so much money every day.

171
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,040
Why did you ask me to deliver food?

172
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,240
I didn't ask you to deliver food.

173
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,360
Why didn't you?

174
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,240
You're in the company.

175
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,960
They have to fire me, right?

176
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,480
Now the senior high-ranking people are out of the way.

177
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,200
They have to deliver food and express their gratitude.

178
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,600
You can't bear to see me deliver food, right?

179
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,360
Okay, okay.

180
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,960
Master, calm down.

181
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,440
Don't misunderstand me.

182
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,720
Don't try to trick me.

183
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,480
Okay?

184
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,680
I have a kid.

185
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,120
I have to raise a family.

186
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,280
Don't you think I'm difficult?

187
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,400
Yes, I'm leaving this time.

188
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,160
What about next time?

189
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,400
I won't step on you next time.

190
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,400
This knife will cut your body sooner or later.

191
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,280
I can't keep it this time.

192
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,480
I'll cut it next time.

193
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,800
Don't you know what kind of company this is?

194
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,840
You brought me to this company.

195
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,000
In your opinion, you know this company best.

196
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,360
I came here this time

197
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,920
to discuss something with you.

198
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,960
I've been looking for a family these days.

199
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,080
There is a company.

200
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,120
The company culture is good.

201
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,240
The environment is good.

202
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,280
The direction of development is also good.

203
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,560
You're not like this company.

204
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,040
You're a mess.

205
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,320
Let's do it together.

206
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,280
Take the current team

207
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,960
to the next company.

208
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,480
Let's enter a new environment together.

209
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,840
New company, new market.

210
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,520
Isn't it good to talk about feelings and feelings?

211
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,040
Let's dig into the market and develop well.

212
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,000
As long as you are willing to take a deep breath,

213
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,840
we will look good.

214
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,760
What do you think?

215
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,240
What do I think?

216
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,000
Yes, it's definitely not as high as your current company.

217
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,800
But at least the market environment is good.

218
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,640
Our development environment is good.

219
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,360
We should put our eyes a little further.

220
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,640
You taught me this.

221
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,080
You're not sincere.

222
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,600
You really don't talk back.

223
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
You have a little salary.

224
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,880
You let me have a little more sight.

225
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,480
You're so funny.

226
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,680
Okay, don't worry about this.

227
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,920
You can think about it slowly.

228
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,120
Okay, I should also pick up the child.

229
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,040
After you think about it,

230
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,080
call me anytime.

231
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,080
Okay.

232
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,040
Okay, you keep this.

233
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,680
There is something else.

234
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,640
You don't have a sore back.

235
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,240
I don't know it.

236
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,160
I'm sorry.

237
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,200
Here, let me help you.

238
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,000
Where are the kids?

239
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,920
Are they at their grandpa's?

240
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,240
Youyou is back too.

241
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,520
She's taking care of Li Xun.

242
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,360
So I came to invite you to have a meal.

243
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,440
Where's Li Yuxuan?

244
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,920
She went back to eat.

245
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,520
Okay.

246
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,120
Here.

247
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,760
The food is delicious.

248
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:27,880
Here.

249
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:30,840
Thank you.

250
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,200
What's wrong?

251
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,320
Don't talk.

252
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,680
Let me lean on you.

253
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,400
Li Yuxuan

254
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,720
Li Yuxuan

255
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,920
It's almost time.

256
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,360
Let's not wait any longer.

257
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,520
Don't be late.

258
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,400
It's so late.

259
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,440
Let the kid sleep here.

260
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,120
Xu Happy won't agree.

261
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,440
Don't be like her.

262
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,800
She has done too many things.

263
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,840
I want her to be with you forever.

264
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:16,840
Mom.

265
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,120
I gave Xu Happy

266
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,240
the last chance today.

267
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,080
She didn't agree to remarry.

268
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,360
So we had to take Xiaomin away.

269
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,440
As long as we get the visa,

270
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,560
let's move on.

271
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,240
All right.

272
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,640
I'm sorry.

273
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,240
What's wrong with you today?

274
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,200
I received a gift today.

275
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,160
It's the gift that can help me

276
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,120
to get back the property of my husband and wife.

277
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,680
After receiving it,

278
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,440
I feel very sad.

279
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,800
I don't know

280
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,200
if it's because of the child

281
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,640
or the pain.

282
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,840
I just think

283
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,400
the marriage in those years

284
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,360
is disgusting to me.

285
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,560
Actually, I don't want to

286
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,960
keep pestering him.

287
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,760
The situation now

288
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,600
must be a bad battle for him.

289
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,560
But he gave up

290
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,560
the house

291
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,640
and let him go.

292
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,200
I feel bad about it.

293
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,000
Well,

294
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,160
everyone

295
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,200
has a hard time to choose.

296
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,840
But I think

297
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,920
you shouldn't force yourself

298
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,160
to make a decision so quickly.

299
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,160
You should move forward

300
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,280
and let go.

301
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,320
Maybe time will make a choice for you.

302
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,080
I know the truth.

303
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,400
Sometimes,

304
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,360
the more you understand,

305
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,040
the easier it is to make a decision.

306
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,920
When we were young,

307
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,560
I was very jealous of your husband.

308
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,360
Why?

309
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,720
He was very filial.

310
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,720
He must have

311
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,560
a mother who loved him very much.

312
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,400
Well, my family

313
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,680
is a mess.

314
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,240
It's complicated.

315
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:34,840
I don't know

316
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,160
if my mother really loved me or not.

317
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,680
I remember

318
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,120
I was about to go to college.

319
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,680
To save money,

320
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,520
she went to the boarding school

321
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,560
with my cousin's brother.

322
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,280
She did my job secretly.

323
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,680
She changed from 985 to Shifan School.

324
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,760
She never helped me since then.

325
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
After graduation,

326
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,160
it's really good.

327
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,000
She asked me for the raise fee every month.

328
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,360
Especially these few months,

329
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,280
it's getting more and more flat.

330
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,640
She said she missed me.

331
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,840
I thought

332
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,000
she was really going to school.

333
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,880
I knew it from last week.

334
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,800
My cousin called me

335
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,880
and said she was sick.

336
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,480
She was really sick.

337
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,880
She asked me to take care of her.

338
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,640
I was fine.

339
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,640
I hung up.

340
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,680
After I left,

341
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,680
I told myself

342
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,200
my only relationship with her

343
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,520
was her last minute.

344
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,040
Am I too unfilial?

345
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,360
No one can forgive for others.

346
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,400
Because no one has ever been deeply moved by you.

347
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,880
But as long as it's your decision,

348
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,400
I support you.

349
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,760
Thank you.

350
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,900
Yan Yan...

351
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,780
ées.

352
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,480
...

353
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,380
Xiaodong...

354
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,840
do you understand?

355
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,280
Approach as you can.

356
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,380
My۔

357
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:45,040
I am contented with what I managed.

358
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,620
That's about right.

359
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,700
See you.

360
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,040
I'm here.

361
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,040
I'll call you.

362
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,040
Don't blacken me.

363
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,040
Will Xiao Qiao be

364
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,040
in the next room?

365
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,040
Why don't we go down

366
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,040
and have a look?

367
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,040
No need.

368
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,040
I'm fine.

369
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,040
I'm fine.

370
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,040
It's useless.

371
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,040
If she doesn't give up,

372
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,040
we can't control her.

373
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,040
If she really gives up,

374
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,040
this Qian Hao

375
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,040
can't be helped

376
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,040
no matter what.

377
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,040
Don't worry.

378
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,040
My sister is right.

379
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,040
Sister,

380
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,040
when will you go back?

381
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,040
I'll buy a gift for mom in advance.

382
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,040
You're so impatient

383
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,040
to drive sister out?

384
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,040
No.

385
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,040
No.

386
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,040
It's good to be together.

387
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,040
It's good.

388
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,040
It's lively.

389
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,040
It's lively.

390
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,040
Right?

391
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,040
Yes.

392
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,040
If you two are so enthusiastic,

393
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,040
fine.

394
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,040
Then I'll

395
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,040
buy a gift for mom.

396
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,040
Really?

397
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,040
Alright.

398
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,040
I've booked the flight ticket.

399
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,040
Three days later.

400
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,040
Really?

401
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,040
Really.

402
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,040
Before leaving,

403
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,040
my mom said

404
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,040
to give this to you.

405
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,040
Sister.

406
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,040
Take it.

407
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,040
Look.

408
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,040
What is this?

409
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,040
Isn't this the heirloom

410
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,040
that grandma left?

411
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,040
Yes.

412
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,040
Mom said

413
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,040
you two

414
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,040
have been together

415
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,040
for so many years.

416
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,040
When I came back,

417
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,040
I couldn't do anything

418
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,040
to make you two part.

419
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,040
Since you can't do anything,

420
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,040
I'll join you

421
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,040
with my mom.

422
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,040
Got it?

423
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,040
I'll tell you next time.

424
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,040
Be filial to your mom.

425
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,040
Take your wife

426
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,040
to see your mom

427
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,040
when you have a chance.

428
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,040
Got it?

429
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,040
Got it?

430
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,040
My mom finally accepts you.

431
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,040
Honey.

432
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,040
Honey.

433
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,040
Alright.

434
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,040
What are you doing in the car?

435
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,040
Why don't you care about us?

436
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,040
Sister is here.

437
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,040
Be good.

438
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,040
This is so beautiful.

439
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,040
Our heirloom.

440
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,040
Wait for the bell.

441
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,040
Be gentle.

442
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,040
I'll be back.

443
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,040
Luo Xiao.

444
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,040
I have something to tell you.

445
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,040
You can say it here.

446
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,040
I've solved

447
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,040
your problem.

448
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,040
I've paid 300,000 yuan.

449
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,040
Don't worry about

450
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,040
others threatening you.

451
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,040
They'll use the video

452
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,040
to trick you.

453
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,040
I didn't threaten you.

454
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,040
Wait.

455
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,040
Wait.

456
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,040
300,000 yuan?

457
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,040
I can't hear you.

458
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,040
What are you talking about?

459
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,040
What video?

460
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,040
I'm not saying this

461
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,040
to make you happy.

462
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,040
I just want to tell you

463
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,040
I didn't lie to you.

464
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,040
I really love you.

465
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,040
The past is in the past.

466
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,040
You must live a happier life.

467
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,040
Are you stupid?

468
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,040
This is not me.

469
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,040
This is a liar.

470
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,040
You're so smart.

471
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,040
You're so far away from the light.

472
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,040
You've been cheated 300,000 yuan

473
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,040
for me.

474
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,040
Isn't it you?

475
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,040
This is a trace of the river.

476
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,040
You finally see it.

477
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,040
You've been cheated.

478
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,040
This is a photo of the river.

479
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,040
That's not me.

480
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,040
Call the police.

481
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,040
Go forward.

482
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,040
Not yet?

483
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,040
Go forward.

484
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,040
How long?

485
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,040
Trust me.

486
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,040
Go forward.

487
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,040
Where are we?

488
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,040
Go forward.

489
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,040
Turn right.

490
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,040
We're here.

491
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,040
Do you feel it?

492
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,040
What?

493
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,040
The chair.

494
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,040
Sit down.

495
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,040
One, two, three.

496
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,040
How is it?

497
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,040
It's oily.

498
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,040
Yes.

499
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,040
You said you like it.

500
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,040
I tried it several times.

501
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,040
Come on.

502
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,040
You made it.

503
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,040
It's so good.

504
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,040
You made it.

505
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,040
It's so good.

506
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,040
Look at the shoes.

507
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,040
It's so good.

508
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,040
Right?

509
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,040
It's so good.

510
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,040
It's good.

511
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,040
The wine tastes good.

512
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,040
I choose it for you.

513
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,040
My clients

514
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,040
gave me some tickets

515
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,040
for the basketball club.

516
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,040
It's on Friday.

517
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,040
We can eat, play and drink.

518
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,040
You can take Li Yiqi and the kids.

519
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,040
Friday?

520
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,040
Xiao Mi has to go to her grandma's house?

521
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,040
Of course.

522
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,040
Okay.

523
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,040
You're not afraid of the kids?

524
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,040
You can do it.

525
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,040
It's the first time since then.

526
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,040
Right?

527
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,040
Okay. I'll listen to you.

528
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,040
One more.

529
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,040
Qian Hao is

530
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,040
very close to Xiao Jia.

531
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,040
But don't forget

532
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,040
he used to

533
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,040
force his ex-wife and kids

534
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,040
to stay away from each other.

535
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,040
Why don't I believe it?

536
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,040
Right.

537
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,040
He's like a monkey.

538
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,040
He cheated her

539
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,040
with such a low-level trick.

540
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,040
Could it be that he

541
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,040
used the dinosaur weapon

542
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,040
to trick Xiao Qiao?

543
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,040
What are you talking about?

544
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,040
They're divorced.

545
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,040
Don't worry.

546
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,040
I won't turn back.

547
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,040
I know the principle

548
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,040
of the ten-way

549
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,040
life-and-death ratio.

550
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,040
You've grown up.

551
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,040
But, uncle,

552
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,040
Qian Hao was cheated

553
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,040
because of me.

554
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,040
If he has any difficulties in the future,

555
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,040
I won't ask you to help him.

556
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,040
Don't step on him.

557
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,040
Okay, uncle?

558
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,040
I agree.

559
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,040
Look at my husband.

560
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,040
Come on.

561
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,040
Don't worry.

562
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,040
Come on.

563
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,040
You too.

564
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,040
No.

565
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,040
Come on.

566
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,040
I'll give you this.

567
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,040
You don't want it?

568
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,940
Visiting the

569
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:38,020
Meeting here is for good or bad?

570
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:38,940
flavourful

571
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,820
Seems strange

572
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,500
Go

573
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,180
I really hate a lot of her

574
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,860
I think

575
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:56,340
This man is so pretty

576
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,740
andzusagen

577
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,660
Why can't I wear an iPhone 3

578
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,540
to buy things

579
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,140
I think

580
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,060
It's right that she doesn't allow us to bring her here.

581
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,260
So that you won't have to suffer anymore.

582
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,700
She's such a small child. We have to take her away from her mother.

583
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,260
What are you saying?

584
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,700
The root of the Qian family is to look for her in the Qian family.

585
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,220
Be careful

586
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,220
Let's go.

587
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:05,540
Have a look.

588
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,300
Actually,

589
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:17,980
I was very lucky

590
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,080
that Yu Long brought

591
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,100
Zhang Bai Yi behind me.

592
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,140
I've had factors

593
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,140
which lead me not to believe

594
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,180
that they were all-inclusive.

595
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,060
However,

596
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,420
they're all the reasons

597
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,180
of my favorite logic

598
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,180
and my зв எлestets.

599
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,860
If I had known

600
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,260
it was Fish Poke,

601
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,100
I'll be back.

602
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:35,920
And that's it.

603
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,660
Have a good sleep.

604
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,560
See you.

605
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,500
Give me your jacket,ekaima.

606
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:43,940
Take care.

607
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:44,520
Bye.

608
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,180
You're here.

609
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,340
Grandma, Grandpa.

610
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:06,900
Hello.

611
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,060
Xia Xiao Mi.

612
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,340
Grandma misses you so much.

613
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,500
That's great.

614
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,180
Now I can be with Grandma everyday.

615
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,540
What do you mean?

616
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,860
I booked a car.

617
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,180
I'll be there in half an hour.

618
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,900
We'll leave when we get there.

619
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,100
Okay.

620
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,860
Honey.

621
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,540
There's nothing to be afraid of.

622
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,900
Let's leave here

623
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,340
and start over.

624
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,380
There are many things

625
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,420
you can do there.

626
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,940
You can inherit our family business.

627
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,580
And

628
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,980
I have many handsome guys.

629
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,820
I believe I've explained a lot to you.

630
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,460
You must be satisfied.

631
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,660
Let's start

632
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,820
a perfect relationship.

633
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,460
Honey.

634
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,220
Let's get closer.

635
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,540
Okay.

636
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,180
Hello.

637
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,540
Honey.

638
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,220
Yes.

639
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,540
We'll meet in a few hours.

640
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,620
I miss you so much.

641
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,300
I'll bring my daughter back

642
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,620
to introduce you.

643
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,580
We'll get to know each other.

644
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,860
Okay?

645
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,900
Okay.

646
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,740
I miss you.

647
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,020
I miss you.

648
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,620
I love you.

649
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,940
I miss you too.

650
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,460
I'm a friend.

651
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,500
This place is so lively.

652
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:01,780
See you later.

653
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,260
See you later.

654
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,260
Bye.

655
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,700
Nami.

656
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,380
Stop playing.

657
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,060
We're here.

658
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,220
I'll play for another minute.

659
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,380
Please, Nami.

660
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,020
Hello.

661
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:15,820
Are you Miss Xu?

662
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,380
Yes.

663
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,700
I'm a staff here.

664
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,980
Mr. Mei has registered for you.

665
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:19,780
I'll take you in.

666
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,500
Okay.

667
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:20,980
Hello.

668
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:21,700
Let's go.

669
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,940
I'm here.

670
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,860
I know this place.

671
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:41,940
My mom made it.

672
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,580
Awesome.

673
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,380
Yes.

674
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:44,740
Hello.

675
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,420
You're here.

676
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:45,980
Thank you.

677
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,060
Come on.

678
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,060
Mom.

679
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,500
Mr. Mei, I want to play that too.

680
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,620
That one?

681
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,620
Wait a minute.

682
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,420
Coach Luo.

683
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,020
Yes.

684
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,260
Okay.

685
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,100
Sorry.

686
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,260
Let me take care of you.

687
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:57,700
Thank you.

688
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,380
Thank you.

689
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,420
Nami.

690
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,460
Let's go.

691
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,860
You're so persistent.

692
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,100
You're so smart.

693
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,140
I guess you didn't bring it.

694
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:05,660
Come on.

695
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,660
Let's play.

696
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,300
Thank you.

697
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,300
Nami.

698
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,300
Cool, right?

699
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:21,740
Great.

700
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,740
Awesome.

701
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,180
Awesome.

702
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,100
Dad.

703
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,780
Where are we going?

704
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,540
To a fun place.

705
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,260
Far away?

706
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,260
Yes.

707
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:41,260
Why do we have to carry so many things?

708
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,100
Why?

709
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,500
Who's calling?

710
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,780
Give it to me.

711
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,500
Give it to me.

712
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,380
Give it to me.

713
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,380
I don't want it.

714
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,780
I don't want it.

715
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,460
Hao.

716
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,260
I told you not to do this.

717
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,100
Stop it.

718
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:03,900
Come on.

719
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:04,700
Come here.

720
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,900
Sit tight.

721
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,900
Sit tight.

722
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,500
Nami, sit tight.

723
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,980
Leave me alone.

724
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:09,700
Okay.

725
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,300
Stop it.

726
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,580
Sit tight.

727
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,780
Sit tight.

728
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:14,860
Stop it.

729
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,740
Sit tight.

730
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,660
Sit tight.

731
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,660
Sit tight.

732
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,660
Sit tight.

733
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,220
Okay, next one.

734
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:24,820
Come on.

735
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,060
Three.

736
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:26,860
Go.

737
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,700
Next one.

738
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,700
This way.

739
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,500
Hello, what's up?

740
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,620
Kai Qi.

741
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,140
Is Xiaomi with you?

742
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:34,860
No.

743
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,380
She's with Qian Hao's mom.

744
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,420
I sent you a picture.

745
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,540
Take a look.

746
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,620
Qian Hao and I booked a flight ticket.

747
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,780
It's an account.

748
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:43,180
I saw him buying a ticket to go abroad today.

749
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,780
There's Xiaomi in it.

750
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,020
What's wrong?

751
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,740
Qian Hao took Xiaomi abroad.

752
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,980
Oh, no.

753
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,260
What should we do?

754
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,020
Don't worry.

755
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,020
Sister Li, please take care of the kid.

756
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:57,980
If you need anything,

757
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,940
just ask my colleague.

758
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,980
I'll go with Kai Qi.

759
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,780
Mom, sister Li, I want to go to the airport, too.

760
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,060
You can go with them.

761
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,220
No, I don't want to go.

762
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,940
I don't want to fight with them.

763
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,300
I want to be friends with them.

764
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,260
You two stay here.

765
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,060
Wait for me.

766
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,740
Listen to me, okay?

767
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,740
Hurry up.

768
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,860
Xu Kai Qi, what are you doing?

769
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,020
How do I know?

770
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,260
You can't hurt yourself.

I want to go to the toilet.

00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,140
You're too much.

798
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,060

She's still young.

Don't shout.

825
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,500
What's going on, little friend?

826
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,540
What's your name?

827
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,700
Uncle, I'm Qian Xiao Mi.

828
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,820
I'm looking for my mom.

829
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,780
I'm looking for my mom.

830
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,980
I'm looking for my mom.

831
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:08,980
I'm sorry.

832
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,780
Look, this is my ID.

833
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,220
I'm sorry.

834
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,100
This is my son.

835
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,300
This is my mom.

836
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,580
But the mother is looking for her child in the broadcast.

837
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,460
This is my son.

838
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,700
His mother and I...

00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,060
I'm sorry to trouble you.

842
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,700
Do you have any evidence?

843
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,140
Look at the photo.

844
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,620
Do we still have evidence?

845
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,540
This is my son.

846
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,260
Look, Qian Xiao Mi and Qian Hao are all rich.

847
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,260
This is my son.

848
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,940

Uncle.

850
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,260
He's not my dad.

851
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,500
He's a criminal.

852
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,020

853
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:36,700

00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:40,500
Don't mention it.

967
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,260
Bye.

968
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,380
Xu Happy.

969
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,140
Hi, teacher.

970
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,020
I'm going to pick it up.

971
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:57,260
Okay.

972
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,740
Yuan finally gave me back

973
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,900
the real estate.

974
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,020
That's great.

975
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,300
Qian Hao must have never thought

976
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,220
that he would go to the end of the world

977
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,180
and spit out everything

978
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,620
if it wasn't for him.

979
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:22,820
Let's go.

980
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,980
The partner's life is still going on.

981
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,900
There will be difficulties and troubles.

982
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,580
But isn't the truth of life

983
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:44,060
the search for happiness in the troubles?

984
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,540
What do you want?

985
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,140
I'm going to pick it up.

986
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:53,900
What?

987
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:55,580
I like to eat it.

988
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:00,260
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

989
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:07,740
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

990
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:18,820
Everyone.

991
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:20,940
Your turn.

992
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,660
I'm still thinking about your turn.

993
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:23,620
Hotpot.

994
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,580
Hotpot.

995
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,340
After you eat it.

996
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,220
Not hot.

997
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,260
How hot?

998
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,140
On the other side.

999
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,340
Good job, mind.

1000
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,060
Slow down.

1001
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,020
What?

1002
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,180
Here.

1003
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:21,820
You're the best, baby.

1004
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,020
You're the best.

1005
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,820
You're the best.

1006
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:27,220
Let's cross the wind, dance in the wind.

1007
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:31,700
Let the stars shine through my night away.

1008
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,380
Come on.

1009
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:32,820
Come on.

1010
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:33,540
Let's go.

1011
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,620
Tears and fears, happiness,

1012
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,820
they are all brought up for journey.

1013
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:40,220
The two hearts are full of sweetness.

1014
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,220
Yeah.

1015
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,660
You're the best.

1016
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,020
You're the best.

1017
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,100
Later,

1018
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,060
Mei Qiong Yi and I

1019
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,300
successfully passed the test of each other.

1020
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:51,980
We became a real family.

1021
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,020
As for Qian Hao,

1022
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:54,940
no matter how much money he had,

1023
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,460
he didn't keep his mother.

1024
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:59,380
He never appeared in our life.

1025
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:01,100
There will be wind and rain in the future.

1026
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:01,980
But Xu Happy

1027
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,260
will bravely

1028
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,620
win the wind and bloom

1029
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:06,900
like all the friends who love life.

1030
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:25,020
The two parts of a river and a city.

1031
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,060
A lamp,

1032
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:31,860
the bright light of the day and night.

1033
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,140
A memory,

1034
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:37,420
a memory of the past.

1035
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,780
A memory of the past.

1036
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:42,140
A memory of the past.

1037
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:45,940
A memory of the past.

1038
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:48,980
A memory of the past.

1039
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:53,660
The flow of time.

1040
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,780
There is always someone

1041
00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:01,180
who is half happy and half sad.

1042
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:04,020
Who said it's not

1043
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:08,420
wasting the time?

1044
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:11,260
Who said it's not

1045
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:15,300
making the lonely lonely?

1046
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:18,340
Whose story is

1047
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:22,900
thick and plain?

1048
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:25,820
How can it be half

1049
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:32,740
and half?

1050
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:35,420
How many times

1051
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:37,780
have I walked through

1052
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:41,380
the vast and barren land?

1053
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:43,620
How many days and nights

1054
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:47,620
have I endured the pain of the past?

1055
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:51,780
The sorrow of time

1056
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:55,620
is like a long plate.

1057
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:57,740
Only when you meet it

1058
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:02,180
can you be happy and happy.

1059
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:05,500
If you are young and brave,

1060
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:10,380
you will never be miserable.

1061
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:12,780
If you are fearless and simple,

1062
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:16,900
you will never have any regrets.

1063
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:21,020
The sorrow of time

1064
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:24,900
is like a long plate.

1065
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,780
The sky will be half

1066
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:30,380
and the moon will be half.

1067
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:36,020
Half and half.
