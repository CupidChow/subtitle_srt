1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,980
Uooooooooh

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I see your pain as you're braying too

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Something sweet cannot just depraise

4
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And there's no time to guess the ground above

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Greater daylight, go to the free

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let's cross the wind, dancing ring

7
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let the stars into my night away

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh, it's a piece of happiness

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
They are all bought off for journey

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Woo-oo, woo-oo, woo-oo

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You're not a happy boy

12
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 1

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Dad, dad

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm sorry, dad

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Dad, I'm so great at selling gifts

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Your sister is my superman, dad

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Dad, you're the best dad in the world

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I love you, dad

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Okay, I'll help you to make a deal

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Come, let's go

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
This is only the feeling that only parents can understand

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
They are constantly being emptied, but they are constantly being cured

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
They are soft, but also a loss

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
No matter if it's dad's gift or the price

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
In their eyes, they are always the best

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The day of the original disaster

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Because of this double hug

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It has become a happy day

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Even if the road ahead is windy

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I can't fight because I'm their superman's dad

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You're asleep

32
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You and Zhen are asleep

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What are you doing?

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I don't have any girlfriends

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yu'an, Yule, you have a stepmother

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You have a stepmother and a stepfather

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And your little daughter

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
When you were in the year of the book

39
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
When you were in the year of the book

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
When you were in the year of the book

41
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
He had to be independent

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
He had to enjoy a single life

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
He didn't get married

44
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's obvious that the two of them are in the same situation

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's a three-star situation

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Both of them don't listen

47
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What do you think?

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The old man has been gone for years

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
He is still young

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He must find

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
He has to be married in the summer

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
He can't stop him

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Unless he is in a hurry

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Nothing to do with you

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What did you say?

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Nothing

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Nothing?

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Nothing before?

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Unless he is in a hurry

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Nothing to do with you

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
That's right

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's okay if he is in a hurry

63
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I didn't expect you to have such a wonderful wife

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Go to sleep

65
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Who said you are an old woman?

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm going to sleep

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I have found out

68
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Whose news?

69
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Qianhao's

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You have such a good news

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Wait

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What's going on?

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What's going on?

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's said that Hu Xiaojiao was pregnant for three years

75
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
He was pregnant for three years

76
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Did Qianhao's mother hear that?

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
She said that she didn't even have a child at home

78
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
She also said that Qianhao's ex-wife

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
She knows how to give birth

80
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
She has a son, she wants a daughter

81
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Her mother is a god

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
She can't afford to have a son

83
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
even if she is a god

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Do you remember when she was in Hongyao village?

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Did she say that she was not beautiful enough?

86
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
She said that she was not beautiful enough

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That's why her son was born

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Her mother is sick

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
She said she was in love

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
She didn't have a few years of life

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So my little Qianhao

92
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
must have returned home for this

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Hu Xiaojiao can't give birth to a child

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Her mother always thinks that

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
someone's royal position will be inherited

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So she put the idea on your head

97
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Qianhao is a good girl

98
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But what's the joke about her mother?

99
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Your heart is soft

100
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Is it your heart that is soft?

101
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm a rich woman

102
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I was thinking that

103
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Isn't this old woman sick?

104
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I don't know

105
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Mother

106
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Mother

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Do you remember

108
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You had a big fever

109
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I was suspicious that you had a white blood cell

110
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
After I came out of the hospital

111
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I saw a lot of money

112
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Qianhao's phone was out

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And Hu Xiaojiao's father was black

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Both of them were abroad

115
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I couldn't find anyone.

116
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I really had no choice.

117
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I went to see his mother.

118
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
She threw me out of the house and took me away.

119
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I remember that it was the beginning of the year.

120
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
There was a lot of joy everywhere.

121
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I was alone.

122
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I was like a wolf.

123
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I walked around the river.

124
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I stood beside the river.

125
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I thought,

126
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I was happy and I was happy.

127
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Why did I go to this place?

128
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
If I die,

129
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
did Qianhao have to take care of the child?

130
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Then I saved her.

131
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I was so stupid.

132
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I couldn't keep dancing.

133
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Jiang Shui is so cool.

134
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
She woke me up all of a sudden.

135
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Qianhao's family

136
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
is so soft.

137
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What if I die?

138
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What about my children?

139
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What about Lili?

140
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm not afraid of death.

141
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

142
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Luckily, my father is fine.

143
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm fine too.

144
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So, how could I be soft?

145
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
If they want to see the child,

146
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
they can take Fu Yangfei over.

147
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I won't stop them.

148
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
If they have any other flower plants,

149
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
we won't leave them and we won't endure them.

150
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
If there are any other flower plants,

151
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'll beat them out for the first time.

152
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Xiao Mi.

153
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Xiao Mi, what are you doing?

154
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Xiao Mi, what are you doing?

155
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Xiao Mi, what's wrong?

156
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
What's wrong with you?

157
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Hurry up.

158
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
No more быстрos.

159
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
See this.

160
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's time for fish.

161
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,360
Acid

162
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,540
يع

163
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,180
What happened here?

164
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,940
blem

165
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,280
Dad

166
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,460
Qi Stamina

167
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,180
What?

168
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:40,440
What theacc

169
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Come on, hurry up and take a shower.

170
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Hurry up.

171
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Oh, this...

172
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Hey, you two, stop playing.

173
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm not going to put on my clothes.

174
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You two, hurry up.

175
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Mom, I'm going to sleep.

176
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You're going back to sleep, right?

177
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm going to wait.

178
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm going to say that I'm happy and you're going to see my company.

179
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I won't send you today.

180
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Why?

181
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Why are you hiding?

182
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
The boss is not happy, okay?

183
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I said you're an old man.

184
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I won't send you if you don't want to.

185
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I have to get rid of the water.

186
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I want Mei Chen to think about it.

187
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
If it weren't for our help, how would she live?

188
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
She needs to be bright.

189
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
If she really gives Yuanyu a good mother,

190
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
we wouldn't care.

191
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I think she can live without it.

192
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You know what to do.

193
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Dad, you're so stupid.

194
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
The water is more flowing when you're drinking.

195
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
If you don't want to sleep, come out and work.

196
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Hey, I haven't finished eating yet.

197
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You're always looking for trouble.

198
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And you're still looking for food.

199
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm asking you to be more sincere.

200
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm going to eat.

201
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Okay, eat.

202
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Eat.

203
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Why are you so quiet today?

204
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Where's your wife?

205
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
She's tied the shoelace for more than a minute.

206
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
She's waiting for you.

207
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Go.

208
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Let's go.

209
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Go.

210
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Shuang, eat.

211
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
We're going to the hospital.

212
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
My wife.

213
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You're leaving now.

214
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Eat.

215
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
That's weird.

216
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You're almost late.

217
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Why aren't you leaving?

218
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You're always working.

219
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You're always working.

220
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You're always working.

221
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Are you a woman or a mother?

222
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You're always working.

223
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm a man.

224
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
How can you be so small?

225
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You're so lazy.

226
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm going to the hospital.

227
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'm going to the hospital.

228
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm going to the hospital.

229
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm going to the hospital.

230
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm going to the hospital.

231
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm going to the hospital.

232
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm going to the hospital.

233
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm going to the hospital.

234
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm going to the hospital.

235
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm going to the hospital.

236
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm going to the hospital.

237
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm going to the hospital.

238
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm going to the hospital.

239
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm going to the hospital.

240
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Mom.

241
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Don't talk.

242
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm going to the hospital.

243
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'll pick you up later.

244
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You can't eat.

245
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Dad will give you some money.

246
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Go to the school's department store and eat.

247
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Okay.

248
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Do you want to make breakfast for me?

249
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I want to make egg cakes for dad.

250
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You're still young.

251
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
If you make breakfast early, dad will be more tired.

252
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Dad, I'm sorry.

253
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Okay.

254
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Next time, I'll teach you.

255
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Let's make breakfast together.

256
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Thank you, dad.

257
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Okay.

258
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Get ready to go.

259
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Brother-in-law, my dad is getting married.

260
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
He won't let me take care of Yuanyuan and Le.

261
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
He wants you to leave our family and go to his daughter-in-law.

262
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Brother-in-law, hold on.

263
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Don't let him go to the wrong place.

264
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Wait.

265
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm going to be late.

266
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
What?

267
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Hurry up.

268
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'm going to be late.

269
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm going to be late.

270
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Thank you.

271
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
My child!

272
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
My child!

273
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Hurry up.

274
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I can't make it.

275
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Aunt is not coming.

276
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Okay, I'm not coming.

277
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Come on.

278
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'll go get the shoes.

279
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Who is this?

280
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Darling!

281
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Darling!

282
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Come here.

283
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
What's wrong?

284
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
What's wrong with you?

285
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Is that the one who took Yuanyuan to the car?

286
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Is that our daughter-in-law?

287
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You're not going to pick up the phone.

288
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Who is Cheng Yi?

289
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
No.

290
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
No, it's not Cheng Yi.

291
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Who is that?

292
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Yongyang!

293
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
What's wrong?

294
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Yongyang!

295
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
What's wrong?

296
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Darling!

297
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Darling!

298
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Call the police!

299
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
What's wrong?

300
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Call the police!

301
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Yuanyuan and Le are being kidnapped.

302
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'll call the police first.

303
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Yuanyuan and Le are being kidnapped.

304
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You found a colleague.

305
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You're going to the school with Yuanyuan, right?

306
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Okay, okay.

307
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's okay.

308
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's okay.

309
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm scared to death.

310
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It's okay.

311
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Okay, see you.

312
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
What's wrong?

313
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
What's wrong?

314
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Brother-in-law is late for work today.

315
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
You suddenly didn't let him go.

316
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
He couldn't find a colleague to send Yuanyuan to the school.

317
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
He'll be in the middle of a meeting with the teacher.

318
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
You're so smart.

319
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's so ridiculous.

320
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
How can he give the child to an outsider?

321
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You can't help him today.

322
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
He can only find an outsider.

323
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You're making me sick!

324
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
If something really happened to Yuanyuan,

325
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I'll divorce you!

326
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Okay, okay.

327
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
No, I'm still worried.

328
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I want to talk to you.

329
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
No.

330
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
No.

331
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Mom, can I take the brother to my dad for a meal?

332
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Qin Anmi,

333
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
what's the matter?

334
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Please come to me later.

335
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
My parents are not good at talking to each other in front of their children.

336
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
How can you be like this?

337
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Why do I have to be so heartless and praise him every day?

338
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You can't be so good.

339
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I've been to and from this day on.

340
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
What did your dad do?

341
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
He knows it the best.

342
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I don't want to tell you now because you're still young.

343
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Let your life be taught to you.

344
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Do you want to stay with your dad for a few days?

345
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Yes.

346
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Then go ahead.

347
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Really?

348
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Yes.

349
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I want to stay for a few days.

350
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Thank you, mom.

351
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm the best.

352
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Bye.

353
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Hello.

354
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You're here.

355
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What are you doing?

356
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It's almost done.

357
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I can't take it anymore.

358
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Hello.

359
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I'm the member who just finished the wine.

360
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I didn't have time to come yesterday.

361
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I... I'll just say

362
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
my request to the other half.

363
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Kind,

364
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
love children,

365
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
care about their family.

366
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Let's talk about this.

367
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Let's see if there's a suitable woman.

368
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Thank you, mom.

369
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Love and care for children?

370
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
This bastard.

371
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
He just wants to be the leader outside.

372
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
What's so good about him?

373
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Xu Kai Qi.

374
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Why did you tell me?

375
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
You're lying to me.

376
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I thought I could make a report on the prize money.

377
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I was so happy last night.

378
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I didn't have enough money to pay the bill.

379
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I didn't have enough money to pay the bill.

380
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I thought I could make a report on the prize money.

381
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
But I didn't have enough money to pay the bill.

382
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I didn't think it was a fraud.

383
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
How much is the bill?

384
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
3600.

385
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
What if it's a misunderstanding?

386
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Do you want to pay the bill?

387
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Never believe a fraud.

388
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
He must be more powerful than Dou Er.

389
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
How about you be my friend?

390
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Let's be like a couple.

391
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
You're not afraid of other women, right?

392
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Miss Lin, your conscience won't hurt.

393
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
What?

394
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
First, you won't be fooled.

395
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Second, you can eat a big meal.

396
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Anyway, I won't give you money.

397
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I thank you.

398
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Listen to me.

399
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Look.

400
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
You're wearing a dress with a dress and a dress with a mood.

401
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And you're going to be the man who will be the bride for the wedding.

402
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Are you responsible for our good sisters?

403
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
You're willing to do everything for Tianxing Island.

404
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Please take care of her.

405
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
You should take good care of her.

406
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Like me, I'll take care of the two children.

407
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Bye-bye.

408
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
This way.

409
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
This way.

410
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Okay.

411
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Okay.

412
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Please take care of her.

413
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
What time is it?

414
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It's 6 o'clock.

415
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I'll be there right away.

416
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Okay.

417
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
When will you meet her?

418
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
It's not a good day.

419
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
It's just tonight.

420
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Wait a minute.

421
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Have you ever seen her?

422
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I was wearing a dress.

423
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Don't worry.

424
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I can't recognize her.

425
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
That's great.

426
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
You're the best.

427
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Watch the show.

428
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Bye-bye.

429
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Bye-bye.

430
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It's just tonight.

431
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
It's so late.

432
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
You're back.

433
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I'm not going to buy anything.

434
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I'm not going to tell you.

435
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
My wife and son-in-law are my children.

436
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
They can't tell you.

437
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
They took my baby's baby.

438
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I can't talk now.

439
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I want to be a son-in-law.

440
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I can't do anything.

441
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I'm really going to do something.

442
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Did you hear that?

443
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I'm going to do something.

444
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

445
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

446
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Listen to your mom.

447
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
What are you talking about?

448
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I'm a little girl.

449
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I'm a little girl.

450
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I'm a little girl.

451
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Why are you talking about that?

452
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Why don't you say it?

453
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
You're the one who's going to do the dishes.

454
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Shut up.

455
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
What are you talking about?

456
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
You can't just say it.

457
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
You can't just say it.

458
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
You think your mom is the dirty one.

459
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
You just want me to be the dirty one.

460
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
No.

461
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
You can say it.

462
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
You can say it if you're happy.

463
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Okay.

464
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Let's go.

465
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Let's go home.

466
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I'm going to talk to you.

467
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Don't talk to me.

468
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Let's go home.

469
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Let's go.

470
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Let's go.

471
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Let's go.

472
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Come on.

473
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Hey.

474
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
What's wrong?

475
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
You're going to talk to me?

476
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Mom.

477
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Come and buy some food.

478
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Mom.

479
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
You're so angry.

480
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Mom.

481
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Mom.

482
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Mom.

483
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I'm sorry.

484
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I was just yelling at you.

485
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I was so scared.

486
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Just hit me.

487
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Hit me.

488
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Hit me.

489
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Hit me.

490
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Mom.

491
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Mom.

492
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I didn't do it on purpose.

493
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I didn't do it on purpose.

494
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I didn't do it on purpose.

495
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I was hit by a car.

496
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
You know my mom's body.

497
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
How did she say that?

498
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Look at her biggest wish.

499
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
She's a grandson.

500
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
If she knew I'm like this,

501
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
she wouldn't be so ill.

502
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
She wouldn't be sick.

503
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I'm sorry.

504
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I think you're more upset.

505
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I'm more upset than you.

506
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Really.

507
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I'm not upset.

508
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I like you.

509
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I know you're upset.

510
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I'm glad to be your husband.

511
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
We'll live a good life.

512
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
You're the third one.

513
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I'm sure you're the third one.

514
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I'm so upset.

515
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I'm not upset.

516
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I'm not upset.

517
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Hello.

518
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Dad.

519
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Chen Yu, listen.

520
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Don't ever let Yu An Yu

521
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
go to the outside world.

522
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Got it?

523
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
It's too dangerous.

524
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
It's too dangerous.

525
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Dad,

526
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I'm really busy today.

527
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I can't be late.

528
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
It's okay.

529
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
If you have something to do,

530
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
go back to work.

531
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Leave the kids to us.

532
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Don't bother them.

533
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
It's the same today.

534
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Let them have dinner here.

535
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Then go back.

536
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Okay.

537
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Brother,

538
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
you're so nice.

539
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
You've made my dad a big deal.

540
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Slow down.

541
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Okay.

542
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I'll take care of the house.

543
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
It's not working.

544
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
The damage is almost

545
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
a thousand times greater.

546
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I have to think of another plan.

547
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Pull it.

548
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Don't worry.

549
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I'll do it.

550
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
If they say no,

551
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
they'll say no.

552
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
They'll say they don't know

553
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
that Li Bukai and Yu You Jia are not in the family.

554
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
But they've solved it.

555
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
You're so mad.

556
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Then go up there.

557
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Go after the kids

558
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
and send them to the school.

559
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
You're so childish.

560
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
How did you say that?

561
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
People think that

562
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
they'll find out on the ground.

563
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
That's what you're laughing at.

564
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
You know nothing.

565
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
The whole family is just me.

566
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
If it wasn't for me,

567
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I'd see how you two would have lived.

568
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Since you don't want to have kids,

569
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
you have to go after your stepmother.

570
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
What are you going to do?

571
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Let the god laugh at me.

572
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Next,

573
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
it's our team

574
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
to analyze the data in this three-day live broadcast.

575
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Okay, let's take a look at

576
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Zhou Qingyi's live broadcast.

577
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
In short,

578
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
his performance is very good,

579
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
but his return rate is very high.

580
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And the image of his back is very high.

581
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
In the live broadcast room of T-Shirt,

582
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
his feel for the music is more high.

583
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
And his return rate is very low.

584
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
His back is very good.

585
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Let's take a look at sister Yato.

586
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Her data is the best in this three-day live broadcast.

587
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
But this is also

588
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
our team's first post-it.

589
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Because she's promoted to the first live broadcast in the whole network.

590
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
In this way,

591
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
the product will definitely be produced.

592
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
During the short-term,

593
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
the performance will be very good.

594
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
But for us,

595
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
it's not good for long-term cooperation.

596
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
So we are more similar to T-Shirt.

597
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
And I also escaped from their work

598
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
with the concept of double live broadcast.

599
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
And the product live broadcast is very similar.

600
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
We can double-broadcast.

601
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Okay, thank you.

602
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Thank you.

603
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Okay, okay, okay.

604
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Now we will go up.

605
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Come on.

606
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Come on.

607
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
You don't need to say anything.

608
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
You know what the company wants.

609
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Last chance.

610
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
You have to be confident.

611
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Do you hear me?

612
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Yes.

613
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
What's wrong with you?

614
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Come on.

615
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
What's wrong with you?

616
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Mr. Mei, hello.

617
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I have arranged a date for you tonight at 6 p.m.

618
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I will send you the name card.

619
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Which one?

620
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Hello.

621
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
The key is the introduction of the studio.

622
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I am Mei Chengying.

623
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Hello.

624
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
You are a friend of my friend, right?

625
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Yes.

626
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I will send you more to the restaurant.

627
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Thank you.

628
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Okay, come on.

629
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Okay, come on.

630
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Welcome to the studio.

631
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Thank you.

632
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Hello.

633
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Tonight at 6 p.m.,

634
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
do you have any friends who want to know about me?

635
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Mei Chengying.

636
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Her name is really Zhai Chi Luo Luo.

637
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Okay, where do you want to go?

638
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
What do you want to eat?

639
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
You decide.

640
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
We are...

641
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
At 6 p.m.,

642
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
there is a pizza restaurant on the street.

643
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Can you do it?

644
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I am done.

645
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Hello.

646
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Hello.

647
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I have a pen and a pencil.

648
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Do you have a pen and a pencil?

649
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
There is one over there.

650
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
You can go ahead and choose.

651
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Okay.

652
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Hello.

653
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Okay, I know.

654
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I will be right over.

655
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Okay.

656
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Sister Mei.

657
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I am going to the school.

658
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Please take care of the guest for me.

659
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
You Xiaουμεi,

660
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
do you know who is the best celeb?

661
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Easy to find, easy to find...

662
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I think he can just say whatever he wants.

663
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
My responsibility here will always be more high-plony ground than just the world.

664
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Li Jiayang,

665
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Who are you?

666
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,280
I can't even take out the photo of the child.

667
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,040
The child said he didn't know you, right?

668
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,840
We can't make sure that you are the real grandma of the child.

669
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,560
How can you take her away?

670
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,240
Is that okay?

671
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:31,880
Do you want to take a photo?

672
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,360
Do you think that

673
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,160
I look like Xiaomi?

674
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:34,720
That's why you...

675
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,480
Don't be so excited.

676
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,360
...couldn't have come out.

677
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,080
I just want you to take her away.

678
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,240
Or else, you can call the client and tell us, okay?

679
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,240
What client?

680
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:41,920
I want to take her away.

681
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,800
Hey, you're really like this.

682
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,080
You can't take her away.

683
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,800
How can you push me like this?

684
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,320
Really.

685
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,360
How can you always do this?

686
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:49,920
Right?

687
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,760
How can you...

688
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,960
Are you really my grandma?

689
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,960
Yes, it's your grandma.

690
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,160
Grandma, stop making trouble.

691
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,560
Grandma, stop making trouble.

692
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,560
Grandma, listen to Xiaomi.

693
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,160
What do you think of her?

694
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:03,880
Grandma, what do you think of her?

695
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,360
Okay?

696
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,200
Xiaomi!

697
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,280
Xiaomi!

698
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,040
I'm so happy!

699
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,760
I miss you so much!

700
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,560
Why are you here?

701
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,000
Xiaomi, what's wrong?

702
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,520
I miss you so much!

703
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,400
I miss you so much!

704
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,120
I miss you so much!

705
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:26,880
Xiaomi!

706
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,920
I miss you so much!

707
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,520
Teacher!

708
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,520
Mom, I'm here to see grandma out.

709
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,520
You see?

710
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,520
She's still in class.

711
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,200
Come to see me next time, okay?

712
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,240
Okay, okay, grandma.

713
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:40,800
I'll listen to you.

714
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,640
You can do whatever grandma says.

715
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:45,720
Come.

716
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,880
Let me see your red bag.

717
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,200
I'll come here to play with you.

718
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,400
Please, please, please.

719
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,200
See?

720
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,400
Teachers, I'm her new grandma.

721
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,920
Okay, grandma, I'm leaving.

722
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,600
See you later.

723
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,320
Bye-bye.

724
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,600
Bye-bye.

725
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,960
Happy?

726
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,720
Bye-bye.

727
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,320
Mom.

728
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,240
What are you doing?

729
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,040
I'm giving you a red bag.

730
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,120
Help me.

731
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,040
I'm keeping it for you.

732
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,360
Okay.

733
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,560
Mom, you should go home.

734
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,400
I'll come inside, please, okay?

735
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,320
Teacher, hurry up.

736
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,120
Xiaomi!

737
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,360
Listen to me.

738
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,760
Mom, I got it!

739
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,200
Mom, you're back.

740
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,200
Where's your son?

741
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,200
Mom, you're back.

742
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,200
Xiao Xiao bought you a lot of gifts.

743
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,200
Yes, I picked these for you.

744
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,200
Take my son's money as a favor.

745
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,200
Go, go, go.

746
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,200
Go, go, go.

747
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,200
Mom, Xiao Xiao is...

748
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,200
You're not feeling well. I'll go to bed.

749
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,200
She's not feeling well.

750
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,200
You little bitch.

751
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,200
What are you doing?

752
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,200
You're back.

753
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,200
You're blind.

754
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,200
Who's going to hit you?

755
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,200
Where did you go?

756
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,200
I know that Xiao Mi is pregnant.

757
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,200
I went to see Xiao Mi.

758
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,200
I was so scared.

759
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,200
I was like,

760
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,200
Grandma, grandma, grandma.

761
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,200
I was so scared.

762
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,200
It's because of her.

763
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,200
If it wasn't for that person,

764
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,200
I would have been so confused

765
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,200
to go see Xiao Mi.

766
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,200
Xiao Mi would be by my side every day.

767
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,200
What are you talking about?

768
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,200
You agreed on it yourself.

769
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,200
Back then,

770
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,200
Xu Kai was so happy.

771
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,200
Xu Kai was a girl.

772
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,200
He was born.

773
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,200
He was a boy.

774
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,200
Besides,

775
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,200
he's been pregnant for three years.

776
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,200
Well, well,

777
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,200
he's pregnant but he can't.

778
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,200
Don't talk about the child.

779
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,200
Mom, isn't that the thing?

780
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,200
He's sick.

781
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,200
Mom, this is the wish.

782
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,200
He can't achieve it.

783
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,200
It's almost done.

784
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,200
I have a project to visit his uncle.

785
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,200
You can talk about it.

786
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,200
Mom, you're happy today.

787
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,200
He's still okay with my attitude.

788
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,200
You talk to him.

789
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,200
Tell him to bring back

790
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,200
Xiao Mi's health.

791
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,200
I've said it.

792
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,200
He said

793
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,200
we have to re-company the property.

794
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,200
How could he do that?

795
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,200
What do you mean by re-company the property?

796
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,200
He's out of his mind.

797
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,200
Can the property be re-companyed?

798
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,200
Yes, he's out of his mind.

799
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,200
How can he re-company the child?

800
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,200
You're so stupid.

801
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,200
You're not a good person.

802
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,200
How about you divorce

803
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,200
and get married with Xu Kai Xin?

804
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,200
Then you can have a baby.

805
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,200
What nonsense are you talking about?

806
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,200
What nonsense?

807
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,200
What's the family?

808
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,200
We have to have a child.

809
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,200
What's the family without a child?

810
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,200
Enough.

811
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,200
You're a murderer.

812
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,200
I'm so happy.

813
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,200
I'm so happy.

814
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,200
Xu Kai Xin.

815
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,200
If you had a half of Xiao Mi's heart,

816
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,200
you would have killed her.

817
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,200
You're just like me.

818
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,200
We're a family with a half of her heart.

819
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,200
We're all together.

820
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,200
We're all in Xiao Mi's belly.

821
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,200
I'm not that kind of person.

822
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,200
I'm not that kind of person.

823
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,200
I'm not that kind of person.

824
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,200
I'm not that kind of person.

825
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,200
I'm not that kind of person.

826
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,200
I'm not that kind of person.

827
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,200
But Qian Hao is the most famous person.

828
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,200
He loves his mom so much.

829
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,200
He loves himself.

830
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,200
He must have a purpose for his business.

831
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,200
At that time,

832
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,200
he would be in a great danger.

833
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,200
He would be disappointed.

834
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,200
But he can't stop this.

835
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,200
The more you stop him, the more you'll get hurt.

836
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,200
That's like I had to marry Qian Hao.

837
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,200
He was the same.

838
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,200
And he didn't get blinded.

839
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,200
It's not your fault.

840
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,200
Qian Hao is good at acting

841
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,200
and acting.

842
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,200
We old classmates

843
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,200
don't think he's a scumbag.

844
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,200
What do you mean?

845
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,200
You can meet him

846
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,200
when you say goodbye.

847
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,200
You just be the bitter of love.

848
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,200
You'll be the light of his light.

849
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,200
You'll be the light of his light.

850
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,200
I think

851
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,200
love is the essence of that flower.

852
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,200
I've entered the bitter of love.

853
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,200
I'm not being deceived by jealousy.

854
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,200
What should we do?

855
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,200
We can't find him.

856
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,200
How can we?

857
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,200
We should find him.

858
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,200
I don't know.

859
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,200
But

860
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,200
we should find him in the future.

861
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,200
We can find him in movies,

862
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,200
in travel,

863
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,200
and we can find him when he's happy.

864
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,200
I'm getting a cold.

865
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,200
Where's Zheng Jing?

866
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,200
He's meeting you.

867
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,200
He's meeting you.

868
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,200
It's 6 p.m.

869
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,200
I'm warning you.

870
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,200
Don't be so strict.

871
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,200
You're making me lie again.

872
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,200
Xu Kai Xin is now.

873
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,200
No one knows who's lying.

874
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,200
Mr. Xu, welcome.

875
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,200
Xu Kai Xin.

876
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,200
Mr. Mei Qing, right?

877
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,200
Yes.

878
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,200
I'm glad to see you.

879
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,200
Please sit.

880
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,200
Mr. Mei, right?

881
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,200
Yes.

882
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,200
I'm glad to see you.

883
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,200
Please sit.

884
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,200
Well,

885
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,200
Mr. Mei,

886
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,200
what would you like to eat?

887
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,200
Well,

888
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,200
I don't need it.

889
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,200
I'm full.

890
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,200
Would you like to order something to drink?

891
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,200
Well,

892
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,200
I'd like a cup of water.

893
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,200
No, thanks.

894
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,200
Okay.

895
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,200
Hello, Mr. Mei.

896
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,200
Hello, Mr. Mei.

897
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,200
Hello, Mr. Mei.

898
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,200
Hello, Mr. Mei.

899
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,200
Okay, you've been riding for several times.

900
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,200
Okay.

901
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,200
Okay.

902
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,200
Hello, Mr. Mei.

903
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,200
Hello, Mr. Mei.

904
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,200
Hello,

905
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,200
please sit.

906
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,200
Please sit.

907
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,200
I'm about to start.

908
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,200
What's your father's name?

909
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:02,200
My father's father's name is Grandpa.

910
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,200
What's your father's brother's name?

911
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:09,200
My father's brother's name is Uncle.

912
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,200
What's your father's wife's name?

913
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,200
My father's wife's name is Mom.

914
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,200
Oh, right.

915
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,200
Sorry.

916
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,200
The game is over.

917
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,200
I've got to make this call.

918
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,200
Okay.

919
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,200
Who's that?

920
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,200
Yu,

921
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,200
I saw you eating outside.

922
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,200
Is this your daughter?

923
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,200
You're not even a single child.

924
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,200
We're family.

925
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,200
You see,

926
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,200
you're going out to have a date.

927
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,200
I won't teach you.

928
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,200
I'm not going out.

929
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,200
I'm going out.

930
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,200
I'm going out.

931
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,200
I'm going out.

932
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,200
I'm going out.

933
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,200
I'm going out.

934
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,200
I'm going out.

935
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,200
I'm going out.

936
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,200
I'm going out.

937
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,200
I'm going out.

938
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,200
I'm going out.

939
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,200
