1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,780
maybe

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,280
oh

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:21,280
We are face-lives problems always

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:30,280
Beautiful moments happen along the way

5
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:41,280
I see your pen as your bray-ray too

6
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:54,280
And some things we cannot just embrace

7
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:02,280
And there's no time to guess the ground above

8
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:12,280
Create a daylight, go to the free

9
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,280
Let's cross the wind, dancing rain

10
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,280
Let the stars in the moonlight wane

11
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,280
Oh, this is face happiness

12
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,280
They are all bought off with Johnny

13
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,280
How years have passed since we first met

14
00:01:51,280 --> 00:02:04,280
You thought he was young girl

15
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,280
I'm coming

16
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,280
Future son can't do this

17
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,280
Don't block my way

18
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,080
Xiao Qiao, I don't know anything about your uncle and mom.

19
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,280
We don't care about this matter.

20
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,480
How about this? You pack your things and go back with Qian.

21
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,280
No, uncle.

22
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,280
She made a mistake.

23
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,280
But I can't teach her about this matter.

24
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,280
You can do it yourself.

25
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,280
Uncle, uncle.

26
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,280
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,280
You're so angry.

28
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,280
You said you couldn't save her for the rest of your life.

29
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,280
How could she miss me?

30
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,280
I didn't hurt you.

31
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,280
You're just a whore.

32
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,280
You don't have anyone else.

33
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,280
No, I won't.

34
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,280
I just brought her a good wine.

35
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,280
I'm not at home.

36
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,280
Don't act.

37
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,280
Go back.

38
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,280
What do you mean?

39
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,280
Qian Hao, don't pretend.

40
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,280
I've heard what you said.

41
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,280
You've been with me for a long time.

42
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,280
You've been enough for me.

43
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,280
If it wasn't for my uncle,

44
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,280
and my family,

45
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,280
you wouldn't want to talk to me.

46
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,280
And you even scolded me for being a little bitch.

47
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,280
I know that.

48
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,280
You don't want to touch me.

49
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,280
You can't even take your mom,

50
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,280
or your child,

51
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,280
and you're still in touch with Xu Kai Xin.

52
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,280
I'm telling you, Qian Hao,

53
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,280
I'm not a person who's dead.

54
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,280
We're divorced.

55
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,280
You and Xu Kai Xin just got married.

56
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,280
You're family is so beautiful.

57
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,280
I don't have a single mom.

58
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,280
Where are you going?

59
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,280
When will I...

60
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,280
Look at your phone.

61
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,280
I'm looking at it.

62
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,280
I'm wearing a dress.

63
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,280
Look, don't take your phone.

64
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,280
I didn't say that to you.

65
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,280
Look.

66
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,280
Impossible.

67
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,280
Absolutely impossible.

68
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,280
I...

69
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,280
If it wasn't for

70
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,280
not letting her family

71
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,280
have a better wife than Xu Kai Xin,

72
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,280
her uncle would have helped me in the world.

73
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,280
I wouldn't have divorced Xu Kai Xin.

74
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,280
No, no, no.

75
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,280
This is definitely a misunderstanding.

76
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,280
I've had enough.

77
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,280
I don't have any sense of art.

78
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,280
I don't remember what I said.

79
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,280
This is a misunderstanding.

80
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,280
A man has had enough.

81
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,280
He's willing to blow some balls.

82
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,280
Right?

83
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,280
This is definitely not a real idea.

84
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,280
No, no.

85
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,280
Trust me.

86
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,280
Don't touch me.

87
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,280
Don't touch me.

88
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,280
Let go of me.

89
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,280
Qian He.

90
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,280
You dare to do it in front of me?

91
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,280
No.

92
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,280
I don't know.

93
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,280
I have everything in my hands.

94
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,280
I can't even touch it.

95
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,280
This is for you to wear.

96
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,280
Who asked you to wear?

97
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,280
Enough.

98
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,280
The door is open.

99
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,280
Why did you make it so loud?

100
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,280
You made Lin Yi Qu hear it.

101
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,280
He thought something was wrong.

102
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,280
Take all the clothes and wine.

103
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,280
You two go back to your home and solve the problem.

104
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,280
Go.

105
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,280
Uncle, mom, I'm not going back.

106
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,280
I'm sorry.

107
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,280
I told you.

108
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,280
You two go back to your home.

109
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,280
I'm not going back.

110
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,280
Hurry up.

111
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,280
Don't go.

112
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,280
Mom, I'm sorry.

113
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,280
Mom, I'm sorry.

114
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,280
You go back.

115
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,280
I'm sorry.

116
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,280
Where's Yu Yan?

117
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,280
Come.

118
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,280
Dad, come back.

119
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,280
Dad.

120
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,280
Let's go home.

121
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,280
Are you going to be good today?

122
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,280
Yes.

123
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,280
Come.

124
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,280
I'm going to report to the police.

125
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,280
Mom, you've worked hard.

126
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,280
Take them back first.

127
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,280
You two can have a good rest.

128
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,280
Okay.

129
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,280
Let's go home.

130
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,280
We'll be back in a day.

131
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,280
How about we go back to dinner?

132
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,280
Yes.

133
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,280
We'll have dinner.

134
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,280
No.

135
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,280
We can just eat dinner.

136
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,280
We'll talk to my grandfather.

137
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,280
Goodbye, baby.

138
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,280
Goodbye, grandpa.

139
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,280
Goodbye.

140
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,280
Goodbye.

141
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,280
Okay.

142
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,280
I'll go.

143
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,280
Goodbye.

144
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,280
Goodbye, aunt.

145
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,280
Goodbye, aunt.

146
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,280
I'm going.

147
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,280
Okay.

148
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,280
Take care.

149
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,280
I was so angry with you

150
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,280
when I pushed you away.

151
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,280
I'm not safe now.

152
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,280
It's late.

153
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,280
Why are you talking nonsense?

154
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,280
I'm not.

155
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,280
Stop it.

156
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,280
Enough.

157
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,280
You two can have a rest.

158
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,280
Talk to your grandfather.

159
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,280
I'm satisfied.

160
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,280
You two can have a rest.

161
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,280
You two take care.

162
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,280
Okay.

163
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,280
Hurry up.

164
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,280
Dad, you haven't hugged me for a long time.

165
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,280
Dad, I want you to hug me.

166
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,280
No, hug me.

167
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,280
I'm your sister.

168
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,280
Hug me first.

169
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,280
I'm telling you.

170
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,280
You can't hug me.

171
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,280
You have to hug me.

172
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,280
Dad, you said you hugged me

173
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,280
and you hugged my sister.

174
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,280
Dad, if you don't hug me,

175
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,280
I'll be angry.

176
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,280
Okay.

177
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,280
Let's hug each other.

178
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,280
Okay?

179
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,280
Come on.

180
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,280
Great.

181
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,280
Let's do it.

182
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,280
Come on.

183
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,280
Dad, are you okay?

184
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,280
Are you okay?

185
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,280
Hurry up.

186
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,280
Hurry up.

187
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,280
Dad.

188
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,280
Dad, I'm so tired.

189
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,280
Dad, are you okay?

190
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,280
Dad.

191
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,280
It's okay.

192
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,280
It's okay.

193
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,280
Dad, are you okay?

194
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,280
It's okay.

195
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,280
Dad, I'm so tired.

196
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,280
Are you okay?

197
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,280
I'm okay.

198
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,280
Sit down.

199
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,280
Sit down.

200
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,280
Turn around.

201
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,280
What's wrong with you?

202
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,280
What's wrong with you?

203
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,280
What's wrong with you?

204
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,280
What's wrong with you?

205
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,280
Xiao Mi.

206
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,280
Don't.

207
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,280
Don't touch me.

208
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,280
Don't touch me.

209
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,280
Don't touch me.

210
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,280
I'm doing my homework.

211
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,280
Okay.

212
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,280
Okay.

213
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,280
Sister, you did your homework.

214
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,280
Don't touch me.

215
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,280
Don't touch me.

216
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,280
Don't touch me.

217
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,280
Xiao Mi, don't touch me.

218
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,280
Don't touch me.

219
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,280
Don't touch me.

220
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,280
Don't touch me.

221
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,280
I'm begging you.

222
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,280
I'm begging you.

223
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,280
Xu Kai Xin, your son.

224
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,280
Qin Yang Mi.

225
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,280
Yi Yi.

226
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,280
Don't touch me.

227
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,280
Don't touch me.

228
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,280
Xu Kai Xin, you're good.

229
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,280
You're so thoughtful.

230
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,280
If the expert knows you're a dangerous child,

231
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,280
you'll be in trouble.

232
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,280
What's the point of this?

233
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,280
It's a suggestion.

234
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,280
Less advice from the expert.

235
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,280
Yi Yi,

236
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,280
the child has been a good girl since she was a child.

237
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,280
After she grew up,

238
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,280
others will treat her as a good girl.

239
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,280
You're so good.

240
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,280
Did Mei Chun Yi contact you?

241
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,280
No.

242
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,280
She won't be able to run away.

243
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,280
She didn't eat the food.

244
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,280
She won't call the police.

245
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,280
Don't laugh.

246
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,280
I think I'm a very polite person.

247
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,280
You're so energetic.

248
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,280
You're so good.

249
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,280
You're always like this.

250
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,280
You're always like this.

251
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,280
Xiaobin.

252
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,280
You're looking for me again?

253
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,280
You're here.

254
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,280
It's time to eat.

255
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,280
Red hair boiled water.

256
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,280
Egg and a wave.

257
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,280
You're good at singing.

258
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,280
But when you're in the exam,

259
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,280
you can't use it.

260
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,280
Dad,

261
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,280
what's wrong with your face?

262
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,280
Did you get hurt?

263
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,280
Where?

264
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,280
In the car.

265
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,280
Dad, you...

266
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,280
Are you okay?

267
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,280
No, I'm not.

268
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,280
Come on, let's eat.

269
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,280
What's wrong with you?

270
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,280
I'll get you some shoes.

271
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,280
Mom!

272
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,280
Mom!

273
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,280
You're back!

274
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,280
What's this?

275
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,280
I specially asked you to come.

276
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,280
This is official work.

277
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,280
You're back from the official work?

278
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,280
What do you mean?

279
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,280
What do you mean?

280
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,280
You're so polite.

281
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,280
What do you mean?

282
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,280
You're...

283
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,280
What's wrong?

284
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,280
What's wrong?

285
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,280
What's wrong?

286
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,280
You're so rude.

287
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,280
I'll get you some shoes.

288
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,280
I'll get you some shoes.

289
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,280
I'll get you some shoes.

290
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,280
I'm so sorry.

291
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,280
Mom, what are you doing?

292
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,280
What are you doing?

293
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,280
What are you doing?

294
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,280
I'm telling you.

295
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,280
These things

296
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,280
are going to be transferred to the company.

297
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,280
Mom, I told you

298
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,280
that you've never heard of it.

299
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,280
You know what?

300
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,280
You're going to get a job.

301
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,280
You're going to get a job.

302
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,280
You're going to get a job.

303
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,280
You're going to get a job.

304
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,280
We're going to get a job.

305
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,280
I spent $20,000.

306
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,280
I didn't use your money.

307
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,280
You're going to get a job.

308
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,280
What's wrong with you?

309
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,280
What's wrong with you?

310
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,280
You're so rude.

311
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,280
What's wrong with you?

312
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,280
Calm down.

313
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,280
Calm down.

314
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,280
Calm down.

315
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,280
Calm down.

316
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,280
Are you going to kill me?

317
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,280
Calm down.

318
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,280
Calm down.

319
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,280
Calm down.

320
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,280
Calm down.

321
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,280
Calm down.

322
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,280
Calm down.

323
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,280
Calm down.

324
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,280
What time is it?

325
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,280
It's 1 p.m.

326
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,280
It's been a long day.

327
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,280
I've been busy.

328
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,280
I've got a lot of orders.

329
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,280
You finished all the dishes?

330
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,280
You didn't finish them?

331
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,280
I finished them.

332
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,280
I was so happy to have your son.

333
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,280
I'll pay for the cake later.

334
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,280
I'll pay for it.

335
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,280
I've got it all cleaned up.

336
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,280
Now, the house is in a hurry.

337
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,280
So he won't make it difficult for us.

338
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,280
You can only take the eggs on the top.

339
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,280
How can I take the eggs on the top?

340
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,280
I've made up my mind.

341
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,280
I'm going to go back to the subway station.

342
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,280
Anyway, we don't have a car.

343
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,280
I'll wait for the photo.

344
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,280
I'll take the back seat.

345
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,280
I'll take a little red dress.

346
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,280
I'll make some cakes and sandwiches.

347
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,280
I've arranged it.

348
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,280
It's two hours.

349
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,280
There's a little 500 in the water.

350
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,280
And these orders on the line.

351
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,280
800.

352
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,280
200 for the cost.

353
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,280
One month is 20,000 yuan.

354
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,280
Okay.

355
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,280
I'm not going to pay.

356
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,280
It's hard to say.

357
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,280
It turns from the owner

358
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,280
to the business owner.

359
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,280
When the classmate is talking,

360
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,280
he's still laughing at me.

361
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,280
He's so handsome.

362
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,280
I'm telling you.

363
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,280
You know what you're talking about?

364
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,280
You know the cash flow.

365
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,280
Now the business is changing.

366
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,280
The big deal is the high-end.

367
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,280
The few M-class classmates

368
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,280
are so bright.

369
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,280
In fact,

370
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,280
if it's a house loan,

371
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,280
if it's a car loan,

372
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,280
what's the reason for it?

373
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,280
It's worth it.

374
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,280
Do you want to go to the classmate's wedding?

375
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,280
Of course I want to.

376
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,280
Why not?

377
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,280
I'm not the one who goes out.

378
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,280
I'm afraid of them.

379
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,280
I'll go too.

380
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,280
I'll warn the police.

381
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,280
Song Ran is not here to disturb me.

382
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,280
Song Ran?

383
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,280
What a old name.

384
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,280
You two are in touch.

385
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,280
It's just that...

386
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,280
It's just that...

387
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,280
I don't know why.

388
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,280
Why did I suddenly get my wire?

389
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,280
And then...

390
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,280
I got it.

391
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,280
I got it.

392
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,280
I got it.

393
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,280
And then I got it.

394
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,280
And then I...

395
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,280
I don't know what to do.

396
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,280
I don't know what to do.

397
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,280
Look at your virtue.

398
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,280
Are you going to get your old love back?

399
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,280
How is that possible?

400
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,280
I'm that kind of person who doesn't know anything.

401
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,280
He and Qian Hao

402
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,280
were wearing a nice pants that year.

403
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,280
When Qian Hao went out,

404
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,280
he didn't have much.

405
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,280
He was a big-eyed man.

406
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,280
He was a big-eyed man.

407
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,280
And he was a black man.

408
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,280
What kind of a good thing was he?

409
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,280
It's all because of you.

410
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,280
I really envy you.

411
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,280
You say it, you say it.

412
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,280
You say it's like a 250-year-old man.

413
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,280
He was severely hurt by love.

414
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,280
But he still can

415
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,280
be so kind and silly.

416
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,280
He's a big-eyed man.

417
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,280
You envy me?

418
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,280
Did you get your parents' wedding again?

419
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,280
You guessed it.

420
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,280
This time, it's more intense.

421
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,280
Do you know what my mom said?

422
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,280
My mom said that men are not important.

423
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,280
Marriage is okay if you get married.

424
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,280
As long as you have a child,

425
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,280
it's not that they're helping me.

426
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,280
No, they're crazy.

427
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,280
So I'm going to leave the house

428
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,280
and fight with them in the dark.

429
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,280
So you guessed it.

430
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,280
That's why I know

431
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,280
it's probably the tacit understanding of the ghost.

432
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,280
I know you'll welcome me

433
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,280
to stay at the house for a long time.

434
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,280
I'm so happy.

435
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,280
What's up?

436
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,280
Your niece is in our house now.

437
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,280
She said it's your life.

438
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,280
Xu Tianxian, you're a dog.

439
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,280
We're going to be in a bad team today.

440
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,280
We're going to be in trouble.

441
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,280
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you.

442
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,280
Take it out.

443
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,280
I'll take it out.

444
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,280
See you later.

445
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,280
I'll take it out.

446
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,280
Besides the basic illness,

447
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,280
you're not really...

448
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,280
Just pay attention to the mood.

449
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,280
Don't be too loud.

450
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,280
It's a little bit of a joke, right?

451
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,280
It's nothing.

452
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,280
It's just a blood sugar.

453
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,280
Just drink some grape syrup later.

454
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,280
But this pregnant woman

455
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,280
can't afford to lose weight.

456
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,280
She's still young.

457
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,280
The blood sugar test this morning

458
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,280
is only four weeks old.

459
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,280
The fetus hasn't been stable yet.

460
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,280
Pay attention to the patient.

461
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,280
If you're in a fight,

462
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,280
you'll have it.

463
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,280
Don't be too loud.

464
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,280
Doctor, who's pregnant?

465
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,280
Auntie, just you two patients.

466
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,280
You're over 60.

467
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,280
How can I say you're pregnant?

468
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,280
De'er.

469
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,280
You mean...

470
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,280
Hu Xiaojiao is pregnant?

471
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,280
The test report of this hospital

472
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,280
is all recorded.

473
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,280
The patient came this morning to do the test.

474
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,280
What?

475
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,280
Didn't she tell you the good news?

476
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,280
Good news, good news.

477
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,280
Good news.

478
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,280
I'm telling you.

479
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,280
Son,

480
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,280
the work is so hard.

481
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,280
I haven't worked for a long time.

482
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,280
I'm pregnant.

483
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,280
I'm pregnant.

484
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,280
I'm pregnant.

485
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,280
Thank you.

486
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,280
I'm pregnant.

487
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,280
I'm not pregnant.

488
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,280
It's okay.

489
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,280
I'm pregnant.

490
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,280
Doctor.

491
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,280
Can you tell me

492
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,280
if a boy and a girl can see this?

493
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,280
This is the girl.

494
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,280
I think our son and that boy

495
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,280
are in a good relationship.

496
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,280
I didn't expect

497
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,280
that a girl from this family

498
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,280
would be so confident.

499
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,280
He didn't.

500
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,280
We're in a bad relationship.

501
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,280
What can we do?

502
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,280
If I were him,

503
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,280
Xiao Xi and You You

504
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,280
wouldn't have a good relationship.

505
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,280
I'm not sure.

506
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,280
I'm sure.

507
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,280
Xiao Xi and You You

508
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,280
don't have a good relationship.

509
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,280
But You You

510
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,280
is a little strange.

511
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,280
I told him to be a doctor.

512
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,280
He just lied to me.

513
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,280
Now he's fine.

514
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,280
He's fine.

515
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,280
He's still angry.

516
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,280
I'm sorry.

517
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,280
I'm sorry.

518
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,280
It's over.

519
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,280
You can't say that.

520
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,280
Although Xiao Xi passed the first level,

521
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,280
the first level of the original entertainment

522
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,280
hasn't passed.

523
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,280
Especially since he has two children.

524
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,280
If he doesn't have a child with us,

525
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,280
it's useless to be so good.

526
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,280
You mean?

527
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,280
We still have to keep it in mind.

528
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,280
Next time,

529
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,280
we'll take a look at the two children together.

530
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,280
That makes sense.

531
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,280
I'll go ask You You again.

532
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,280
What does that mean?

533
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,280
Don't ask.

534
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,280
I'll ask.

535
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,280
I'll ask you two to make it up.

536
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,280
I'll ask you.

537
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,280
Dad, is this the place?

538
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,280
No, it's the next one.

539
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,280
No, it's the next one.

540
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,280
This one?

541
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,280
Left. Left.

542
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,280
This one.

543
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,280
This one.

544
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,280
It's okay.

545
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,280
Give it to me.

546
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,280
I'll do it myself.

547
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,280
Is it mine?

548
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,280
Go ahead.

549
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,280
Go ahead.

550
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,280
I'll just have to return it.

551
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,280
Okay.

552
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,280
Go ahead.

553
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,280
Go ahead.

554
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,280
Are you done?

555
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,280
Okay.

556
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,280
I'm sorry.

557
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,280
Dad.

558
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,280
Chen Yi,

559
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,280
let Xiao Xu bring two children to our house next week.

560
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,280
We'll see each other again.

561
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,280
No,

562
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,280
it's not necessary, dad.

563
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,280
What is it?

564
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,280
Can Yu An and Yule

565
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,280
and their children come together?

566
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,280
It's very important.

567
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,280
That's the final decision.

568
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,280
When we first got married,

569
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,280
I honestly said that

570
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,280
even if it's the second marriage,

571
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,280
it must be because of love.

572
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,280
But tonight,

573
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,280
I honestly faced my own problem.

574
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,280
I found out that

575
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,280
the unmarried girl in middle school

576
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,280
doesn't deserve her love.

577
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,280
I can't tell what kind of

578
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,280
emotional emotion it is.

579
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,280
A 20-year-old unmarried girl

580
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,280
can be in love with a girl

581
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,280
who is on the mountain and is in the lake.

582
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,280
A 20-year-old unmarried girl

583
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,280
is like a coward.

584
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,280
If Yu An and Xu Kai

585
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,280
can be together,

586
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,280
can they overcome

587
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,280
the pressure of the two-in-two group?

588
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,280
If the answer is no,

589
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,280
how can I explain

590
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,280
the question of the time-lapse?

591
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,280
The first time I met Yu An

592
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,280
was when I was a kid.

593
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,280
I was a little bit nervous

594
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,280
when I first met her.

595
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,280
I was very nervous

596
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,280
when I first met her.

597
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,280
I was very nervous

598
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,280
when I first met her.

599
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,280
I was very nervous

600
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,280
when I first met her.

601
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,280
I was very nervous

602
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,280
when I first met her.

603
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,280
I was very nervous

604
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,280
when I first met her.

605
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,280
I was very nervous

606
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,280
when I first met her.

607
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,280
I was very nervous

608
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,280
when I first met her.

609
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,280
What's wrong?

610
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,280
Did you fight with Xuai Xiao?

611
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,280
Did you get kicked out?

612
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,280
Lin Xiao Xiao,

613
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,280
sleeping with a mosquito is too scary.

614
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,280
There were also

615
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,280
so many adventures last night.

616
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,280
I was lying on the food plate

617
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,280
Everyone in the room is looking at me.

618
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,280
I'm so tired.

619
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,280
I'm so tired.

620
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,280
I'm so tired.

621
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,280
What do you want to tell me?

622
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,280
Nothing.

623
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,280
Are you in love?

624
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,280
You're so big.

625
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,280
What does it have to do with you?

626
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,280
You and Li Xiaoxiao,

627
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,280
the two big sisters,

628
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,280
we're all about to know.

629
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,280
I'm listening to you.

630
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,280
I'm going to be a deaf.

631
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,280
Actually,

632
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,280
it's not like we're in love yet.

633
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,280
You're just a loving wife.

634
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,280
Do you have a picture?

635
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,280
Next,

636
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,280
I guess

637
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,280
you're in love with me.

638
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,280
But I'm not.

639
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,280
I'm not in love with you.

640
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,280
You're even more handsome than me.

641
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,280
Fine, fine.

642
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,280
All right.

643
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,280
Go to bed.

644
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,280
You have to get up in the middle of the night

645
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,280
and get your exams.

646
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,280
Sleep more.

647
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,280
Sleep more.

648
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,280
Mom.

649
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,280
I'm not scared.

650
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,280
Xiaojiao, you're finally awake.

651
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,280
We're really worried about you.

652
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,280
You're so pregnant.

653
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,280
You don't even tell Qianhao about it.

654
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,280
You must want to give us a big surprise, right?

655
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,280
I don't want it.

656
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,280
I don't want it.

657
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,280
I don't want it.

658
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,280
I don't know.

659
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,280
You're pregnant now.

660
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,280
Let's try our best in the future.

661
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,280
It's okay.

662
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,280
We're divorced.

663
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,280
We're divorced.

664
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,280
We're divorced.

665
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,280
We're divorced.

666
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,280
We're not divorced.

667
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,280
We're divorced.

668
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,280
You're my pregnant woman.

669
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,280
You're my pregnant woman.

670
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,280
I can hug my grandchild.

671
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:42,280
Xiaojiao, you're so hardworking.

672
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,280
Mom.

673
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,280
Xiaojiao is pregnant.

674
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,280
She needs a rest.

675
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,280
Xiaojiao, go to bed.

676
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,280
Get some rest.

677
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,280
I'll make you some food tomorrow morning.

678
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,280
Thank you, sister.

679
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,280
Thank you for everything.

680
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,280
I'll take a rest over there.

681
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,280
Qianhao.

682
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,280
I know I'm sorry.

683
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,280
If you're willing to divorce,

684
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,280
I can accept it.

685
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,280
I heard it, mom.

686
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,280
I said if you're willing to divorce,

687
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,280
I can accept it.

688
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,280
I heard it, mom.

689
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,280
I said if you're willing to divorce,

690
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,280
I can accept it.

691
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,280
I'm sorry.

692
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,280
I'm sorry.

693
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,280
I'm sorry.

694
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,280
I'm sorry.

695
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,280
Mom.

696
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,280
You're back.

697
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,280
You're still early.

698
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,280
You're so sleepy.

699
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,280
You played with your classmate last night.

700
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,280
I'm not sleepy.

701
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,280
I can't sleep.

702
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,280
I'm sorry.

703
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,280
You're back early.

704
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,280
Hello, brother-in-law.

705
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,280
Youyou, I'm not good at talking to you.

706
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,280
I'm not good at talking to you.

707
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,280
If you have time,

708
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,280
you can send them to the kindergarten.

709
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,280
What a coincidence.

710
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,280
Okay, I know.

711
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,280
Your brother-in-law.

712
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,280
What's wrong?

713
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,280
Let me borrow Yu'an and Le.

714
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,280
He was in a bad mood yesterday.

715
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,280
He's injured his waist.

716
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,280
He's injured his waist?

717
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,280
Okay.

718
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,280
Let's eat.

719
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,280
I'm sorry.

720
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,280
I'm sorry.

721
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,280
You're so...

722
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:32,280
Youyou, did you misunderstand something?

723
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,280
Brother-in-law, you don't have to explain anything to me.

724
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,280
But I don't think you need to lie to me.

725
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,280
It's nothing to do with Xu Kaiqing.

726
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,280
He's just here to help.

727
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,280
Is that it?

728
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,280
What?

729
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,280
I just think you're sorry to my sister.

730
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,280
Of course you can find her.

731
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:56,280
But don't try to be too hard on my sister.

732
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,280
You can't be too hard on other women.

733
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,280
What?

734
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,280
You're so rude.

735
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,280
No, I was just...

736
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,280
What's wrong?

737
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,280
Why are you still here?

738
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,280
I'm sorry.

739
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,280
I'm sorry.

740
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,280
Let's go.

741
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,280
Bye, brother-in-law.

742
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,280
Bye.

743
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,280
Bye.

744
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,280
Okay.

745
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,280
Xu Kaiqing.

746
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,280
Xiaojiao, mom, you scared me.

747
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,280
What are you doing?

748
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,280
Where are you going?

749
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,280
You have my grandson in your belly.

750
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,280
Don't leave.

751
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,280
What are you doing?

752
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,280
Money!

753
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,280
Son, come out!

754
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,280
Xiaojiao, he needs...

755
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,280
He has a baby in his belly.

756
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,280
It's okay, mom.

757
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,280
Don't worry.

758
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,280
He has a baby in his belly.

759
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,280
Xiaojiao, let me go.

760
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,280
Xiaojiao, let me go.

761
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,280
I'm sorry.

762
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,280
I'm sorry, mom.

763
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,280
You're so...

764
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,280
You...

765
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,280
Just calm down.

766
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,280
Or else, I...

767
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,280
I don't know what I'm doing.

768
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,280
I don't want to die.

769
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,280
I...

770
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:18,280
Xiaojiao, I know I'm sorry.

771
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,280
I...

772
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,280
I...

773
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,280
Don't touch me.

774
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,280
I told you to divorce.

775
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,280
Let go of me.

776
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,280
Don't touch me.

777
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,280
What do you want?

778
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,280
You brought me such a big pair of hats.

779
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,280
Of course, I have to thank you.

780
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,280
I'm not your grandson.

781
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,280
I'm not your grandson.

782
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,280
I was drunk that day.

783
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,280
I woke up and I was like that.

784
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,280
I didn't even know it.

785
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,280
I didn't want to let you down.

786
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,280
So I proposed to divorce.

787
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,280
Or else, you'd have agreed.

788
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,280
No.

789
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,280
What do you want?

790
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,280
I gave birth to a child.

791
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,280
Are you crazy?

792
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,280
I'm not crazy.

793
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,280
Are you crazy?

794
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,280
I know what I'm doing.

795
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,280
You said my mom had been a good girl.

796
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,280
You gave birth to a child.

797
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,280
Let her leave happily.

798
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,280
Then you can do whatever you want.

799
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,280
What should I do with the child?

800
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,280
I don't even know who her father is.

801
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,280
If I were to lie to your mom,

802
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,280
I would have to take them with me for the rest of my life.

803
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,280
Then who are you blaming?

804
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,280
You made a mistake.

805
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,280
Okay, I promise you.

806
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,280
I promise you.

807
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,280
Hu Xiaoqiao,

808
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,280
you can't go back now

809
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,280
and raise the child, right?

810
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,280
I'm warning you.

811
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,280
Think about it.

812
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,280
I'll be angry with you.

813
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,280
Don't think about using your uncle to fool me.

814
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,280
He's been doing things for me for the past two years.

815
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,280
I'm going to be so mad at him.

816
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,280
Qianhao, don't be like this.

817
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,280
I really love you.

818
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,280
Don't touch me.

819
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,280
Don't touch me.

820
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,280
Xiaoqiao,

821
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,280
He Hao,

822
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,280
don't quarrel.

823
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,280
It's bad for the child in your belly.

824
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,280
Mom, I'm fine.

825
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,280
Give me a break.

826
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,280
Mom,

827
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,280
we're fine. Don't worry.

828
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,280
Mom.

829
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,280
Mom.

830
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,280
Mom.

831
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,280
Mom.

832
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,280
You said you were the one

833
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,280
who introduced me to the man who rented my house.

834
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,280
Why don't you answer my phone now?

835
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,280
I've already paid

836
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,280
the rent I rented.

837
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,280
I've already paid the compensation.

838
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,280
You're not doing well in the house.

839
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,280
What?

840
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,280
He did give me some money,

841
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,280
but he just paid the compensation.

842
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,280
What?

843
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,280
He didn't even see your phone.

844
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,280
Is this a little bit of a deal?

845
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,280
Listen to me.

846
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,280
You're going to rent a house again.

847
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,280
You're going to rent a house and pay me a loan.

848
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,280
You're doing this for me, right?

849
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,280
If I continue to do this,

850
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,280
I'll be your son-in-law.

851
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,280
I'm not a son-in-law.

852
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,280
Xiaoxi,

853
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,280
I've been thinking about this.

854
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,280
We've been working together for years.

855
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,280
I've been renting a house for you.

856
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,280
It's a pleasure to work with you.

857
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,280
I'm so embarrassed to rent a house for others.

858
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,280
You're not doing well in the house.

859
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,280
You can't find the right place to live.

860
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,280
You've been doing this for years.

861
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,280
You're old and old.

862
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,280
It's a pity to move out.

863
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,280
You can continue to be my son-in-law.

864
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,280
I don't have money to pay for the business.

865
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,280
Okay?

866
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,280
Brother Bao,

867
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,280
is there anyone who wants to drive me out

868
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,280
because they want to rent a house?

869
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,280
No, no, no.

870
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,280
I just suddenly feel

871
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,280
that we still have feelings.

872
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,280
Since you have feelings,

873
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,280
you should rent a house.

874
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,280
Maybe you can still think about it when you're happy.

875
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,280
Okay, okay.

876
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,280
Okay, then.

877
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,280
I'll pay you 100 yuan.

878
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,280
Okay?

879
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,280
It's enough for me to pay you 100 yuan.

880
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,280
I'm not sure about this person.

881
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,280
The only advantage is that

882
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,280
I never live in the house.

883
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,280
No.

884
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,280
200 yuan.

885
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,280
200 yuan, okay?

886
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,280
200.

887
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,280
No.

888
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,280
What's 200?

889
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,280
I'll pay you 100 yuan.

890
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,280
This is my final limit.

891
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,280
I heard that someone wanted you to leave

892
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,280
because of the house.

893
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,280
But you left.

894
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,280
That person is so nice.

895
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,280
That's so weird.

896
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,280
So,

897
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,280
is it Qian Hao?

898
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,280
Let's go back and ask him.

899
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,280
Don't you know?

900
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,280
Come on.

901
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,280
Xiao Zheng, have some more.

902
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,280
The body needs nutrition the most.

903
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,280
I can't eat it.

904
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,280
I told you to eat.

905
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,280
Just eat.

906
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,280
No.

907
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,280
Eat yours.

908
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,280
Don't worry.

909
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,280
What's wrong with you?

910
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,280
He's not feeling well.

911
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,280
He's pregnant.

912
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,280
What's the difference?

913
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,280
When Xu Kai Xin was pregnant,

914
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,280
I didn't see you so close.

915
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,280
It's better to die than die.

916
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,280
Mom is feeling better.

917
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,280
It's time to hug.

918
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,280
Now, Xiaomi,

919
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,280
can you come back?

920
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,280
It's a problem.

921
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,280
Xiao Jiao is pregnant.

922
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,280
It's the God's opening.

923
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,280
If I can hug,

924
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,280
Qian's grandchild,

925
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,280
mom's dead,

926
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,280
okay, mom.

927
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,280
Don't die.

928
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,280
I'm not feeling well.

929
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,280
Mom.

930
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,280
You can definitely hug your grandchild.

931
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,280
I'll try harder for Xiaomi.

932
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,280
I'll go to our class reunion.

933
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,280
I'll talk to her.

934
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,280
I'm not feeling well.

935
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,280
I won't go to class reunion.

936
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,280
You go by yourself.

937
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,280
How can I?

938
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,280
Qian,

939
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,280
you're my wife.

940
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,280
You can go wherever I go.

941
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,280
Don't think about your friend.

942
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,280
Come on.

943
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,280
Let's eat.

944
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,280
Eat is the most important thing.

945
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,280
Come on.

946
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,280
The most important thing is your health.

947
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,280
Come on.

948
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,280
Eat.

949
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,280
Why is he so unmarried?

950
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,280
He's still pregnant.

951
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,280
He wants to give me a divorce.

952
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,280
He wants to make my shop go bankrupt.

953
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,280
He wants me to have two kids.

954
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,280
He's so stubborn.

955
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,280
When the class reunion is over,

956
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,280
I'll give him a hand.

957
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,280
He's my second brother.

958
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,280
I thought I'd give him a hand.

959
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,280
Since he doesn't want to give me a hand,

960
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,280
let's not talk about it.

961
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,280
I'll give him a hand.

962
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,280
I'll give him a hand.

963
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,280
I'll give him a hand.

964
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,280
If he doesn't want to give me a hand,

965
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,280
let's not talk about it.

966
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,280
What do you want?

967
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,280
I'll sue him.

968
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,280
We'll have a new divorce.

969
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,280
Qian is a cat in a iron machine.

970
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,280
I want to give him a hand.

971
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,280
I want to give him a hand.

972
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,280
Okay.

973
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,280
I'll give him a hand.

974
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,280
I'll give him a hand.

975
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,280
I'll give him a hand.

976
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,280
I'll give him a hand.
