1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'll count the birds

2
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Create a daylight

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Go to the free

4
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let's cross the wind

5
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Dancing ring at the stars in the room

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And night away

7
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
This is a fierce happiness

8
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Stay here all but hope for Johnny

9
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Story of Johnny

10
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 1

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
If you're angry again, I'll let you find it.

12
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Try it again.

13
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'll go to bed early.

14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Go.

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Honey.

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Do you want to be together?

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I can make breakfast for you.

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'll go to bed early.

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The Story of Johnny

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Episode 1

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The Story of Johnny

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Sister is back.

23
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Mom, mom is back.

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You can sleep on your own.

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'll go to bed early.

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Mom.

27
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay, okay, you can do it.

28
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Sister, did you live in my house?

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yes, I lived in the house I was a kid.

30
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I still remember.

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Why don't you remember?

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Because you're stupid.

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Sister, is dad's house fun?

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's fun when I was a kid.

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's not fun now.

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I won't go there anymore.

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Why?

38
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Because my house is not in my room.

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I can only sleep on the sofa.

40
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Why can't you sleep on the sofa?

41
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Is it because you didn't buy the money?

42
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
No, I have a lot of money.

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But dad doesn't love us.

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Dad doesn't love us?

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I don't love dad anyway.

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I only love mom.

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
No.

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I love sister.

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I love auntie.

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I love aunt Xiaoxia.

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I think you're right.

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I don't love dad anymore.

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Forget it.

54
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I just love dad a little bit.

55
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's getting cold.

56
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I think it's the two little pigs who haven't woken up yet.

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
They're coming to eat.

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
They're not woken up yet.

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
They're coming to eat.

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
We're so handsome.

61
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Let me see.

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
We're so handsome.

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You're so handsome.

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You said today is a sunny day.

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's all happy every day.

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You said you were happy.

67
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You said you wanted to be more happy.

68
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The rainbow must appear.

69
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I said I would be more happy with you.

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The sun will warm up a little bit.

71
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I think tomorrow is a wish.

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Open your heart.

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Even if life is wind and rain.

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm afraid of the weather.

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
A little more courage can pass.

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Give the future can pass.

77
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Give the future new self.

78
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Don't forget to be happy.

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The passionate eyes.

80
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Don't need to laugh.

81
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Don't laugh.

82
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Give the future new self.

83
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Happy is around you.

84
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Don't forget to be happy.

85
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The passionate eyes.

86
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Don't need to laugh.

87
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Don't need to laugh.

88
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The youth is around you.

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Can't run away.

90
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Can't run away.

91
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Can't run away.

92
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Can't run away.

93
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Is the celebration done?

94
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Yuanyu Le is so happy.

95
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Give the princess a thumbs up.

96
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yuanyu Le, come and eat.

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Eat quickly.

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Don't be late.

99
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
If you are not late,

100
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I will take you to eat fried chicken.

101
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's a feast.

102
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Great.

103
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Great.

104
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Eat quickly.

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yuanyu Le, come and see.

106
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Choose your clothes.

107
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I want to wear a white dress.

108
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I want to wear a square skirt.

109
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Choose a white dress.

110
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yellow looks good.

111
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
This one.

112
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
OK.

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Dad, this one.

114
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Hurry up.

115
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Hurry up.

116
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Go.

117
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yuanyu Le, wait.

118
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Let's go!

119
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Wait for a while!

120
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Let's take a photo together!

121
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Come on!

122
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Three, two, one, yeah!

123
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Okay, family wedding is the first one!

124
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Four, five, six, seven, eight!

125
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Let's go!

126
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The first day of the wedding

127
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Look, this is the design of our main house

128
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You should give it a try

129
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The first one

130
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The second one

131
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Come here

132
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Wait for a while

133
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What's wrong?

134
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I've changed the seven-day schedule

135
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
to the wedding date

136
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
That's my first date

137
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You can't move

138
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'll help you think it over

139
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Look, is the bedroom space big?

140
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
The chair is from the head office

141
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I've put a big chair on it

142
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
to ensure that you can put everything down

143
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
No, I don't agree

144
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You let them stop

145
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
to make me wear a hat

146
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
What do you mean?

147
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
My son came

148
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
and didn't have a second-hand room

149
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
to stay with us

150
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Then what?

151
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Yeah, that's not good

152
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
What about you?

153
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You have a study room?

154
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I have

155
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
All my work in the future

156
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
will be completed by the company

157
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
and I'll move it to a few places

158
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
and come back after that

159
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
No way

160
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Mom, give me a way

161
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Then I can only make a living

162
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I think my life is

163
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
a little bit lost

164
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Now we have a problem

165
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's easy to solve the problem

166
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
All the unnecessary things

167
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
and the necessary things

168
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
are all recorded

169
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You're so smart

170
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You must understand

171
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Good boy

172
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So I'm the one who has to do the work

173
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Forget it

174
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Isn't it just a hat?

175
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm sorry for you

176
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You should be sorry for me

177
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's a deal

178
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Mom, I like this

179
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I have a problem

180
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's like a dream, car

181
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Happy

182
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I still think that

183
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
the price is the lowest

184
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
and the performance is the highest

185
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
My sister said

186
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
that we can still do it

187
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
without a break

188
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Then the more the salary is,

189
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
the more suitable it is

190
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
to buy it

191
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
But I think this car is good

192
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
The car shape is linear

193
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
and the color is suitable

194
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Dami, which one do you think is good?

195
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Mom, I like this

196
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Mom, look

197
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
There is no such big sky window

198
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You can look at the stars here at night

199
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You can see the rain from the sky

200
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
from the top

201
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
This is the position of mom

202
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You sit here

203
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
We sit here

204
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I also want to put my favorite little bear here

205
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You can also put Mr. Kong Long here

206
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I want this

207
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
This is very expensive

208
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's over 20,000 yuan

209
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
This is for me

210
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Mom, I'm the best

211
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Let's go to the middle of the road

212
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Okay

213
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Take the car certificate and ID card

214
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
and pay half the temporary number plate

215
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
The car plate needs three days

216
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
We will give you a discount

217
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Do you need a discount?

218
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's okay

219
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
We can buy a car without a car certificate

220
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
We will drive the car back for you

221
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
After you finish the test, we will drive

222
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Okay

223
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Okay

224
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Since the atmosphere is so red

225
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
We must buy it today

226
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Let's go

227
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm happy to see you

228
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm happy to see you

229
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Let's go

230
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Okay, sister

231
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Let's go

232
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Okay

233
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Okay

234
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Let's go

235
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
One, two, three

236
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Two, three

237
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Okay

238
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
One, two, three

239
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
One, two, three

240
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Two, three

241
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
One, two, three

242
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
One, two, three

243
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Okay, let's go

244
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
One, two, three

245
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Okay

246
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
One, two, three

247
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
One, two, three

248
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Okay

249
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
One, two, three

250
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Okay

251
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
One, two, three

252
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Okay

253
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Wait, I need to wash my hands

254
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Okay

255
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Wash your hands

256
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Wash your hands

257
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Is it delicious?

258
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Yes

259
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's delicious

260
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Okay

261
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Okay

262
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Okay

263
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Okay

264
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Okay

265
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I like this one

266
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
This one

267
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Yes, this one

268
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Let's see

269
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Do you like this one?

270
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Yes

271
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Both are pretty

272
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
This one

273
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I don't like it

274
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
No, I don't like it

275
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Okay

276
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Okay

277
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Is it delicious?

278
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Yes

279
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Okay, you can eat more

280
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm not good at it

281
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Do you like it?

282
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Yes

283
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I love it

284
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Oh, thank you

285
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
They like that one

286
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Hello, Kitty

287
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You see

288
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You've liked this since you were a kid

289
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You are the one who likes this

290
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I like it

291
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'll buy it for you

292
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Do you remember it?

293
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Of course

294
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I like it

295
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
How much?

296
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
What do you want to eat, Kitty?

297
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
What do you want to eat?

298
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I want to eat Hanbao

299
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
What else?

300
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
This one

301
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Here

302
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I want this one

303
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
This one

304
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
What do you want, Sister?

305
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I want this one

306
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Dad, you can eat it

307
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You can eat more

308
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I want to eat it

309
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Okay

310
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Okay

311
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Okay

312
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Okay

313
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'll eat it for you

314
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Dad, you can eat it

315
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I want to eat it too

316
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It's sour

317
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Where is it sour?

318
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Why isn't it sour?

319
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Where is it sour?

320
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
So sour

321
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I like it

322
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I like it

323
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I like it

324
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I like it

325
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I like it

326
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I like it

327
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I like it

328
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Okay

329
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You feed me both

330
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I like it

331
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You can eat it

332
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You can be happy in the future

333
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Yes

334
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I like it

335
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I like it

336
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I love them

337
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I promise

338
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I hope

339
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I promise

340
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You can eat it

341
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
The vivo is gone

342
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Okay

343
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,000
BothINGS

344
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,840
BothDO

345
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,840
I'm going to sleep.

346
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,840
These two guys are really too excited today.

347
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,840
They only sleep for an hour.

348
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,840
Let's see how they can get up tomorrow and go to school and kindergarten.

349
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,840
You...

350
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,840
If you don't get up, there's no way to get up.

351
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,840
How can you let a kid decide on such a big thing?

352
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,840
Do you know what Big Brother told his brother this morning?

353
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,840
He said he slept in the front yard.

354
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,840
Because my dad's not in my room anymore.

355
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,840
He only sleeps in the back yard.

356
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,840
But do you know how he told me?

357
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:47,840
I just lived in the house where my dad lived.

358
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,840
He told me that my dad's house is big and spacious.

359
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,840
But the three rooms are the same.

360
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,840
Why is there no bed in the girl's room?

361
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,840
The money is really not human.

362
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,840
I know that you feel disappointed.

363
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,840
But I can't stop him from falling and bumping into his dad.

364
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,840
But if he really falls, I feel more hurt than anyone else.

365
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,840
So today, I'm going to make you happy.

366
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,840
No matter how much money you spend, you have to be happy.

367
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,840
Yes, as long as you are happy, you have to be happy.

368
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,840
No matter how much money you spend, you have to be worth it.

369
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,840
Hello, Miss Xu.

370
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,840
Well...

371
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,840
Hello, Miss Xu.

372
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,840
Well, I'm really sorry that day.

373
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,840
Miss Xu, I'm really sorry.

374
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,840
I was really too much that day.

375
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,840
I said some nice words.

376
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,840
Please don't put them in my heart.

377
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,840
Besides, I'm sorry.

378
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,840
Besides, there's something else I want to ask you to do.

379
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,840
If you have time tomorrow night, we can meet again.

380
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,840
It's better to make it clear.

381
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,840
And you can also meet at the new restaurant.

382
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,840
I'm coming.

383
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,680
I'll hit him.

384
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,680
I'll go to the police station.

385
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,680
Dad, why haven't you slept yet?

386
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,680
If you don't want to sleep,

387
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:33,680
at least drink this every day to relieve your hunger.

388
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,680
Don't think about anything else.

389
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,680
Mei Yi.

390
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,680
Mei Yi, I'm here.

391
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,680
Mei Yi.

392
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,680
You said that Zhai Lan suddenly called your friend.

393
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,680
I want to see you.

394
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,680
Can we not call her like that?

395
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,680
What do you mean by that?

396
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,680
I suddenly saw her today.

397
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,680
Do you think she suddenly came to our party?

398
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,680
I think I'm quite nice.

399
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,680
I want to see how I can get along with her.

400
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:09,680
Xu Kai Jin, do you know what I'm most excited about?

401
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,680
I think you're not a good idol.

402
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,680
Do you remember where you got the title of a college mentor?

403
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,680
A person who is rich and knows how to eat rice.

404
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,680
Come on.

405
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,680
Okay, Xu Kai Jin, you're good at finding skills, right?

406
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,680
You're so good at playing the fool.

407
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,680
You're so small.

408
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,680
What are you doing, Mei Yi?

409
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,680
Mei Yi, let's eat something together.

410
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,680
Okay, you guys go ahead.

411
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,680
Jia Fang has another request.

412
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,680
I'm done with the plan.

413
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,680
Then we'll go first.

414
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,680
They're leaving.

415
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,680
I'll stay with you.

416
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,680
Two bottles.

417
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,680
Okay, okay.

418
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,680
Mei Yi, you want two bottles?

419
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,680
No, I don't.

420
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,680
I'll add some more.

421
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,680
Okay, it's still the last time.

422
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,680
Okay, I'll see you tonight.

423
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,680
Hello, Mr. Qian.

424
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,680
Let me introduce you to the owner of the shop.

425
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,680
The shop is in a state of emergency.

426
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,680
Hello.

427
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,680
Come on, sit down.

428
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,680
I'll just say it without delay.

429
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,680
There's a gold-gray father behind my company.

430
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,680
He really likes this street.

431
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,680
He wants to rent a shop on this street.

432
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,680
He's just looking at your shop.

433
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,680
If I can't find a good one,

434
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,680
I'll just go to the shop.

435
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,680
I'll just go to the shop.

436
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,680
I'll just go to the shop.

437
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,680
He really likes to look at your shop.

438
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,680
If you're willing,

439
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,680
Mrs. Jin and I are really in a good mood.

440
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,680
How do you feel about having a 1.5 times price?

441
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,680
That's good.

442
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,680
The contract of my house

443
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,680
hasn't arrived.

444
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,680
If you take them away,

445
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,680
you can buy them a gold-gray father.

446
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,680
Yes.

447
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,680
Maybe my father doesn't say it clearly.

448
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,680
I'll repeat it again.

449
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,680
Mrs. Jin and I are in a good mood.

450
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,680
If you're willing,

451
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,680
he can offer you a gold-gray father

452
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,680
as a deposit.

453
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,680
And he can pay the whole amount at once.

454
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,680
What do you think?

455
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,680
If that's what you said,

456
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,680
then this matter can be settled.

457
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,680
Then it's settled.

458
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,680
It's settled.

459
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,680
It's settled.

460
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,680
Okay, okay.

461
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,680
That's a good idea.

462
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,680
That's a good idea.

463
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,680
I have to tell them.

464
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,680
Tell them to eat.

465
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,680
Don't worry.

466
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,680
We're back.

467
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,680
Come back to your mom's house.

468
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,680
Let's go to school.

469
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,680
Let's go to school.

470
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,680
Let's go to school.

471
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,680
Sister Ning.

472
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,680
Let's go to school later.

473
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,680
Send Xiao Mi back.

474
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,680
I have to go out.

475
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,680
When it's late,

476
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,680
take Xiao Mi back.

477
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,680
Okay.

478
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,680
And,

479
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,680
tomorrow morning is my first day in school.

480
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,680
I might have to get up earlier than usual.

481
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,680
I'll bring the cake over first.

482
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,680
You got up early enough.

483
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,680
You still have to get up early.

484
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,680
Don't be so lucky.

485
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,680
I have a pet.

486
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,680
By the way,

487
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,680
Xiaoxiao called me.

488
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,680
Why did you drag her?

489
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,680
What's going on?

490
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,680
I'll bring her back later.

491
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,680
I forgot.

492
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,680
I forgot.

493
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,680
Sister Ning, did you get your phone?

494
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,680
Okay.

495
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,680
Let's go.

496
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,680
Be careful.

497
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,680
Let's go in.

498
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,680
Wait a minute.

499
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,680
I can't hear you in our school.

500
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,680
Did she ask you?

501
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,680
She did?

502
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,680
That's great.

503
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,680
I had a conversation with you.

504
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,680
No, I'm fine.

505
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,680
I...

506
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,680
I went out for a drink.

507
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,680
She knows that she's fighting with me.

508
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,680
Thank you.

509
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,680
Don't talk to me in the morning.

510
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,680
I love you.

511
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,680
I love you.

512
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,680
Good friend.

513
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,680
Mom, you scared me.

514
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,680
Why are you here?

515
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,680
What's wrong?

516
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,680
You said something so loud just now.

517
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,680
What's wrong?

518
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,680
You said something.

519
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,680
What's wrong?

520
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,680
The sound outside is so noisy.

521
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,680
You must have heard it wrong.

522
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,680
I called my friend.

523
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,680
She said she bought a bottle of

524
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,680
expensive tea.

525
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,680
I said you use such expensive tea.

526
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,680
Be careful.

527
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,680
It's hot.

528
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,680
Mom,

529
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,680
the decoration is so noisy outside.

530
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,680
You're not feeling well.

531
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,680
Come and rest.

532
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,680
I have to watch it.

533
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,680
I have to watch the decoration

534
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,680
of my grandson's house.

535
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,680
Some people are too cheap.

536
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,680
If they use bad materials,

537
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,680
my grandson's health

538
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,680
will be a problem.

539
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,680
I'll watch it.

540
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,680
Watch it.

541
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,680
Mom.

542
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,680
Please sit down.

543
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,680
Please sit down.

544
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,680
Thank you.

545
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,680
This man is really

546
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,680
handsome once.

547
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,680
Hello, Mr. Mei.

548
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,680
Hello, Miss Xu.

549
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,680
What's the matter?

550
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,680
Just tell me directly.

551
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,680
Well,

552
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,680
I want to

553
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,680
treat you as my girlfriend.

554
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,680
I didn't hear it wrong.

555
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,680
There's still such a good thing.

556
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,680
Don't misunderstand.

557
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,680
I haven't finished talking about it yet.

558
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,680
It's temporary.

559
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,680
Or it's for my girlfriend.

560
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,680
I can pay you

561
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,680
according to the time.

562
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,680
I won't waste your time.

563
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,680
You're so considerate.

564
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,680
You can still be handsome.

565
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,680
Can you do this?

566
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,680
Now that there are so many chips,

567
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,680
it's not a game.

568
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,680
Miss Xu.

569
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,680
Well,

570
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,680
I'll make it clear.

571
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,680
Maybe I can

572
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,680
remove your new pants.

573
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,680
My wife has a sister.

574
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,680
She was always outside.

575
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,680
After she came back from abroad,

576
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,680
she couldn't find a job.

577
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,680
My father-in-law

578
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,680
made up the idea of being together.

579
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,680
Of course, for them,

580
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,680
after finding such a mother,

581
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,680
my two daughters

582
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,680
would not be angry.

583
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,680
I would not agree.

584
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,680
So I lied to them.

585
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,680
I said I have a girlfriend now.

586
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,680
But when we met in the day,

587
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,680
my father-in-law's friend

588
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,680
took a picture of us.

589
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,680
Take a picture?

590
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,680
The key is here.

591
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,680
She wants to check my girlfriend now.

592
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,680
So I stopped her from

593
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,680
asking about our relationship.

594
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,680
I want to ask you to play a play.

595
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,680
I said that

596
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,680
you understand?

597
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,680
Yes.

598
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,680
Yes.

599
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,680
Then you play a play for me.

600
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,680
I'll give you 500 yuan.

601
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,680
Is that okay?

602
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,680
But I have a question.

603
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,680
In the process of

604
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,680
being a girlfriend,

605
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,680
do we need to be close?

606
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,680
Of course.

607
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,680
If we are far away,

608
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,680
my father-in-law

609
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,680
will not believe us.

610
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,680
But how close?

611
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,680
Like this.

612
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,680
Can we be closer?

613
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,680
Like this.

614
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,680
Can we be closer?

615
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,680
Like this?

616
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,680
You need to be closer.

617
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,680
We are actors.

618
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,680
We are going to be close to each other.

619
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,680
I'm sorry.

620
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,680
I'm not going to.

621
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,680
Don't worry.

622
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,680
Don't worry.

623
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,680
I won't take advantage of you.

624
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,680
If you hold hands or need to hold your shoulder,

625
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,680
you need to be close.

626
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,680
Let me tell you this.

627
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,680
I'm the most professional.

628
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,680
If I agree to be your girlfriend,

629
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,680
I will be in the drama.

630
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,680
When we need to be close,

631
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,680
we can't be soft.

632
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,680
When we need to be close,

633
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,680
we can't be soft.

634
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,680
Our goal is

635
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,680
to make your father-in-law fall in love.

636
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,680
Do you understand?

637
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,680
Yes.

638
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,680
Okay.

639
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,680
That's good.

640
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,680
Help me cut the food.

641
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,680
Xiaojiao.

642
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,680
Is Qianhao being honest lately?

643
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,680
Not only his mom,

644
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,680
we are both very good.

645
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,680
When we get close to his mom,

646
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,680
it must be my fault.

647
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,680
This is the typical mother-in-law.

648
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,680
Didn't I tell you that

649
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,680
Qianhao has a flower price.

650
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,680
His name is written on his head.

651
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,680
With your heart,

652
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,680
he won't even leave you alone.

653
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,680
Listen to me.

654
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,680
Get divorced quickly.

655
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,680
You will be in a hurry.

656
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,680
Otherwise, you won't have a good wife.

657
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,680
Aunt, did you hear that?

658
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,680
My uncle is here for three times again.

659
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,680
He wants me to get divorced with him.

660
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,680
You don't listen to your uncle.

661
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,680
How can you do that?

662
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,680
Since ancient times,

663
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,680
he has been persuading me to divorce him.

664
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,680
I think Qianhao is a good boy.

665
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,680
He is good to him.

666
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,680
He is good to Qianhao.

667
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,680
If Xiaojiao doesn't have me,

668
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,680
he can make money for him.

669
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,680
He can make profit for him.

670
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,680
What do you think of him?

671
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,680
I have seen a lot of people like him.

672
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:55,680
Qianhao is a man with a skin.

673
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,680
He is happy to meet women.

674
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,680
Uncle.

675
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,680
You don't want me to say it.

676
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,680
I want to tell you the same.

677
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,680
I want to tell you the same.

678
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,680
How about this?

679
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,680
My uncle will give you a idea.

680
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,680
Let's talk about it.

681
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,680
What do you mean?

682
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,680
You can tell Qianhao that

683
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,680
I have made a mistake in my work.

684
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,680
I have to be punished.

685
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,680
I even got fired.

686
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,680
I can't help him

687
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,680
with his company.

688
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,680
You have to be serious.

689
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,680
If he keeps on making you suffer,

690
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,680
then uncle will lose.

691
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,680
I will beat him.

692
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,680
Why?

693
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,680
If I lose,

694
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,680
your relationship with me

695
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,680
will be bad.

696
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,680
Look at you.

697
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,680
You are still a young man.

698
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,680
You are married.

699
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,680
What's so good about a man like you?

700
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,680
I can't get rid of him.

701
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,680
You can't get rid of him?

702
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,680
You are right.

703
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,680
You can't change your job.

704
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,680
You are pretending.

705
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,680
You are so happy to see me.

706
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,680
I am happy.

707
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,680
Miss Xu.

708
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,680
Let's find a time

709
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,680
to practice it.

710
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,680
I will do it.

711
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,680
Now,

712
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,680
we need to know each other better

713
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,680
and know each other better.

714
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,680
My father-in-law is an old painter.

715
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,680
I didn't mean to lie to him.

716
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,680
He is a cute old painter.

717
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,680
He is not a good man.

718
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,680
He always asks

719
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,680
some strange questions.

720
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,680
We will write a letter in advance.

721
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,680
Is that okay?

722
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,680
Yes, no problem.

723
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,680
The first question is

724
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,680
do you introduce your parents?

725
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,680
I don't know.

726
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,680
I didn't tell you.

727
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,680
I grew up with my aunt.

728
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,680
I didn't see my own parents.

729
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,680
I am sorry.

730
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,680
I don't know.

731
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,680
You know,

732
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,680
I told my father-in-law

733
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,680
not to ask him to leave.

734
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,680
It's not a big deal.

735
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,680
My aunt and I grew up

736
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,680
and we were very happy.

737
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,680
You haven't seen him, right?

738
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,680
He is a cute old woman.

739
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,680
Really?

740
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,680
He is single now.

741
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,680
I will make you see him.

742
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,680
Why?

743
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,680
It's good.

744
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,680
You are so open-minded.

745
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,680
He is so open-minded.

746
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,680
He must be a cute old woman.

747
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,680
Next question.

748
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,680
Do you have a house or a car?

749
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,680
No, sorry.

750
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,680
You can lie to this kind of private matter.

751
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,680
We just write a letter in advance.

752
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,680
You can answer it.

753
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,680
You don't need to be so familiar.

754
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,680
Lie?

755
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,680
I can't.

756
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,680
If you lie to someone,

757
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,680
you can lie to others.

758
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,680
But you can't lie to others.

759
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,680
I can't do that.

760
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,680
I am going to tell you the truth.

761
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,680
When we got divorced,

762
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,680
the house was cheated by the ex-husband.

763
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,680
Recently,

764
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,680
I bought a car

765
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,680
and it's on the test.

766
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,680
Good question.

767
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,680
Good question.

768
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,680
Good question.

769
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,680
Good question.

770
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,680
What is it?

771
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,680
There is one more important question.

772
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,680
I will definitely ask you.

773
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,680
Yes.

774
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,680
Which one do you like?

775
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,680
Handsome.

776
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,680
Good question.

777
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,680
Good question.

778
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,680
Good question.

779
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,680
Smells good.

780
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,680
You are back, son.

781
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,680
Mom is here.

782
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,680
Mom is ready.

783
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,680
Let's eat.

784
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,680
Luo Xiao, come back and help mom.

785
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,680
Mom left after coming here.

786
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,680
She went out.

787
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,680
Why is she so unintelligent?

788
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,680
It's okay.

789
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,680
I don't want to see her.

790
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,680
We are so close.

791
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,680
Is that okay?

792
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,680
Is this a matter of the rule?

793
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,680
Mom,

794
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,680
what is the rule?

795
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,680
It's a matter of the rule.

796
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,680
It's okay.

797
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,680
That's not okay.

798
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,680
Don't say anything.

799
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,680
I will make the bottom line if it's not good for my mom.

800
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,680
Luo Xiao,

801
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,680
the phone is ringing.

802
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,680
Help me pick it up.

803
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,680
Hello, Luo Xiao.

804
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,680
Where are you going?

805
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,680
My mom left after coming here.

806
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,680
What do you mean?

807
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,680
Mom is a secret.

808
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,680
It's okay.

809
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,680
Mom can't stand people's support.

810
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,680
Luo Xiao,

811
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,680
tell you what.

812
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,680
Come back to me.

813
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,680
My mom is tired from the hospital.

814
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,680
She has a cold.

815
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,680
Don't be like this.

816
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,680
Your uncle

817
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,680
always scolds me here.

818
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,680
Your uncle

819
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,680
is about to die.

820
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,680
I have been thinking about it for years.

821
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,680
Think about it.

822
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,680
We will live together.

823
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,680
I have told you many times.

824
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,680
If it's not good for my mom,

825
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,680
you should go.

826
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,680
Keep your word.

827
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,680
Don't pretend to be dead.

828
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,680
I said I ate too much.

829
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,680
You and your uncle

830
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,680
always play with me.

831
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,680
It's not over yet.

832
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,680
Hello,

833
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,680
honey.

834
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,680
What's up?

835
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,680
You miss me?

836
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,680
It's fine.

837
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,680
I'll go to the toilet.

838
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,680
Go to the toilet.

839
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,680
Don't want to be a pet.

840
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,680
I'm a pet.

841
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,680
You are a pet.

842
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,680
I can't say you are a pet.

843
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,680
I'm a pet.

844
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,680
You are a pet.

845
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,680
I'm a pet.

846
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,680
Where are you?

847
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,680
I'm at my uncle's house.

848
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,680
I told you I ate too much.

849
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,680
I just went to the toilet.

850
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,680
She...

851
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,680
You...

852
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,680
Did you take the phone?

853
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,120
Hello?

854
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,920
Honey. Honey.

855
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,520
Uncle.

856
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,560
What's wrong?

857
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,160
The money is very good.

858
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,760
It's very good. Tell her that next week,

859
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,120
I'm going to give her a big gift.

860
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,080
Hey, honey, did you hear that?

861
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,600
This is praising you.

862
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,200
I'm going to give you a big gift.

863
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,120
Why did you hang up?

864
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,320
What's wrong?

865
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,560
I just went out.

866
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,160
Why did you leave again?

867
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,160
Xiao Zhao gave you a dream medicine.

868
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:15,880
A dream medicine?

869
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,640
This is not a good thing.

870
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,400
I have to take a bath.

871
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,600
You...

872
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,320
What's going on?

873
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,560
It's raining.

874
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,840
Miss Xu, look at the phone.

875
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,480
I'll send you the document.

876
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,440
It's simple and clear.

877
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,880
We don't have time.

878
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,800
It's basically covered.

879
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,000
I have no details in the information.

880
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
And my father-in-law

881
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,840
might ask you about it.

882
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,360
Do you have a password?

883
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,120
You can go back and memorize it.

884
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,480
No.

885
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,640
Why do you have to know

886
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,200
where your son-in-law is?

887
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,800
I was asked that year.

888
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,520
Fortunately, I had a prediction.

889
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,000
It's said that the other half of the examination

890
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,080
is deeply related to Cantonese.

891
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,400
You know my father-in-law?

892
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,880
He was the director of the human management

893
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,360
before he retired.

894
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,040
He was very slow in his time.

895
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,000
You know, the problems with the pictures of HR

896
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,160
and the sculptures.

897
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,240
After he retired,

898
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,720
he was angry at me every year.

899
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,400
He was still studying at night.

900
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,880
When I first went to the door,

901
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,080
he asked me about the problems.

902
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,240
He said that I would send you

903
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,600
the document to the human management.

904
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,640
Of course, I'm not his son.

905
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,640
He asked you,

906
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,240
he wouldn't be so anxious.

907
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,760
He just wanted you to go to the hospital.

908
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,880
He just wanted to make it more serious.

909
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,080
Look at these problems.

910
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,400
The two daughters' business,

911
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,840
their previous days,

912
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,720
the two daughters' favorite color,

913
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,120
animal, cartoon characters,

914
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,480
and the favorite food and snacks.

915
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,480
Let me tell you,

916
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,600
you have to keep your hands on the standard

917
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,560
for the rest of your life.

918
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,360
What did you say?

919
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,280
Well,

920
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,320
I think

921
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,920
you should stop looking for your wife.

922
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,480
Find a machine to get it.

923
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,880
No.

924
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,440
I thought these were okay.

925
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,640
Since you care about them,

926
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,640
you should be the first one

927
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,240
to take care of your daughter.

928
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,800
Of course, I will follow the standard

929
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,280
and take care of the other half of the child.
