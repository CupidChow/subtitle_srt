1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I see your pain as you're braying too

2
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Some things we cannot just de-brains

3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And there's no time to guess the count of us

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Greater daylight, go to the free

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let's cross the wind, dancing ring, let the stars in room and night away

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Oh, this is the peace, happiness, they are all bought off a journey

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Let's cross the wind, dancing ring, let the stars in room and night away

8
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I saw a handsome prince holding a mermaid with all his strength

9
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
He said, save me!

10
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The mermaid was a handsome man, and she hit the prince to the side and shook his tail to the sea

11
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
From there, the mermaid and the family lived happily ever after

12
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Okay, I'm done talking, go to sleep, I'll give you the gift tomorrow

13
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Mom, why didn't the mermaid save the prince?

14
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The mermaid is only 15 years old, she's still the baby of the mermaid

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I have something to ask you, what if you're dragged by the strangers?

16
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The strangers give me candy, don't, don't, the strangers take me away, don't, don't

17
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The strangers knock on the door, don't open, don't open, we are the smart baby, we are not going to get up

18
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That's great!

19
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Don't mess with the baby

20
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The child's childhood fairy was changed into a mess

21
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What's the story of the child's childhood fairy?

22
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The princess and the baby's husband died, they were both in pain and in pain

23
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I've changed from the beginning, I've been away from bad guys and safe

24
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What's the big deal? Xiaomin is a boy

25
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
A boy needs to take good care of himself, if he becomes a father like his father, no one will save him

26
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Don't, be serious

27
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Dami is not very close recently, she locked herself in the room at night

28
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
She locked the door and pushed me in, she was so quiet and quiet

29
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
She looked at me and said I was mad, I heard that the frauds are looking at the child

30
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm afraid Dami is being cheated

31
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Isn't that right? She's still studying, she doesn't look like her

32
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Dami, what are you doing? studying?

33
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Open the door

34
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Open the door, or I'll go to bed

35
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
One, two

36
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
What are you doing?

37
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm going to sleep

38
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
How did you talk to your father?

39
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Xiaomin, do you want to talk to your father?

40
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
No, I don't

41
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm Xu Kaixin, 33 years old

42
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Xu Yuan's Xu is happy, the name is the old lady in the house

43
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
She said my birth was just an accident

44
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I was born with a baby, I don't know where I'm from

45
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm just a little girl, I'm not a girl

46
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm a little girl, I'm not a girl

47
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm a unable to imagine what I'll be doing

48
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,960
You should not think about that

49
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
other than your mother, there are 계속ances

50
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You should at least ruin my life

51
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That's right Enough

52
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I am so happy

53
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
That I only need to roam for the next 20 years

54
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and find happiness

55
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,280
my magic is the盜

56
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,220
该叫水电费了啊 73

57
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,620
没错房子是粗来的

58
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,800
你以为我要闻一花儿地告诉你

59
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,320
生活是自己的

60
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,980
你想歪了

61
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,500
曾经有一套140瓶的大房子

62
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,940
摆在我面前

63
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,780
我为他攒了手付

64
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,000
付了月供

65
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,440
却因为收留物价可贵的闺密

66
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,540
被他勾走渣男前夫

67
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,540
She believes in and kicked me and Pearly out of her house.

68
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,140
If one day she could give me another chance,

69
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,480
I'll give her a credit for폰.

70
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,020
I'll get her killed in death.

71
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,620
We'll prize her as gentleow,

72
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,300
doing the sacred kiss and keeping good health.

73
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,100
Why did I move the box's car keys?

74
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,540
Yes, yes, yes.

75
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,540
I'm flying from Beijing this afternoon to Hong Man.

76
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,540
0819.

77
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,540
Oh.

78
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,540
Yes, my luggage is here.

79
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,540
I have something urgent. I'll go first. I'll get the luggage.

80
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,540
You can call me later. Look, this luggage is not mine.

81
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,540
Hello, sir. I just checked the back stage.

82
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,540
A passenger who is with you from Hong Man

83
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,540
called me and asked for a receipt.

84
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,540
It should be your luggage.

85
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,540
Do you think it's convenient for you?

86
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,540
That's great.

87
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,540
Can you give me that woman's phone number?

88
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,540
I'll ask her to give me her number in the city.

89
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,540
This woman asks you to send the luggage to the airport.

90
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,540
She will be in front of the airport staff.

91
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,540
Is it that troublesome?

92
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,540
Can we have a hotel tomorrow morning?

93
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,540
What do you mean?

94
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,540
You're making a fuss over the supermarket?

95
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,540
So many.

96
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,540
You're making a fuss over the airport.

97
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,540
You're just making a fuss over the young people.

98
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,540
Dad!

99
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,540
You're making me miss you.

100
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,540
You're making me miss you.

101
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,540
Youyou, I'll take your dad to the airport.

102
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,540
Thank you for taking care of him.

103
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,540
It's okay.

104
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,540
Is he good?

105
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,540
Do you have time?

106
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,540
I'll talk to him.

107
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,540
Sure.

108
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,540
I'll take her to the dressing room.

109
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,540
I'll talk to Xiaoyi.

110
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,540
Bye, Xiaoyi.

111
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,540
I told you I'll be here at the hotel.

112
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,540
You're a wild cat.

113
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,540
You should sleep early.

114
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,540
You can't sleep for too long.

115
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,540
Let's go.

116
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,540
It's getting late.

117
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,540
I'm out of bed.

118
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,540
Why are you up?

119
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,540
I'm not up.

120
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,540
I'm not up.

121
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,540
I'm not up.

122
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,540
I'm not up.

123
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,540
I'm not up.

124
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,540
I'm not up.

125
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,540
I'm not up.

126
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,540
I'm not up.

127
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,540
I'm not up.

128
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,540
I'm not up.

129
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,540
I'm not up.

130
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,540
I'm not up.

131
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,540
Why are you up so early?

132
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,540
I'm out of bed.

133
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,540
Get up.

134
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,540
Don't.

135
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,540
Take it easy.

136
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,540
Don't be silly.

137
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,540
I'm out of bed.

138
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,540
Get up.

139
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,540
I'm going to school.

140
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,540
Mom, I'm going to school.

141
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,540
You haven't eaten yet.

142
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,540
Why are you leaving?

143
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,540
Hello, Miss Cheng.

144
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,540
I'm the mother of Qian Dami.

145
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,540
I want to know

146
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,540
how our family has been doing lately.

147
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,540
Okay, thank you.

148
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,540
Thank you.

149
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,540
I know.

150
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,540
Well...

151
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,540
What?

152
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,540
What school activity?

153
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,540
I didn't hear her.

154
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,540
Okay, okay.

155
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,540
I'll cooperate.

156
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,540
Bye.

157
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,540
Family meeting?

158
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,540
Yes.

159
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,540
Don't take pictures.

160
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,540
Let's take a picture first.

161
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,540
Dad is having a meal.

162
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,540
Okay, are you done?

163
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,540
Yes.

164
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,540
Come here.

165
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,540
How was your meal?

166
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,540
It was delicious.

167
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,540
Thank you, Dad.

168
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,540
Here you go.

169
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,540
Thank you.

170
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,540
It was delicious.

171
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,540
Come on.

172
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,540
Let's go.

173
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,540
Let's go to the wedding.

174
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,540
Let's go to the wedding.

175
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,540
Your dress is pretty.

176
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,540
Okay, I'll take it.

177
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,540
Dad.

178
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,540
What's the cash you bought for us?

179
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,540
Cheating.

180
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,540
Cheating?

181
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,540
I'll take it back tonight.

182
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,540
Let's go.

183
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,540
Let's go.

184
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,540
Let's go.

185
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,540
Why are you here again?

186
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,540
My parents said

187
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,540
if I don't get up

188
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,540
and send you two children to school,

189
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,540
I won't get any money this month.

190
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,540
I can't help but ask you.

191
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,540
My parents are my parents.

192
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,540
Okay, go to work.

193
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,540
I'll send them to the hospital.

194
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,540
I'll go to the water.

195
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,540
The boss said

196
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,540
he wants me to have dinner at home.

197
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,540
Anyway, it's a small area.

198
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,540
Don't forget that we have to say good night.

199
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,540
Okay, I got it.

200
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,540
Let's go.

201
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,540
Bye, bye.

202
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,540
Bye, bye.

203
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,540
See you.

204
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,540
I'll take your phone.

205
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,540
I'll take it.

206
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,540
Okay, thanks.

207
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,540
Thank you.

208
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,540
Thank you.

209
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,540
Bye, bye.

210
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,540
See you.

211
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,540
Bye, bye.

212
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,540
This cup is for us.

213
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,540
See?

214
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,540
It's heavy.

215
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,540
It's so pretty.

216
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,540
I'll use this.

217
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,540
I'll use this.

218
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,540
Let's go.

219
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,540
We'll pack this.

220
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,540
Welcome.

221
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,540
Right.

222
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,540
I forgot to introduce an important point.

223
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,540
I'm the owner of the happy cake shop.

224
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,540
The shop owner is Dan Yun Gong.

225
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,540
Sometimes, the delivery man is me.

226
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,540
Is Xu Keng Xin very good?

227
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,540
This is called happy.

228
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,540
Welcome.

229
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,540
The cake is ready.

230
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,540
Be careful.

231
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,540
I'll help you.

232
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,540
Thank you.

233
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,540
Thank you.

234
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,540
Thank you.

235
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,540
Thank you.

236
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,540
Hello.

237
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,540
I'm sorry.

238
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,540
This is your box.

239
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,540
I haven't opened it yet.

240
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,540
I'll find something wrong.

241
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,540
This is mine.

242
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,540
This is yours.

243
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,540
Yes.

244
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,540
Here you are.

245
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,540
I opened the box.

246
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,540
No.

247
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,540
I have a password.

248
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,540
Our house is in a mess.

249
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,540
So I have to open this box.

250
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,540
It's very convenient.

251
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,540
But don't worry.

252
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,540
There's nothing missing.

253
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,540
Sir, would you like to check it?

254
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,540
See if there's anything missing.

255
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,540
I...

256
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,540
I suggest you don't open this box.

257
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,540
It's under the control of the big bottle.

258
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,540
I'm sorry.

259
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,540
I want to explain to you.

260
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,540
What about these things?

261
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,540
How can I explain?

262
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,540
I didn't think about these things.

263
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,540
It's my job.

264
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,540
I mean...

265
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,540
Sir,

266
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,540
we are all adults.

267
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,540
You don't have to explain these things to me.

268
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,540
But you work hard.

269
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,540
You really work hard.

270
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,540
I have something to do.

271
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,540
Take care.

272
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,540
Sir,

273
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,540
are you really not opening it?

274
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,540
Would you like to check it?

275
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,540
No, no.

276
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,540
No need.

277
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,540
Sir.

278
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,540
New York

279
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,540
New York

280
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,540
New York

281
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,540
New York

282
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,540
New York

283
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,540
New York

284
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,540
New York

285
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,540
New York

286
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:50,820
Bigッ

287
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,540
worldwide

288
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,540
Paris

289
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,540
My job is

290
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,540
my father.

291
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,540
He is the best father in the world.

292
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,540
He has a very hard time overseas.

293
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,540
I had to stay in apartment for the first time

294
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,540
after coming back from hell.

295
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,540
Every birthday, although he's not around me,

296
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,540
he always remembers to buy me birthday presents.

297
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,540
And then he gave them to me.

298
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,540
Dad really cares about me.

299
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:16,540
He remembers once, when I was writing my homework,

300
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,540
suddenly a question came up that made me feel uncomfortable.

301
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,540
I couldn't figure it out.

302
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,540
So I called my dad.

303
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,540
He kept telling me that I would be back.

304
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,540
He understood.

305
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,540
Every time he came back, he would buy me many delicious things.

306
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,540
He would take me out for fun.

307
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,540
He would buy me many toys and beautiful clothes.

308
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,540
My dad is the best.

309
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,540
I love my dad.

310
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,540
Oh no.

311
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,540
There must be someone else.

312
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,540
Why are you all here?

313
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,540
Brother Mei, you're here.

314
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:07,540
I'm going to the department of

315
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,540
the director.

316
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,540
You're looking for me?

317
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,540
What's the matter?

318
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,540
Nothing.

319
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,540
Oh, nothing.

320
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,540
Something?

321
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,540
Yes.

322
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,540
I heard that the company is starting to be too far.

323
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,540
Now everyone is nervous.

324
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,540
They're afraid that the director will ask questions.

325
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,540
So we have to be careful.

326
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,540
We shouldn't be too active.

327
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,540
You're the director.

328
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,540
Let's go and see.

329
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,540
We're looking for you.

330
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,540
I know.

331
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,540
You can go to work.

332
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,540
Ask for us.

333
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,540
Okay.

334
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,540
Brother Mei.

335
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,540
Thank you.

336
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,540
It's not me.

337
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,540
Mr. Li.

338
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,540
Yes.

339
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,540
Do you know what I'm doing?

340
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:42,540
I'm having too much trouble with my business.

341
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,540
But you know that I really have no choice.

342
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,540
Recently, I've been infected with a flu.

343
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,540
My children are suffering from a stroke.

344
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,540
Your business card is like buying a lottery ticket.

345
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,540
It's too hard to rely on luck.

346
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,540
Okay.

347
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,540
You can give me a discount.

348
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,540
Recently, I've been looking for someone to talk to.

349
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,540
Do you know that?

350
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,540
Really?

351
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:08,540
I've given three financial names to the company.

352
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,540
Cheng Yi, to be honest,

353
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,540
you made me very difficult.

354
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,540
Mr. Li, don't be like this.

355
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,540
I can't have this job.

356
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,540
I have millions of mortgage.

357
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,540
I have two children.

358
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,540
You know how to make me.

359
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,540
You're awake.

360
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,540
Close your eyes.

361
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,540
Sit back and think about it.

362
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,540
Sit.

363
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,540
Look.

364
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,540
You said I was looking for it personally.

365
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,540
Your ability is very clever.

366
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,540
But don't you yourself think this is too much?

367
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,540
Does the work for you have to work to earn a living?

368
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,540
Yes.

369
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,540
You're an adult,

370
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,540
and you are forced to have two children.

371
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,540
It's not easy.

372
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,540
But the company never gets paid.

373
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,540
Just think of it,

374
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:51,540
if one starting one's **** day

375
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,540
and it's too late,

376
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,540
how many cases can you have within three to four times?

377
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,740
What about the other one?

378
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,140
Which one is not a good one?

379
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,540
Sister.

380
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,140
Last chance.

381
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,540
Can you pass the exam in three months?

382
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,540
It's up to you.

383
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:10,940
Thank you.

384
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,740
I'm sure...

385
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,340
I'm sure you won't recognize me again.

386
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,340
Well...

387
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,940
We're not in the same class.

388
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,940
We're not in the same class.

389
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,740
We're in the same class.

390
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,140
I have a friend who is abroad.

391
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,540
I bought a pair of shoes.

392
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,540
I don't have any.

393
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,140
It's too big.

394
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:30,940
I can't hold it in.

395
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:31,740
I'm sweating.

396
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,740
If you do this, I'll send you a car.

397
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,140
You...

398
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,740
You're so...

399
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,140
I'm sorry.

400
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,140
What are you talking about?

401
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:42,940
Be careful.

402
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:43,940
Okay, okay.

403
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,540
Go.

404
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,140
Okay.

405
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:45,940
I'll be busy.

406
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:46,540
Okay.

407
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:53,940
You...

408
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,340
You're so...

409
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,340
So...

410
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,140
You're so...

411
00:21:59,340 --> 00:21:59,740
Hey.

412
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,740
What else do you want to eat?

413
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,140
I want to eat that fried rice cake.

414
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,140
No problem.

415
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:06,940
I'll go to the doctor.

416
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,740
I'll order anything.

417
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,940
Dad, I'm the best.

418
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,940
Are you happy when dad comes out?

419
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,340
Yes, I'm very happy.

420
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,540
Why are you so happy when dad comes out?

421
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,140
What's wrong?

422
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,340
Are you unhappy with your mom?

423
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,540
I'm not happy.

424
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,740
My dad comes here all the time.

425
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,540
My mom is not home all day.

426
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,540
I don't know why.

427
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,940
I'm always the uncle's dad.

428
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,940
I know noodles and eggs every morning.

429
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,940
I also have to force myself to work.

430
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:29,940
I'm a teacher.

431
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,540
I'm a foreigner.

432
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,140
I'm a foreigner anyway.

433
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,140
Dad, I miss you so much.

434
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,740
How can I live with you?

435
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,940
I'm sorry.

436
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,140
Dad, I have to do something.

437
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,940
I'll let you live with your brother as soon as possible.

438
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,340
Okay?

439
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:41,740
Okay.

440
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,140
Do you want to live with dad?

441
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:43,740
Yes.

442
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,940
But I don't want to.

443
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,740
It's okay. You're still young.

444
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,740
You have to persuade your brother to take your brother with you.

445
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,340
Okay?

446
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:51,740
Okay.

447
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,940
I promise I'll talk to aunt Xiao Niang about the house.

448
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,140
Dad will do anything.

449
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,340
You can move in anytime, okay?

450
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,340
Go away!

451
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,340
Are you crazy?

452
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,140
You're so angry.

453
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,740
Are you a mother-in-law?

454
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,340
I was too kind back then.

455
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,940
I made you change your father's wife.

456
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,540
Now I understand.

457
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,340
If anyone makes me unhappy,

458
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,940
I'll make him even more unhappy.

459
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,340
Don't be too much of a fool.

460
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,540
I'm the daughter of my own daughter.

461
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,540
I'm not qualified to be married to Fu Yang Fei.

462
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,940
I'll come and see what's going on.

463
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:27,940
Fu Yang Fei, right?

464
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,340
Come on.

465
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,940
Let's sit down and talk about Fu Yang Fei.

466
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,140
Qian Hao,

467
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,740
you and Hu Xiaojiao were having a baby.

468
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,940
You bought a fake divorce from the school.

469
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,140
After the house was built,

470
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,940
you kicked our mother-in-law out like a football.

471
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:49,140
The total cost of divorce is about 60,000 yuan.

472
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,540
Just a single divorce.

473
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,740
You've been having a baby for two years.

474
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,740
You've been in the hospital for over a minute.

475
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,740
Dad, I bought a lot of things.

476
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,740
You're really your dad's daughter.

477
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,740
You're so selfish.

478
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,740
You're not even worth a single cent.

479
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,740
How did I bring you here these years?

480
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,940
Have you forgotten?

481
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,940
I can't work normally for you two.

482
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,540
I'll make you three days' work

483
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,540
after you're done sleeping.

484
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,340
I'll take this basket to the subway station.

485
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,740
What did he say?

486
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,340
Sister Fan Lili,

487
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,540
she's so mean.

488
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,340
Lili's retirement money

489
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,740
has been on your side for the past two years.

490
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:24,940
When you were sick,

491
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,740
she kept holding you in her arms and couldn't sleep.

492
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,740
Have you forgotten?

493
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,140
I just want to be her dad.

494
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,340
I have a dad.

495
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:30,740
What's wrong with that?

496
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,340
If you want to be her dad, you can tell me.

497
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,940
Why are you so stubborn?

498
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,140
She really loves you.

499
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,940
Can't you tell her that she loves you?

500
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,140
You want to be with her, right?

501
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,140
No problem.

502
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,340
I'll tell you, Qian An Mi.

503
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,140
I'll go with her to the hospital later.

504
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,740
You'll go home with her tonight.

505
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,140
I'm telling you, don't worry about me.

506
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,140
I'll take your dad's money back.

507
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,940
I have two more children now.

508
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,540
You're a white-eyed wolf.

509
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,740
I'll go with you.

510
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,340
How's Xiao Mi?

511
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,540
You want Xiao Mi's retirement money, right?

512
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,140
Give me half of the money.

513
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,340
We'll talk later.

514
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,540
You're dreaming, you stupid girl.

515
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,540
Mom.

516
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,940
Hello, is that Miss Wu Dao?

517
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,540
I'm Qian An Mi's mom.

518
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,340
I want to quit her dance class.

519
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,340
Hello, Miss Wang.

520
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,540
I'm Qian An Mi's mom.

521
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,940
She's going to cancel that English class.

522
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:28,940
No, no.

523
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,540
We're not going to do that.

524
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,340
We're not going to do that anymore.

525
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,340
Yes, yes, yes.

526
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,940
Dad, mom, don't.

527
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,740
I can go get the rent first.

528
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,740
Baby,

529
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,740
mom is angry today.

530
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,540
We can't get her mad again.

531
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:06,340
You should go home today, okay?

532
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,740
I know, I know.

533
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:12,740
We're not going to talk about your mom's retirement, right?

534
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,740
After a few days,

535
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,540
mom will calm down.

536
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,540
She's in a good mood.

537
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,940
I'll pick you up, okay?

538
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,940
I'll take you and your brother to have a big meal.

539
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,940
I'm going to have a big meal.

540
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:24,940
Mom, he's been saving me for so long.

541
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,940
Very soon.

542
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,940
Dad, you must be very soon.

543
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:27,940
Okay?

544
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,940
Just a few days, okay?

545
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,940
Come here, listen to me.

546
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,940
Mom, okay?

547
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,940
Okay.

548
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,940
I'm done.

549
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,940
Okay, I'm going to go.

550
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,940
I'm going to go.

551
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,940
Okay, okay, okay.

552
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,940
I'm not going to be wrong.

553
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:41,940
You can't be wrong.

554
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,940
You're a baby.

555
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:47,940
Okay.

556
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,940
Hello, mom?

557
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,140
I'm too nervous to catch the car.

558
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:02,140
I mean, I'm too nervous to catch the car.

559
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,940
There's too much work to do.

560
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,540
I have to show it well.

561
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,940
I have to go home late tonight.

562
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,940
Please pick up the fish and fish.

563
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,140
What time is it?

564
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,540
I have a date with you and Youyou.

565
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,540
I'll have dinner with you.

566
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,140
No, no, no.

567
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,540
I'll go home at 8.

568
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,740
You guys have dinner first.

569
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,340
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

570
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,340
I'll hang up.

571
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,340
Okay, I'll hang up.

572
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,740
Why did Qianhao and Hu Xiaojiao suddenly come here

573
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,740
when they were in China?

574
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,940
Do you remember how cruel Qianhao was back then?

575
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,740
He said that Hu Xiaojiao was the real love for him.

576
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,740
He was a big and a small girl.

577
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,740
He didn't want any of these two kids.

578
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,140
Now he's back.

579
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,740
Why do you think he's like that?

580
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,940
Based on my experience as a second-class middle-class girl,

581
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,340
there's only one problem.

582
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,540
I can't make it.

583
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,740
As for Qianhao,

584
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,940
he can't make it.

585
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,740
Or Hu Xiaojiao can't make it.

586
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,540
I don't know.

587
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,940
Qianhao must be fine.

588
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,140
Otherwise, why would Dami and Xiao Mi come here?

589
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,540
Then it's Hu Xiaojiao's problem.

590
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,140
If you don't understand,

591
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,940
if you keep acting like this,

592
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,340
Qianhao will be careless.

593
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,940
He won't be hurt.

594
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,740
You're right.

595
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,540
You really stopped Dami's work.

596
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,340
Of course.

597
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:15,940
I didn't stop.

598
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:18,140
I didn't stop because I wanted to be a student.

599
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,340
He's still young.

600
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,340
He doesn't know how to fix his bank account.

601
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,540
Li Li always said that he's running a bank account.

602
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,340
He's not that good at talking.

603
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,940
I think I should tell you.

604
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,140
A real teacher should let him fall.

605
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,140
If he falls, he'll know what he's doing.

606
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:32,940
I've thought about it.

607
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,940
After this work,

608
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,940
I'll save money and help myself.

609
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,940
I don't want to be too careless.

610
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,340
If Qianhao and Hu Xiaojiao really treat him well,

611
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,540
then I congratulate Qian Dami.

612
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,740
He'll be happy.

613
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,740
If he doesn't treat him well,

614
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,740
he'll come back anytime.

615
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,540
His mother will always give him a break.

616
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,740
That makes sense.

617
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:51,140
If you only treat Xiao Mi as a child,

618
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,940
maybe you'll find a better partner.

619
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,540
Why do you always think about this?

620
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,740
As the second marriage,

621
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,940
my goal is to get you married

622
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,940
to the best of my ability.

623
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,140
To be honest,

624
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,940
you're a single woman with a 30-year-old family.

625
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,740
You haven't even started a business.

626
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,740
Why do you only do second marriage business?

627
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,340
You don't understand.

628
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,940
What's the second marriage now?

629
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:15,540
Who doesn't want to find a reliable partner?

630
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,340
What does this mean?

631
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:19,740
It means that the match is successful.

632
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:23,540
Then I'm not the first to get the chance.

633
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,940
Can you help me find a partner?

634
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,140
You'll know the standard.

635
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,140
Handsome.

636
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,140
You're a good dog.

637
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,740
You don't even have to be a leader.

638
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,340
You're so ugly and handsome.

639
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,340
You're not even good at choosing handsome.

640
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,740
Fine.

641
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,940
You're good at talking about handsome.

642
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,740
You're a little bit funny.

643
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,940
You're making me feel bad.

644
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,340
You're suddenly getting old.

645
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,140
But let me tell you.

646
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:47,540
If Qian Hao and Xiao Jiao were really stupid kids,

647
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:51,140
they wouldn't have done this with their shamelessness.

648
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:54,540
Then I'm not the happy one who was good at cheating and bullying.

649
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,540
Let me tell you.

650
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,740
If a friend comes, it's easy to say.

651
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,340
If the enemy comes,

652
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,340
we'll be the first to get the chance.

653
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:15,740
The second person to be the first to be the first to get the chance.

654
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:20,540
The second person to be the first to get the chance.

655
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:26,140
The third person to be the first to get the chance.

656
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,340
Honey.

657
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,340
Hi.

658
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,340
Honey.

659
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,340
Hi.

660
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,140
Hi.

661
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,140
My goodness.

662
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,740
I'm so worried.

663
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,740
I'm worried.

664
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,740
Honey.

665
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,580
I'll give you a special one.

666
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,020
Don't let it get in your way.

667
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,180
I'll put it on for you.

668
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,180
Okay?

669
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,220
Kai Tian,

670
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,940
I have some skin today.

671
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,220
Why are you using your skin?

672
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,180
Don't be so mean.

673
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,180
Hey.

674
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,100
What's wrong with your hair?

675
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,780
You're having a meal with me?

676
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,060
Don't mention it.

677
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,300
Xu Kai Xin has a hair loss.

678
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,140
You're having a heart loss?

679
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,340
Why would he call you?

680
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,940
I went to a university

681
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,460
to get a job.

682
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,780
I went there.

683
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,860
I was thinking about

684
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,020
how to get in touch with the kids.

685
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:16,340
I didn't expect

686
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,100
that Xu Kai Xin would hit me.

687
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,300
I was so mad.

688
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:22,500
How did he become like this?

689
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,300
I'm fine, honey.

690
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,380
I'm fine.

691
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,540
I finally found a place

692
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,780
to put my hair down.

693
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,100
It's so hard to look at.

694
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,140
You're still a kid.

695
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,260
You don't know Xu Kai Xin?

696
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:35,980
She's changed.

697
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,860
She's...

698
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,740
She's been a bit unreasonable.

699
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,860
I think it's hard

700
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,740
to raise Xiaomi now.

701
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,740
It's hard.

702
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,500
What should we do?

703
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,460
I don't know.

704
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,940
Xiaomi hasn't been born yet.

705
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,500
Xu Kai Xin and I are divorced.

706
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,340
She doesn't have any feelings for me.

707
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,460
I was thinking about

708
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,060
having a big secret

709
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,740
to contact her.

710
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,620
But now that Xu Kai Xin has found out,

711
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,660
I don't think it's possible.

712
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,660
Big secret is a small secret.

713
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,220
But my mom still wants to have a grandson.

714
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,460
She's so happy.

715
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,740
She's so good.

716
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,380
Let's think about it.

717
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,700
I told you.

718
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,700
She's really changed now.

719
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,300
She's changed a lot.

720
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,460
You know, I just want a big secret.

721
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,380
She asked me to change half of the house.

722
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,700
She's changed this?

723
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,700
Who said she's not?

724
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,380
How about this, honey?

725
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,860
Let's not talk about it.

726
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,020
Let's go to the Golden Claw to choose one.

727
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,420
It's a private matter.

728
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,820
They won't suspect

729
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,220
what you've brought out of my belly.

730
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,540
And it won't be your destiny.

731
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,780
What are you kidding?

732
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,420
I have a son.

733
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,500
I don't help others raise their children.

734
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,500
I'm telling you,

735
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,940
I'll come back with a high-level support.

736
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,060
I support you, honey.

737
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,260
How about this?

738
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,740
I'll change my mind.

739
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,780
Let's have a try.

740
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,660
Go and take a shower.

741
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,580
We're all in the same hospital.

742
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,740
You haven't been in this state for a long time.

743
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:14,860
Let go of your hand.

744
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,740
Don't touch my face.

745
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,220
Let go of my hand.

746
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,100
Honey.

747
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,540
I know. I know.

748
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,220
I know.

749
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,500
I have to go now.

750
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,660
I have to go now.

751
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,060
Get out of my way.

752
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,980
Mom.

753
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,660
Mom.

754
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,460
Mom.

755
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,220
What's wrong?

756
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,340
You've worked hard for the big game.

757
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,620
You've changed your mind.

758
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,700
What do you mean?

759
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,900
Qianhao is back.

760
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,300
He wants to go back to Fuyang.

761
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,300
What?

762
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,220
Qianhao?

763
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,060
How dare he?

764
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,540
I'll break his leg.

765
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,620
You don't have to say that.

766
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,540
If you keep doing this, I'll leave the house.

767
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,500
Here you are.

768
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,420
Take it.

769
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,860
Hurry up.

770
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,380
hahahh Aphemeranted

771
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,460
Hurry up.

772
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,020
kinds

773
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,020
What just happened

774
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,100
Why are you talking like that?

775
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,460
Get out of there.

776
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,620
I've got to go first.

777
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,460
No.

778
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,980
You don't have to.

779
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,540
Is that all?

780
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,860
No.

781
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,220
Yes.

782
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,020
Are you okay?

783
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,020
Why are you leaving?

784
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,380
I'm still here.

785
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,900
Why are you still fighting?

786
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,340
What are you talking about

787
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,140
Piss off.

788
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,580
You're still here?

789
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,300
No, no, I'm done.

790
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,780
I'm tired.

791
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,180
I'm done.

792
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,500
I'm tired.

793
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,100
I can't say it.

794
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,140
These two kids.

795
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,900
Slow down, slow down.

796
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:46,340
Yueyue, Yueyue, come out.

797
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,700
Help me pick up the kids.

798
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,580
I can't say it.

799
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:53,300
Boss, it's time to work.

800
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,700
You have to pay for the overtime.

801
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,900
What did you say?

802
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,420
What overtime?

803
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,660
I asked you to do something.

804
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,180
You have to pay overtime.

805
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,620
Don't say it.

806
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,020
It's not good.

807
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,620
Okay, you're in.

808
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,580
Thank you, dad.

809
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,020
See you.

810
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,340
Come on, go play with aunt.

811
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,100
Auntie, can you see the outside?

812
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,660
Okay.

813
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,500
What are you looking at?

814
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,100
I can do it.

815
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,100
I told you to look at the kids.

816
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,300
You asked the kids to look at the animals.

817
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,500
I don't know how to turn on the TV.

818
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,860
Yuanyuan's entertainment is not needed anymore.

819
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:43,100
Don't make a scene.

820
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,740
Dad.

821
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,340
Chen Yi is here.

822
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:56,900
Mom.

823
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,820
Mom.

824
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,700
Mom.

825
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,260
Mom, big.

826
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,540
It should smell good.

827
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,260
Mom.

828
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,700
Let me have some.

829
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,100
That's good.

830
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,460
Chen Yi, you're here today.

831
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,860
I have seen your mother.

832
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,340
I want to talk to you about something.

833
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,340
Okay.

834
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,340
It's okay.

835
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,340
I'll tell you later.

836
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,340
Okay.

837
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:36,340
Xingxing has been away for many years.

838
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:39,340
You've been single for many years.

839
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,340
You've been so kind to Xingxing these years.

840
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:44,340
We've been watching you and remembering you.

841
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,340
Honestly, I can't even talk to you.

842
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:49,340
I feel a little bit guilty about you.

843
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,340
Yes.

844
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:53,340
You should have taken a step forward.

845
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,340
Let me handle it.

846
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,340
You should try it on.

847
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,340
I'll go.

848
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,340
I'll go.

849
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,340
Hurry up.

850
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,340
Take your time.

851
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,340
Take your time.

852
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,340
No, no.

853
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,340
Sir,

854
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:09,340
have you been wanting to get married recently?

855
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,340
Yes.

856
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,340
I've been thinking about it.

857
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:20,340
You know that a man should have two children.

858
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,340
He doesn't look like a man.

859
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,340
He's really old.

860
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,340
What do you think of me?

861
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,340
He's so serious.

862
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,340
Okay.

863
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,340
He's a good man.

864
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,340
He's an old man.

865
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:39,340
Look, he's not a man.

866
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,340
Youyou just came back from abroad.

867
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,340
You know each other well.

868
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,340
You know each other well.

869
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,340
You can rest assured.

870
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,340
Yes.

871
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,340
Of course.

872
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,340
We know that.

873
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:51,340
We can't even turn back time.

874
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,340
It's okay.

875
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:56,340
Time can solve everything.

876
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,340
But I want to analyze it with you.

877
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:02,340
Youyou and I have a lot of benefits.

878
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,340
What benefits?

879
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,340
He's the one who's talking.

880
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,340
I'm telling you.

881
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,340
I'm sick all my life.

882
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,340
I've been abroad for two years.

883
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:11,340
I've been having fun every day.

884
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,340
Now I'm back.

885
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:15,340
I'm not going to find any decent job.

886
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:17,340
I'm a good cook.

887
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,340
I'm not good at cooking.

888
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,340
I just enjoy life.

889
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,340
You're such a good mother.

890
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,340
Don't worry.

891
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,340
We don't worry.

892
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,340
That's right.

893
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:29,340
Youyou is a good cook.

894
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,340
You two are together.

895
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,340
He's good.

896
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,340
That's right.

897
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,340
You can't be so honest.

898
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,340
Anyway, my parents don't need me.

899
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,340
I'm just a good cook.

900
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:42,340
I'm going to be old.

901
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:45,340
You know I'm not short of money.

902
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,340
Yes.

903
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,340
I bought several houses

904
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,340
with the money I wanted.

905
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:52,340
I can't finish my rent.

906
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,340
But to be honest,

907
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:56,340
if you marry an outsider,

908
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,340
I'm not going to be worried

909
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:01,340
about the estate and entertainment.

910
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,340
But I'm telling you.

911
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:06,340
If you're with Youyou,

912
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:09,340
you'll be the ones to pay for the money.

913
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,340
Isn't that a big wedding?

914
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,340
I just want to marry you.

915
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:21,340
You want to eat the housework?

916
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,340
Wait.

917
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,340
Youyou,

918
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,340
calm down first.

919
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,340
When will I fall in love with you?

920
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,340
Or I'll be the one to do it?

921
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,340
I'll be too much of a concern.

922
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,340
You don't know me?

923
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,340
What else?

924
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,340
Eat the housework?

925
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:37,340
Yes.

926
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,340
I'm giving you some red packets.

927
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,340
I don't care about your housework.

928
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,340
Fine.

929
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,340
We're both familiar with each other.

930
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,340
I'll tell you what I want to say.

931
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,340
No matter what,

932
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:50,340
you know your own character.

933
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,340
You're so nice.

934
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,340
You're so nice.

935
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,340
You're so cold.

936
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:56,340
You're so good at this.

937
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,340
Well,

938
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,340
I...

939
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:01,340
Why?

940
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,340
You...

941
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,340
don't like me?

942
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,340
I won't marry anyone.

943
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,340
Fine.

944
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,340
I'll be relieved if you say that.

945
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,340
As long as you don't eat me,

946
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,340
you're still my good brother-in-law.

947
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,340
I'm going to the camp.

948
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:24,340
Don't ever go back.

949
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,340
Bye, brother-in-law.

950
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,340
Bye, brother-in-law.

951
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,340
I'm not taking medicine.

952
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,340
What's wrong with me?

953
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,340
Dad.

954
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,340
Dad.

955
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,340
It's okay.

956
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,340
You can say whatever you want.

957
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,340
You can't solve any problems.

958
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,340
Yes.

959
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,340
Say it.

960
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,340
Well,

961
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,340
there's something I want to say.

962
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,340
Dad.

963
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,340
I haven't told you yet.

964
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,340
It's okay.

965
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,340
Say it.

966
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,340
Well, I have a girlfriend now.

967
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,340
Is that okay?

968
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,340
Well...

969
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,340
What did you say?

970
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,340
I mean,

971
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,340
I have a girlfriend now.

972
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,340
So, I can't be with that Youyou.

973
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,340
So, Dad.

974
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,340
Mom.

975
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:13,340
You're so heartless.

976
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,340
I'm going to eat noodles.

977
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,340
Dad.

978
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,340
Okay.

979
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,340
Brother-in-law,

980
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,340
it's you again.

981
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,340
But I'm curious.

982
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,340
Brother-in-law,

983
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:43,340
if you want to find a new mother for Yuanyuan and Yule,

984
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,340
I'll have to consider it.

985
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,340
Where are you going to

986
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,340
get your girlfriend to work?

987
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,340
Where are you going?

988
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,340
Sister-in-law,

989
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:10,340
the man you want is here.

990
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,340
I don't want to talk about this.

991
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:18,340
I need to work.

992
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:48,340
I'm going to work.

993
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:25,340
Who said it's not the same?

994
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:32,340
Who said it's not the same?

995
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:39,340
Whose story is so fair?

996
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:47,340
Why do you have to be so sad?

997
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:52,340
How many days have passed?

998
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:54,340
Who has passed?

999
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:58,340
The ice has turned blue.

1000
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:02,340
How many days have passed?

1001
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:08,340
I'm sorry for the time.

1002
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:12,340
Why do you have to be so sad?

1003
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:19,340
I'm sorry for the time.

1004
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:23,340
If I can't be brave,

1005
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:27,340
I'll be sad.

1006
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:31,340
I can't be so sad.

1007
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:33,340
I have a lot of regrets.

1008
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:38,340
I'm sorry for the time.

1009
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:42,340
I'm sorry for the time.

1010
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,340
If I can't be so sad,

1011
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:47,340
I'll be sad.

1012
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:54,340
I'm sorry for the time.
