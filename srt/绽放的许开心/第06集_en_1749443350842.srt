1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I see your pain and your bravery too

2
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Some things we cannot just embrace

3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And there's no time to guess the ground above

4
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Greater daylight, go to the free

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let's cross the wind, dancing ring, let it start to rule my night away

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:33,080
alle questa fiesta Garay

7
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,240
What are you talking about?

8
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,280
I think

9
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,920
you should stop looking for your wife.

10
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,440
You should find a wife.

11
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,120
No.

12
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,200
I think these are okay.

13
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,640
Since you care about her,

14
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,960
you should be the first one to take care of her.

15
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,840
Of course, I will follow the standard

16
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,000
and treat her like a child.

17
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,520
Do you think you can be fair

18
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,480
with your own family?

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,920
Don't you think so?

20
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,120
If you can't do this

21
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,360
in your family,

22
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,920
then why are you marrying me?

23
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,400
My attitude is

24
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,320
with your family and everyone

25
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,400
under a standard and environment.

26
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,760
However, if you can't accept this,

27
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,280
anyone will work harder

28
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,640
to be their their wayward daughter, right?

29
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,400
Why don't you give up

30
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,080
on running to theirlık?

31
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,760
Put one's life

32
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,840
in debate issues when we need to!

33
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,600
So you make the child feel

34
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,480
anビce elle

35
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,640
is superior to her mom and uncle

36
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,080
and which way you're on

37
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,440
is perfect for you

38
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,600
and me.

39
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,360
Okay, okay.

40
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,720
Good.

41
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,440
We never agree on the third round.

42
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,440
It's a good game.

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,120
Forget it. Let's end it here today.

44
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,920
You should work hard and prepare it.

45
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,520
Okay?

46
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,800
I'll ask you to find a place when you're done.

47
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,280
I'll take care of you.

48
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,280
Hu Yuan, I'm done.

49
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,200
Do you want AA?

50
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,160
I'll do it.

51
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,640
Cool.

52
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,560
Good, good.

53
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,360
The End

54
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,360
Husband, what's wrong?

55
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,160
I'm going out.

56
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,160
I'm going out?

57
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,360
You know I love you so much.

58
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,160
You woke up last night, so I was a little bit anxious.

59
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,760
I said a lot of bad things in the phone.

60
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,960
But uncle must have misunderstood me.

61
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,360
Please explain it to me.

62
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,360
I didn't mean that.

63
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,360
Don't bother me.

64
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,760
I'll explain it to uncle.

65
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,760
He's the one who loves me the most.

66
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,760
What's wrong with you?

67
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,760
What's wrong with you?

68
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,360
I'm the one who loves you the most.

69
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,360
I'll explain it to uncle.

70
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,360
Uncle loves me the most.

71
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,360
I'm the one who loves you the most.

72
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,360
Let's go.

73
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,360
Hurry.

74
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,160
Coming.

75
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,560
Coming.

76
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,960
Uncle, sorry.

77
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,160
Uncle, I'm going out.

78
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,160
You're not going out?

79
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,560
Yes.

80
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,960
Then why are you like this?

81
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,960
Uncle.

82
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,960
Uncle.

83
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,960
Uncle, I'm here to say good-bye to you.

84
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,960
Look at my attitude.

85
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,960
Why are you talking to uncle?

86
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,960
How can you say that to me?

87
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,960
I'm happy.

88
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,960
I'm used to it.

89
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,960
Which one is your ex-husband?

90
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,960
How far is he?

91
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,960
How far is he?

92
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,960
Uncle, you're going to be angry with me.

93
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,960
You're so kind.

94
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,960
We're not coming.

95
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,960
Uncle is right.

96
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,960
I'm so full of food.

97
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,960
I can't bear to see you in the morning.

98
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,960
You're like your mom.

99
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,960
You're so good-looking.

100
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,960
You deserve to be bullied.

101
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,960
You're also angry with me.

102
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,960
Look at my mom.

103
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,960
She's so kind.

104
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,960
Don't.

105
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,960
You're so kind.

106
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,960
You're so angry with my dad.

107
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,960
What's so good-looking about it?

108
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,960
Right?

109
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,960
They'll have one in the future.

110
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,960
I'll fight them out.

111
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,960
Don't be angry.

112
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,960
Let's go.

113
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,960
When I was in college,

114
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,960
I couldn't understand the word Chongqing.

115
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,960
I saw the classic lines

116
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,960
of Chongqing.

117
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,960
I suddenly understood

118
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,960
that I was young.

119
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,960
Right.

120
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,960
The autumn knife is good.

121
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,960
The meat is good.

122
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,960
The immortal is good.

123
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,960
Why is the youth not good?

124
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,960
There's no time to talk.

125
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,960
No one is going to the dorm.

126
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,960
Without the god,

127
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,960
time is running out.

128
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,960
Guys, are you playing?

129
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,960
There was a guy outside.

130
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,960
Come on.

131
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,960
One more person.

132
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,960
Come on.

133
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,960
One more person.

134
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,960
Come on.

135
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,960
Come on.

136
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,960
Come on.

137
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,960
Come on.

138
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,960
Come on.

139
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,960
Beautiful moments have passed along the way.

140
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,960
Let's cross the wind, dance in the night,

141
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,960
the stars in the room and never wait.

142
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,960
These are dreams, heaviness,

143
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,960
they are all bought off a journey.

144
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,960
I know.

145
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,960
I know.

146
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,960
I know.

147
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,960
I know.

148
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,960
I know.

149
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,960
I haven't seen you before.

150
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,960
Come to play again.

151
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,960
Okay.

152
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,960
I'll take a break.

153
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,960
Okay.

154
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,960
Thank you for your help.

155
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,960
Thank you.

156
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,960
Is this the youth I've long forgotten?

157
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,960
I'm sorry.

158
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,960
I'll make a call.

159
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,960
Okay.

160
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,960
Bye, president.

161
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,960
Bye.

162
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,960
President Liu.

163
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,960
My plan is still a little bit short.

164
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,960
I'll adjust it.

165
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,960
I'll send it to you tonight, okay?

166
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,960
Okay.

167
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,960
Okay.

168
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,960
Okay.

169
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,960
Bye.

170
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,960
Brother Liu, we're almost there.

171
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,960
Let's play for a while.

172
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,960
Okay.

173
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,960
Let's play next time.

174
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,960
Okay.

175
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,960
Bye.

176
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,960
Bye.

177
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,960
Is it a little bit short?

178
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,960
It's a short, happy ending.

179
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,960
It's a short, happy ending.

180
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,960
It's a short, happy ending.

181
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
It's a short, happy ending.

182
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,960
Sit tight.

183
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,960
I'll draw a picture for you.

184
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,960
Say it.

185
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,960
No.

186
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,960
You're in love?

187
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,960
What?

188
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,960
Be serious.

189
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,960
The landlord asked me to contact you.

190
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,960
He said he couldn't find you.

191
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,960
He asked me to tell you

192
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,960
that the house in the high-end

193
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,960
is going to be sold.

194
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,960
He's going to pay the rent for three months.

195
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,960
It's not enough.

196
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,960
I'm sorry.

197
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,960
I'm sorry.

198
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,960
Don't worry.

199
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,960
It's okay.

200
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,960
It's okay.

201
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,960
Anyway, there are many shops.

202
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,960
Let's find the house.

203
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,960
Right?

204
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,960
Is it real?

205
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,960
Really?

206
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,960
Why is there such a good thing?

207
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,960
No.

208
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,960
The shop is almost gone.

209
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,960
What's the good thing about this?

210
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,960
Listen to me.

211
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,960
The rent is 5,000 every month.

212
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,960
The current shop is actually

213
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,960
6,000 every month.

214
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,960
I can sell at least 8,000 to 9,000

215
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,960
per month on the Internet.

216
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,960
The house is already sold.

217
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,960
I was going to wait for the house

218
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,960
to be sold at the end of the year.

219
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,960
I didn't expect that

220
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,960
he would take the initiative

221
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,960
to find me to pay the rent.

222
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,960
He even wants to pay me the rent.

223
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,960
It's 15,000.

224
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,960
I'm not going to make a big deal of money.

225
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,960
Am I going to die?

226
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,960
If you think so,

227
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,960
it seems like...

228
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,960
How about we go to the market?

229
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,960
No, I'm not going to the market.

230
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,960
I see.

231
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,960
I know.

232
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,960
Could it be that Mei Cheng Yi?

233
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,960
She forgot me.

234
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,960
You two really met today?

235
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,960
Just met?

236
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,960
No, it's okay, Xiao Mei.

237
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,960
I'm officially her ex-girlfriend.

238
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,960
I'm going to meet my parents on the weekend.

239
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,960
Yanxi, you're the only one who's smart.

240
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,960
Although she's a fake girl,

241
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,960
what if she gets touched by my inner beauty?

242
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,960
Don't cry.

243
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,960
Marry me.

244
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,960
Let me tell you.

245
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,960
I touched her second-class wife today.

246
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,960
She's the typical

247
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,960
dressed, skinny, and skinny.

248
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,960
How can a man like her

249
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,960
stay in the single market for so long?

250
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,960
She's not going to be a second-class maid.

251
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,960
You're shameless.

252
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,960
I'm a top-class customer.

253
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,960
You two are all behind my brother.

254
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,960
If you're sincere,

255
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,960
I'll tell you that he must pay me.

256
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,960
Don't you dare to follow me.

257
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,960
Xu Tai Xi,

258
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,960
how can I be your friend

259
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,960
who's so generous?

260
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,960
Who wants us to be friends?

261
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,960
15,000 yuan.

262
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,960
Honey, are you okay?

263
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,960
Don't bother me.

264
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,960
You guys are really

265
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,960
trying to get me together.

266
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,960
How did I get you?

267
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,960
How?

268
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,960
Are you doing this for me?

269
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,960
You know that you're holding my heart.

270
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,960
You want to help me,

271
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,960
don't you?

272
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,960
You should help me get her together.

273
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,960
What are you doing?

274
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,960
You're fighting over me.

275
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,960
What if I get her married?

276
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,960
I'm telling you, I'm getting married.

277
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,960
I'm done.

278
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,960
Look at you.

279
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,960
You're talking too much to me.

280
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,960
I'm angry.

281
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,960
I was the one who quarreled with her.

282
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,960
I'm standing on your side.

283
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,960
Why are you angry with me?

284
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,960
I'm done.

285
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,960
I'm done?

286
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,960
I'm done.

287
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,960
I'm telling you,

288
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,960
I'm the one who's the most hurtful.

289
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,960
I'm telling you,

290
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,960
I'm telling you, I'm done.

291
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,960
I'm going to save my mom.

292
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,960
Mom?

293
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,960
Mom?

294
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,960
Hello?

295
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,960
Mom?

296
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,960
What's wrong?

297
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,960
I'm sorry.

298
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,960
I'm sorry.

299
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,960
I'm sorry.

300
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,960
I'm sorry.

301
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,960
I'm done.

302
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,960
I'm done.

303
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,960
I'm done.

304
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,960
I'm the one who's the most hurtful.

305
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,960
I'm...

306
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,960
This Hu Xiaojiao is quite smart.

307
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,960
Why is she so obsessed with Qianhao?

308
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:56,960
Qianhao was able to abandon his wife for Xiaojiao.

309
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,960
Maybe someday,

310
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,960
she will be able to make up for Xiaojiao's mistake

311
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,960
If she can make up for it,

312
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,960
that's good.

313
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,960
What do you mean?

314
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,960
Isn't Qianhao out of the car?

315
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,960
The expert who came back from treatment

316
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,960
asked me for it.

317
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,960
I asked him in private the other day.

318
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,960
The result is not good.

319
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,960
The heart function is severely damaged.

320
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,960
I'm afraid that this life will be hard.

321
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,960
I...

322
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,960
Does Xiaojiao know?

323
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,960
I'm a man and an elder.

324
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,960
How can I ask her that?

325
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,960
Well...

326
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
She should be alive.

327
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,960
What are you talking about?

328
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,960
That... that Xiaojiao had to be a mistress

329
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,960
to steal her own husband's secret.

330
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,960
That... that Xu Kaixin

331
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,960
always came to our house to play when she was in college.

332
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,960
I like her a lot.

333
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,960
And that...

334
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,960
What was her name?

335
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,960
Li... Li Xiao.

336
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,960
Oh, right.

337
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,960
They are so good.

338
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,960
Xiaojiao was the mistress to steal her husband.

339
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,960
I was against this.

340
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,960
You all said I was hard to listen to.

341
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,960
At that time, she was so stubborn

342
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,960
and she was trying to hide her life.

343
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,960
What can we do?

344
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,960
Forget it. Forget it.

345
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,960
Don't mention the past.

346
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,960
The point is, what can we do now?

347
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,960
What can we do then?

348
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,960
We can only be good friends.

349
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,960
We can find our own man.

350
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,960
We can take care of ourselves.

351
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,960
You...

352
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,960
You didn't just climb out of your stomach

353
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,960
and you really feel bad.

354
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,960
By the way,

355
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,960
if I were to raise this child,

356
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,960
my dad would have been broken down

357
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,960
if I had been in the previous three years.

358
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,960
Mom.

359
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,960
I'm back.

360
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,960
What's wrong?

361
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,960
Mom.

362
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,960
Mom.

363
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,960
Mom.

364
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,960
Mom.

365
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,960
Mom.

366
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,960
Mom, are you okay?

367
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,960
Mom.

368
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,960
Mom.

369
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,960
Mom.

370
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,960
Mom.

371
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,960
Mom.

372
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,960
Mom.

373
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,960
Mom.

374
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,960
Mom.

375
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,960
Mom.

376
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,960
It's okay.

377
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,960
I don't want to be a mom.

378
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,960
I'm so annoying.

379
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,960
I... I feel so bad for mom.

380
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,960
Are you okay?

381
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,960
I don't know what happened.

382
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,960
Maybe the medicine is too heavy.

383
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,960
It's so hard to drink.

384
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,960
Mom, you scared me.

385
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,960
Mom, you're so annoying.

386
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,960
Get up.

387
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,960
Drink some water.

388
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,960
Mom, sit up.

389
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,960
Come.

390
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,960
Come.

391
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,960
It's okay.

392
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,960
It's okay.

393
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,960
How about you take care of my mom?

394
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,960
I'll go in first.

395
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,960
Go in.

396
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,960
Mom, you're making me feel bad.

397
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,960
Mom.

398
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,960
It's okay.

399
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,960
I'm scared.

400
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,960
Son.

401
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,960
This person is different from the person.

402
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,960
Do you remember when mom became a salt?

403
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,960
She spit on a land.

404
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,960
Xu Kexin was so happy.

405
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,960
She was so clean.

406
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,960
She took care of me.

407
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,960
Look at that.

408
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,960
She wrote two words on her face.

409
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,960
She was so happy.

410
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,960
Mom, I've been thinking.

411
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,960
How did this happen?

412
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,960
When Xu Kexin was alive,

413
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,960
she was so happy.

414
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,960
How did she get along with Hu Xiaojiao?

415
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,960
She's getting more handsome.

416
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,960
Look.

417
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,960
You're out of the car.

418
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,960
I'm sick.

419
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,960
I want a child.

420
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,960
Mom, think about it.

421
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,960
How about finding a teacher?

422
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,960
Mom, I know you're against her.

423
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,960
But you're at least

424
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,960
as tall as my dad.

425
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,960
How can you believe in this?

426
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,960
I'm getting older.

427
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,960
Don't make me feel bad.

428
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,960
I've been having a headache lately.

429
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,960
Okay.

430
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,960
Take a bath.

431
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,960
Take a bath.

432
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,960
I'll get you a blanket.

433
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,960
Go on.

434
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,960
The current zero is more than the zero of three years ago.

435
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,960
Go for it.

436
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,960
Another happy day.

437
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,960
Why is it always so happy?

438
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,960
Why is it always so happy?

439
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,960
Why is it always so happy?

440
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,960
Why is it always so happy?

441
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,960
Because I'm Xu Kexin.

442
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,960
I'm not a man.

443
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,960
I'm a man.

444
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,960
I'm a man.

445
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,960
I'm a man.

446
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,960
I'm a man.

447
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,960
I'm a man.

448
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,960
I'm not a man.

449
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,960
Actually, no one can be happy forever.

450
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,960
Because we're all greedy.

451
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,960
We can't get what we lost.

452
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,960
We can't get what we don't have.

453
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,960
We'll all be unhappy.

454
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,960
The more we grow up, the less happy we'll be.

455
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,960
But after a certain age,

456
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,960
the older we'll be,

457
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,960
the happier we'll be.

458
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,960
In the end,

459
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,960
only the middle-aged people

460
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,960
who are half-timid

461
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,960
are happy every day.

462
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,960
So,

463
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,960
that's what I'm saying.

464
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,960
You must be happy.

465
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,960
My mom has been taking the medicine.

466
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,960
I think the side effects are a bit too much.

467
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,960
She was vomiting last night.

468
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,960
Can you show her how to change it?

469
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,960
The side effects are not so big.

470
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,960
From the day I saw it,

471
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,960
there's a bit of a gap.

472
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,960
Didn't you say that the effect was good

473
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,960
for the time being?

474
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,960
The effect is only a temporary pressure.

475
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,960
It's not a root.

476
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,960
This can only be done once.

477
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,960
But from the heart's point of view,

478
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,960
your mom's heart is not so good.

479
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,960
It's risky.

480
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,960
It could be a heart failure.

481
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,960
So,

482
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,960
you must be prepared.

483
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,960
You...you can think of a way, okay?

484
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,960
Now, there's nothing

485
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,960
to be afraid of.

486
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,960
There's no medicine for the test.

487
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,960
You should give it a try.

488
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,960
I'm not afraid of spending money.

489
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,960
I can only save my mom.

490
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,960
Money can be a way to push the target.

491
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,960
But in the case of saving your life,

492
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,960
money is not a way to save your life.

493
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,960
I think it's a good idea.

494
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,960
Besides,

495
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,960
let's see if your mom has any wishes or ideas.

496
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,960
Or take her to the trip.

497
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,960
Okay, mom.

498
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,960
Tell me how long my mom has to live.

499
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,960
One year.

500
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,960
Two years.

501
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,960
Let's see if your mom has any wishes or ideas.

502
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,960
Or take her to the trip.

503
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,960
Mom.

504
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,960
What's wrong?

505
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,960
It's okay.

506
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,960
We use the wrong medicine.

507
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,960
That's why it's so difficult.

508
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,960
But it's good for your health.

509
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,960
We must be careful.

510
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,960
We must be careful.

511
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,960
We must be careful.

512
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,960
We must be careful.

513
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,960
We must be careful.

514
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,960
We must be careful.

515
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,960
We must be careful.

516
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,960
We must be careful.

517
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,960
Let's sit down for a while.

518
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,960
We have to do it again.

519
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,960
My life will be ruined.

520
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,960
I know it hurts.

521
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,960
But we are not doing this for the illness.

522
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,960
I have done it.

523
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,960
I'm so worried about you.

524
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,960
I promise you.

525
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,960
I'll take our grandson home.

526
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,960
Okay?

527
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,960
Mom.

528
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,960
Mom.

529
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,960
Sit down.

530
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,960
Let's take a look at our grandson.

531
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,960
They say he's doing well.

532
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,960
He's doing well.

533
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:32,460
To enhance Tr cumulative

534
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,960
is more important than primary care.

535
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,680
I'm sorry.

536
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,520
I'm sorry.

537
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,120
I'm sorry.

538
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:40,720
I'm sorry.

539
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,520
I'm sorry.

540
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,160
I'm sorry.

541
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,720
How is it?

542
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,320
I'm sorry.

543
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:43,920
I'm sorry.

544
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,360
The temperature is very good.

545
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,360
I'm still in the back.

546
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:46,920
Okay.

547
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,360
Don't talk nonsense.

548
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,720
Three, two, one.

549
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,720
The next round.

550
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,720
The next round.

551
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:54,880
Okay.

552
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,480
Good.

553
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,080
Good luck.

554
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,120
26.3 yuan for the green pepper.

555
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:58,720
Okay.

556
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,320
Okay.

557
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,520
Brother Mei.

558
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,760
It's really a good day.

559
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,760
I've been busy for so long.

560
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,160
Drink some water.

561
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,160
I'm busy.

562
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,320
I didn't have time to spend time with you.

563
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,320
I was in a hurry to take the kids home.

564
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,120
Okay.

565
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,120
I'll be there.

566
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,120
Wait.

567
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,160
I'll go first.

568
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:22,920
Really?

569
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,320
Oh.

570
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,320
It's a good thing.

571
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,320
Don't worry.

572
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,120
I'll be there.

573
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:30,720
Okay.

574
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,320
I'll be there.

575
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,520
Okay.

576
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,520
Do you have time tonight?

577
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,120
Let's have a meal together.

578
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:58,920
Let's practice.

579
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,480
Okay.

580
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,920
You thought you forgot about this?

581
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,120
But I'm a little busy today.

582
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,320
Can you come closer?

583
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,480
There's a barbecue restaurant nearby.

584
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,240
It's not bad.

585
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,040
I'll treat you.

586
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,040
Okay.

587
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,040
See you at 6 p.m.

588
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,440
Youyou.

589
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,520
I've asked Xu Kexin to practice tonight.

590
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,640
I'm afraid he'll be in front of me tomorrow.

591
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,440
I'll have to trouble you and your parents

592
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,920
to take care of Yuanyuan and Luan.

593
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,520
Don't worry, brother-in-law.

594
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,360
Dad went out with my mom to buy some food.

595
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,040
He'll be ready tomorrow.

596
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,080
I'll report to you anytime.

597
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,640
Go.

598
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,480
Go.

599
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,240
Go.

600
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:38,880
Go.

601
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,560
Go.

602
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,280
Go.

603
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:40,920
Go.

604
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,680
Go.

605
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,400
Go.

606
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,240
Go.

607
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,080
Go.

608
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,840
Go.

609
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,680
Go.

610
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,880
Go.

611
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,880
Go.

612
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,880
Go.

613
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,680
Go.

614
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,480
Go.

615
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,320
Go.

616
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,240
Go.

617
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,440
Go.

618
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,080
Go.

619
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,880
It's been an hour since we last met.

620
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,040
You didn't buy any fish and ribs.

621
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,320
You just mentioned Xiaosong.

622
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,320
You're the one who's so popular.

623
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,240
You have a big...

624
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,520
Let me tell you.

625
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,560
Xiaosong is a good girl.

626
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,480
Our old friend

627
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,360
is our daughter's lover.

628
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,880
You know that, right?

629
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,760
She's a good girl.

630
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,080
We have to take her with us.

631
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,480
Can I take it?

632
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,680
Go home.

633
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,000
There's a radish at home.

634
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,400
I'll make some fried pork with pork.

635
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,760
I'll make some fried pork with pork.

636
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,520
That's too embarrassing.

637
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,440
You know it's embarrassing?

638
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,720
You don't have to invite others to have a meal.

639
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,320
I feel better now.

640
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,200
I feel better now.

641
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,200
You don't have the heart.

642
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:37,920
Don't make me do that.

643
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,120
Don't be lazy.

644
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,240
I'm a little girl.

645
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,480
You old man.

646
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,280
You're more young.

647
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,160
I'm young.

648
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,120
It's not okay.

649
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,320
I'm warning you.

650
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,120
If you don't invite others,

651
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,560
you can push things away.

652
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,760
Don't make a fuss.

653
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,800
Do you want to buy or not?

654
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,360
If you don't, I'll leave.

655
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,880
Buy more.

656
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,920
Buy more.

657
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,320
I'll kill him.

658
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,920
When will your back?

659
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,920
My body problem is that

660
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,360
you don't love yours.

661
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,640
It must change.

662
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,520
It's that men that want beverages.

663
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,600
Then you shouldn't love

664
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,760
other boilers.

665
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:21,680
I'll give you an extra menu.

666
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,840
and bring some fruit.

667
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,440
What are you doing here?

668
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,760
Qianhao and the dog.

669
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,800
You can't go out here.

670
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,400
You go out.

671
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,440
I'll bring some fruit.

672
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,760
Let him go. Let him go.

673
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,840
What are you doing?

674
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,160
Calm down.

675
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,600
What did you say to him?

676
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,520
But I remember

677
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,040
this guy gave us so many

678
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:37,600
half-naked dogs.

679
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,240
I hate him.

680
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,160
He's so itchy.

681
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,880
The door is open.

682
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,080
Look.

683
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,800
Since Qianhao and his mother

684
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,680
appeared,

685
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,440
we've been so scared.

686
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,960
Why are you looking at me like this?

687
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,080
I heard you say that

688
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,560
and I completely believe

689
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,880
you have a little feeling for Qianhao.

690
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,240
You don't have to say that.

691
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,920
Just wait a minute.

692
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,360
Let's see how I can

693
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,680
win this financial award.

694
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,600
Do you know what I want?

695
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,280
I want to help you.

696
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,360
I need to fix the battery.

697
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,040
I'll treat you a drink.

698
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,400
I'll talk to you.

699
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,600
Okay.

700
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,040
Wait a minute.

701
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,120
I'll be outside.

702
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,280
Okay.

703
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:22,840
Okay.

704
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,680
I want a glass of blue wine.

705
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,520
I'll give you a glass of mocha.

706
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,400
Two cups of sugar.

707
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,080
Okay.

708
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,640
I remember.

709
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,520
Love and sweetness.

710
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,280
Just one cup of sugar.

711
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,320
Okay.

712
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,560
The memory is good.

713
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,520
But it's getting older.

714
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,520
It's hard to lose weight.

715
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,800
Just one cup of sugar.

716
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,680
Okay.

717
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,360
Just a little.

718
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,320
Good.

719
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,360
I thought you were playing with TV.

720
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,520
Tell me.

721
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,640
I won't drink this anymore.

722
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,400
No one will wait for me in the garden.

723
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,360
Four years.

724
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,800
We haven't been together

725
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,920
like we are now.

726
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,520
We sit together and chat.

727
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:13,920
You're different.

728
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,440
You're more beautiful.

729
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,240
You're more confident.

730
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:20,960
Thank you for your compliment.

731
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,000
But I think you can be better.

732
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
After all, you're alone now.

733
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,520
It's hard to have two children.

734
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,360
Right?

735
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,880
And it mainly affects you.

736
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,240
You need to find another half.

737
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,280
Now,

738
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:35,880
there are not many men

739
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,200
who can accept two women

740
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,520
with two children.

741
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,520
So I want to...

742
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,120
I'm done now.

743
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:45,920
I'll go find you.

744
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,440
Okay?

745
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,280
I'll see you.

746
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,320
Hello.

747
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,800
You can medium-sized.

748
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,760
It's not difficult

749
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,320
for you to ask for this.

750
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,560
Who's speaking?

751
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,240
I don't know.

752
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,560
We're like sirens in 我們過ums.

753
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,640
This game just took hours.

754
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,080
Our oilman can't leave us.

755
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:21,640
Let's get fix or warm up.

756
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,360
Wait a minute.

757
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,400
Thank you.

758
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,520
Zha Nanqian is doing a P.A. dance.

759
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,640
He said I can't find a boyfriend

760
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,640
with two kids.

761
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,480
It's not a P.A. dance.

762
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,800
He's very honest.

763
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,800
He's really not easy to find.

764
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,960
Since that,

765
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,800
I'll think about it tomorrow.

766
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,520
It's indeed a P.A. dance.

767
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,800
Where is Jin Zi?

768
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,360
I can't wait.

769
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,360
Hurry up.

770
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,400
Is this work easy?

771
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,520
Yes.

772
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,520
Who are you talking to?

773
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,760
You're a happy boyfriend.

774
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,560
Yes.

775
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,960
Boyfriend,

776
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,760
please bring some flowers when you come.

777
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,760
Be pretty.

778
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,520
I like to buy a box and a full box.

779
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,800
You can buy me a box.

780
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,160
Okay?

781
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,120
What are you talking about?

782
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,920
What are you talking about?

783
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,960
You're really...

784
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,720
What did you just say?

785
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,560
I... I said boyfriend...

786
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,520
Your boyfriend,

787
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,640
although he can accept you as a child,

788
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,320
but he can't accept you as a child.

789
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,440
But you're in the single-star shop now.

790
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,880
You have some problems.

791
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,200
There will be some problems

792
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,240
with the economy.

793
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,880
So I'm thinking

794
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,280
if I can help you to make some money.

795
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,280
We can talk about

796
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,760
the whole thing again.

797
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,360
What?

798
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,000
What's wrong with my face?

799
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:09,720
Why is your face

800
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,320
thicker than before?

801
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,760
Xu Fan, you've changed.

802
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,480
You're very good at understanding people.

803
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,560
You don't know how to say

804
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,240
such a straight and rough thing.

805
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,280
Fuyuan.

806
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,480
I brought you some.

807
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,600
Do you want some hot water?

808
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,920
Okay, right away.

809
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,320
Get out of here.

810
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,240
Why do you drink so hot water

811
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,360
in such a hot weather?

812
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,160
Xu Fan, what do you want?

813
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,560
I want to drink hot water.

814
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,200
Xu Fan, what do you want?

815
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,680
It's public.

816
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,000
Don't be so reckless.

817
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,960
What can I do?

818
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,400
I just feel a little cold.

819
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,720
I want to drink hot water.

820
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,280
Sun, you can draw now.

821
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,120
Wait a minute.

822
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,680
Can you help me get it?

823
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,480
I'll get it.

824
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,080
Can I?

825
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,840
The number is too small.

826
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,000
It's a little too much.

827
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,200
Don't look at me like that.

828
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,440
Well,

829
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,400
you can call me Jia Wu Zhi.

830
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,920
Jia Wu Zhi?

831
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,800
Wait a minute.

832
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,680
Okay, thank you.

833
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,560
Well,

834
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,560
if it's convenient,

835
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:52,160
let's talk about the

836
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,560
Fuyuan Fondation.

837
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,560
Right.

838
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,560
You're not here to talk about

839
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,560
the Fuyuan Fondation, are you?

840
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,560
No, no, no.

841
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,560
It's not like that.

842
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,560
It's mainly about the rice.

843
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,560
The child.

844
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,560
And it must be related to you

845
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,560
for so many years.

846
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,560
It's convenient for a mother

847
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,560
to have a daughter.

848
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,560
It's convenient for a child.

849
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,560
And it's a boy.

850
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,560
A boy with a big father

851
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,560
will be more manly.

852
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,560
And don't worry.

853
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,560
All the Fuyuan Fondation

854
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,560
that I gave you

855
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,560
in the past few years,

856
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,560
I'll give you

857
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,560
the compensation you gave me.

858
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,560
What do you think?

859
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,560
How is it?

860
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,560
The name of the flower is here.

861
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,560
Please help me get it.

862
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,560
No problem.

863
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,560
How long will it take?

864
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,560
Happy.

865
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,560
I'm really sorry

866
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,560
about you

867
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,560
in the past few years.

868
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,560
Just a few minutes

869
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,560
in this flower shop.

870
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,560
But you have to give

871
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,560
a chance to grow up.

872
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,560
I'm really heartbroken now.

873
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,560
I'm really heartbroken.

874
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,560
I'm really heartbroken.

875
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,560
I'm really heartbroken.

876
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,560
I'm really heartbroken.

877
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,560
I'm really heartbroken.

878
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,560
It's really hard

879
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,560
for me

880
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,560
to have a child

881
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,560
by myself.

882
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,560
So I think

883
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,560
we are not

884
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,560
in a relationship anymore.

885
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,560
But you are

886
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,560
my child's mother.

887
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,560
She can't change it.

888
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,560
If possible,

889
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,560
I hope you can give me

890
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,560
a chance

891
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,560
to help you

892
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,560
to take responsibility

893
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,560
for raising a child.

894
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,560
Speaking of this,

895
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,560
I'm really happy

896
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,560
to hear the most

897
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,560
about you.

898
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,560
How about this?

899
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,560
Let's

900
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,560
figure out

901
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,560
the payment you owe me

902
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,560
in the past few years.

903
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,560
Let me see

904
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,560
if you really have the sincerity

905
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,560
to take care of the child.

906
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,560
Then,

907
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,560
let's talk about something else.

908
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,560
I've given

909
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,560
a lot of payment.

910
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,560
You mean

911
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,560
the payment for the service of the rice?

912
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,560
Yes.

913
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,560
My mother also gave a lot.

914
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,560
The payment for the service

915
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,560
is a year-long

916
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,560
and a year-long

917
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,560
payment.

918
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,560
The money your mother gave me

919
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,560
is a little bit more

920
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,560
worth your money.

921
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,560
It's okay to take the payment

922
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,560
as a payment.

923
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,760
The most

924
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,560
unfair thing between us

925
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,560
is that house.

926
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,560
How did you

927
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,560
make the house

928
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,560
into a hand?

929
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,560
You know it best.

930
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,560
Now,

931
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,560
the house in Jiangcheng

932
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,560
is about 30,000 yuan.

933
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,560
The total amount of the house

934
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,560
is about

935
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,560
4 million yuan.

936
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,560
As a

937
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,560
marriage lawyer,

938
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,560
according to the law,

939
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,560
you should

940
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,560
pay less or less.

941
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,560
I'll withdraw

942
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,560
the money

943
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,560
in the face of the child.

944
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,560
You can sell the house

945
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,560
and

946
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,560
divide the money

947
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,560
into two parts.

948
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,560
You can

949
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,560
pay 2 million

950
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,560
for the market price.

951
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,560
Let's solve

952
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,560
the house first

953
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,560
and talk about

954
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,560
other problems.

955
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,560
Xu Kai,

956
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,560
you've really changed.

957
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,560
How did you

958
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,560
change like this?

959
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,560
You're so scary.

960
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,560
What do I look like?

961
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,560
How did you

962
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,560
change

963
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,560
so much,

964
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,560
so much, so much,

965
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,560
so much, so much, so much?

966
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,560
What are you talking about?

967
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,560
The house

968
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,560
is in the past,

969
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,560
the child is

970
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,560
in the present,

971
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,560
the future is in the future.

972
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,560
How can you

973
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,560
mix up

974
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,560
these two things?

975
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,560
Mix up?

976
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,560
What's the point

977
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,560
of having power

978
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,560
to you?

979
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,560
It's just one thing.

980
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,560
The thing that

981
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,560
has no power to you

982
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,560
is the two things that are not related.

983
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,560
Why do you still

984
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,560
treat me like a fool?

985
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,560
Anyway, I don't know

986
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,560
who you and Hu Xiaojiao

987
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,560
are.

988
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,560
Who can't be born?

989
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,560
Now your mother is sick.

990
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,560
She's anxious to have a grandson.

991
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,560
You're anxious.

992
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,560
You're fighting for

993
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,560
the good name for me

994
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,560
to get a little rice.

995
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,560
How can a person

996
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,560
be good and strong?

997
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,560
What do you think?

998
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,560
Let's make it clear.

999
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,560
Who can't be born?

1000
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,560
No one can be born.

1001
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,560
Okay?

1002
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,560
If I can't be born,

1003
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,560
how can I get a lot of rice?

1004
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,560
Okay?

1005
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,560
Xiaojiao also made an idea.

1006
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,560
The article can be reported

1007
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,560
to you.

1008
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,560
She has no problem.

1009
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,560
My mother wants to have a grandson.

1010
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,560
How can you

1011
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,560
be so stingy

1012
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,560
about the Tianjin Diyi thing?

1013
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,560
I'm coming.

1014
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,560
I'm here.

1015
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,560
I won't be a bachelor with you today.

1016
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,560
When will you

1017
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,560
solve the problem of the house?

1018
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,560
Then we can talk about it.

1019
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,560
No.

1020
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,560
You're selling the child.

1021
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,560
You know that?

1022
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,560
When did I say

1023
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,560
you paid the money back?

1024
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,560
I'll pay you back.

1025
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,560
I'll pay you back.

1026
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,560
You're a good teacher now, right?

1027
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,560
I'm a good teacher.

1028
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,560
Sit down.

1029
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,560
Go.

1030
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,560
Go.

1031
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,560
Go.

1032
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,560
What are you doing?

1033
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,560
I still have money.

1034
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,560
Don't be so stingy about this.

1035
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,560
Be careful.

1036
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,560
I'll give you a bet.

1037
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,560
Why do you look like a woman?

1038
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,560
She won't be able to take your money.

1039
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,560
Just a lousy piece.

1040
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,560
She's a rich girl.

1041
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,560
She's the one

1042
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,560
who's giving you money.

1043
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,560
Don't be so stingy.

1044
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,560
I'm telling you.

1045
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,400
I'm her.

1046
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,520
Didn't we agree?

1047
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,120
What's wrong with your girlfriend's eyes today?

1048
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,920
She's not even looking at me.

1049
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,720
I'm telling you, I'm going to talk to you.

1050
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,520
I'm listening.

1051
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,320
Big sister, my car is in reverse.

1052
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,760
She doesn't see you.

1053
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,320
Fine.

1054
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,400
Let's go.

1055
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,800
Let's go for dinner.

1056
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,520
Baby.

1057
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,680
You can't even hear me.

1058
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,080
Can you be normal?

1059
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,080
Isn't this my play?

1060
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,280
My play is fast.

1061
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,080
Then how can I...

1062
00:41:59,080 --> 00:41:59,880
Then I...

1063
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,080
I should be called...

1064
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:01,880
Baby.

1065
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,880
I...

1066
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,080
Okay, okay.

1067
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,520
Red light, red light.

1068
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,680
Please.

1069
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,280
Red light.

1070
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:17,880
Please.

1071
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,480
Sister, look at me.

1072
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,640
I'm calling you.

1073
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,840
You're not eating?

1074
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,440
I'm really eating.

1075
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,040
Good boy.

1076
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,680
Good boy.

1077
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,240
Good boy.

1078
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,240
You can't eat.

1079
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,440
You two...

1080
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,320
Play.

1081
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,040
Come.

1082
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:29,840
Come.

1083
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,880
It's too fast.

1084
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,640
Thank you.

1085
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,040
I can't bear it.

1086
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,720
Open the winter flowers and show them.

1087
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,040
Let them play and eat.

1088
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,240
It's not good to be prepared for the exam.

1089
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,880
My sister said not to take the flowers.

1090
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,040
I'm so happy.

1091
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,720
She can't cook herself.

1092
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,040
She can't let them see.

1093
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,480
What time is it?

1094
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,480
Why hasn't your sister come back yet?

1095
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,480
I can't remember.

1096
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,480
Home work.

1097
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:55,480
A memory of the past

1098
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:02,480
I'm always half-hearted and half-happy

1099
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:10,480
Who said it's not the end of the world

1100
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:18,080
Who said it's not the end of the world

1101
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:24,680
Who's story can be heard

1102
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:31,680
How to fly and become a fly

1103
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,280
At that time, how many days have passed

1104
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:44,080
Who has passed the ice and flowers

1105
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:47,880
How many days have passed

1106
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:58,080
Made theはが

1107
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:04,080
If only to meet again

1108
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:12,880
If dare not be left untimely
