1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I see your pain and your bravery too

2
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Some things we cannot just embrace

3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And there's no time to guess the count of us

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Greater daylight, go to the free

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let's cross the wind, dancing ring, let the stars in the manetta wave

6
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This is a fierce happiness, they are all bought off a journey

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The End

8
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 1

9
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You're talking too much.

10
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This kid is not a kid.

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You!

12
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Who are you? You have to find this person. You have to be responsible.

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
If you kill the kid and get sick, what if you can't take care of him?

14
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yes, who is that person?

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Don't ask. I don't know either.

16
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I had a drunk drink that day and woke up early.

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Why are you so panic?

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Brother Xia, you're a little kid.

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The mother is blind.

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You can't take care of her.

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You...

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Why are you doing this?

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I didn't even leave her in Wu's safety, but now that she's back inーム

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I haven't seen her anywhere else.

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Go find your好不好�

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You're so naive today.

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I feel like everything is lost in it.

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Why would you kill someone?

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
On your right hand, that building,

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
the one with the greenery on it,

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
don't look at it, don't look at it, don't look at it.

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Is there an old man and two girls?

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yes.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's your father-in-law and two girls, right?

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yes.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
They are there,

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
watching us secretly.

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So,

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
we have to make them believe that you are my girlfriend.

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Actually, that old man is very nice.

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Really.

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You will know when you know.

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Okay.

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
That person is nice, that's it.

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
If he wants me to know his fortune,

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
then it's not that easy, right?

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You are a man,

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
you have exposed your heart.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You are so sweet.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Don't be nervous.

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm not nervous.

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Don't worry.

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I have already talked to Yu'an and Yule.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But, they are both little ghosts.

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
They are so strong.

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm just worried.

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Don't worry.

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Let's take a step back.

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's not that hard.

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Let's go.

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Okay.

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Okay, go in.

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Let's go.

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Let's go.

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Do you remember

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
the strategy and strategy of our mission?

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He likes our move.

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
That's right.

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
He doesn't like our move.

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Okay.

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That's it.

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Do you understand?

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Okay, come on.

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Come on.

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Come on.

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Come on.

77
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Come on.

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Brother-in-law.

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay.

80
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I like the little one.

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Okay.

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Thank you.

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Okay.

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'll go in.

85
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Come in.

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Hello.

87
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Thank you.

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Dad.

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Mom.

90
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Why is he so tall?

91
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Well,

92
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
this is my father-in-law.

93
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm mom.

94
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Hello, aunt.

95
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Welcome.

96
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You're Cheng Yi's girlfriend.

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You look pretty.

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm Xu Kai Xin.

99
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Come on.

100
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You should bring some gifts.

101
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I should.

102
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Come on.

103
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Call aunt.

104
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I don't like this aunt.

105
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Don't call her.

106
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yes, I like her.

107
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I like her.

108
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yu Le,

109
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
how did you talk?

110
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I don't have a gift.

111
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Does dad usually call you that?

112
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yes.

113
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Why do you have no gift?

114
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You don't understand.

115
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Don't be angry, okay?

116
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Happy.

117
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Oh, right.

118
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Xu Kai Xin.

119
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Right?

120
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's okay, uncle.

121
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Our two are not very fond of Cheng Yi.

122
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
This is the gift.

123
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Okay.

124
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Don't stand here anymore.

125
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Sit inside.

126
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'll sit inside.

127
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Sit inside.

128
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Okay.

129
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Okay.

130
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Sit inside.

131
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm Yuan.

132
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm Yuan.

133
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Master,

134
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm sorry.

135
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm Yuan.

137
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But I'm not.

138
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm Yuan.

139
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What do you mean?

140
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I don't understand.

141
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
No.

142
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
This means...

143
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'll do it.

144
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Anyway, don't panic.

145
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm Yuan.

146
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'll ask you.

147
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Just relax like you're at home.

148
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'll ask.

149
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Let's put it this way.

150
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I got divorced.

151
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
When I was with my wife,

152
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
it wasn't a good thing.

153
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
But it wasn't bad.

154
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
There was a couple.

155
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
After the divorce,

156
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I was a couple.

157
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I was a couple.

158
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I was a couple.

159
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I was a couple.

160
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
After the divorce,

161
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I was a couple.

162
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
But now,

163
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
it's not a good thing.

164
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
My mom is sick.

165
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Right.

166
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I got a car accident.

167
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Right.

168
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
We can't take care of our kids.

169
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Let me see.

170
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
What's going on?

171
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's weird.

172
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Some people are not only on a plane,

173
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
but also on a plane.

174
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Right.

175
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Am I a bad guy?

176
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
No, you're not.

177
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
This little Hong Kong guy is a good guy.

178
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
He's a good guy.

179
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Do you know the girl's birthplace?

180
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yes.

181
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Get ready.

182
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Go.

183
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Master.

184
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
One, two.

185
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
People are good.

186
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
They're good.

187
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Okay.

188
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm afraid that water will...

189
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's here.

190
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So fast.

191
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's a night house.

192
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Okay.

193
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You're a water.

194
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You're a gold.

195
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You're a star.

196
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Gold can be water.

197
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You two are together.

198
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
When we're together,

199
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
he should forget you.

200
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Right?

201
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yes.

202
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But...

203
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Yes.

204
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Gold can be water.

205
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Water is gold.

206
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I don't understand.

207
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I was born to be with you.

208
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I want to make you feel better.

209
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
When he forgets you,

210
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
he's just a pure water in your eyes.

211
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You're a dog's hair.

212
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
When a dog has a hair,

213
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
he has only your pure water in his eyes.

214
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Then he can be water.

215
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Even if you have a dog's hair,

216
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
you can still be a water.

217
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Am I right?

218
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Yes.

219
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
But the mother and the son are not together.

220
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
They're together.

221
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's not important at all.

222
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
He's just pure water.

223
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
He's become a shameless and shameless water.

224
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And your son,

225
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
he's become a dog's hair

226
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
from the wind and waves.

227
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
He's become a old lamb.

228
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Old gold.

229
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Old gold.

230
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
He's become a beautiful lamb.

231
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
One lamb is two people's worth.

232
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
He's also a water.

233
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
He's also a shameless water.

234
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Listen,

235
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
who's not worth the money?

236
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Do you have any idea?

237
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
But you're a former wife.

238
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You're a gentle woman.

239
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You're a gentle woman.

240
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You're a gentle woman.

241
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You're a gentle woman.

242
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You're wrong.

243
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
But...

244
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's not right.

245
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
There is.

246
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
No.

247
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
There is.

248
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What's going on?

249
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Master,

250
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
can you hurry up?

251
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Shhh.

252
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Old sister,

253
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I've calculated it carefully.

254
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
The problem is on your son.

255
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You said he doesn't cherish his ex-wife.

256
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It doesn't matter.

257
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
But even if the background is not harmonious with him,

258
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
he doesn't mind

259
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
having your family.

260
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
What does this mean?

261
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It means there's only one truth.

262
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I don't know if I should say it or not.

263
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Say it.

264
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You must have done something bad.

265
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You hurt the British and cut your own fortune.

266
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Say it.

267
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Say it.

268
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Say it.

269
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You hurt the British and cut your own fortune.

270
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
But anyway,

271
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
we don't care what we did.

272
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's all his fault.

273
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Just say it.

274
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
How can you solve it?

275
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
He's a handsome man.

276
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
He's here.

277
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
No hurry.

278
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Let me make a small announcement.

279
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I, Mr. Kong,

280
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
besides focusing on my work,

281
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
have also revised my law.

282
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I know the law.

283
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Before the court,

284
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
you must be very careful.

285
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Why?

286
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Because the victim is more careful

287
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
than you.

288
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
The more you spend, the more you can solve it.

289
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Say it.

290
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
How much do you want to spend?

291
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You'll see how much you've made.

292
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
How much do you want to spend?

293
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You mean,

294
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I only need to spend money.

295
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
My mother's illness will be cured.

296
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
My wife and I will have children.

297
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Is that what you mean?

298
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I didn't mean that.

299
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
For example,

300
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
my sister may only live for a year

301
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
after she has been ill.

302
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
But you spend money and work,

303
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
you can live more than

304
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
seven or eight years.

305
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Who can be more accurate?

306
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
But, bro,

307
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
let's say

308
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
we're talking about

309
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
a child.

310
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's not embarrassing.

311
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
If you're sick, you're sick.

312
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Who's sick?

313
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Who's sick?

314
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You're sick.

315
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You're sick.

316
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I've told you I've been sick for a long time.

317
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What kind of system

318
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
is it that you're going to be a burden?

319
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What are you doing?

320
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Have you ever been afraid of anyone?

321
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Go, go, go.

322
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Go.

323
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm sorry.

324
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm sorry, master.

325
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm sorry.

326
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Master, I'm sorry.

327
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'm sorry.

328
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm sorry.

329
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm sorry.

330
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Are you going to be mad at me?

331
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Mom, you...

332
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Boss,

333
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
the pressure on your hand is gone again.

334
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You're...

335
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's gone.

336
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's gone.

337
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
But we're doing this

338
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
like we're doing a salesman.

339
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
We're going to catch customers.

340
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
What did Sun's son say

341
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
that he's going to catch them?

342
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
He said we're going to catch them.

343
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
The girl

344
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
has to fly back after she's done with it.

345
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I said...

346
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
How do you know

347
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
they must have done something bad?

348
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
What if they...

349
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
What do you mean?

350
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
How many times have I told you

351
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
to read and to be yourself?

352
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Don't lie.

353
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I was just learning from my heart.

354
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
My painting is a key.

355
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
She opened the door

356
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
and went to the team.

357
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I can't afford to go with you.

358
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You're leaving.

359
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm tired of catching the pain.

360
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I have to lie down and rest.

361
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Then you can take it.

362
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
How is it?

363
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Being yourself in the gang

364
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
is a great performance.

365
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's not too short.

366
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
At least it's a safe place.

367
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Didn't she say she'd come to help?

368
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
She did.

369
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
She said

370
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
she'd never let customers

371
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
help her.

372
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
She couldn't stand it.

373
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
She didn't care about

374
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
the girl.

375
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
She didn't care about the two kids.

376
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
She was awesome.

377
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I told you

378
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
you wouldn't be a brother

379
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
if you got off the car.

380
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I was thinking

381
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
how did you tell me yesterday?

382
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Did you forget about your father?

383
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Father, father.

384
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Good father.

385
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Father, father.

386
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You're a bad boy.

387
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
If you don't tell me,

388
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'll beat you up.

389
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
You're a bad father.

390
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Mother, father.

391
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
This is what you want.

392
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You're so handsome.

393
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You're not that handsome.

394
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Have some fruit.

395
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Here.

396
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Thank you.

397
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Okay.

398
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm Youyou.

399
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Yuanyu's aunt.

400
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I know.

401
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I've heard about her.

402
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Actually, I'm your father.

403
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
But now,

404
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'm a little bit different

405
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
from the four to three.

406
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I hope you can

407
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
hold my parents' hand.

408
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
If you can't,

409
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'll help you.

410
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'll help you.

411
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Let's eat.

412
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Come on.

413
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Let's eat.

414
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Let's eat.

415
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Yuanyu, let's eat.

416
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Yuanyu, come on.

417
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Come on.

418
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Let's eat.

419
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Come on.

420
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Mother, I have such a big table of dishes.

421
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Look at my brain.

422
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I've lost my chair.

423
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Youyou,

424
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
go and get your chair.

425
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm not that lucky.

426
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
What's wrong?

427
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Who else is coming?

428
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'll buy you a dress.

429
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'll find Yuanyu's mother.

430
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'll find her mother.

431
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It's so important.

432
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
She has to be a good mother.

433
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You're really a fool.

434
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It's true that

435
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
this is a women's play.

436
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I'll buy you a dress.

437
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Yuanyu,

438
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
you don't mind?

439
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Of course not.

440
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Who's the one who wants it?

441
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'll do it.

442
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'll do it.

443
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Come on.

444
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Come on.

445
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Come on.

446
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'll do it.

447
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Where do they usually do it?

448
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You're such a child.

449
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You're a master.

450
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You're so lucky.

451
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You even know how to make a happy life.

452
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Are you going to be mad?

453
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You're rich.

454
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Give me some money.

455
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Why do you give money to people?

456
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm asking you.

457
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Is there a lot of people who do bad things in the world?

458
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Is there a lot of people who take the house away?

459
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Why should we be the ones to report?

460
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
We can't tell them.

461
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Even if we're in a loss,

462
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
how can we make up for it?

463
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Give us the house back.

464
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Are you willing to do it?

465
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
We can't.

466
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
We have millions.

467
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
We can't?

468
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
But

469
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
if we give the god a gift,

470
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
we'll lose the temple.

471
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm telling you.

472
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You can't do anything.

473
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Mom,

474
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
your son isn't a good person.

475
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
But he's not a fool.

476
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
If you really turn him into a fool,

477
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
no god can save our family.

478
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Mom, I know.

479
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Let's go.

480
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Let's go.

481
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Come on.

482
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Please.

483
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Mom.

484
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's not appropriate.

485
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
What's not appropriate?

486
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Chenyin,

487
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
you said

488
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
you had a heart problem and forgot to save people.

489
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You said that

490
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
and made us sad.

491
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It's okay.

492
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It's okay.

493
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It's okay.

494
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Auntie,

495
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I have children.

496
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I can understand.

497
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I can think about it.

498
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
The mother of Yuanyuan

499
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
must feel very happy.

500
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's okay.

501
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm going to eat.

502
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Hurry up.

503
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Lele,

504
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
you can eat whatever you want.

505
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Okay.

506
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Sorry.

507
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I didn't expect them to do this.

508
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
But it's not the truth.

509
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
No matter who I bring back today,

510
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
it will be like this.

511
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I don't mind.

512
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I even have a little envy.

513
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Do you believe me?

514
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Do you want to eat?

515
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
This sauce looks quite similar.

516
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Dad,

517
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I want to eat this pig.

518
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I want to eat this too.

519
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I can't eat it.

520
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I can't eat it.

521
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Dad,

522
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I want to eat this corn too.

523
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I want to eat corn too.

524
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Wait.

525
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Come.

526
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Here.

527
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Turn it around.

528
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Here.

529
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Dad,

530
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I want to eat this.

531
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I want to eat this too.

532
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
What's wrong with you two?

533
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
She's a guest.

534
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
You don't understand.

535
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Why are you so strict with your children?

536
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
If their mother knows

537
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
that she has to eat something,

538
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
she will be scolded.

539
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
She will come to see your door at night.

540
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Dad,

541
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I am teaching Dong Li Mao

542
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
about two things.

543
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
What two things?

544
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
It's just one thing.

545
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It's too much.

546
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
No one knows.

547
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Look.

548
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I don't like it.

549
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I don't like it.

550
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I don't like it.

551
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Try this.

552
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Okay.

553
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Dad,

554
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
the fried egg with the potato is so good.

555
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It's too tasty.

556
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It's the first time I've ever had this kind of pork.

557
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Okay, I'll try it.

558
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Xiao Xu,

559
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
look,

560
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Chen Yu and Yu An and Yu Le

561
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
have been helping each other

562
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
for the past few years.

563
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
The common people say

564
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
that a son-in-law

565
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
and a son-in-law

566
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
are one of the two daughters.

567
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Chen Yu wants to go forward.

568
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
He can't do anything.

569
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
We are his parents.

570
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
His parents are not around.

571
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
There are some things

572
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
that I don't know about.

573
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I don't know.

574
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
We have some things

575
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
that we can do with our old age.

576
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
We can do it for him.

577
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Look, this is the first time you've come here.

578
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
We want to know

579
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
some of the things.

580
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Do you mind?

581
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Auntie,

582
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
we are not talking about food.

583
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
We are not talking about things.

584
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
What is your parents

585
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
doing?

586
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I don't know.

587
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It's like this.

588
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I grew up with my aunt.

589
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I only knew

590
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
who my parents were.

591
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Anyway,

592
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I've never seen them.

593
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
But

594
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I think I'm very lucky.

595
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
My aunt

596
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
has always been like a biological daughter to me.

597
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Her name is Lili.

598
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
She is a teacher who has been promoted to a human.

599
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
She lives with me now.

600
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
She has never married before.

601
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
So, Uncle and Auntie,

602
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
to be honest,

603
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
seeing you

604
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
treat Yu'an and Yu'er like this today,

605
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm very envious of her.

606
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Even now,

607
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
she is in two different spaces.

608
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
She can also feel your kind of love.

609
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
That's right.

610
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
The school is like this.

611
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Cheng Yi

612
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
has been single for many years.

613
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
You know why?

614
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
You are the reason for them.

615
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Right?

616
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
You have two children.

617
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Uncle,

618
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I know I'm here today.

619
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You must have a lot of questions.

620
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Do you want to hear the details

621
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
or the Korean version?

622
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Just the Korean version.

623
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
The details.

624
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
The details.

625
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Then, let's hear what your aunt means.

626
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I don't know.

627
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I'm just asking.

628
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
You are a good friend.

629
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Don't be angry

630
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
when you see someone.

631
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
That's good.

632
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Youyou,

633
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
can you take two kids

634
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
to play with them?

635
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Some things

636
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
are not suitable for children.

637
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
No, no.

638
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I'll go.

639
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'm looking for Weiwei's child.

640
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Come.

641
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Come.

642
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Come.

643
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
How old are you?

644
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Four years ago?

645
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Uncle,

646
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I'm not going to be emotional for Xiaoqiang.

647
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I'm also angry when you're angry.

648
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I thought

649
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
she was a little boy

650
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
and wanted a man like a dog.

651
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
But she didn't have the bottom line

652
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
and didn't think...

653
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I thought...

654
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Luckily,

655
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
she's not our real child.

656
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I'm telling you,

657
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
you don't like it.

658
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Your uncle's name

659
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
is not something.

660
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
His name is a fire pit.

661
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
But you married them

662
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
and they're divorced.

663
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
What else do you want to find?

664
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Who can find

665
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
her ex-wife?

666
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You're right.

667
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I have to call my sister.

668
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Whose child?

669
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Whose house?

670
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Then...

671
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
What about her child?

672
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I'll take her to the hospital

673
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
and do a check-up.

674
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Aren't you going to have dinner?

675
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I have something to do today.

676
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
You go upstairs.

677
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I'll be at ease when I see you.

678
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
What else can happen?

679
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I'll take you there.

680
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Okay.

681
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Take care.

682
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Take care.

683
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Okay.

684
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Take care.

685
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Let's go.

686
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Is that my son?

687
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Next one.

688
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
You go first.

689
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
There are so many people

690
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
in the queue.

691
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Boy,

692
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
your belly isn't big.

693
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
It's not big enough.

694
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Who's going to be born?

695
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
How can I be born?

696
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
You know it's a boy.

697
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Look, so many pregnant women

698
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
are standing here.

699
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Are you embarrassed?

700
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Sit down.

701
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Thank you.

702
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Sit down.

703
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Sit down.

704
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Thank you.

705
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
You're welcome.

706
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
That's okay.

707
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
That's good.

708
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Miss,

709
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
tell me

710
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
if my master

711
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
has been here before,

712
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
how's he doing?

713
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
He's practicing.

714
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
He's practicing.

715
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
He's practicing.

716
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
He's practicing.

717
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Please wait for a moment.

718
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I'll go first.

719
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Okay.

720
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Miss,

721
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
my master...

722
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Miss,

723
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Miss,

724
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
my master...

725
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
is so heartless.

726
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
His mother and son

727
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
are so hard to deal with.

728
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I...

729
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
even if I break the barrier,

730
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I'll be back to my heart.

731
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I'll be back.

732
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I want to try.

733
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Miss.

734
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Miss.

735
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Miss,

736
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
here you are.

737
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Master.

738
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I'm sorry.

739
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
My son doesn't know how to do things.

740
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Please forgive him.

741
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
It's okay.

742
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
He's a good-for-nothing.

743
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
He's kind-hearted.

744
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
But he's still so hard to deal with.

745
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
It's okay.

746
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
He's a good-for-nothing.

747
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
He's a good-for-nothing.

748
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I'll be back to you.

749
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I'll be back.

750
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I understand.

751
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
That's the...

752
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
That's the...

753
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
That's the...

754
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
What's the sum of the money?

755
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Miss.

756
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
It's not money.

757
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It's a...

758
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
It's a fate.

759
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
It's a fate.

760
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
It's a fate.

761
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
He's a good-for-nothing.

762
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
He's a good-for-nothing.

763
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
He's a good-for-nothing.

764
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
He's a good-for-nothing.

765
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
That means...

766
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
A good-for-nothing.

767
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
A good-for-nothing.

768
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
A good-for-nothing.

769
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
A good-for-nothing.

770
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Master.

771
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I've made up my mind.

772
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Master.

773
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
How is it?

774
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
What's the matter?

775
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
What's wrong?

776
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
It's been 30 minutes.

777
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
She's not talking about food.

778
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
She's just saying.

779
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Brother-in-law, she's just playing with you.

780
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I'm so happy.

781
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
That's too much.

782
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
How can you bully people like that?

783
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Mom.

784
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I'm just a guest.

785
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
My dear daughter.

786
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
You'll be fine in the future.

787
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Don't worry.

788
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
We're both here to protect you.

789
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
We're not that kind of people.

790
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
We're just good-for-nothing.

791
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Although Yu'an and Yule are both naughty,

792
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
don't worry.

793
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
They're the most obedient people in this house.

794
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
If they're not naughty,

795
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
tell me.

796
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I'll beat them up.

797
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Auntie Chu Ru, you're so nice.

798
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I'm so touched.

799
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I think this house is very warm.

800
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
You'll be fine in the future.

801
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I'll eat the skin of the pig.

802
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Okay.

803
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I'll eat the skin of the pig.

804
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Okay.

805
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
You're so polite to Auntie Chu Ru.

806
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
You brought more things for me.

807
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I'm so sorry.

808
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I've seen you before.

809
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
You're so nice.

810
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I'm so nice.

811
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
You're so nice.

812
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I'm so jealous.

813
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
You're so nice.

814
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
You're so hard to get along with.

815
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
You're so hard to get along with.

816
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
You're so hard to get along with.

817
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
It's hard to hear that

818
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
she's not so nice to Yule.

819
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Do you want to be a Yule?

820
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
That's no other explanation.

821
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Do you want to know the reason?

822
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Of course.

823
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I have a condition to deal with.

824
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Then what?

825
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
It's very simple.

826
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I'll go back now.

827
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Let's go.

828
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
This is...

829
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
It's a good thing.

830
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
It's a good thing.

831
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
It's a good thing.

832
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
It's a good thing.

833
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Who said no?

834
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I just said

835
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
it's okay to listen to Han Hu.

836
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
You have to let him say what he wants to say.

837
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Look at what he's going to do now.

838
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
You two are too impulsive.

839
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
You have to work hard.

840
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
You two are both going to change.

841
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
We don't want to.

842
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
We want to see what people are going to do.

843
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
You should learn more from Xiaoxu.

844
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Look.

845
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
You're so optimistic.

846
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
If Xiaoxu is smart,

847
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I'll be careful when I sleep with your mother.

848
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Okay, okay.

849
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Anyway, everyone in the world is better than me.

850
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
You like him so much.

851
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
You can go to your daughter.

852
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
What are you doing?

853
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I didn't say anything wrong.

854
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Why do I feel something is wrong?

855
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Can you say it now?

856
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
You're so stubborn.

857
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
That old woman has been treating you.

858
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
How could you do this?

859
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Actually, I didn't do anything.

860
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
But your ex-husband and mother

861
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
are kind people.

862
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Although I failed the marriage last time,

863
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I've been taught how to be a good person.

864
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
And don't be so self-conscious.

865
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I remember when I first met my ex-husband,

866
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
he was so jealous.

867
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
He treated me as his own daughter.

868
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
But my ex-husband was so lucky.

869
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
He was so lucky that he had a girlfriend and a mistress.

870
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
He designed me and made me a good person.

871
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I didn't pay the raise.

872
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
One day, my big daughter got sick.

873
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I couldn't help it.

874
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I begged them.

875
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
But they threw me a hundred dollars.

876
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
They threw me away.

877
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
That's too much.

878
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Your ex-husband and mother wanted to trouble me.

879
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
They could understand.

880
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
They wanted to protect their daughter and granddaughter.

881
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
If they were a good person,

882
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I think they would be so happy.

883
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
After they heard that I was a good person,

884
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
they couldn't do anything to bully me.

885
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Besides, your son-in-law is a newbie.

886
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
He will make people think of his own daughter.

887
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
He will be sad.

888
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
The best way to comfort a person is to open your own business.

889
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Show it to the other person.

890
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
It's so precious.

891
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
When you drive, I'll...

892
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I'll be there.

893
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
What did you say?

894
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Did you say that I was a good person?

895
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
You're a good person.

896
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
You're a good person, aren't you?

897
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I'm sorry.

898
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I'm sorry.

899
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I'm sorry.

900
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I'm sorry.

901
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I'm sorry.

902
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I'm sorry.

903
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I'm sorry.

904
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I'm sorry.

905
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I'm sorry.

906
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I'm sorry.

907
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I'm sorry.

908
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I'm sorry.

909
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I'm sorry.

910
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I'm sorry.

911
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I'm sorry.

912
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I'm sorry.

913
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I'm sorry.

914
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I'm sorry.

915
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I'm sorry.

916
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I'm sorry.

917
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I'm sorry.

918
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I'm sorry.

919
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I'm sorry.

920
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I'm sorry.

921
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I'm sorry.

922
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I'm sorry.

923
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I'm sorry.

924
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I'm sorry.

925
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I'm sorry.

926
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I'm sorry.

927
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I'm sorry.

928
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I'm sorry.

929
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
What's the result?

930
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
When can a doctor treat her?

931
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
She said she needs to see other tests.

932
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
She'll be there in a few days.

933
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
But I can't bear to dance.

934
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I'm not in the mood for the surgery.

935
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Why didn't you find a new one?

936
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Let's go home now.

937
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Let's go.

938
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
The passing of the sun.

939
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I'm always half happy.

940
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Who said it's not the end of the world?

941
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Who said it's not the end of the world?

942
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:57,000
The story of sleep will never stop.

943
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:05,000
How can I be a part of it?

944
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Why are you sleeping?

945
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I'm sorry.

946
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I saw you sleeping just now.

947
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

948
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I didn't expect I would fall asleep.

949
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Is this the neighborhood?

950
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Yes.

951
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
It's 4 o'clock. I have to go home.

952
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Why can't I wake up?

953
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I'm going to the car.

954
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I'll help you.

955
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Hey.

956
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
What's this?

957
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

958
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
You don't believe me?

959
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I'll just believe you.

960
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Actually, I can untie the safety belt for you.

961
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
But it doesn't seem important.

962
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Do you feel it?

963
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Do you feel the heat coming down?

964
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I don't think so.

965
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
But it hurts.

966
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Maybe it's because of the scar.

967
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
You're so serious.

968
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
You're sick.

969
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
You're not guilty.

970
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I'm not afraid.

971
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
But I can get rid of it.

972
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
It's normal.

973
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I can't be anxious.

974
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Where's dad?

975
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Why isn't he back yet?

976
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I don't know.

977
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
You called Chengjie.

978
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Why isn't he back yet?

979
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
He's a little girl.

980
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
It's rare to have a chance to be together.

981
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I called him.

982
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I didn't mean to.

983
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Just call him.

984
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I saw it.

985
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Call him.

986
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Hurry up.

987
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Wait.

988
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I'll call him.

989
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I'll call him.

990
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I'll call him.

991
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Dad.

992
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Chengjie.

993
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
It's okay.

994
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I didn't disturb you.

995
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
That's good.

996
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
When will you be back?

997
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I'm on my way.

998
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
It's a little bit crowded.

999
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Don't worry.

1000
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I'll be back soon.

1001
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Okay.

1002
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Be careful.

1003
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I'm on my way.

1004
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
You're good, Chengjie.

1005
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I'll keep you company.

1006
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Dad.

1007
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
It's me.

1008
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I'm so lonely.

1009
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I can't move.

1010
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Don't wait for me.

1011
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Okay.

1012
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I'll be back soon.

1013
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Where is Chengjie?

1014
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Where is Chengjie?

1015
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Where is Chengjie?

1016
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
He's in the eyes of his little friend.

1017
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
He's back.

1018
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Come back.

1019
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Mom.

1020
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Why are you coming back?

1021
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Mom.

1022
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Do you miss me?

1023
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I miss you.

1024
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
What are you doing here?

1025
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Are you blind?

1026
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Didn't you see my feet?

1027
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I want to eat something.

1028
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
My mom is drunk.

1029
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Mom.

1030
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
You're right.

1031
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
What's wrong?

1032
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I'm the most beautiful one.

1033
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
What?

1034
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,000
You can't think of something beautiful in your big head.

1035
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
For example, a man?

1036
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
A man?

1037
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Who's so blind?

1038
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I know.

1039
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Who are you?

1040
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,820
Who will win me the doll?

1041
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,360
What kind of doll?

1042
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,920
What kind of doll?

1043
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,800
Okay.

1044
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,180
No need to fix.

1045
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,060
You have the big mirror.

1046
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,900
Who do you think we are Allez girli's lord?

1047
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,260
Type encouraging for the pure, cheap-looking girl.

1048
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I am the one who is holding the coffin

1049
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Who said that I am not the one who is making this loneliness

1050
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Whose story is so fair to me

1051
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:38,000
How can I be half-dead and half-dead

1052
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:49,000
At that time, how many days have I walked through the cold and desolate

1053
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:56,000
How many days have I been through the lightning and lightning

1054
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Time is so long, I am alone

1055
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I only have to share my feelings

1056
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:18,000
If I can't be brave enough to be a coward

1057
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I will not be able to endure the pain of being alone

1058
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Time is so long, I am alone

1059
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I only have to share my feelings

1060
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:45,000
If I can't be brave enough to be a coward
