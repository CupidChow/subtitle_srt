1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I see your hand as your bray-ray too

2
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Some things we cannot just embrace

3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And there's no time to guess the ground up first

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Create a daylight, go to the free

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let's cross the wind, dancing ring, let it start to rule my night away

6
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This is the first happiness they have all bought off a journey

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Woo

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
This is the first happiness they have all bought off a journey

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Woo

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Woo

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What's going on? Is President Lin sick?

12
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Of course he is.

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Don't play with me.

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
President Lin is a bit nervous. I'm always chasing him.

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm asking you if you're doing well.

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Is there any change?

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Will you be disheartened?

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You said you can't really make the conditions open.

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Are you afraid?

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
If you don't think it's appropriate, we can talk about it.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You scared me.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Help me take it.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I tried to deal with it within half a month.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I mainly don't want to throw away the prize money.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The conditions are not bad.

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm not worried.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But the team I'm in is the core team.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You can't say that.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You can be a doorkeeper.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
If you earn more,

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
you will be more competitive.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
That's not a problem.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I can promise you for President Lin.

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Are you busy with the traffic?

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Although I'm a bit too busy,

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm fine.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Listen,

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
last time you didn't use the light.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I heard he was very nervous.

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
He jumped up and down.

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I think he's a lot of people.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
If you want to take the responsibility behind him,

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
you should be more careful.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I don't want to do that.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
After all, he's my master.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
He really helped me.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Are you busy with the traffic?

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I need to clean up the traffic.

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
If you don't want me to get late,

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'll leave the city soon.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Bye.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Hello, President Lin.

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Don't be angry with me.

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's what the boss means.

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I just want to open the shop.

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What can I do?

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Besides,

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
it's hard to get a job

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
on the basis of money and compensation.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Meicheng is not a fool.

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So how could he sign on the business management?

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So you're too young and too smart.

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You're a bit too strong.

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Now you're doing business, right?

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I've tried my best.

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I've made all the connections.

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'll keep the last order.

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Listen,

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
as long as Meicheng is within half a year,

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
with the business management,

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
we can't move.

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Our orders won't fly.

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Then you're increasing my work burden.

74
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I want to report it.

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I even hit him.

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The money and compensation are a lot.

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I don't know if my uncle will give up.

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You can't give up.

79
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Then you just open the shop.

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
What are you looking at?

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Nothing.

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Nothing.

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You're so ridiculous.

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
YoYo graders

85
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Meixio,

86
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
don't be nervous.

87
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You can just scare me like this, OK?

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,400
I was sleeping well.

89
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,360
What?

90
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,200
You're so considerate.

91
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,440
You're not going to work in the morning.

92
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,440
Why did you come to me?

93
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,320
What are you doing?

94
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,560
It's not your fault

95
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,920
that you don't belong to me.

96
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,160
I don't belong to you anymore.

97
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,600
Where did you go?

98
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,680
Why don't you belong to me?

99
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,520
Happy.

100
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,560
I'm so worried.

101
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,480
I'm going to

102
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,160
marry myself.

103
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,000
He transferred the money to me.

104
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,320
He even prepared the resources.

105
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,760
The house is also in the palace.

106
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,040
Change it.

107
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,840
Auntie, don't do that.

108
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,640
What?

109
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,960
You just told me

110
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,120
that a middle-aged couple

111
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,600
can't be forced to leave

112
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,400
but the professional

113
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,760
who can't be forced to love

114
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,560
through music.

115
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,600
Can you scold me?

116
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,640
Why should I scold you?

117
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,080
I told you

118
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,000
that you can't be forced to leave.

119
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,760
But I didn't say

120
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,640
that Song Ran can't be forced to leave.

121
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,160
Now he's fallen in love with you.

122
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,440
Now he can't be forced to leave.

123
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,200
Now you're

124
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,600
a rich man.

125
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,560
Rich man?

126
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,680
Can you help me raise the house?

127
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,000
What a pity!

128
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,760
Hello.

129
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:32,960
Hello.

130
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,480
I...

131
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,120
I...

132
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,480
I know.

133
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,080
It's just that the relationship between us

134
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,040
is a bit complicated.

135
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,960
I don't know how to call you.

136
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,320
Call me my old friend.

137
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,560
I'm your new friend.

138
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,480
OK.

139
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,120
We're even half-washed.

140
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,680
Yes.

141
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,480
I just want to come over

142
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,400
and see if there's anything

143
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,800
I can help you with.

144
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,240
No, no.

145
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,600
It's all some mess.

146
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,160
I...

147
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,000
I'll do it myself.

148
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,400
The kitchen light is broken.

149
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,120
When the little girl comes,

150
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,320
I'll let her help me.

151
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:04,840
No,

152
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,680
it's not necessary.

153
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,640
It's not necessary.

154
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,360
It's just a sincerity.

155
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,960
I'll take care of it.

156
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,640
You're here?

157
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,200
Yes.

158
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,160
Is it OK?

159
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,800
Yes.

160
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,640
Do you have a stool?

161
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,720
Yes.

162
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,600
It's OK with this.

163
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,480
We're not young.

164
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,800
We can't be mature.

165
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,240
Do something more.

166
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,240
Men.

167
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,040
It's just a little bit

168
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,520
to do these things at home.

169
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,200
Yes, yes.

170
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:22,920
Yes.

171
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,680
Leave it to me.

172
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,000
You...

173
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,040
Be careful.

174
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,440
Leave it to me.

175
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,640
You...

176
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,120
You...

177
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,920
OK?

178
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,880
OK.

179
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,200
You're going up like this.

180
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,280
It's dangerous.

181
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,520
You...

182
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,320
Wait a minute.

183
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,240
I'll turn off the light.

184
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,400
OK.

185
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,360
This...

186
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,400
It's not broken.

187
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,360
OK.

188
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,720
It's a wire.

189
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,160
I'll take it off.

190
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,560
Do you have a stool?

191
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,520
Yes.

192
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,200
Wait a minute.

193
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:01,960
I'll go find it.

194
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,720
Thank you.

195
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,040
I saw you just moved here.

196
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,040
I wonder if I can help you.

197
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,680
You're really a newbie.

198
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,600
What do you mean?

199
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:23,840
Dad.

200
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,840
Why are you here?

201
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,160
Dad.

202
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,760
I can't wake up in this house.

203
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,440
Slow down.

204
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,880
Can you do this?

205
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,480
OK.

206
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,040
OK.

207
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,840
You can do it.

208
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,080
Sister Lin,

209
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,200
do you need any help?

210
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,120
No, no.

211
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,280
No, I can do it myself.

212
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,480
OK.

213
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,040
OK.

214
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,800
Where's the key?

215
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,480
In the room.

216
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,080
I'll go over there.

217
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,760
OK.

218
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,320
Where did your wish come from?

219
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,120
It wasn't like this before.

220
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,960
How did you change your hair?

221
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,920
You changed it.

222
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,160
This is my life's essence.

223
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,680
Once, you changed it.

224
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,280
You should always pursue your own needs.

225
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,920
Yiren.

226
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,280
You finally learned my essence.

227
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,040
Congratulations.

228
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,240
You've started a new journey.

229
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,440
You're so exciting.

230
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,640
Are you serious?

231
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,240
I'm not.

232
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,320
No.

233
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,880
What if I'm a monk?

234
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,240
I can't go on.

235
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,080
We're divorced.

236
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,080
What are you thinking about?

237
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,960
What's the standard answer

238
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,000
for your choice?

239
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,240
Even if you have the excuse,

240
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,720
you can make the opposite decision

241
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,960
when you go back to the starting point.

242
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,680
Can you guarantee your life is full of happiness?

243
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,960
Why are you not coming in?

244
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,120
Life is like this.

245
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,680
A monk is a general.

246
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,280
He's in a limitless happiness

247
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,920
and he's in a limitless happiness.

248
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,560
We should let him go.

249
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,080
Do you understand?

250
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,560
Yes.

251
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,720
He's so happy.

252
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,800
He's so happy.

253
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,040
He's so happy.

254
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,760
No one can say that.

255
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,440
He should give him a nickname.

256
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,240
It's Chang You Li.

257
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,240
He's a wild man.

258
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,120
He's so hardworking.

259
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,720
But he's soft-hearted.

260
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,920
He's a good boy.

261
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,400
Xiaomei.

262
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,800
Sister Li Li, I hope

263
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,960
you won't get married.

264
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,400
You should treat him well.

265
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,400
You're right.

266
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,560
He's so happy.

267
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,600
Besides, we're not young.

268
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,600
We're serious

269
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,400
no matter what.

270
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,920
I'm right.

271
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,600
You can do it.

272
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,320
Thank you.

273
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,760
They need to be treated well.

274
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,920
Or you can do it on the sofa.

275
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,560
Okay.

276
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,560
You can do it.

277
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,720
You're not making me happy, are you?

278
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,720
Of course I'm making you happy.

279
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,760
Only those who care about you

280
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,760
will be happy.

281
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,040
You should think about it.

282
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,280
You should think about it.

283
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,240
Where do we go in the afternoon?

284
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,880
We have to pay a high price, right?

285
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,640
And we have to pay your card.

286
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,920
Xu Kexin, you're a good boy.

287
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,360
You're like a man.

288
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,280
I didn't pay.

289
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,200
We're in a good business.

290
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm not a good boy.

291
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,920
I'm not a good boy.

292
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:41,920
Mom.

293
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,320
Mom, do you know where you come from?

294
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,360
You're right.

295
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,440
I'm here to help your girlfriend.

296
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,240
I'm here to help her.

297
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,360
I came here yesterday.

298
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,040
Yesterday...

299
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,440
Yesterday...

300
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,880
You seem to be fine.

301
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,400
Come on.

302
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,440
Come on, eat some fruits.

303
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:02,960
Come on.

304
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,520
Come on.

305
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,520
I'm going back.

306
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,280
I suddenly remembered

307
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,760
that I was waiting for you

308
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,920
to take care of the house.

309
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,040
You're leaving?

310
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,600
You...

311
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,800
How about

312
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,840
taking this fruit

313
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,040
to your wife?

314
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,640
Okay.

315
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:20,920
No, no.

316
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,200
It's not convenient.

317
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,000
It's not convenient.

318
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,080
It's okay.

319
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,760
She's going to eat.

320
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,800
She's gone home to eat.

321
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,000
Come on, let's go.

322
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,560
I'll send you off.

323
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,200
Come on.

324
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,720
I'm going to send you off.

325
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,920
I'm going to send you off.

326
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,120
I'm going to send you off.

327
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,320
I'm going to send you off.

328
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,360
I'm going to send you off.

329
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,560
I'm going to send you off.

330
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,800
I'm going to send you off.

331
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,080
I'm going to send you off.

332
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,320
I'm going to send you off.

333
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,360
I'm going to send you off.

334
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,560
I'm going to send you off.

335
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,680
I'm going to send you off.

336
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,920
I'm going to send you off.

337
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,120
I'm going to send you off.

338
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,200
I'm going to send you off.

339
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,360
I'm going to send you off.

340
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,600
I'm going to send you off.

341
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,720
I'm going to send you off.

342
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm going to send you off.

343
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,440
I'm going to send you off.

344
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,800
I'm going to send you off.

345
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,160
I'm going to send you off.

346
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,520
Okay.

347
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,160
I'm going to send you off.

348
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,280
I'm going to be angry.

349
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,080
Nara.

350
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,760
Nara.

351
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,920
Nara.

352
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,760
That hair.

353
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,320
F conjuras pedies two years later.

354
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,080
Nara.

355
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,160
That's just...

356
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,960
I'm holding back a good name.

357
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,760
You have to enjoy a more beautiful love.

358
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,560
Why are you so happy?

359
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,960
Of course I'm happy.

360
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,560
You didn't know that when you pushed out from the surgery room yesterday,

361
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,560
that face was white.

362
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,360
I'm really worried that I'm going to be an old lady.

363
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,360
Look at you now. You're lying here.

364
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,760
You're calling me mom.

365
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,760
Can I not be happy?

366
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,560
And you're planning for the future.

367
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,360
I really want to thank all the people in my heart.

368
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,760
But I can't be your mom anymore.

369
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,760
Mom, can I still meet a good love?

370
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,560
What nonsense are you talking about?

371
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,960
Love has something to do with Zi Guang?

372
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,360
You were talking about yesterday.

373
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,960
You said that your mom wouldn't have a baby.

374
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,160
You and your grandma wanted them to be separated.

375
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,160
You two didn't even know that you're not going to be together now.

376
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,760
You're saying that you're stupid again.

377
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,160
She's an outsider. You're an inner person.

378
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,760
What she's talking about is Li.

379
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,560
What she's talking about is Qi.

380
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,160
You're too old and too double-minded.

381
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,960
Of course, the human heart is selfish.

382
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,960
According to your grandma's words, you're saying that you're being selfish.

383
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,560
Baby, if you want to divorce, then divorce.

384
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,960
After you divorce, then go out with me.

385
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,960
The handsome and beautiful handsome guy from abroad,

386
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,760
Ding Ke You, is the one.

387
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,360
Let's throw away the dead man and be free.

388
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,960
Okay, stop crying, baby.

389
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,160
Look at you.

390
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:01,560
Mom, Jian Hao and I have already proposed to divorce. He didn't say anything.

391
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,760
I'm worried that he'll keep on saying that he wants to get rid of me.

392
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,960
You don't need to worry about this. I'm telling you.

393
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,160
Your uncle...

394
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,960
is a bit weak.

395
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,160
But he hates it when he's abroad. Just leave this to him.

396
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,960
Come, come, come.

397
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,560
Give me some nutrition.

398
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,560
Thank you, mom. Don't blame me.

399
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,760
What are you talking about? Don't blame me.

400
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,560
Here, eat some.

401
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,560
Give me some.

402
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,760
Let me pour some water for you.

403
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,560
Okay.

404
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,360
Mom, I'm so scared.

405
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,960
Mom, my stomach hurts.

406
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,360
Okay, okay, okay.

407
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,360
I'm not eating.

408
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,360
Mom.

409
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,960
Mom, I'm here.

410
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,360
I'm here.

411
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,360
You look much better now.

412
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,560
That's right. I'm with Yan Wan.

413
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,560
I have to support her. I want to see Xiao Jiao's son get pregnant.

414
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,960
What's wrong?

415
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,160
Where's Xiao Jiao? Why isn't he here?

416
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,760
He's not feeling well.

417
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,360
You look pale. You're not feeling well.

418
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,560
I'm scared of you.

419
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,560
You can't be scared of me anymore. I can't bear it.

420
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:43,560
I know about this.

421
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,560
You still have to live with your wife forever.

422
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,560
I can't be with you forever.

423
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,560
After I get discharged, I'll treat Xiao Jiao well.

424
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,560
I won't treat her badly.

425
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,360
You should say what you should say.

426
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,760
Let me get out of here.

427
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,560
The doctor said that I need to pay some money. I didn't figure it out.

428
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,560
Now, the hospital is in a hurry.

429
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,760
The old man is really not understanding.

430
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,160
What's wrong? Why haven't you paid the money?

431
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,160
What's wrong with your face?

432
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,560
What's wrong?

433
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,360
Xiao Jiao just hit her.

434
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,160
What? He hit you?

435
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,360
Why?

436
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,360
I'll find him and see if he can help me.

437
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,360
You're really a bad guy.

438
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,360
I find you funny.

439
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,360
I was hit by Xiao Jiao when I was young. I came back to see you.

440
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,960
What did you say? Why didn't you hit me?

441
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,360
You hit me. What's wrong with you?

442
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,760
You're already old. You're already a son.

443
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,160
How did your grandpa hit me?

444
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,960
I also feel pain.

445
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,960
I didn't want to be alone when I was young.

446
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,960
When I grew up,

447
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:21,160
I suddenly realized that I became him.

448
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,760
Don't find trouble for others.

449
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,760
I want to divorce.

450
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,560
Divorce? No, no, no.

451
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,360
I know women. I can't leave you.

452
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,560
I can't leave you even if I hit you.

453
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,360
Then, you can analyze it for me.

454
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,360
How can I leave two women

455
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,360
who can't leave me?

456
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,160
Okay, Tao Xing. I'll go get a big dog.

457
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,160
I'll go get a big dog.

458
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,160
Hello, handsome man.

459
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,160
Sister Li. I have to go.

460
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,160
Let's eat after we leave.

461
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,160
If you let him leave, he's already married and married.

462
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,160
Bye.

463
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,160
Take care, wife.

464
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,160
Okay.

465
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,760
What wife and wife?

466
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,160
I'll explain it to you later.

467
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,760
Why can't you come over?

468
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,360
I want to talk about the contract.

469
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,760
What contract?

470
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,760
I'm afraid that you won't admit it.

471
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,960
How is that possible?

472
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,760
Didn't you say you were satisfied with the contract yesterday?

473
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,760
What?

474
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,160
I said yesterday,

475
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,960
every classmate is really good at it.

476
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,360
Look at this chicken.

477
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,360
The box is so small.

478
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,560
It's not big at all.

479
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,360
Yes, it's good. I'll give you a discount.

480
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,960
Thank you, sister Li.

481
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,960
I'll take him out for a chat.

482
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,960
Go ahead. Don't rush back.

483
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,960
Go ahead.

484
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,960
What a long way to go.

485
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,160
You're not kidding.

486
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,360
About our contract.

487
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,960
I'm angry.

488
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,960
The result?

489
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,560
After all, there's a patient at home.

490
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,360
Right?

491
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,760
I'll teach him.

492
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,960
That's a good idea.

493
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,560
Hello?

494
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,960
My mom is out of the ICU.

495
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,160
She's missing you.

496
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,160
No problem.

497
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,360
Give me a contract first.

498
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,560
What contract?

499
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,760
If you leave again,

500
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,360
I'll pay half of the money for the change.

501
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,560
Sign the contract.

502
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,960
Xiao Mi's 1 hour delay is due to the hospital.

503
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,960
We're a bit of a human being, okay?

504
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,760
Now an old man is lying on the bed all day.

505
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,160
The only wish is to see his grandson.

506
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,760
Now, he's taking the house to threaten us.

507
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,360
Humanity is for people.

508
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,360
I'm treating you.

509
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,160
I know I took Xiao Mi out on my own last time.

510
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,960
It's my fault.

511
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,160
I'm sorry. I apologize to you.

512
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,760
I promise I won't do this again.

513
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,960
But now, let's talk about the old man first.

514
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,760
It's a long-term thing.

515
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,360
You're so greedy when you need him.

516
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,960
Qian Hao, why do you always look so down?

517
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,760
You can't even look at your face.

518
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,360
Xu Kai Xin, you...

519
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,960
We agree to continue our investigation.

520
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,560
We don't agree.

521
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,560
Don't waste my time.

522
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,560
Goodbye.

523
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,360
lesson

524
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,160
Cool!

525
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,560
You've wanted him with this for long.

526
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,160
So?

527
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,160
That's what I said, right?

528
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,760
Even so, a bit of it would still make it.

529
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,400
But the majority is not in enough.

530
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,600
But it's just that

531
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,240
she's seriously ill.

532
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,360
I understand.

533
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,960
Thank you for accepting.

534
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,320
I'll take care of it.

535
00:22:59,160 --> 00:22:59,800
Here.

536
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,240
It's yours.

537
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,040
No need to take it.

538
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,120
It's not yours.

539
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,320
I'm not asking for it.

540
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,880
I said one, two, three.

541
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,400
You've been practicing here for half a life.

542
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,720
Why do you still think

543
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,120
it's not clear?

544
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,000
You like her so much?

545
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,520
If I'm not here in the future,

546
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I'll follow her.

547
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,320
This little beauty.

548
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,240
Seeing that's fine.

549
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,640
We'll policymakers

550
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,400
continue to fall,

551
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,640
moving and rising.

552
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,200
Maybe

553
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,880
she'll never come back.

554
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,720
I'm back.

555
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,680
You're back.

556
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,520
Oh, my.

557
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,880
Why are you standing here without a sound?

558
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,880
You look like a blind man.

559
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,680
I'm here for your daughter every day.

560
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,080
I can't sleep well.

561
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,280
I'm a pretty face.

562
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,880
I didn't sleep last night.

563
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,040
Who's looking for me again?

564
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,080
Be cool.

565
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,080
I forgot the ring.

566
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,880
I've been hungry for days.

567
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,880
Is something wrong?

568
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,880
What's the matter?

569
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,880
I'm looking at the good one.

570
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,880
You asked me to go to see Youyou last night at 11 o'clock.

571
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,880
Usually, he is still angry and angry at me.

572
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,880
I looked at him yesterday.

573
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,880
He has a bad sleep.

574
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,880
I can't remember.

575
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,440
It's fine now.

576
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,240
It's not like you're always fine.

577
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,840
We have to resolve this.

578
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,640
You made this up.

579
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,440
You can't just skip the dance.

580
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,640
It's none of my business.

581
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,640
You have to work with Zhong Youyou.

582
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,640
Otherwise, it won't happen again.

583
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,640
You know what you're talking about.

584
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,640
Even if we don't know,

585
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,640
Youyou is working at the woodland.

586
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,140
This is the truth.

587
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,140
What's the truth?

588
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,140
I don't know.

589
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,140
This doesn't exist.

590
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,400
I know.

591
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,900
I can't sleep at night.

592
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,400
So I sleep at night.

593
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,400
You did all of this.

594
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,400
You're not responsible.

595
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,400
Who's responsible?

596
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,400
I think so.

597
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,400
How about this?

598
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,400
Let's go to the woodland again.

599
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,400
Ask the master to persuade Youyou not to go.

600
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,400
I've been thinking about it.

601
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,400
Let's just give her a little money.

602
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,400
Ask her to give Youyou out.

603
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,660
She's a bad girl.

604
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,660
She can't go back if she wants to.

605
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,660
Where are you going?

606
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,660
To the woodland.

607
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,660
So fast?

608
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,660
Here, have some water.

609
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,660
I'll give you a bottle.

610
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,660
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

611
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,660
Where else?

612
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,660
That's the table.

613
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,920
I've been looking for your grandson.

614
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,920
I just came out of the door.

615
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,920
I want to see how my grandson is doing.

616
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,920
No, no, no.

617
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,920
You want to see your grandson being very normal.

618
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,920
Xiaomi has been here with you when you were getting married.

619
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,920
She's going to the woodland now.

620
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,920
She will come back.

621
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,920
She gave up.

622
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,920
You take her back.

623
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,920
Mom, it's been a long time.

624
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,920
Don't say that, mom.

625
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,920
I'll get her here in a minute.

626
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,920
You're like this now. She must be here with you.

627
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,920
I miss her now. I miss my heart.

628
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,920
Why do you have so many things to do with your old wife?

629
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,920
Do you want a child or a child that hurts you?

630
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,920
Enough.

631
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,920
It's okay. I'll pick her up now.

632
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,920
I can take my mom's heart if I have something.

633
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,920
Okay? I'll go now.

634
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,920
I'll go now.

635
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,920
Hey, do you have something to say?

636
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,920
I'm the former secretary's manager. Please call Teacher Lu for me, okay?

637
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,920
Okay. I'll be waiting.

638
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,920
Hello, Teacher Lu.

639
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,920
Hello.

640
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,920
I'm here to pick up Qian Xiaomi.

641
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,920
Sorry, Qian Xiaomi is not in this kindergarten anymore.

642
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,920
I'm not in this kindergarten anymore?

643
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,920
Yes, her mom transferred her.

644
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,920
No, no, no.

645
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,920
What do you mean? Transfer?

646
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,920
No, if you lie to me, I can tell you to go to the education bureau.

647
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,920
You're just telling the truth. She's not here either.

648
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,920
Sorry, I have to go to work. I'll go back first.

649
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,920
What are you doing?

650
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,920
I'm going to work.

651
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,920
I'll go back first.

652
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,920
What's your attitude?

653
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,920
Xu Kaixing.

654
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,920
You're a late-time worker.

655
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,920
You're a late-time worker.

656
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,920
You're so shameless.

657
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,920
You're a late-time worker.

658
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,920
How can you give me a lift?

659
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,920
How is it? Have you been doing well these days?

660
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,920
I've been worried about you.

661
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,920
You must be mistaken.

662
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,920
I'm going to divorce.

663
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,920
I gave up my wrongdoings and lost my job.

664
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,920
I finally let go of my mind.

665
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,920
It's still easy.

666
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,920
Congratulations on your retirement.

667
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,920
Why?

668
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,920
It's easy to get a job and it's easy to lose your job.

669
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,920
It's easy to lose your job and it's easy to lose your job.

670
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,920
It's very accurate.

671
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,920
But this is not a real job.

672
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,920
It's a person's fortune.

673
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,920
You have to be confident.

674
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,920
Really?

675
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,920
Of course, I don't believe you can try buying a lottery ticket.

676
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,920
Who are you talking to?

677
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,920
Is it Qian Hao?

678
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,920
I'm telling you,

679
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,920
don't give him a lift unless you get a divorce.

680
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,920
He's a friend and I'm selling lottery tickets.

681
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,920
Friend?

682
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,920
I've been making some money recently.

683
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,920
I'll send you a red packet.

684
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,920
What's going on?

685
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,920
I'll buy the first cup of milk tea for summer.

686
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,920
A red packet for 5 yuan?

687
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,920
What's the first cup of milk tea for summer?

688
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,920
Baby, who is this?

689
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,920
What's going on?

690
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,920
I'll introduce you to a cup of milk tea for 10 yuan or 20 yuan.

691
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,920
He's a fast learner.

692
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,920
He's a big eater.

693
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,920
He's a big eater.

694
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,920
He can make himself a cup of milk tea.

695
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,920
I'll sell him a small piece of milk tea.

696
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,920
I'll sell him a small piece of milk tea.

697
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,920
You want this too?

698
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,920
Of course, I don't know how to make money.

699
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,920
Do you know your mom?

700
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,920
She's been in the country for so many years.

701
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,920
She's been cheated by people.

702
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,920
But she's not married yet.

703
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,920
She hasn't been cheated by people for half a minute.

704
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,920
Even if she's married,

705
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,920
even if she's a married woman,

706
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,920
she has to take care of her appearance.

707
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,920
With this kind of careless and careless spirit,

708
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:39,920
she can make our family proud.

709
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,920
I've taken it.

710
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,920
This pig is so high.

711
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,920
No.

712
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,920
5.2 yuan.

713
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,920
You're so stingy.

714
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,920
You can sell it for 6.8 yuan.

715
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,920
Now,

716
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,920
all the businesses are increasing in the accounts.

717
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,920
I'm a marketer.

718
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,920
Even 5.2 yuan is enough.

719
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,920
What does that mean?

720
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,920
It means that this pig is greedy.

721
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,920
It's easier to think of.

722
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,920
It's more accurate to set up a target group.

723
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,920
Okay.

724
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,920
I'll take care of it.

725
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,920
I didn't get any training lessons.

726
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,920
I always think this person seems to have a problem.

727
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,920
You sent a message every day.

728
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,920
You can have a look at the woman.

729
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,920
Love makes people busy.

730
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,920
But money will never betray you.

731
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,920
If you're divorced,

732
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,920
you must protect your rights.

733
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,920
Think about how to live.

734
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,920
If you have financial pressure,

735
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,920
I can help you.

736
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,920
I made a investment recently.

737
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,920
It's pretty good.

738
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,920
No problem.

739
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,920
She recommended me an investment.

740
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,920
Isn't it good?

741
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,920
It's just a trick.

742
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,920
It's just a trick.

743
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,920
No, mom.

744
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,920
I've been chatting with Tianya for a long time.

745
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,920
I was unhappy that day.

746
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,920
She was chatting with me all night.

747
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,920
What?

748
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,920
Why are you so silly?

749
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,920
I really don't know

750
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,920
how your uncle and aunt taught you.

751
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,920
You're a person.

752
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,920
Love is simple.

753
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,920
But why are you so simple-minded?

754
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,920
The most patient in the world is a liar.

755
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,920
He's a patient hunter.

756
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,920
Do you understand?

757
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,920
Aunt Sol,

758
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,920
you can go back with mom

759
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,920
and accept our family's family business.

760
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,920
I'll tell you.

761
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,920
I'm sorry.

762
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,920
Even if you're smart,

763
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,920
you can never mind.

764
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,920
But you must be kind.

765
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,920
Mom, you think too much.

766
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:49,920
Can we be kind to the world?

767
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,920
Okay.

768
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,920
Give me your phone.

769
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,920
What?

770
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,920
Mom,

771
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,920
let me show you the real world.

772
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,920
It's so good.

773
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,920
Okay.

774
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,920
Mom, you want to pay him?

775
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,920
Your mother?

776
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,920
Are you crazy?

777
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,920
You just...

778
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,920
You really did it?

779
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,920
Look.

780
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,920
Did you just say

781
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,920
he's a pig?

782
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,920
You even transferred 5000 yuan to him.

783
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,920
You said Tianya is not a person.

784
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,920
You can't do that.

785
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,920
Hurry up.

786
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,920
I'll tell him to transfer it to us.

787
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,920
Don't worry.

788
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,920
He'll definitely transfer it.

789
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,920
No one knows who he is.

790
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,920
Do you know who his mother is?

791
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,920
She's a Chinese woman.

792
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,920
Okay?

793
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,920
Don't worry.

794
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,920
Kids,

795
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,920
today's 007, 008,

796
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,920
the joint opening of the show,

797
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,920
let's congratulate them.

798
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,920
It's a lot of money.

799
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,920
It's a lot of money.

800
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,920
It's just a celebration.

801
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,920
There will be 135 million,

802
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,920
10 million, 100 million in the future.

803
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,920
KPI is not a dream.

804
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,920
Let's cheer for them.

805
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,920
Music,

806
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,920
let's cheer for them.

807
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,920
Music,

808
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,920
let's cheer for them.

809
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,920
Music,

810
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,920
let's cheer for them.

811
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,920
Music,

812
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,920
let's cheer for them.

813
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,920
Music,

814
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,360
What's this?

815
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,960
précis

816
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,120
Stop

817
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,120
Le Feng

818
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,200
Song Yuan

819
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,960
What's this?

820
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,920
Ye Qin

821
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,160
I'll give it to you

822
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,400
too

823
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,480
cooked

824
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,440
Zhang Yu

825
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,840
I'm sorry.

826
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,040
I'm sorry.

827
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,080
I'm sorry.

828
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:22,840
I'm sorry.

829
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,680
I'm sorry.

830
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,520
I'm sorry.

831
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,000
Hello?

832
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,360
Xu Kai, why can you...

833
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,920
Who is that?

834
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,040
You're so good at speaking.

835
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,600
I'm at your door.

836
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,080
Why did you change the door for Xiao Mi?

837
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,440
You're so good at it.

838
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,320
You even went to my door to poison me.

839
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,760
You're really good at it.

840
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,320
I can't help it.

841
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,320
Who told you not to let the child see the old man?

842
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,160
Please don't make it up to me, okay?

843
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,400
You know what you've done.

844
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,280
I've already told you

845
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,720
that you're a good girl.

846
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,640
I've already told you that

847
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,960
it was my fault before.

848
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,560
But no matter what,

849
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,280
it's the biggest problem in our lives now.

850
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,600
Have you ever thought about

851
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,640
our mother's life when you did those things?

852
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,360
I'm telling you,

853
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:28,840
I don't want to

854
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,480
tell you these old-fashioned things.

855
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,880
My story is very simple.

856
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,160
I've already told you last time.

857
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,520
If you can promise me,

858
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,440
think it over and contact me.

859
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,280
If you can't,

860
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,520
don't call me again.

861
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,200
Otherwise, I'll be a nuisance to you.

862
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,000
Bye.

863
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,600
Let me remind you again.

864
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,120
Don't let our family poison me.

865
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,560
The pig's head and the rabbit's neck are all bent.

866
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,880
See you.

867
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,880
I...

868
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,080
Let's have a closer look.

869
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:04,600
The topic is

870
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,320
to form a text agreement in my computer.

871
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:07,720
Talk.

872
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,280
Talk.

873
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,040
Okay.

874
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,800
First of all,

875
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,520
we all have a special reason.

876
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,640
This is also a problem

877
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,360
that we can't let go of.

878
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,360
Other things can be written on the board.

879
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,520
First of all, you know

880
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,960
that you agree with the first one.

881
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,520
Then you have to ask questions.

882
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,800
When did I agree?

883
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:25,960
Just now.

884
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,920
You forgot.

885
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,560
You agreed.

886
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,400
You don't have to say it.

887
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,560
Next,

888
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,360
the agreement

889
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,920
covers economic issues,

890
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,720
emotional issues,

891
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,720
child issues,

892
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,680
and life issues.

893
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,600
Fourth,

894
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,360
do you have any problems?

895
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,080
No problem.

896
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,200
First, economic issues.

897
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,040
You go first.

898
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,760
But I don't think...

899
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,640
What do you mean?

900
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,120
A is too clear.

901
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,160
It's easy to hurt feelings.

902
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,280
If A is not clear,

903
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,160
it will hurt feelings more.

904
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,400
How about this?

905
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,960
The big head chooses A,

906
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,680
and the small head puts water on it.

907
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,360
The big head,

908
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:56,960
for example,

909
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,200
the rent of our rooms,

910
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,200
the children's expenses,

911
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,960
and the medical treatment of our children,

912
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,240
we can figure it out.

913
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:02,560
The small head

914
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,680
goes to everyone to eat,

915
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,280
to meet, to meet,

916
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:04,840
to buy gifts.

917
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,000
These things are so complicated.

918
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,600
How about it?

919
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:08,880
I agree.

920
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,280
There are two problems

921
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,800
that I have to deal with.

922
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,400
Lady first.

923
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,480
First,

924
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,680
I believe we have some problems.

925
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,720
Make it clear in advance.

926
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,840
Don't try it.

927
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,000
For example,

928
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,200
the birthday of your children,

929
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,120
the birthday of your children,

930
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:23,920
the birthday of your family,

931
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,520
and some important holidays,

932
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
remind them in advance.

933
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,200
Don't do that.

934
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,800
Will they remember it?

935
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,200
Will they forget it?

936
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,680
Our special group

937
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,040
make it clear in advance.

938
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:35,880
It's not right to do it.

939
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,320
This question is good.

940
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,240
You asked me to answer it.

941
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,160
What's the other one?

942
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,360
Both of you have to take care of each other

943
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,640
and maintain good health and beauty.

944
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,520
Let everyone look up

945
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,880
and appreciate the moon.

946
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,560
Your question

947
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,160
is a bit unambitious.

948
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,200
I've never denied

949
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,200
that I'm a strict person.

950
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:00,520
Okay.

951
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,560
I'll do it tomorrow.

952
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,160
Hi.

953
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:54,240
Hello,

954
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,400
may I help you?

955
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:57,640
Okay.

956
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,680
You know,

957
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,680
my feelings for Yu'an and Yule

958
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,680
are different from yours.

959
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,680
I want to talk about my ex-girlfriend's feelings

960
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,680
in front of the reality.

961
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,680
It's not suitable.

962
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,680
But I...I hope...

963
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,680
You can still love her.

964
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,680
You...

965
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,680
I won't be angry.

966
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,680
You may not know.

967
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,680
Actually,

968
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,680
I even respect and envy

969
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,680
your feelings.

970
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,680
I also have some CP for you.

971
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,680
You two

972
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,720
have been married since you were a child.

973
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,720
Actually, it's a bit like my manager.

974
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,720
But I'm the one who failed to settle down.

975
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,720
These feelings

976
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,720
are pure and clean.

977
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,720
But for me,

978
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,720
I'm a little out of love.

979
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,720
Compared to the feelings of the two of us,

980
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,720
I'd rather choose

981
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,720
a peaceful life.

982
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,720
But I absolutely like you.

983
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,720
I like the meaning of each and every part of you.

984
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,720
In my opinion,

985
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,720
80% of the life is a peace of mind.

986
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,760
20% of the love

987
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,760
is the most satisfied relationship I have.

988
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,760
So,

989
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,760
she's your love.

990
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,760
We're just friends.

991
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,760
We're just friends.

992
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,760
Okay?

993
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,760
Is it still a problem

994
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,760
for you now?

995
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,760
If it's not a problem,

996
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,760
I'll go with you

997
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,760
to see her next time.

998
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,760
Thank you.

999
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,760
Okay.

1000
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,760
There are two questions.

1001
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,760
It's about the children

1002
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,760
and the life.

1003
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,760
The first time we met these four people

1004
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,760
was like that.

1005
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,760
I think the biggest problem

1006
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,760
we're going to face

1007
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,760
is them.

1008
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,760
I think

1009
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,760
we can try another way.

1010
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,760
Look.

1011
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,760
The current situation

1012
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,760
is very serious.

1013
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,800
The one sitting in front of you

1014
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,800
is a hidden person.

1015
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,800
What's his name?

1016
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,800
I'm sorry.

1017
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,800
I'm sorry.

1018
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,800
I'm sorry.

1019
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,800
I'm sorry.

1020
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,800
I'm sorry.

1021
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,800
I'm sorry.

1022
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,800
I'm sorry.

1023
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,800
I'm sorry.

1024
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,800
I'm sorry.

1025
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,800
I'm sorry.

1026
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:34,800
I'm sorry.

1027
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,800
I'm sorry.

1028
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,800
I'm sorry.

1029
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,800
I'm sorry.

1030
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:38,800
I'm sorry.

1031
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,800
I'm sorry.

1032
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:40,800
I'm sorry.

1033
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,800
I'm sorry.

1034
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:42,800
I'm sorry.

1035
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,800
I'm sorry.

1036
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,800
I'm sorry.

1037
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,800
I'm sorry.

1038
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,800
I'm sorry.

1039
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,800
I'm sorry.

1040
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,800
I'm sorry.

1041
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,800
I'm sorry.

1042
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,800
I'm sorry.

1043
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,800
I'm sorry.

1044
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,800
I'm sorry.

1045
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:53,840
I'm sorry.

1046
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:54,840
I'm sorry.

1047
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,840
I'm sorry.

1048
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,840
I'm sorry.

1049
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,840
I'm sorry.

1050
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,840
I'm sorry.

1051
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,840
I'm sorry.

1052
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,840
I'm sorry.

1053
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:01,840
I'm sorry.

1054
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,840
I'm sorry.

1055
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,840
I'm sorry.

1056
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:04,840
I'm sorry.

1057
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,840
I'm sorry.

1058
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,840
I'm sorry.

1059
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,840
I'm sorry.

1060
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,840
I'm sorry.

1061
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,840
I'm sorry.

1062
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,840
I'm sorry.

1063
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:11,840
I'm sorry.

1064
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,840
I'm sorry.

1065
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:13,840
I'm sorry.

1066
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:14,840
I'm sorry.

1067
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:15,840
I'm sorry.

1068
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:16,840
I'm sorry.

1069
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:17,840
I'm sorry.

1070
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,840
I'm sorry.

1071
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:19,840
I'm sorry.

1072
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:20,840
I'm sorry.

1073
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:21,840
I'm sorry.

1074
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:22,880
I'm sorry.

1075
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:23,880
I'm sorry.

1076
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,880
I'm sorry.

1077
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:25,880
I'm sorry.

1078
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:26,880
I'm sorry.

1079
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,880
I'm sorry.

1080
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:28,880
I'm sorry.

1081
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:29,880
I'm sorry.

1082
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:30,880
I'm sorry.

1083
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,880
I'm sorry.

1084
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:32,880
I'm sorry.

1085
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,880
I'm sorry.

1086
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:34,880
I'm sorry.

1087
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,880
I'm sorry.

1088
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,880
I'm sorry.

1089
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,880
I'm sorry.

00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:40,880
I'm sorry.

1093
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:41,880
I'm sorry.

1094
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:42,880
I'm sorry.

1095
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,880
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

1098
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:46,880
I'm sorry.

1099
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:47,880
I'm sorry.

1100
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:48,880
I'm sorry.

1101
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:49,880
I'm sorry.

1102
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:50,880
I'm sorry.

1103
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:51,920
I'm sorry.

1104
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:52,920
I'm sorry.

1105
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,920
I'm sorry.

1106
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:54,920
I'm sorry.

1107
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,920

I'm sorry.

1111
00:44:58,920 --> 00:44:59,920
I'm sorry.

1112
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:00,920
I'm sorry.

1113
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:01,920
I'm sorry.

1114
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:02,920
I'm sorry.

1115
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:03,920
