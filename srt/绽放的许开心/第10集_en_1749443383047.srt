1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I see your pain and your bravery too

2
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And some things we cannot just embrace

3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And there's no time to guess the ground up us

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Create a daylight, go to the free

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let's cross the wind, dancing ring, let it start singing through my night away

6
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Pacem Bo is theå¹³est. He's this. He's the best.

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,520
Made both of usAT

8
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Am I really done with these?

9
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,200
She always wanted my reward.

10
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
She wanted to break out of here.

11
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
She said she wasn't rich.

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,200
She is too angry.

13
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,600
Sure enough, that was bad sign.

14
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,040
Since he doesn't want to take it, let's not be polite.

15
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,920
What are you doing?

16
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,560
Tell him to re-company the wedding materials.

17
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,760
The money is the hair of the air-conditioner.

18
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,760
I want to give him a single strand of hair.

19
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,680
What's wrong?

20
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,000
How did it become two dollars?

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,880
Why are you staring at me? It's not me.

22
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,720
You're not the one who stole the hair.

23
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,960
Who's the one on the top? Xiao Yao?

24
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,120
Xiao Yao is the one you're looking at, right?

25
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,160
It's me, but I've already locked the bill.

26
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,840
What bill? Lock the bill and pay two dollars?

27
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,560
Ten thousand dollars? How much is it?

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,680
Xiao Yao, stop arguing.

29
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,760
Why are you saying this?

30
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,000
Think of a solution.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,760
What solution? Two dollars is cheaper than a hair dryer.

32
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,040
Call Brother Pei right now.

33
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,400
I'm not calling him.

34
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,960
Call him right now.

35
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,880
What are you doing? Hurry up.

36
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,280
What's wrong?

37
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,720
Brother Pei, where are you now?

38
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,600
The incense is out.

39
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,640
I'm sleepy. I'm just a little bit bet.

40
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,760
The live broadcast is on the wrong track.

41
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,800
The live broadcast is on the 27th.

42
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,080
The bill is two dollars.

43
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,560
It's over 10,000.

44
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,560
What?

45
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,600
Brother Pei, what's wrong?

46
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,600
It's nothing. Let's go upstairs.

47
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,440
Let me confirm it again.

48
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,320
This is...

49
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,000
Brother Pei, you're finally here.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,960
Okay, thank you.

51
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,640
Don't worry.

52
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,480
Brother Pei, you're finally back.

53
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,560
What's going on?

54
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,800
The news about the new live broadcast and the live broadcast

55
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,240
are not clear.

56
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,640
The original was a product of 40 yuan.

57
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,600
The live broadcast and the live broadcast should be sold at 27.

58
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,680
Now suddenly...

59
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,120
Suddenly, the water is at 27.

60
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,600
Yes, yes, yes.

61
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,640
The fans are crazy.

62
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,600
After a minute, they have to pay half the bill.

63
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,320
When we found the problem,

64
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,920
they went out for more than 30 million.

65
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,440
Really?

66
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,880
Did they tell you now?

67
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,760
Yes.

68
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,360
But they only have half the compensation.

69
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,640
They said that when they went to the practice street,

70
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,320
we didn't find the problem in time.

71
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,400
So we have the responsibility.

72
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,480
Okay, then I'll find them and the factory.

73
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,920
The factory doesn't need to contact Meigen.

74
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,800
The factory must be happy now.

75
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,200
Anyway, someone has compensation.

76
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,160
And they have a high-end sales amount.

77
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,160
They have a live broadcast.

78
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,840
No way.

79
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,320
Mei Changyi,

80
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,480
come to my office.

81
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,560
What's wrong?

82
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,560
Think about it.

83
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,520
I'll deal with that old thing.

84
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,840
Use me over there.

85
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,080
There's no food left.

86
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,400
I don't have any more.

87
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,920
Yifan, I'll order some.

88
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,920
No.

89
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,240
I'll go to the food factory.

90
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,560
It's more fresh and cheaper.

91
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,320
Old You, let's go buy some food.

92
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,440
That's your boss's mistake.

93
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,600
It's so convenient and convenient to buy food now.

94
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,040
And it's time to get the money.

95
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,800
If there's any problem, you can ask them.

96
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,400
It's time.

97
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,720
What's left?

98
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,280
The game?

99
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,320
It seems that you have more time.

100
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:31,480
Let's go.

101
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,920
It's your day.

102
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,520
You drive.

103
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,840
You go buy food with me.

104
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,320
You should be with me.

105
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,200
You're a customer.

106
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,640
You said it.

107
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,760
You...

108
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,920
Why are you stepping on my foot?

109
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,800
Okay.

110
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,920
I'll buy some food.

111
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,200
Buy some food.

112
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,960
Buy some food.

113
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,320
Isn't this Yoyo?

114
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,440
You didn't work?

115
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,280
You're here to visit the market with your mom?

116
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,800
You're so pretty.

117
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,680
I just came back from home. I haven't got used to it.

118
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,600
I'll let her stay at home and stay with me for a while.

119
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,480
I'll go buy some meat.

120
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,840
I'll go get some food.

121
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,640
Okay.

122
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,960
I'm sorry, Old You.

123
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,920
The old lady was a good cook.

124
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,520
She was so sick.

125
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,920
She spent a lot of money on this old man.

126
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,960
She sent him abroad to study in an art school.

127
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,000
She didn't have any money.

128
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,840
She's not at home anymore.

129
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,880
What's the matter with Old You?

130
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,080
She's with someone else.

131
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,160
She's so young.

132
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,200
She's so sensitive.

133
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,760
She's so innocent.

134
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,440
You know,

135
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,200
many young people like her now

136
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,280
are still in the same age.

137
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,760
What do you want to try?

138
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,080
I want to try.

139
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,160
I want to try.

140
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,520
Try it.

141
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,000
Try that.

142
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,240
Okay.

143
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,560
Don't tell me you don't have the right to be responsible.

144
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,560
Two groups have raised so many cases.

145
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,160
The company is out of trust in you.

146
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,200
I'm out of the question of helping you

147
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,320
to give you such an important experience.

148
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,840
You made the wrong choice.

149
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,920
You made the wrong choice.

150
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,080
Do you understand?

151
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,000
I understand, Mr. Li.

152
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,840
I didn't want to give you the responsibility.

153
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,840
But now I think

154
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,960
it's not the time to pursue responsibility.

155
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,120
I'll ask the team to set up a public official

156
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,600
and pursue the loss plan.

157
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,720
Is that okay?

158
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,840
You can do it later.

159
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,840
I'll be responsible,

160
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,360
I'll be responsible,

161
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,000
I'll do it.

162
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,680
What do you think?

163
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,200
Now there's a client problem.

164
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,520
Other clients will be afraid.

165
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,800
Let me tell you.

166
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,880
I'll only give you one day to solve the problem.

167
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,200
All the losses in the future

168
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,440
will be in your hands.

169
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,360
You have a plan.

170
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,520
If you can't handle it,

171
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,680
I can't keep you safe this time.

172
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,120
I know, Mr. Li.

173
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,600
Thank you, Mr. Li.

174
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,360
Mom.

175
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,760
Hello.

176
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,280
Please take this.

177
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,680
Thank you.

178
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,400
Are you angry?

179
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,600
I mean,

180
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,000
after the news was out,

181
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,520
I saw you were not sincere.

182
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,040
You were a little emotional.

183
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,920
We also thought about it.

184
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,240
Did you ignore your feelings?

185
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,560
After all, you've been missing your parents for so long.

186
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,080
I've been wanting to be with you.

187
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,080
Who knows?

188
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,480
If Mr. Li and Xiaoxue come to Chengyao,

189
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,120
we'll be in trouble.

190
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,160
I'm sure Wang Li will be the one to blame.

191
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,480
As long as my daughter likes it,

192
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,800
we won't be able to solve it.

193
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,240
Mom, I'm sorry.

194
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:42,920
I'm sorry.

195
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,080
I didn't mean to do anything to my sister.

196
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:46,840
I'm angry.

197
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,720
I just think she's not sincere.

198
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,160
Look at her.

199
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,520
She's been my sister's idol for the rest of her life.

200
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,800
I have to give her a proper explanation.

201
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,840
Tell me, tell Xu Kaixin.

202
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,160
What's the point?

203
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,040
It's all right.

204
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,920
It's 8 o'clock.

205
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,120
It's 8 o'clock.

206
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,600
Okay.

207
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,280
Just try.

208
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,440
Sister, I'm fine now.

209
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,920
We'll be together soon.

210
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,640
I'm not worth it for my sister.

211
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,040
I know I have to find her.

212
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,240
But I know it's a matter of two things.

213
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,520
When you're dating Huang,

214
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,040
how old is the baby?

215
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,080
You're making a man of 30 years old.

216
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,200
You're making a man of 30 years old.

217
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,200
Don't listen to Huang.

218
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,800
I'm sorry.

219
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,000
I'll do it.

220
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,200
I'll do it.

221
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,320
Let's go.

222
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,160
Yes.

223
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,440
Miss Xu, you've been divorced for three years.

224
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,000
That's why you're pursuing a divorce.

225
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,800
After the divorce,

226
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,560
Qian Feng never looked for me.

227
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,560
But recently,

228
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,360
they're going to take my son's health care

229
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,440
and do everything they can to make him feel better.

230
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,320
They've done a lot of stupid things.

231
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,840
Since they're not worth it,

232
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,640
they should stop.

233
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,080
Yes, they're going out to bully Mr. Xu.

234
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,360
Besides, we're not honest people.

235
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,520
We're blind.

236
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,960
Don't be so fast.

237
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,800
In terms of legal laws,

238
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,600
the couple should hide, transfer, sell,

239
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,280
and destroy the property of their couple.

240
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,200
Divorce can be divided or divided.

241
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,920
Once the divorce is found,

242
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,680
the other party should know or know

243
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,320
the date of the divorce

244
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,520
and can ask the court to give it to them.

245
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,040
Please give them the same property again.

246
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,120
That's better.

247
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,760
Then let's get out of this three-year divorce.

248
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,360
But there's a problem.

249
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,120
There's no legal law to disband the divorce.

250
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,400
So what you said

251
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,560
was that the agreement signed

252
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,000
to buy a cheap study room

253
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,480
was not established.

254
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,800
But these two children belong to the female side.

255
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,920
The female side is still out of the house.

256
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,880
Unless the child has nothing to do with the male side,

257
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,120
that's a good thing.

258
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,720
So we still have a chance.

259
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,600
We must make a decision on our own.

260
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,400
Also, if there's evidence

261
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,800
that during the marriage,

262
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,120
the male side did use

263
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,880
the property that was not properly guarded

264
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,240
and took advantage of your property.

265
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,880
That would be better.

266
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,800
You mean

267
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,520
we need to collect more evidence

268
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,720
to speed things up, right?

269
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,800
That's right.

270
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,520
But I want to remind you

271
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,280
that if it's a record evidence,

272
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,160
we must verify it.

273
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,400
We can't judge others' privacy.

274
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,160
Otherwise, we can't use it as evidence.

275
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,760
We can record it in public places

276
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,560
and use legal equipment in our own house,

277
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,840
and record it in our own car.

278
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,280
We can do it as evidence

279
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,720
for the regular records.

280
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,240
Okay.

281
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,480
Let's discuss it.

282
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,200
Thank you.

283
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:40,720
Okay.

284
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,520
You can discuss it.

285
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,520
It's been three years.

286
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,400
Where do you find evidence?

287
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,480
The money is like a monkey.

288
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,240
It's not easy to leave the evidence to you.

289
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,520
You can't use it as evidence.

290
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,360
I have to bear with it?

291
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,640
No.

292
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,080
If you talk to someone

293
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,280
in a gentle way,

294
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,480
your ex-boyfriend and the little tiger

295
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,480
will be in a bad mood

296
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,080
and won't be able to sleep.

297
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,440
Okay.

298
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,720
That makes sense.

299
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,840
You two are so stubborn.

300
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,480
You don't even say a word

301
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,600
and go home to play the zither.

302
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,640
So,

303
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,280
we can do whatever we want

304
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,120
and just keep the three words

305
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,240
without mentioning the rules.

306
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,040
As long as we collect the evidence,

307
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,440
we can speed things up immediately.

308
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,800
Didn't the lawyer just say

309
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,640
that it's not a record evidence

310
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,960
for the regular records?

311
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,360
The family and cars

312
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,160
are all legal monitoring.

313
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,880
In this way,

314
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,640
there are still many opportunities.

315
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,840
It's a good thing.

316
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,200
You are so generous.

317
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,560
You don't even want me to be happy.

318
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,640
What's the point of being so generous?

319
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,960
Think about it.

320
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,680
There are no such properties.

321
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,720
I was happy

322
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,240
when I got married.

323
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,520
If the government

324
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,160
can take over the money,

325
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,480
then the property will be ruined.

326
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,040
Life is already very hard.

327
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,040
Like our middle-aged girls

328
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,640
don't give yourself too much money.

329
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,720
Apple will be in trouble today.

330
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,680
Who is going to marry you

331
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,040
if you are not a middle-aged girl?

332
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,720
Do you know why I love you so much?

333
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,920
You are a walking emotional switch.

334
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,240
No matter how dirty it is,

335
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,560
you can prove

336
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,840
the value of emotional value.

337
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,480
Love is okay.

338
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,120
Please don't get hurt.

339
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,480
I won't give you a bad review.

340
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,400
What's your opinion

341
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,240
about Mei Cheng Yi?

342
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,200
A second-class man like him

343
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,600
is not so good at making jokes.

344
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,720
He is a good client.

345
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,200
He is definitely a good client.

346
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,520
If you don't take this job,

347
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,520
I will take you away

348
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,080
and pay you back.

349
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,000
Try it.

350
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,800
Do you dare to try it?

351
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,960
Yes, yes, yes.

352
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,120
Yes, yes, yes.

353
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,440
Yes, you are right.

354
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,040
Well,

355
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,160
we are not

356
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,920
the time to promote each other.

357
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,920
We should think about

358
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,720
how to reduce the loss.

359
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,280
Please.

360
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,920
You should apologize to us in the live broadcast room.

361
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,000
We need to pay you back.

362
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,440
I believe many netizens

363
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,000
won't take this little advantage, right?

364
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,320
I will apologize to the factory now.

365
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,200
Let's see if we can accept

366
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,680
our new compensation plan.

367
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,680
Is that okay?

368
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,400
Okay, okay.

369
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,080
Thank you.

370
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,240
Thank you.

371
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,240
How is Mei?

372
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,520
How can she be?

373
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,720
The main broadcast said

374
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,560
she had a crush on us before she went to the factory.

375
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,080
Who wrote her?

376
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,960
Then, at that time,

377
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,560
she had been living in the city for more than two years.

378
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,320
She was so confused.

379
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,080
I didn't expect

380
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,160
I would be so confused.

381
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,400
Wait, wait, wait.

382
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,960
Don't cry.

383
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,280
I'm sorry.

384
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,800
Stop, stop, stop.

385
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,040
I'll give you a call.

386
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,880
Okay, I got it.

387
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,680
Go back to your work.

388
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,000
Dad, go back to your work.

389
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,840
Go.

390
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,120
I sent a message last night.

391
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,840
I didn't see it when I was asleep.

392
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,600
I came here this morning

393
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,200
and forgot this tea.

394
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,480
Just send a message.

395
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,680
He won't play with Yuqin's orphanage, right?

396
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,840
I'll tell you, since I saw it,

397
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,200
I've been looking for this kind of fake man.

398
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:57,920
I don't even think my dad

399
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,000
thinks it's real.

400
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,000
Why are you thinking so much?

401
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,920
If you want to date, you have to talk first.

402
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,560
I didn't even get my divorce certificate.

403
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,880
How can I get my certificate with you?

404
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,160
It's so hard to get it.

405
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,120
There are many fake men and women.

406
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,400
They are all over the place.

407
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,440
If they don't get their love,

408
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,800
no one can lie to them.

409
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,640
It's quite stressful.

410
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,640
Besides,

411
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,760
if we can still

412
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,040
get our love back,

413
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,760
we won't be as young as we are.

414
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,920
Do you know who

415
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,440
is the biggest user?

416
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,160
Yes.

417
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,280
It's the girls

418
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,520
who are in love with

419
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,800
their dreams.

420
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,360
These girls in the world

421
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,160
are all scolding us.

422
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,040
If there's no man,

423
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,040
they'll become girls.

424
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,600
It's so boring.

425
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,120
Look,

426
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,320
I've been eating and eating for three years.

427
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,400
I've grown up.

428
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,160
I was worried about you.

429
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,080
Now I'm not sincere.

430
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,000
I was shot in the middle of the year.

431
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,800
I was brainwashed.

432
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,000
I was a child.

433
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,120
I was also bullied by my parents.

434
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,120
Now I'm bullied by you again.

435
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,920
I don't know if my brother

436
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,200
has enough physical strength.

437
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,360
I hope he can be a good friend.

438
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,560
Five, four, three, two, one.

439
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,560
What's this?

440
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,560
Why are you so nervous?

441
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,560
This is called

442
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,560
a new love story

443
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,560
after a long time.

444
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,560
I'm so jealous.

445
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,560
Every time

446
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,560
I come to this store,

447
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,560
I'm so jealous

448
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,560
that everyone

449
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,560
can buy a big and small cat.

450
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,560
Don't say that.

451
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,560
That god

452
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,560
is really accurate.

453
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,560
I can't let go

454
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,560
of the things that I've transferred.

455
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,560
I'm so jealous.

456
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,560
This money is worth it.

457
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,560
I'm thinking

458
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,560
I'll go and look for it again in a few days.

459
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,560
I'll spend some more money.

460
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,560
Maybe my mother's illness will be better.

461
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,560
I'm so scared.

462
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,560
That's just a coincidence.

463
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,560
It's just a coincidence.

464
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,560
We're still sick

465
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,560
because of the money.

466
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,560
What's he doing?

467
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,560
Is he a kid or a cat?

468
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,560
I'll talk to him later.

469
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,560
Son, what's wrong with you these days?

470
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,560
You're always angry

471
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,560
when you're not happy.

472
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,560
Do you have anything to hide?

473
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,560
No.

474
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,560
I don't want Hu Xiaojiao

475
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,560
to be too proud.

476
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,560
I want her to think

477
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,560
she's a mother and a son.

478
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,560
But she's

479
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,560
making fun of me.

480
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,560
Look at your son.

481
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,560
Mom knows you're a little boy.

482
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,560
Hu Xiaojiao has a lot of illness.

483
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,560
But it's not easy

484
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,560
to get pregnant in October, right?

485
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,560
We can do it.

486
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,560
We can't get pregnant.

487
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,560
We can't get pregnant.

488
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,560
Mom thinks she's sick

489
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,560
and doesn't know

490
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,560
when she'll be in the hospital.

491
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,560
Mom thinks

492
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,560
she can be brave

493
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,560
and prepare something for her son.

494
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,560
This one is good.

495
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,560
This one is good.

496
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,560
It's good.

497
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,560
Mom,

498
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,560
I'm sorry.

499
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,560
I'm sorry.

500
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,560
I'm sorry.

501
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,560
I'm sorry.

502
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,560
Hu Xiaojiao is very angry.

503
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,560
If Xu Kaiqing

504
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,560
really doesn't give me back

505
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,560
the rice,

506
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,560
I can't be a mother

507
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,560
even if I have this baby.

508
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,560
I've thought about it.

509
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,560
Call it DoDo.

510
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,560
Money is DoDo.

511
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,560
Mom wants to

512
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,560
make a medical certificate.

513
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,560
The half of the medical certificate

514
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,560
must be for you.

515
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,560
The other half is for DoDo.

516
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,560
I'm going to be angry.

517
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,560
I'm going to make her happy.

518
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,560
I'm going to make her regret

519
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,560
that she's gone.

520
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,560
Mom, you can't give her the money.

521
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,560
Why?

522
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,560
Isn't this your son?

523
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,560
Who knows?

524
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,560
Is he her son?

525
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,560
Right?

526
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,560
Oh, that's true.

527
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,560
Mom,

528
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,560
I'm so excited.

529
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,560
What if

530
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,560
she's a girl?

531
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,560
What should we do?

532
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,560
Right.

533
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,560
This is still the rice.

534
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,560
This is the grandchild of the county.

535
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,560
I'm going to make her regret

536
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,560
that she's gone.

537
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,560
Okay?

538
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,560
I'm going to be angry.

539
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,560
But there's something

540
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,560
you're right about.

541
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,560
Let's take this matter

542
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,560
and make her happy.

543
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,560
Let her

544
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,560
give the money back

545
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,560
to the family.

546
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,560
Right?

547
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,560
Let her know.

548
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,560
The money from the old family

549
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,560
is all from Xiao Mi.

550
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,560
Right?

551
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,560
I'm going to make her regret.

552
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,560
I'm going to make her regret.

553
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,560
I'm going to make her regret.

554
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,560
I'm going to make her regret.

555
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,560
I'm going to make her regret.

556
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,560
I'm going to make her regret.

557
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,560
I'm going to make her regret.

558
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,560
I'm going to make her regret.

559
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,560
I'm going to make her regret.

560
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,560
I'm going to make her regret.

561
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,560
I'm going to make her regret.

562
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,560
I'm going to make her regret.

563
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,560
I'm going to make her regret.

564
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,560
I'm going to make her regret.

565
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,560
I'm going to make her regret.

566
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,560
I'm going to make her regret.

567
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,560
I'm going to make her regret.

568
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,560
No big deal.

569
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,560
We made a clear bank statement.

570
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,560
No big deal.

571
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,560
I'm going to make her regret.

572
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,560
I'm going to make her regret.

573
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:50,560
Young Master brought just three times

574
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,560
the price she left in the box.

575
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,560
San Shang.

576
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,560
She should have bought a grand stock

577
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,560
for her ownæº¢ price.

578
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,560
Young Master,

579
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,560
have a sit.

580
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,560
Come on.

581
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,560
Try to eat some water,

582
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,560
just bring more if you can,

583
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,560
not the bills.

584
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,160
Xiao Li, drink some water.

585
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,160
Come on, drink some water.

586
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,360
Mr. Qin,

587
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,160
you think it's just a simple thing to do on the battlefield?

588
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,360
What's the job now?

589
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,560
It's the sales of the gold machine.

590
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,360
It's okay if you don't want to cooperate.

591
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,560
I can bring other big net reds.

592
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,960
The sales of the goods and the silk are on the Internet.

593
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,960
It's possible that the sales of this year will be ruined.

594
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,760
What's the result?

595
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,560
What's the result?

596
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,560
I've been paying you for three times.

597
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,560
I feel that I'm being cheap.

598
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,160
You're still here to tell me about the price?

599
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,560
PAY!

600
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,160
It's not worth it!

601
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,360
It's not worth it!

602
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,360
Oh, my God!

603
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,960
Xiao Li, Xiao Li, Xiao Li!

604
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,360
I'm so angry!

605
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,360
Sit down. Sit down.

606
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,760
Xiao Li, Xiao Li, Xiao Li.

607
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,360
When I was a kid, I played the Internet.

608
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,760
I was a world-class hero.

609
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,760
I only understood after I grew up.

610
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,760
It's just that the adult society

611
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,360
failed to take the lead and discover that

612
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,360
it was cursed but was powerless to resist.

613
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,960
It was forced to hold on.

614
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,360
It was cursed with a smile.

615
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,160
It was the true truth of the world of adult people.

616
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,160
Please leave.

617
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,960
Wait a minute.

618
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,160
We're going to leave.

619
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,160
Please leave.

620
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,360
Please leave.

621
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,160
You're not coming out?

622
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:25,960
I'm coming out.

623
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,160
Over there.

624
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,160
Xiao Li.

625
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,160
Xiao Li.

626
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,760
What are you doing?

627
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,960
Let's go.

628
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,960
Xiao Li.

629
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,760
Bye-bye.

630
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,560
Xiao Li.

631
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,560
I'm going out!

632
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,760
Xiao Li.

633
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,560
Xiao Li, Xiao Li!

634
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,360
Xiao Li, Xiao Li!

635
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,360
Xiao Li.

636
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,960
I know you.

637
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,960
I'm your father.

638
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,960
Sister secretly showed me your photo.

639
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,960
Yes, it's not dad. It's Xiao Mi's dad.

640
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,960
I'm hungry.

641
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,960
Thank you.

642
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,960
Let's go.

643
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,960
Shan Yi.

644
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,960
We can't just take her like this.

645
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,960
I'm hungry.

646
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,960
How is it?

647
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,960
Sorry.

648
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,960
Where did you hit?

649
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,960
Say it again.

650
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,960
Say it again.

651
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,960
I saw you were in a hurry.

652
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,960
It's okay.

653
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,960
It's like this, Li Zuo.

654
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,960
Now the live broadcast situation is effective.

655
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,960
67%

656
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,960
I'm still continuing to communicate with them.

657
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,960
The original market value

658
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,960
is still demanding our 300 compensation.

659
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,960
I really touched it this afternoon.

660
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,960
They temporarily agree now.

661
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,960
Our live broadcast team

662
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,960
has been in a double market for three days.

663
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,960
The original customer fee is not changed.

664
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,960
It's also a variable 300 compensation.

665
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,960
The company is not paid.

666
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,960
It's a good explanation.

667
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,960
But this matter is not final.

668
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,960
Xia Yan, I understand.

669
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,960
This also depends on the future three days.

670
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,960
The situation of our initial order launch.

671
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,960
And the results of the sales of the double market.

672
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,960
I'm just doing a new launch plan.

673
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,960
Okay.

674
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,960
The plan is not round.

675
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,960
But don't want to add a half-fail.

676
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,960
Where are the others?

677
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,960
The live broadcast team is not coming.

678
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,960
I'll send the plan to the school later.

679
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,960
Okay.

680
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,960
I'll make up for it.

681
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,960
I'm not busy.

682
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,960
Come on.

683
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,960
You can't go to the school.

684
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,960
You go first.

685
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,960
You're busy.

686
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,960
Come on.

687
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,960
Let's eat.

688
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,960
Let's eat.

689
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,960
Come on.

690
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,960
Come on.

691
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,960
Eat.

692
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,960
Listen to me.

693
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,960
Let's eat.

694
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,960
Let's eat.

695
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,960
Dad told you.

696
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,960
I'm not going to tell you.

697
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,960
Did you hear me?

698
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,960
This is not a good idea.

699
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,960
Come on.

700
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,960
Let's eat.

701
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,960
It's so good.

702
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,960
Look.

703
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,960
My sister ate it all.

704
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,960
Yes.

705
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,960
We also eat.

706
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,960
Come on.

707
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,960
What are you doing?

708
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,960
What's wrong?

709
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,960
It's all your fault.

710
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,960
You're the one who came here to take care of the child.

711
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,960
She left the child here.

712
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,960
She went out to have a romantic life.

713
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,960
Aunt Huai, you're wrong.

714
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,960
She's not working overtime.

715
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,960
She's very happy.

716
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,960
Aunt Huai, Aunt Huai.

717
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,960
Yes, Aunt Huai.

718
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,960
Listen to me.

719
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,960
Who is happy?

720
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,960
I'm going to ask your dad to do it alone.

721
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,960
Okay?

722
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,960
Okay.

723
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,960
Don't cry.

724
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,960
Okay.

725
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,960
What are you doing?

726
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,960
Okay.

727
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,960
Don't cry.

728
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,960
I'm going to scold Aunt Huai.

729
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,960
Don't cry.

730
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,960
Don't cry.

731
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,960
You're the one who did this to the family.

732
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,960
This is your family.

733
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,960
You won't take the child and scold the child.

734
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,960
You're so stubborn.

735
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,960
You won't do anything.

736
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,960
You'll be in trouble with me.

737
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,960
This month's salary is not even a dime.

738
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,960
Don't try to fool me again.

739
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,960
Mom, you're going to cook?

740
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,960
Enough.

741
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,960
It's like this every day.

742
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,960
Why are you making a fuss today?

743
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,960
Stop saying that.

744
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,960
You...

745
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,960
Okay.

746
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,960
If you're capable, don't come back.

747
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,960
You can take care of yourself.

748
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,960
Come here.

749
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,960
Let's eat.

750
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,960
Don't cry.

751
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,960
Come.

752
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,960
You're so lazy.

753
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,960
You're so drunk.

754
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,960
Even if you're not good at it,

755
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,960
don't say anything.

756
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,960
Don't make a fuss.

757
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,960
Is she your daughter?

758
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,960
You two are married.

759
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,960
You're the only one who knows.

760
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,960
I know.

761
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,960
These are two good things.

762
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,960
You deserve it.

763
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,960
I'm telling you.

764
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,960
I don't care about it today.

765
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,960
I don't care about you.

766
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,960
I don't care about you.

767
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,960
You...

768
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,960
Okay.

769
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,960
I'm sorry.

770
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,960
Why?

771
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,960
Why?

772
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,960
Come.

773
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,960
I'm coming here.

774
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,960
It's really fun to stay for fun.

775
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,960
Ad here...

776
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,960
You okay?

777
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,960
Are you tired?

778
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,960
No, I'm just passing the exam.

779
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,960
Are you running behind a car?

780
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,960
I'll take care of you.

781
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,960
He wasn't talking.

782
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,960
Can he...

783
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,960
That's for you?

784
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,960
What's that?

785
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,560
It's Auntie.

786
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,440
Auntie and Grandpa quarreled.

787
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,440
They ran away.

788
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,880
Grandpa was angry.

789
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,880
He never let Auntie come back.

790
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,520
It's because you two don't eat well.

791
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,520
It's not that.

792
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,520
It's Auntie saying dad's bad words.

793
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,120
Yes, Auntie is bad.

794
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,120
Don't let Auntie come back.

795
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,120
Yes.

796
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,320
Auntie is not like that.

797
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,000
Come on.

798
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,120
Let's play together.

799
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,120
Let's play.

800
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,920
I'll give you a call.

801
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,960
Auntie.

802
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,960
He's still not in the room with his phone.

803
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,960
He was very emotional when he left.

804
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,960
What should we do now?

805
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,960
What should we do?

806
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,960
You didn't make him angry.

807
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,960
I didn't make him angry.

808
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,960
No, no, no.

809
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,960
Dad, he's not far away from the phone.

810
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,960
I'll go find him.

811
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,960
Don't worry.

812
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,960
He's not a kid.

813
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,960
It's not your daughter.

814
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,960
Of course you don't worry.

815
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,960
When you forget his sister,

816
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,960
he threw a big bottle of M.I. medicine.

817
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,960
He even gave you a few music.

818
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,960
Dad, that's an accident.

819
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,960
Accident?

820
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,960
If it's an accident, it's real.

821
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,960
You're a crazy dog.

822
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,960
You're making trouble.

823
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,960
Isn't it all because of you?

824
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,960
Dad, because of me?

825
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,960
Dad, I'll go find him.

826
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,960
I want to go.

827
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,960
You two stay here.

828
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,960
No.

829
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,960
I want to go.

830
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,960
Don't say it again.

831
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,960
Go back.

832
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,960
You.

833
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,960
As the old saying goes,

834
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,960
parents' mouths are the children's water.

835
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,960
You can't give the children some mouth.

836
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,960
It's good that Cheng Yi is angry.

837
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,960
Look at you.

838
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,960
You're not doing much.

839
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,960
You can't do anything good.

840
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,960
It's because of your ugly mouth.

841
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,960
Excuse me.

842
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,960
Excuse me.

843
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,960
It's okay.

844
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,960
It's said that only three seconds in the elevator

845
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,960
are the most real emotions of adults.

846
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,960
But the funny thing is,

847
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,960
most of us,

848
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,960
even the real ones in three seconds,

849
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,960
are the ones who are set.

850
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,960
I'm sorry.

851
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,960
Let's play a game.

852
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,960
Zha Min,

853
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,960
Dad, are you happy to see us here?

854
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,960
Xiumin,

855
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,960
get ready.

856
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,960
Come on, get ready.

857
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,960
Come on.

858
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,960
I'm sure I've got a problem.

859
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,960
Or

860
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,960
I'm in another safe space.

861
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,960
Coming.

862
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,960
I'm sorry.

863
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,960
It's my fault,

864
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,960
and my son's fault.

865
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,960
And my sister Li's fault, too.

866
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,960
But what's the problem?

867
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,960
Who can tell me

868
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,960
what's the problem

869
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,960
between us?

870
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,960
Mom, mom.

871
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,960
Happy,

872
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,960
why are you back so late?

873
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,960
You didn't answer my call.

874
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,960
I'm taking Xiumin to school today

875
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,960
to see my mom and Qianghao.

876
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,960
I didn't want to bother her.

877
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,960
But Xiumin seems to be very happy

878
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,960
to see her dad.

879
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,960
I thought I was going through a bad time.

880
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,960
What's the mess?

881
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,960
No.

882
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,960
Then you can't let them come home.

883
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,960
Qianghao and his mom

884
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,960
said they wanted to talk

885
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,960
about the future of the money.

886
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,960
You didn't answer my call.

887
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,960
I thought

888
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,960
it's not like

889
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,960
we need money or noodles.

890
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,960
I was confused.

891
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,960
So I brought them back.

892
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,960
You're an old lady.

893
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,960
You're a rich lady.

894
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,960
Am I wrong?

895
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,960
It's okay.

896
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,960
It's me.

897
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,960
Xiumin.

898
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,960
Mr. Wei.

899
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,960
You're almost done.

900
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,960
You don't have much food here.

901
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,960
You can't have dinner with us.

902
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,960
Qianghao,

903
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,960
can you bring my mom

904
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,960
with you?

905
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,960
Let's go out and talk.

906
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,960
Happy?

907
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,960
You know

908
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,960
my condition, right?

909
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,960
You can let me

910
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,960
stay with them.

911
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,960
What do you think?

912
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,960
You're so good.

913
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,960
If you didn't know

914
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,960
what you did in the back,

915
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,960
you might have

916
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,960
been fooled again.

917
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,960
Okay.

918
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,960
Let's go.

919
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,960
What's wrong?

920
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,960
We can play.

921
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,960
You're so bad.

922
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,960
Say it.

923
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,960
Are you okay recently?

924
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,960
I have something to say.

925
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,960
Hu Xiaoxiao is pregnant.

926
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,960
Congratulations.

927
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,960
I know why.

928
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,960
I just can't get up.

929
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,960
I thought

930
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,960
when you were in the big rice,

931
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,960
I would be like

932
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,960
when I was the happiest

933
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,960
in my life,

934
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,960
and when you were the most beautiful

935
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,960
in the world.

936
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,960
I know

937
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,960
your performance is very powerful,

938
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,960
but you don't have to

939
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,960
show it to me.

940
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,960
Sister Li Li,

941
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,960
tell me

942
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,960
if you want to come out

943
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,960
and talk about our

944
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,960
wealth distribution.

945
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,960
Happy?

946
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,960
Happy?

947
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,960
Or Miss Xu?

948
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,960
Okay, okay.

949
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,960
Happy.

950
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,960
I know.

951
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,960
I know

952
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,960
in your heart,

953
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,960
I'm a small person.

954
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,960
But I'm really regretful now.

955
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,960
Especially today,

956
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,960
I brought

957
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,960
the real meaning

958
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,960
to the big rice.

959
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,960
What have I missed these years?

960
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,960
My mom is like a baby now.

961
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,960
She even wants to

962
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,960
leave all the property

963
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,960
to Hu Xiaoxiao's baby.

964
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,960
Can I promise you this?

965
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,960
No way.

966
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,960
I have to stop her.

967
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,960
I have to talk to you.

968
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,960
Right?

969
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,960
In my heart,

970
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,960
Hu Xiaoxiao's baby

971
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,960
will never be

972
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,960
as big as the big rice.

973
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,960
Lin Hao,

974
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,960
I think you're really excellent.

975
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,960
You keep thinking

976
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,960
I know

977
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,960
two words about Wu Chi.

978
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,960
And I suggest

979
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,960
you

980
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,960
go to the hospital

981
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,960
and have a good time

982
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,960
to share your spirit.

983
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,960
I don't know

984
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,960
what happened

985
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,960
between you and Hu Xiaoxiao.

986
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,960
But

987
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,960
you gave me a cake shop

988
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,960
and a half.

989
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,960
The one who is

990
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,960
the most loyal

991
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,960
is your ex-husband.

992
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,960
I want to know

993
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,960
whether Hu Xiaoxiao

994
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,960
has such an excellent husband.

995
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,960
We're talking about

996
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,960
our business.

997
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,960
Why are you talking about Hu Xiaoxiao?

998
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,960
Wang Xiaoxiao,

999
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,960
do you hear me?

1000
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,960
Please take care of

1001
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,960
your husband.

1002
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,960
Don't make him

1003
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,960
feel bad in front of me.

1004
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,960
Say hello.

1005
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,960
Go away.

1006
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,960
I won't let you go.

1007
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,960
This is called

1008
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,960
being shameless.

1009
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,960
But I learned

1010
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,960
it from you.

1011
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,960
I'm so sleepy.

1012
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,960
I...

1013
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,960
I've made it.

1014
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,960
Hey.

1015
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,960
Hey.

1016
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,960
I think I should go out

1017
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,960
and have a walk.

1018
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,960
Stop!

1019
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,960
If you can't find my daughter,

1020
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,960
you should stop coming back.

1021
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,960
I'm sorry.

1022
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,960
Come on.

1023
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,960
Let's take a picture.

1024
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,960
Wow, that's great.

1025
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,960
Look, I'll give you a good one.

1026
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,960
Wow, sister.

1027
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,960
That's great.

1028
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,960
Look, like this.

1029
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,960
It's not bad.

1030
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,960
It's really good.

1031
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,960
It's really good.

1032
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,960
It's really good.

1033
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,960
It's really good.

1034
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,960
I've made two this time.

1035
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,960
Wow, two this time.

1036
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,960
One more.

1037
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,960
It's really good, sister.

1038
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,960
I'll find another one for you.

1039
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,960
Okay.

1040
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,960
Yao Yao.

1041
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,960
Yao Yao.

1042
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,960
Where should I go?

1043
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,960
Yao Yao.

1044
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,960
Yao Yao.

1045
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,960
Yao Yao.

1046
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,960
Where are you?

1047
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,960
I'm here.

1048
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,960
Where?

1049
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,960
Don't go.

1050
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,960
I'm here.

1051
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,960
I'm here.

1052
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:38,960
My little group.

1053
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,960
Now...

1054
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,960
My little group.

1055
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,960
I finally found you.

1056
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,960
No.

1057
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,960
You didn't even bring your phone.

1058
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:49,960
You left the house.

1059
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,960
Your parents are all in a hurry.

1060
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,960
No way.

1061
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,960
They can't leave me behind.

1062
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,960
I'm afraid that Lei Zhen is not you.

1063
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,960
Three of us?

1064
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,960
Okay, let's drink.

1065
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,960
I'll try to avoid trouble later.

1066
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,960
I'll try to avoid trouble later.

1067
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,960
They're getting older.

1068
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,960
It's hard for them.

1069
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,960
Let's go.

1070
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,960
I don't mean that.

1071
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,960
Brother-in-law, are you having a new girlfriend?

1072
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,960
You want to have a relationship with us?

1073
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,960
I know women don't make sense.

1074
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,960
But I didn't expect

1075
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,960
you could be so unreasonable.

1076
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,960
You're afraid that the father and mother

1077
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,960
will be in a mess.

1078
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,960
You let me find a girlfriend

1079
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,960
and break their minds.

1080
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,960
Why do you blame me now?

1081
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,960
I didn't mean to do anything to you.

1082
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,960
I just broke my sister's name.

1083
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,960
You've changed too quickly.

1084
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,960
You told me that you're just a couple

1085
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,960
and you want to help others.

1086
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,960
So I'm so happy now.

1087
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,960
Don't you feel sorry for my sister?

1088
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,960
You're so cold-hearted.

1089
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,960
You're so cold-hearted.

1090
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,960
You should at least be kind.

1091
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,960
I know you're feeling sorry for your sister.

1092
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,960
I don't want to lie.

1093
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,960
I'm really happy for Xu.

1094
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,960
I didn't...

1095
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,960
But I don't feel sorry for your sister.

1096
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,960
Your sister has been away for three and a half years.

1097
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,960
No matter who she is,

1098
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,960
your sister will never replace her.

1099
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,960
You said that again.

1100
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,960
I'm not a saint.

1101
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,960
I'm not a male lead in any idol drama.

1102
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,960
I'm just a normal middle-aged man.

1103
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,960
How could I have stayed for her for a lifetime?

1104
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,960
If you...

1105
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,960
Help!

1106
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:38,960
You're going to jump over the river.

1107
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,960
Hurry up and help!

1108
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,960
Help!

1109
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,960
Help!

1110
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,960
Help!

1111
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,960
Help!

1112
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,960
Help!

1113
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:46,960
Help!

1114
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,960
Help!

1115
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,960
Help!

1116
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,960
You dare not scare me!

1117
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:50,960
Help!

1118
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,960
Help!

1119
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,960
Help!

1120
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,960
Help!

1121
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:54,960
Help!

1122
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,960
Help!

1123
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:56,960
Help!

1124
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,960
Help!

1125
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:58,960
Help!

1126
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:24,960
Help!

1127
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:54,960
Help!
