I don't want it.

37
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,100
What do you want?

00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,100
I want revenge.

I'm sorry.

00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,100
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,100
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,100
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,100
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,100
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,100
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,100
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,100
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,100
This is the top of the mountain in the south.

61
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,100
I wonder when I can see you again.

62
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,100
I made a new sword.

63
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,100
It's for you.

64
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,100
It's not sharp.

65
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,100
Don't forget your first experience.

66
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,100
Take care.

67
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,100
I'm leaving.

68
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,100
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,100
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,100
I'm sorry.

71
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,100
What's your name?

72
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,100
Yun Qing.

73
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,100
I'm asking you what you're calling now.

74
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,100
What's your name?

75
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,100
Mr. Kong Wang.

76
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,100
My name is Mr. Kong Wang.

77
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,100
But,

78
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,100
it's like a dream.

79
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,100
I'm sorry.

80
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,100
I'm sorry.

81
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,100
I'm sorry.

82
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,100
I'm sorry.

83
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,100
I'm sorry.

84
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,100
I'm sorry.

85
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,100
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,100
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,100
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,100
I'm sorry.

89
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:21,100
Master Li, Master Li.

90
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:27,100
Master, I heard that you've been in a state of emergency.

91
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,100
This money...

92
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,100
Fine.

93
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:37,100
Since you already know, I'll tell you the truth.

94
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,100
People are not as poor as they used to be.

95
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,100
A few days ago, I lost my treasure.

96
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,100
I bought it for you.

97
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,100
So you're the one who gave it all up?

98
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,100
Of course.

99
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:55,100
Master, you don't have to care too much about it.

100
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,100
Sister Huang.

101
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,100
Okay, okay.

102
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,100
Stop.

103
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,100
You've said it before.

104
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,100
You're a good person.

105
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,100
You're a good person.

106
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,100
I'm helping you, too.

107
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,100
Master, I'm hiding a chance.

108
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,100
I'm hiding a great master, Ma Dao Cheng Gong.

109
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,100
Next time, you'll be a great man.

110
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,100
You'll be a great man.

111
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,100
You'll be a great man.

112
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,100
You'll be a great man.

113
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:27,100
At that time, I had a chance to share my happiness.

114
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,100
Can I?

115
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,100
Sure.

116
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,100
I'll prepare it.

117
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:35,100
I'm willing to sacrifice my life for you.

118
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,100
I'll do my best.

119
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,100
I won't let you down.

120
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,100
I'm ready.

121
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,100
Li Shan De, it's time to go.

122
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,100
Let's go.

123
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:17,100
Tong, when I come back, no one will bully you.

124
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,100
Who will bully me?

125
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,100
Come on.

126
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,100
Li, take care of yourself.

127
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,100
Get up.

128
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,100
Get up.

129
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,100
Master Li.

130
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,100
Master Su.

131
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,100
This is the blood of a thousand foxes.

132
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,100
The path is dangerous.

133
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,100
Master, the night is dark.

134
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,100
The wind is heavy.

135
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,100
You must take care of it.

136
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,100
I'll take care of it.

137
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,100
I'll take care of it.

138
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,100
I'll take care of it.

139
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,100
I'll take care of it.

140
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,100
I'll take care of it.

141
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,100
I'll take care of it.

142
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,100
I'm so worried about you.

143
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,100
I have a lot of things to talk about.

144
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,100
I'll say it again.

145
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,100
Remember, I'll wait for you in the company.

146
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:28,100
I'll give you everything you need.

147
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,100
I'll wait for you.

148
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,100
You can protect me.

149
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,100
Let's go.

150
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,100
Go.

151
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,100
Hurry up.

152
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,100
Hurry up.

153
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,100
Hurry up.

154
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,100
Hurry up.

155
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,100
Hurry up.

156
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,100
Hurry up.

157
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,100
Hurry up.

158
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,100
Hurry up.

159
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,100
I'll take you to the temple.

160
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,100
We've been here for some time.

161
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,100
Li Shan De has left.

162
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,100
He's not here.

163
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,100
Go after him.

164
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,100
Mr. Kong has arranged it.

165
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,100
When we get to Chang'an,

166
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,100
Lu Si Cheng of Jing'an Temple will contact you.

167
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,100
I'll be there in a few days.

168
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,100
I'll be there any time.

169
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,100
Okay, let's go.

170
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,100
Hurry up.

171
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,100
Hurry up.

172
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,100
He Ci Shi,

173
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,100
I'm lucky.

174
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,100
I've been doing everything in the Chamber.

175
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,100
Everything is fine.

176
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,100
To be honest,

177
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,100
He Ci Shi,

178
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,100
I've been working in Amita's form.

179
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,100
I've been jealous.

180
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,100
I've been sitting here until now.

181
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,100
I've been here before.

182
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,100
Luckily, He Ci Shi found my coat.

183
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,100
He Ci Shi is a good actor.

184
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,100
You're my boy.

185
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,100
After I sat here,

186
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,100
I was so happy.

187
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,100
Even Su Liang was so impressed with me.

188
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,100
He decided to give up the position of the leader of the Chengdu.

189
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,100
He sold the boat to Yang Lao.

190
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,100
What did you say?

191
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,100
Su Liang sold the boat.

192
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,100
He sold it.

193
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,100
Come here.

194
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,100
Why did he sell the boat?

195
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,100
I...

196
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,100
Maybe...

197
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,100
Maybe I'm too strong.

198
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,100
I'm afraid I'll be killed.

199
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,100
You're so smart.

200
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,100
You're like this.

201
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,100
Don't you understand?

202
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,100
Su Liang sold the boat to exchange money.

203
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,100
He's been so lucky.

204
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,100
He's been so lucky.

205
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,100
He's been so lucky to protect him.

206
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,100
Don't you understand?

207
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,100
I understand.

208
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,100
Lao Zhao.

209
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,100
Uncle Zhao.

210
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,100
Uncle Zhao.

211
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,100
I'm sorry.

212
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,100
I'm sorry.

213
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,100
Su Liang sold the boat to someone else.

214
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,100
He's here.

215
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,100
What's wrong, He Ci Shi?

216
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,100
Lao Zhao,

217
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,100
you go to Li Zhi's house right now.

218
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,100
You can check what Li Xian De is doing here.

219
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,100
If he really sold Li Zhi,

220
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,100
you take him down.

221
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,100
Yes.

222
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,100
Hurry up.

223
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,100
Let me ask you.

224
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,100
Which of the two is the real owner of the boat?

225
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,100
Who sold it?

226
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,100
I'll go and check.

227
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,100
Hurry up.

228
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,100
Uncle Zhao.

229
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,100
Why are you in a hurry to take me back?

230
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,100
Hurry up.

231
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,100
Go and catch Li Xian De.

232
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,100
Li Xian De?

233
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,100
What's wrong with you?

234
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,100
I just went to Li Zhi Yuan's house.

235
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,100
I found Li Xian De

236
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,100
and he's gone back to Chang'an.

237
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,100
He's already...

238
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,100
Hey,

239
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,100
come here.

240
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,100
Come here.

241
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,100
Come here.

242
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,100
Hurry up.

243
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,100
Hurry up.

244
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,100
Come here.

245
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,100
Come here.

246
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,100
Come here.

247
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,100
Come here.

248
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,100
Hurry up.

249
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,100
Hurry up.

250
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,100
You...

251
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,100
You guys, come here.

252
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,100
Let me ask you.

253
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,100
Did Li Xian De sell it?

254
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,100
Yes.

255
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,100
Hey!

256
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,100
You bastard!

257
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,100
You're such a big man.

258
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,100
You're going to kill me!

259
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,100
Uncle Zhao,

260
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,100
I'll go and get Li Xian De.

261
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,100
Zhen Xian, he said he had four ways to do it.

262
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,100
The first one is

263
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,100
the second one is the new road.

264
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,100
The third one is the road to north.

265
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,100
The fourth one is the road to the north.

266
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,100
The second one is the road to the south.

267
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,100
The last one is the road to the west.

268
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,100
Zhen Xian,

269
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,100
the road to the west is closed.

270
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,100
He's been looking for a way

271
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,100
to help him

272
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,100
to get to the west.

273
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,100
I'm sure it's the road to the west.

274
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,100
The road to the west?

275
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,100
You just go to Li Xian De

276
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,100
and get Li Xian De.

277
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,100
You'll get him.

278
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,100
Hurry up.

279
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,100
You bastard!

280
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,100
Li Yong!

281
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,100
You bastard!

282
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,100
You're going to get Li Xian De.

283
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,100
Hurry up.

284
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,100
Everyone, stop!

285
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,100
He's coming!

286
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,100
He's coming!

287
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,100
What's going on?

288
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,100
Stop.

289
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,100
Stop.

290
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,100
Stop!

291
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,100
Stop.

292
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,100
Stop!

293
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,100
Super sighted!

294
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,880
Very good!

295
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,600
This is so good.

296
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,200
Selfish...

297
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,220
Amida has a clue!

298
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,140
So I searched over and over at the port.

299
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,420
Everyone left waiting to deliver and I've searched for them there.

300
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,780
The winters in Li Gang have gone riddled with the good scenery today.

301
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,860
Take care, OK?

302
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,380
Mr. Cheng, Miswork...

303
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,460
You can't do this.

304
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,780
Well done!

305
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,220
Because of you, Mr. Cheng,

306
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:23,940
I was getting busy,

307
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,060
so I asked Mr. Cheng to take me home

308
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,380
he was caught.

309
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,820
Li Shande's side

310
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,620
even if he returns to Chang'an

311
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,620
he's just a fight.

312
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,460
If he breaks his leg,

313
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,060
he won't be able to make any money.

314
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,420
I thought he was just doing what the court says.

315
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,700
He proved that he did his best

316
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,540
and that's why he didn't make it.

317
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,100
He did what he wanted

318
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,620
and he was guilty.

319
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,860
Hey, slow down.

320
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,860
Oh, right. Turn around.

321
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,060
That Lin Yinu,

322
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,060
that dog-nude,

323
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,060
he has a second heart.

324
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,060
I've already seen it.

325
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,060
That's why he didn't break his leg.

326
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,060
He just wanted to have a day off.

327
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,060
He used a counter-attack.

328
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,260
He used his way to

329
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,860
catch Li Shande's side

330
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:19,060
and he's just a fight.

331
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,060
You're so stubborn.

332
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,060
You're so stubborn.

333
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,060
You've fought Li Shande.

334
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,060
Did you beat me?

335
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,060
You've been training with me.

336
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,060
I did.

337
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,060
I'm sorry.

338
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,060
I've been looking at him

339
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,060
all day long.

340
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,060
He's so stubborn and

341
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,060
he's just a fight.

342
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,060
Now he's leaving Linan

343
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:02,060
and he's just a fight.

344
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,060
I don't need to care about it.

345
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,060
He's dead.

346
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,060
It's delicious.

347
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,060
I'm healthy.

348
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,060
I'm not a good person.

349
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,060
I'm not a good person.

350
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,060
I'm not a good person.

351
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,060
I'm not a good person.

352
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,060
I'm not a good person.

353
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,060
I'm not a good person.

354
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,060
I'm not a good person.

355
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,060
I'm not a good person.

356
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,060
I'm not a good person.

357
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,060
I'm not a good person.

358
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,060
I'm not a good person.

359
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,060
I'm not a good person.

360
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,060
I'm not a good person.

361
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,060
I'm not a good person.

362
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,060
I'm not a good person.

363
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,060
I'm not a good person.

364
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,060
I'm not a good person.

365
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,060
Uncle,

366
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,060
they're in danger.

367
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,060
They're in danger.

368
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,060
They're in danger.

369
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,060
Do you have a name?

370
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,060
I'll give you a name.

371
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,060
You can call me Ali.

372
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,060
He said

373
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:56,060
he would give me

374
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,060
a chance to win.

375
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,060
You follow me from now on.

376
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,060
Don't be afraid.

377
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,060
I won't call you.

378
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,060
You are

379
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,060
my father.

380
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,060
You are my father.

381
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,060
I'm not a good person.

382
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,060
I'm not a good person.

383
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,060
I'm not a good person.

384
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,060
I'm not a good person.

385
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,060
Ali.

386
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,060
Ali.

387
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,060
Wait for me.

388
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,060
I'll pick you up at the ancestral house.

389
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,060
Mr. He,

390
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,060
Yang Xiao Wei said

391
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,060
Lin Yi Nu took a wrong path.

392
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,060
Lin Yi Nu is so bad.

393
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,060
He didn't say

394
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,060
which way Li Shan De took.

395
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,060
He has been delayed for a day.

396
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,060
No matter what, he won't come back.

397
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,060
Get out.

398
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,060
Get out.

399
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,060
What's wrong with him?

400
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,060
Didn't you say you must win?

401
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,060
Yang Xiao Wei.

402
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:30,060
Yang Xiao Wei was misled by that Lin Yi Nu.

403
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,060
He was always

404
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,060
trying to take a wrong path.

405
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,060
What are you doing?

406
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,060
I didn't expect

407
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,060
that Lin Yi Nu would be so cunning.

408
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,060
Shut up.

409
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,060
You are both the empress.

410
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,060
You did one thing.

411
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,060
When you do this,

412
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,060
you will be over.

413
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:48,060
You call Yang Xiao Wei right now.

414
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,060
Don't worry about it.

415
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:52,060
I'll find out the secret of the family.

416
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,060
I'll go to Tian Luo.

417
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,060
Stop.

418
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,060
Mr. Zhao,

419
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:05,060
if you lose again,

420
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:08,060
what should I do?

421
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:14,060
I don't want to answer him.

422
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,060
I can't let anything happen to him.

423
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,060
Come on.

424
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,060
Li Daxiang,

425
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,060
what's wrong with you?

426
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,060
What's wrong with you?

427
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,060
Do you want to rest?

428
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,060
I'm fine.

429
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,060
You may go now.

430
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,060
I'll go.

431
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,060
I'll go to you.

432
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,060
Go now.

433
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,060
I'll go now.

434
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,060
Okay.

435
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,060
Go.

436
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,060
I'll go first. I'll go after you.

437
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,060
Go first. Go first.

438
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,060
Go!

439
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,060
Gu Ye is gone.

440
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,060
Gao Er.

441
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:48,060
Are you happy in Chang'an or in Lingnan?

442
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:52,060
As long as you're happy with the King of Qi,

443
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,060
can you say something else?

444
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,060
I heard it well.

445
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:01,060
Do you know what I'm thinking about at this moment?

446
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,060
I'm going back to Chang'an.

447
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,060
You're not right.

448
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,060
You're back, Master Li.

449
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,060
Hurry up.

450
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,060
Hurry up.

451
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,060
Master Li, hurry up.

452
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,060
Be careful.

453
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,060
Be careful.

454
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,060
Be careful.

455
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,060
Master Li, I'm sorry.

456
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,060
Let's go.

457
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,060
Take the time.

458
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,060
We'll wait for you at the next station.

459
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,060
Hurry up.

460
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:19,060
I'm sorry.

461
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,060
Luckily, you made it to the station.

462
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:30,060
If you were in the wilderness,

463
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,060
you'd have to die before Li Zhi did.

464
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,060
I'm not feeling well.

465
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,060
I can't take it anymore.

466
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,060
I've read your account book.

467
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:47,060
It's all your blood.

468
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,060
It's hard to imagine.

469
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:55,060
You have to calculate every cost of Li Zhi's trip to Chang'an.

470
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,060
This account of the cow's fur

471
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,060
has been dried up by you.

472
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:10,060
This is all your blood.

473
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,060
Let's go.

474
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,060
What are you doing?

475
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,060
You're turning me around.

476
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:19,060
You can't ride a horse like this.

477
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:27,060
Even if I fail,

478
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,060
I want to know

479
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:35,060
how far I'm going to the center of the station.

480
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,060
Be careful.

481
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,060
Be careful.

482
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,060
Come on.

483
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,060
Be careful.

484
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,060
I'm sorry.

485
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,060
I'm sorry.

486
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,060
Come on.

487
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,060
I'm sorry.

488
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,060
Mr. Li.

489
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,060
Why are you still looking at me?

490
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,060
It's okay.

491
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,060
It's okay.

492
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,060
Mr. Li.

493
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,060
I'm sorry.

494
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,060
I didn't make it to Chang'an.

495
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:34,060
I just got through the bullet train on the 11th.

496
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,060
You did your best.

497
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,060
What a pity.

498
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:49,060
I didn't see Li Zhi's last line.

499
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,060
Mr. Li.

500
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,060
Mr. Li.

501
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,060
Mr. Li.

502
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,060
Mr. Li.

503
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,060
Let me see.

504
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,060
Mr. Li.

505
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,060
I'm your sister.

506
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,060
I've been here for a long time.

507
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,060
How is it?

508
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,060
How is it?

509
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,060
It's sweet.

510
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:46,060
This is the world.

511
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:49,060
If I get lucky, I'll succeed.

512
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:57,060
Mr. Li.

513
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,060
I've completed my mission.

514
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,060
I should go home.

515
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:03,060
If you need anything,

516
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,060
just call me.

517
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,060
No matter what,

518
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,060
I'll go there.

519
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,060
Mr. Yan.

520
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:19,060
The world is not like the world.

521
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,060
We have no future.

522
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:24,060
We have to fight together.

523
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,060
Take care, Mr. Yan.

524
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,060
Take care, Mr. Li.

525
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,060
Mr. Li.

526
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,060
Mr. Li.

527
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,060
You're awake.

528
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,060
Where are you?

529
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,060
Outside of the city.

530
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,060
I'm in the city.

531
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:21,060
Brother.

532
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,060
Where are your friends?

533
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:26,060
They went to the mountain to pick herbs.

534
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:30,060
They went to the mountain to pick herbs.

535
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,060
Chief.

536
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:50,060
Thank you for saving my life.

537
00:32:56,060 --> 00:33:00,060
How much is it for you?

538
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,060
Chang'an.

539
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:11,060
I'm sorry.

540
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,060
You're leaving so soon.

541
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,060
Are you going to Chang'an?

542
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:22,060
What are you doing in Chang'an?

543
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,060
I came from the south.

544
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:28,060
I was ordered to send Li Zhi to Chang'an.

545
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:32,060
You're going to send Li Zhi to Chang'an?

546
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,060
You're a good person.

547
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,060
Don't be afraid.

548
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:43,060
Don't let these things come to me.

549
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,060
I'll take care of them.

550
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:48,060
Don't let these things come to me.

551
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,060
I'll take care of them.

552
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,060
The way it is about you.

553
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,060
You're a good person.

554
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:58,060
You're a good person.

555
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:04,060
So you're trapped by these things.

556
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,060
I'm trapped.

557
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:14,060
It's a secret in the play.

558
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,060
It's too much.

559
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,060
It's hard to imagine.

560
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,060
For the past few months,

561
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,060
I've been like a dustbin,

562
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,060
ashes, and a group of dust.

563
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,060
I've been like a dustbin, ashes, and a group of dust.

564
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:31,060
I've been like a dustbin, ashes, and a group of dust.

565
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:34,060
I really don't want to cut my head.

566
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,060
I want to cut my head.

567
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,060
I want to cut my head.

568
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,060
I want to cut my head.

569
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,060
I want to cut my head.

570
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,060
I want to cut my head.

571
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,060
I want to cut my head.

572
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,060
The world is like this.

573
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:54,060
This is the whole world.

574
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:58,060
If I can't make it, the whole family will be in trouble.

575
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:04,060
You've made a family out of your life, but you've been away from your family.

576
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,060
You've suffered a lot.

577
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,060
Isn't that what I've done?

578
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,060
I have no other way.

579
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,060
I'm sorry.

580
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:20,060
As long as we can keep the whole family safe, we don't have to give up.

581
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:26,060
Why don't you keep your ideas and practice with me?

582
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,060
What do you suggest?

583
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:35,060
My way of playing is to be able to play with hair and wash it, and to be able to relax.

584
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:41,060
You've been practicing with me for years, and you can be natural and pure.

585
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:48,060
When you reach the top, you can be free from the world and be free from the world.

586
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:54,060
I've escaped. What about my family?

587
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:59,060
It's not a family place. You can come and practice with me.

588
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:07,060
Now, Chang'an is a peaceful and peaceful city.

589
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:13,060
But the people in it are so sad.

590
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:17,060
Full on hunger and sick 관심, fewated songs,

591
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:21,060
꒤ibased chauffeur from the Senmass world,

592
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,060
trademark from Sonicized THERE,

593
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,060
anti-應ides unions,

594
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:39,060
and the incantativ pressure on villagers

595
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,060
I was so confused and confused.

596
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,060
I was so confused and confused.

597
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:45,060
You are too deep now.

598
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,060
You are not a master of the night.

599
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,060
You are a master of the night.

600
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,060
You are not a master of the night.

601
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,060
You are not a master of the night.

602
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:57,060
Why do you say that?

603
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,060
It's been 22 years.

604
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,060
Jiang Huai,

605
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,060
He Nan's transfer history,

606
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:15,060
he was appointed to the port.

607
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:19,060
He studied the number of transfer.

608
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,060
Three years ago,

609
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,060
the shipping cost was 7 million yuan.

610
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:26,060
The shipping cost was 300,000 yuan.

611
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,060
In a short time,

612
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,060
Chang'an was full of rice and grain.

613
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:33,060
The emperor didn't have to live in the east.

614
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,060
I was also caught by the subordinate,

615
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,060
and I was involved in the calculation.

616
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,060
I saw the master of the night,

617
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:53,920
and the

618
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,920
military force.

619
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,920
I was so confused.

620
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,920
I was so confused.

621
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,920
I was so confused.

622
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,920
I was so confused.

623
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,920
I was so confused.

624
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,920
After the news,

625
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,920
you are just a little naive.

626
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,920
You have to be careful.

627
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,920
You are not a bad person.

628
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,920
You are a bad person.

629
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,920
You should know

630
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,920
your ability to limit the time.

631
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,920
You should be a good person.

632
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,920
Live a good life.

633
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,920
Live a good life.

634
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,920
Live a good life.

635
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,920
Live a good life.

636
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,920
Live a good life.

637
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,920
Live a good life.

638
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,920
Our people

639
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,920
live a good life.

640
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,920
Is this also the wrong business?

641
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,920
Chang'an is a deep-sea.

642
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,920
The official site is a project of deep-sea.

643
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,920
People are in a hurry.

644
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,920
They are not in a hurry.

645
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,920
You don't want to go to Chang'an early.

646
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,920
Do you want to be in the deep-sea

647
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,920
and suffer from any trouble?

648
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,920
Do you think

649
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,920
you are in Chang'an

650
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,920
after all this?

651
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,920
I have a bad feeling.

652
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,920
I have been in love with a lot of British people.

653
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,920
I have never been in love with a British person.

654
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,920
So I have to be careful.

655
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,920
I have to be careful.

656
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,920
All right.

657
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,920
You don't have to Iron Dress anymore.

658
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,920
I have to work out what I want now.

659
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,920
Sir, you lost your mind because of this.

660
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,660
I...

661
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,740
It's good...

662
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,380
that somehow do exist for ten years...

663
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:06,260
to gainكونwegoing supposed to die.

664
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,940
Just listen to that once...

665
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,940
Laws of the Moon...

666
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,700
are died the boontime...

667
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,840
for the actions of the people they seek...

668
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:18,600
there will probably be a...

669
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:22,800
every hope that

670
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,240
they'll have...

671
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,640
happening all over the world.

672
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,660
Why are you come to interview me?

673
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,360
No one's coming here.

674
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:41,860
It's so sad that I'm here.

675
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,840
And I'm not there to perform my mission.

676
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,560
The emperor forces me to leave obras.

677
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,560
I just want to make a dream come true.

678
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
The first bullet of the month is June 1st.

679
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
That is to say,

680
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
June 19th, the transfer team will have to leave Lengnan.

681
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
This is a difficult time to make.

682
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I will wait and see.

683
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,560
June 19th, the transfer team will have to leave Lengnan.

684
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,560
That is to say, the transfer team will have to leave Lengnan.

685
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,560
That is to say, the transfer team will have to leave Lengnan.

686
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,560
That is to say, the transfer team will have to leave Lengnan.

687
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,560
That is to say, the transfer team will have to leave Lengnan.

688
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,560
That is to say, the transfer team will have to leave Lengnan.

689
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,560
That is to say, the transfer team will have to leave Lengnan.

690
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,560
That is to say, the transfer team will have to leave Lengnan.

691
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,560
That is to say, the transfer team will have to leave Lengnan.

692
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,560
Move.

693
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,560
This is Chang'an.

694
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,560
We are home.

695
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:20,560
We are home.

696
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,560
We are home.

697
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,560
We are home.

698
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,560
We have made it.

699
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,560
We have to go to Chang'an to learn from the people outside.

700
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,560
Yes.

701
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,560
Where are we going?

702
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,560
To see my daughter.

703
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,560
Grandpa.

704
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,560
Smile.

705
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,560
I am a small host.

706
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,560
Why are you in trouble?

707
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,560
Where is my old bone?

708
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,560
You are the one who is spreading rumors about the transfer team.

709
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,560
You are the one who is spreading rumors about the transfer team.

710
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,560
I am the one who is spreading rumors about the transfer team.

711
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,560
I don't believe it.

712
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,560
I am not even that easy to spread rumors about the transfer team.

713
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,560
We have to make it in the same shoes.

714
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,560
If you don't make it,

715
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,560
you will be in the transfer team with a clean person.

716
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,560
You can't believe it.

717
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,560
I am spreading rumors about Yunqing.

718
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,560
Tell him the truth.

719
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,560
The truth is the truth.

720
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,560
We have to make it.

721
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,560
We have to make it.

722
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,560
We have to make it.

723
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,560
We have to make it.

724
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,560
I am a little worried.

725
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,560
I am a little worried.

726
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,560
I am a little worried.

727
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,560
I am a little worried.

728
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,560
I am a little worried.

729
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,560
I am a little worried.

730
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,560
I am a little worried.

731
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,560
I am a little worried.

732
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,560
I am a little worried.

733
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,560
I am a little worried.

734
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,560
I am a little worried.

735
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,560
I am a little worried.

736
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,560
I am a little worried.

737
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,560
I am a little worried.

738
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,560
I am a little worried.

739
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,560
I am a little worried.

740
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,560
I am a little worried.

741
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,560
I am a little worried.

742
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,560
I am a little worried.

743
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,560
I am a little worried.

744
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,560
I am a little worried.

745
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,560
I am a little worried.

746
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,560
I am a little worried.

747
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,560
I am a little worried.

748
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,560
I am a little worried.

749
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,560
I am a little worried.

750
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,560
I am a little worried.

751
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,560
I am a little worried.

752
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,560
I am a little worried.

753
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,560
I am a little worried.

754
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,560
