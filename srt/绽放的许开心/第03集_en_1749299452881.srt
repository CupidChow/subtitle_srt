1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I see your pants as your bray-ray too

2
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Something sweet cannot just depraise

3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And there's no time to guess the ground up us

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Greater daylight, go to the free

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let's cross the wind, dancing ring, let it start singing through my night away

6
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This a fierce happiness, they are all bought off for Johnny

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Woo-hoo

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The End

9
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's not like that

10
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Our whole family is watching you

11
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You're going out on a date by yourself

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm not going to call you

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Oh, my stomach hurts

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Dad, my stomach hurts

15
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You're not going to hurt enough, just a little more

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Dad, my stomach hurts

17
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That's it

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
How about you?

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Mom, I don't know how I'm doing

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
That's right, that's right

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Who do you want to be good at?

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Next week, I'll take you to the wild zoo

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Mom

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Miss Xu, I'm the one who introduced myself to the school

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Come, please smile

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Come, come and smile

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I have to take a picture

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You are the best choice in my blind date

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I have to keep a memory

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Mom, that's good

31
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So, are we...

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Let's introduce ourselves first

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
This wine is so good

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I told you, I saw the average of the restaurant on the Internet

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's about 3.6

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
No wonder people say

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
This is the best wine in the restaurant

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You have to try it

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
No, no, Miss Xu

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Let's talk about the positive side

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
But also about the deep-sea

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Deeper

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Is that what I understand?

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Is it that straightforward to lie to women?

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What is this woman looking at?

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Why are you still not talking?

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm afraid she's not a fool

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Miss Xu

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Deep-sea, right?

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Come, deep-sea, deep-sea

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Okay, let's have a little time

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'll ask you directly

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Why did you break your marriage before?

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You're a ghost

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What about you?

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
My wife passed away three years ago

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We two are college students

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Our relationship has always been very good

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
My sensitivity to feelings is very high

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
If I want to get married again, I also hope it's because of love

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
When you're out, you bring a box of emotional products

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What kind of face do you talk about love?

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What about Miss Xu?

64
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What is your demand for the other half?

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
My demand is simple

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm looking for a good family partner

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
A partner?

68
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I see a family is not a partner

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
A family is a place of harm

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The prince who loves to love

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Cheating a silly girl as a mother

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's really dark in the world

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Look, love is the most unambitious

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Say love, say love, say love, say love, say love, say love

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I don't want to be separated from the right-wing

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Then I'll waste the courage to face life and marriage

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So I think marriage should be a good partner with a good spirit

78
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So we can eat together, drink together

79
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And go to the police station together to work

80
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Wait a minute

81
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You're looking for a partner now, not a husband

82
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Look, you don't understand this

83
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The couple in the world

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The relationship of marriage is more than seven years

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
More than 70% are brothers

86
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So if you are a friend

87
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
But also a journey

88
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The relationship between the couple

89
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
What kind of man and woman are you?

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I want to say

91
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Of course, for those who have a contract with the spirit

92
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
No matter what kind of man and woman he is

93
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
His best friend can only have one

94
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
His wife or husband

95
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Come on, take it

96
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Your phone is ringing

97
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Sorry, I'll answer the phone

98
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Hello

99
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
He's gone to his dad

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
He's almost there

101
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
He called me and said

102
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What's the problem?

103
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Can you stop this?

104
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
The more you stop him

105
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
He takes out the back force of the whole world

106
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I tell you

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The person who should be said is the one who should be called

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The one who should be called

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Okay, don't care

110
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Okay

111
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Miss Ju

112
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I have a question

113
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What you said is the child and his father

114
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yes

115
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Well, in your opinion

116
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I shouldn't go to this family

117
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
We are all single families

118
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Especially raising children

119
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
That's very important

120
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I think

121
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You shouldn't talk to the child

122
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
About bad things

123
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
If you say so

124
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The child's heart

125
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Mr. Mei

126
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Please admit the diversity of business

127
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Of course, what's wrong?

128
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Not all parents in the world love their children

129
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You use kind lies to deceive them

130
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Let them get bigger and bigger

131
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Anyway

132
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm like my child

133
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
In the process of growing up

134
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Take it slowly and take it slowly

135
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So that they can face the courage of real life

136
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I said that

137
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Well, answer the phone

138
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Hello, dad

139
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Hello

140
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Hello, Teng Ya

141
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm so sorry

142
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Come back soon

143
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
That Yu An

144
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
No, Yu Le

145
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
They both have the same stomachache

146
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Don't know why

147
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Grandpa, can I go to the zoo?

148
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

149
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's okay

150
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Well, okay

151
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'll be right back

152
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Okay

153
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Brother-in-law

154
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
My dad knows you are dating today

155
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yu An said that the stomachache of Yu Le is to deceive you

156
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Don't be serious

157
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Stay away from him

158
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
This old man

159
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
This old man

160
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Jun Jun

161
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
My child suddenly doesn't feel well

162
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'll go first

163
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Okay, no problem

164
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Well, since it's A

165
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Can I pack this part for myself?

166
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Of course

167
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Help me pack

168
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Okay, Mr. Lei

169
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Mr. Lei

170
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,420
No thing to do

171
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,080
My thoughts are all around

172
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,240
With Gruña, I think

173
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,640
life would change

174
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,600
Now maintenance

175
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,240
Luckily, our affection I'm making

176
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,540
Our apartment is safe

177
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,740
So we can handleua

178
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,460
Interesting

179
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,120
I knew I would have to

180
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,580
You take it

181
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,580
When you give me a push,

182
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,580
you need to take a round to get a blood sample.

183
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,580
Don't waste your time and money.

184
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,580
And most importantly,

185
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,580
I don't like girls who are so bad at heart.

186
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,580
And the reality is so rough.

187
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,580
I hope my other half

188
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,580
is understanding, loving, gentle.

189
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,580
She is very kind.

190
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,580
She is not going to

191
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,580
disrupt the relationship between a child and a father.

192
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,580
For anyone,

193
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,580
they are all peaceful and peaceful.

194
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,580
They are all tolerant.

195
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,580
No matter what you say,

196
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,580
if you recommend me a female next time,

197
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,580
well,

198
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,580
you can just

199
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,580
push me in the opposite direction

200
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,580
according to the female.

201
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,580
And I've already deleted it.

202
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,580
I don't want to waste my time and life.

203
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,580
I really don't know how to find her.

204
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,580
I just don't like her.

205
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,580
I don't care.

206
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,580
I just don't like her.

207
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,580
Grandma,

208
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,580
you are so good.

209
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,580
So I believe

210
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,580
you

211
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,580
are a guy man Do you think

212
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,580
you will make her real?

213
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,580
And left her woman

214
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,580
on her grandpa's hand

215
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,320
You tryin

216
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,080
against me but made a sacrifice.

217
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,080
When sending you in person,

218
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,080
haven't you seen

219
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,580
how eagerly the woman was?

220
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,580
Look at your face.

221
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,580
This is serious.

222
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,580
Fuck your face.

223
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,580
They can't do that.

224
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,580
I'm going to the beach.

225
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,580
I'm going to the beach.

226
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,580
I'm going to the beach.

227
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,580
I'm going to the beach.

228
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,580
I'm going to the beach.

229
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,580
I'm going to the beach.

230
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,580
I'm going to the beach.

231
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,580
I'm going to the beach.

232
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,580
I'm going to the beach.

233
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,580
I'm going to the beach.

234
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,580
I'm going to the beach.

235
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,580
I'm going to the beach.

236
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,580
I'm going to the beach.

237
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,580
I'm going to the beach.

238
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,580
I'm going to the beach.

239
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,580
I'm going to the beach.

240
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,580
I'm going to the beach.

241
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,580
Hello, Xu Kai Xin.

242
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,580
I'm so angry.

243
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,580
I'll see you in 20 minutes.

244
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,580
What's this?

245
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,580
What's this?

246
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,580
It's a water bottle.

247
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,580
Qian Hao.

248
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,580
What's this?

249
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,580
Qian Hao.

250
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,580
Qian Hao.

251
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,580
Come here.

252
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,580
Come here.

253
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,580
Come here.

254
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,580
Honey.

255
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,580
Look at my hand.

256
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,580
It's not fake. I made it.

257
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,580
I'm so happy.

258
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,580
This is...

259
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,580
But my wife's hand is beautiful.

260
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,580
Everything is a decoration.

261
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,580
Forget it.

262
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,580
Look at your mom and your mom laughing.

263
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,580
I'm like a maid.

264
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,580
I'm cooking by myself.

265
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,580
Isn't this a chance for you to show off?

266
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,580
Let my mom be nice to you.

267
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,580
Why do you want to be nice to me?

268
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,580
Did you tell your mom that you're laughing at me?

269
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,580
You told your mom that you're laughing at me.

270
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,580
Yes.

271
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,580
When you went to my uncle's house,

272
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,580
they were cooking together.

273
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,580
We were lying down and watching TV.

274
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,580
Yes. I should be laughing at your mom.

275
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,580
I should be laughing at her.

276
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,580
I'm going to take off my clothes.

277
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,580
What are you doing?

278
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,580
Is it the same thing as uncle's?

279
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,580
What do you want?

280
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,580
Mom,

281
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,580
I'm going to take off my clothes.

282
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,580
Ok.

283
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,580
Ok.

284
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,580
You're so cute.

285
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:34,580
How could you say that to me

286
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,580
when you're abroad?

287
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,580
You want to take your uncle's place, right?

288
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,580
No.

289
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,580
Dad.

290
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,080
What?

291
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,580
Nothing.

292
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,080
I fell down.

293
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,080
Fall down?

294
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,080
What?

295
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,080
Fall down?

296
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,080
You fell out of the East and South North?

297
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,080
I don't know why I did something bad to you.

298
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,080
I was hit by someone by the grass.

299
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,080
Don't listen to me like that.

300
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,080
To be honest,

301
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,080
that girl is just a pure partner.

302
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,580
She's the one who forced me to do it.

303
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,580
I'm wronged.

304
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,080
What wronged?

305
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,080
She forced you to do it.

306
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,580
You're so young.

307
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,580
Why did you do it?

308
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,580
You didn't smile when you were young.

309
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,580
You didn't feel well when you were out.

310
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,580
When you were a doctor,

311
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,580
you were so young.

312
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,580
Now, you're going to find a partner.

313
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,580
You deserve it.

314
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,580
You deserve it even if you beat you to death.

315
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,080
Dad, you're wrong.

316
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,580
Are you bullying me like that?

317
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,580
I'll send you to the hospital.

318
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,580
I don't care about you.

319
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:36,080
I'm just a social activist who likes to participate in social activities.

320
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,580
What's wrong with me?

321
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,580
What's wrong with me?

322
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,580
Son,

323
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,080
don't you understand me?

324
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,080
Don't you understand me?

325
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,580
You've been here for years.

326
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,080
We're not divorced, right?

327
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,080
No, no, no.

328
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,580
Don't say that.

329
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,580
Don't drag my son in.

330
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,080
My son has nothing to do with you.

331
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,580
He's handsome.

332
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,080
That girl is a fool.

333
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,580
She has no choice.

334
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,080
Right?

335
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,080
You're so young.

336
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,080
You're still out there.

337
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,080
Why are you looking for a partner?

338
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,080
You're so beautiful.

339
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,080
I'm telling you the truth.

340
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,580
You can't blame me.

341
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,580
I have no choice.

342
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,080
This is a high-end star.

343
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,580
I'm not talking about it.

344
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,080
I'm not talking about...

345
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,080
I'm not talking about going to the city.

346
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,580
Don't worry.

347
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,580
I'll be there next week.

348
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,080
Don't you trust me?

349
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,080
Okay, I'll ask you for a favor.

350
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,580
Okay?

351
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,580
Don't worry.

352
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,580
I'm sure you'll trust me.

353
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,080
Okay?

354
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,580
Okay.

355
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,080
Bye.

356
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,580
Don't be angry.

357
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,080
I promise.

358
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,580
You're a good husband.

359
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,080
My dad has been out of town.

360
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,080
He's gone.

361
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,080
Let me ask you.

362
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,080
Did your dad tell the truth?

363
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,080
Which one?

364
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,080
He said he was out of town

365
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,080
because of your ex-boyfriend's DNA.

366
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,080
So he abandoned Xu Kai Xin and I.

367
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,080
If you ever meet another woman,

368
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,080
will you abandon me?

369
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,080
Nonsense.

370
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,080
I'm telling you.

371
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,080
I'm with you

372
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,080
because I'm familiar with emotions.

373
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,080
I only know the truth

374
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,080
when I get married.

375
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,080
I'll forgive Xu Kai Xin,

376
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,080
but I'll never forgive you.

377
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,080
I swear.

378
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,080
Say it again.

379
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,080
I swear to heaven.

380
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,080
Really?

381
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,080
Yes.

382
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,080
Trust me.

383
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,080
I won't say it.

384
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,080
I'll be fine.

385
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,080
You're beautiful.

386
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,080
I'll forgive you.

387
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,080
I'll be really far away

388
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,080
tonight.

389
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,080
Husband?

390
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,080
I swear.

391
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,080
Dad.

392
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,080
You're here.

393
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,080
Sorry.

394
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,080
Long time no see, Nanny.

395
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,080
Come in.

396
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,080
Come in.

397
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,080
I'm here today.

398
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,080
You didn't answer my call.

399
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,080
I called dad.

400
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,080
You didn't answer.

401
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,080
I didn't answer the phone.

402
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,080
Does your mom know you're here?

403
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,080
Yes.

404
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,080
She said she wanted me to stay here

405
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,080
for a long time.

406
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,080
Can I, dad?

407
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,080
No problem.

408
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,080
You can come if you want.

409
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,080
Yes.

410
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,080
Come with me.

411
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,080
Dad, this is not the room I used to live in.

412
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,080
Yes.

413
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,080
Look.

414
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,080
The memory is good.

415
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,080
There's still a house in the neighborhood.

416
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,080
It's a house for a cook.

417
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,080
But now,

418
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,080
this place is called the aunt's cat house.

419
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,080
Dad doesn't know

420
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,080
if you can come.

421
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,080
In a few days,

422
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,080
you'll be here

423
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,080
to change your room.

424
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,080
Okay.

425
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,080
Let's

426
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,080
take a look

427
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,080
at the sofa tonight.

428
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,080
Okay?

429
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,080
Good boy.

430
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,080
Dad,

431
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,080
can you stay with me today?

432
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,080
No problem.

433
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,080
Dad, this is the best.

434
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,080
Welcome.

435
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,080
Here it is.

436
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,080
You can't do this with me.

437
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,080
What happened?

438
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,080
MyChoice.

439
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,880
Yes.

440
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:55,800
I'm not afraid of it.

441
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,080
I'll buy you two more tickets.

442
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,440
I'll buy you a new one.

443
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,400
Come on, Happy.

444
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,280
Happy.

445
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,680
I miss you so much.

446
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,920
Let's kiss.

447
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,480
Let's kiss.

448
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,080
It hurts.

449
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,880
Let's talk.

450
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,440
What are you talking about?

451
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,880
Happy.

452
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,720
Do you know I love you so much?

453
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,920
I love you so much.

454
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,880
Happy.

455
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,280
No one can bully you.

456
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,280
You're so good.

457
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,680
We won't find a good man.

458
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,280
We don't want him.

459
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,080
I'm not happy.

460
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,320
I'm just kidding.

461
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,480
We've been together for a lifetime.

462
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,080
We've been good to you.

463
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,840
Okay, okay.

464
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,840
I'll tell you.

465
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,440
I'll give him 3600 yuan.

466
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,840
Give it back to him.

467
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,440
Am I good?

468
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,240
Really?

469
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,480
Good.

470
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,080
Good.

471
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,840
Can you give me the 600 yuan?

472
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,800
Okay.

473
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,600
Okay.

474
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,600
Okay.

475
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,600
500 yuan.

476
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,600
Okay.

477
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,600
Okay.

478
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,200
Okay.

479
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,400
You're a bad guy.

480
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,600
You're so bad.

481
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,200
How dare you make us happy?

482
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,200
You're so mad.

483
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,800
I'm sure you're not going to open it.

484
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,200
It's under the control of the police.

485
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,400
You're so mean.

486
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,400
I won't fight with you.

487
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,800
Why are you so mean?

488
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,360
It's not what you think, okay?

489
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,460
So did you both go out that night?

490
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,400
Your gates,

491
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,320
I'll tell you tomorrow.

492
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,320
I'm holding you.

493
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,120
My chance to enter is so high.

494
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,920
How could you take that money?

495
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,920
I may be happy,

496
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:11,580
but I risk my life

497
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:16,580
Please enjoy!

498
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:38,580
A, B, C, C, D, O, E, I, N, G, N, A, N, A, I, N, G, N, A, I, N, A, N, A, I, N, A, I, N, G, N, A, N, G, N, A, N, A...

499
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,380
Hello?

500
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,700
Last time, the number you've dialed is stacked.

501
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,700
Here you go.

502
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,220
Paid for study!

503
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,260
He should be gone,

504
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,420
sauce cents are cut and finished.

505
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,220
Get out of here!

506
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:04,780
Hello?

507
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,700
Is there anything you wanna help out?

508
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,500
You You.

509
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,260
While longue,

510
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:13,460
You give Yu-an and Yu-le a lot of foreign language.

511
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:17,260
I'll give you the ABC I told your mom.

512
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:21,260
Whatever you say, it has a London-style taste.

513
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,260
You're better. You do it.

514
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,260
Do I need to work overtime now?

515
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,260
It's time for work.

516
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:29,260
If you need to work overtime, you have to pay for it.

517
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:32,260
Stop talking nonsense. Get out of here.

518
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:35,260
Your dad spent so much money on you.

519
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:38,260
He just wants you to come back to my house and play games.

520
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,260
You have to earn money from me for some big business.

521
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,260
You're a big deal.

522
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:45,260
I'm telling you, I'll pay for your sister.

523
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,260
I'll pay for your sister.

524
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,260
I'll pay for his dad's mother.

525
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,260
I'm fine. I'll go get some water.

526
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,260
Go.

527
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,260
Go, go.

528
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,260
Hey!

529
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,260
You raised such a girl?

530
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,260
She's always been a wretch.

531
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,260
If she hadn't sent her kid,

532
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:30,260
she wouldn't have known how to lock herself in the house.

533
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,260
She spent so much money on that useless thing.

534
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,260
She owed her life.

535
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:38,260
No wonder you couldn't see her.

536
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,260
But she could be like her sister.

537
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,260
Enough!

538
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,260
Don't talk to your kid like that.

539
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:47,260
You don't know how bad it is to have a child.

540
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,260
We don't need money.

541
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,260
Just stay here.

542
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,260
Live well and do your best.

543
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,260
I'm sorry.

544
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,260
I'm sorry.

545
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,260
I'm sorry.

546
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,260
I'm sorry.

547
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,260
I'm sorry.

548
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,260
I'm sorry.

549
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,260
I'm sorry.

550
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,260
Why didn't you pick up the video?

551
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,260
I was going to sleep.

552
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,260
You couldn't see me in the dark.

553
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,260
It's all good.

554
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:01,260
I just wish my dad would come over and help me sleep.

555
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,260
Mom, don't worry.

556
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,260
I won't fall asleep on weekends.

557
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,260
I won't be late for the English supplementary class.

558
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:10,260
I cancelled the English supplementary class.

559
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,260
What?

560
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:14,260
And all the interest courses you took.

561
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,260
What do you mean?

562
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,260
You said you'd stop the supplementary class?

563
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:22,260
Didn't you tell your dad that you had too much to do with Lily?

564
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,260
And you wanted to go to the class.

565
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,260
From now on, you don't need to go to the class.

566
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,260
Lily and I won't bother you anymore.

567
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,260
Just do what you want to do.

568
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:35,260
Why do you still have to be so stubborn with me?

569
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,260
Who is still a child?

570
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,260
I'm still Lily's little baby.

571
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,260
Okay, I'll tell you.

572
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,260
Go to bed early. Good night.

573
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,260
Dad.

574
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,260
Dad.

575
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,260
Dad.

576
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,260
Okay, I'll go out.

577
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,260
I'm really going.

578
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,260
Listen to me.

579
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,260
Take care of the baby.

580
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,260
As long as you take the supplementary class,

581
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,260
my mom will definitely not be in danger.

582
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,260
You can still be a mother.

583
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,260
You still have a bad heart.

584
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,260
You're still our little princess.

585
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,260
Okay, I'll go.

586
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,260
Good night.

587
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,260
Uncle, don't worry.

588
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,260
I'll treat them well.

589
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,260
Dad.

590
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,260
Dad, I'm going to bed.

591
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,260
Have a good rest.

592
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,260
Okay, bye.

593
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,260
Bye.

594
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,260
Bye.

595
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,260
Bye, baby.

596
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,260
Good night.

597
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,260
Chen Yi.

598
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,260
Since you've talked about your girlfriend,

599
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,260
let's have a look at her.

600
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,260
No matter how much she says,

601
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:59,260
she will be a good mother to Yu An and Yu Le.

602
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,260
We have to turn off the game for her.

603
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,260
You're right.

604
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,260
Yes, you're right.

605
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,260
Don't worry.

606
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,260
As long as you can't pass the second floor,

607
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,260
I'll be fine.

608
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,260
Okay, I'm going.

609
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,260
Okay, bye.

610
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,260
Okay, bye.

611
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,260
Bye.

612
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,260
Dad.

613
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,260
You're so pretty.

614
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,260
I'm the one who's been with you.

615
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,260
Dad, you've worked hard.

616
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,260
I'm so tired.

617
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,260
I'll take a picture of you and you'll go to bed.

618
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,260
An Mi.

619
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:22,260
You should stay here for a while.

620
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,260
I'll tell aunt Xiao Qiao.

621
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:27,260
You should stay with me every day.

622
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,260
Okay, I like dad the most.

623
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,260
Okay, I like dad the most.

624
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,260
I want to stay with An Mi, too.

625
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:46,260
This is the quietest time in the day.

626
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,260
I'm so tired.

627
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,260
I'm so tired.

628
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,260
I'm so tired.

629
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,260
I'm tired.

630
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,260
Pretty girl, are you going out?

631
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:33,260
How about finding a 30-year-old little sister?

632
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:36,260
My house is very big. My wife is not at home.

633
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:08,260
Who is still young?

634
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:13,260
That memory is full.

635
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:18,260
Who is still a little fool?

636
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:23,260
Love is also painful.

637
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:30,260
The time to take away is not just ten thousand songs.

638
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:40,260
There is still that young man who is not at home.

639
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,260
Xiaoxiao, good morning.

640
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,260
Xiaomi, good morning.

641
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,260
Good morning.

642
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,260
Xiaoxiao, you are up.

643
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,260
Sleep more.

644
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:04,260
Lili, why am I at your house?

645
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,260
I am happy that you were drunk yesterday.

646
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,260
I will send you back alone.

647
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,260
She is not worried.

648
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,260
I love you.

649
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,260
I am happy.

650
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,260
She woke up at 4 o'clock.

651
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,260
Look, she is preparing these cakes.

652
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,260
There are so many orders on weekends.

653
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,260
So many.

654
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:29,260
Xu Laiqing, you don't have to put on makeup.

655
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,260
I will definitely do it.

656
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:34,260
I should do it like a big monster.

657
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,260
I tell you, you have my dream.

658
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,260
I will eat your tiger tail.

659
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,260
I will do it.

660
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,260
I will do it.

661
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,260
Sister, I will treat you to the most beautiful food today.

662
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,260
I treat you.

663
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,260
Today is the day of the chicken.

664
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,260
It is the golden time I took money.

665
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,260
Don't play with me.

666
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:53,260
Go and relax.

667
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,260
You should make the cake you should make this morning.

668
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:58,260
I will take Xiaomin to the restaurant on Friday.

669
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,260
Yes, go.

670
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,260
Go.

671
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,260
Go.

672
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,260
Go.

673
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,260
Don't pretend to be a girl.

674
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,260
You are like a duck.

675
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,260
I told you, you had more than 200 customers last night.

676
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,260
I will make all the cakes today.

677
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,260
I will kill you.

678
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,260
No problem.

679
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,260
Dami, look.

680
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:22,260
I prepared a delicious breakfast for you.

681
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,260
What do you like to eat?

682
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,260
Buns, noodles, pancakes.

683
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,260
You have fried buns and pancakes.

684
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,260
Aunt Jiaojiao, you are so good.

685
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,260
My mom cooked for me at home.

686
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,260
You are so rich.

687
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,260
Look at you.

688
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,260
Aunt Jiaojiao is so good to you.

689
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,260
Thank you, aunt.

690
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,260
Eat.

691
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,260
Eat.

692
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,260
Buns.

693
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:46,260
Dad, my mom gave me a lot of money.

694
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,260
She said she would never give me money.

695
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,260
Why?

696
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,260
She is sick.

697
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,260
It's okay.

698
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,260
Your mom doesn't give me money.

699
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,260
I will give it to her.

700
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,260
Dad, I love dad the most.

701
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,260
How much?

702
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,260
A year of English class, 15,000 yuan.

703
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,260
A year of math, 12,000 yuan.

704
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,260
A year of dance class, 8,800 yuan.

705
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,260
A year of dance class, 13,000 yuan.

706
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,260
By the way,

707
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,260
the piano class is in the same class as the record class.

708
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:12,260
If I can't teach today, I will have to stop class.

709
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,260
How much is the total?

710
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,260
55,600 yuan.

711
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,260
Isn't it a little expensive?

712
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,260
My mom always gave me a lot of money.

713
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,260
She didn't give me money.

714
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,260
Dad thinks it's not expensive.

715
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,260
It's just a lot of money for a class.

716
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,260
Right?

717
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,260
No matter how poor you are,

718
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,260
no matter how hard you try,

719
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,260
I will give you a card.

720
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,260
You can charge 60,000 yuan.

721
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,260
Okay?

722
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,260
After you give all the money to the outside class,

723
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,260
you can buy the rest of the money yourself.

724
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,260
Okay?

725
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,260
Okay.

726
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,260
Thank you, dad.

727
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,260
Okay, okay.

728
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,260
Eat.

729
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,260
My stomach is a little uncomfortable.

730
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,260
Da Ming, eat well.

731
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,260
Go to bed early.

732
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,260
I'll go to bed.

733
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:08,260
Is dad and aunt Xiaozhou unhappy?

734
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,260
No.

735
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,260
He is not feeling well.

736
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,260
He is just having a stomach ache.

737
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,260
Okay.

738
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,260
After you finish eating,

739
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,260
you can change your clothes.

740
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,260
Today, I will go to your house.

741
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,260
Okay.

742
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,260
Thank you, dad.

743
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,260
Eat.

744
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,260
Let me see aunt Xiaozhou.

745
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,260
How is she?

746
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,260
He Xiaozhou,

747
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,260
we have agreed to stay with the kids today.

748
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,260
Why are you so angry?

749
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:43,260
You are so angry that you are not done yet, right?

750
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,260
I will force you to do it someday.

751
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,260
You don't even have the money to pay the rent.

752
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,260
60,000 yuan.

753
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,260
Did you discuss it with me?

754
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,260
You just give it to me.

755
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:52,260
You bought a little grandma for me.

756
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,260
Yes, but didn't you also hear that?

757
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,260
Xu Kaiqing has been paying the rent for many years.

758
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,260
We haven't paid the rent for the payment.

759
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,260
60,000 yuan is not much.

760
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,260
I didn't pay the rent.

761
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,260
That's also expensive.

762
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,260
Hu Yaojiao,

763
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,260
when we were together,

764
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,260
did you say that you didn't want to be a stepmother

765
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,260
and that I didn't want a child?

766
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,260
I will leave with you.

767
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,260
Who knows who you are now.

768
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,260
My mother is sick now.

769
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,260
She is very sick.

770
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,260
Her only wish is to have a grandson.

771
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,260
I am a good person.

772
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,260
Although I am not a good person,

773
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,260
I am definitely my mother's good son.

774
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,260
I have to help her fulfill this wish.

775
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,260
I am now too late to enter the capital.

776
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,260
I have never seen Xiao Mi's face.

777
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:37,260
So I have to get along with the big family today.

778
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,260
Get along well with the kids.

779
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,260
Come and fight for the child.

780
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,260
If you can cooperate with us,

781
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,260
you can't cooperate with them.

782
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,260
They are going to divorce.

783
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:47,260
I am telling you, although I love you very much,

784
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:52,260
I will never stop you from pursuing your happiness.

785
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,260
I can leave Shang Tung to myself.

786
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,260
Honey,

787
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,260
don't leave me.

788
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,260
I don't want to divorce.

789
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,260
I will give you the money you want.

790
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,260
I don't want to divorce you.

791
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,260
Don't leave me.

792
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,260
I don't want to divorce you.

793
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,260
I don't want to divorce you.

794
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,260
I don't want to divorce you.

795
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,260
Okay, okay.

796
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,260
Okay, I will divorce you.

797
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,260
Go change your clothes.

798
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,260
I will take you out to buy clothes.

799
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,260
Okay?

800
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:34,260
I will.

801
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,260
Bye.

802
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,260
Stay away from us.

803
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,260
Don't come to me.

804
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:22,260
Please don't come.

805
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,240
conversation is over.

806
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:27,260
Meanwhile,

807
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:29,260
a little Ver and a little Bro

808
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,240
are getting married.

809
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,240
Please don't come to them.

810
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,260
Hello,

811
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,260
How is your hands.

812
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,320
lots of money

813
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,020
I thought it was going to be going enough

814
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,020
Li Li, you look so pretty.

815
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:14,020
This is not bad.

816
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,020
I'm afraid you'll be tired.

817
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,020
It's not good. We're tired.

818
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,020
Mi.

819
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,020
Let's eat.

820
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:28,020
I'm so tired. I'm always in the middle of the night.

821
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,020
I'm not good at this.

822
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:32,020
I feel like I'm dead.

823
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:34,020
Xiao Mi, you can go now.

824
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,020
Let's go.

825
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:38,020
Xiao Mi, listen to Li Li.

826
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,020
I'll leave her to you.

827
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,020
Let's go.

828
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,020
Let's go.

829
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,020
Xiao Shuai, you're so pretty.

830
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,020
Let's go.

831
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,020
Let's go.

832
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,020
Don't call my son.

833
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,020
You're so...

834
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,020
I've been on the bus.

835
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,020
I'm going to find Xiao Xi.

836
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:02,020
She's not that pretty.

837
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,020
I'll buy you a ride.

838
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:08,020
Hurry up.

839
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:10,020
Come here.

840
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,020
No.

841
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,020
Xiao Mi, you're so pretty.

842
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,020
Xiao Shuai, you're so pretty.

843
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:26,020
You're so pretty.

844
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:30,020
Dad, I want to have that massage chair.

845
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,020
You're so young. Why do you want a massage chair?

846
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,020
I usually have my head down.

847
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,020
I'm so lazy.

848
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,020
I have to get my school bag.

849
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,020
My mom gave me all these.

850
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:44,020
I don't want to have them.

851
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:46,020
I can afford to buy a few hundred dollars.

852
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,020
I can afford to buy them.

853
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,020
Thank you, Auntie Jia Jia.

854
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:52,020
Okay.

855
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,020
I'll go get the bill.

856
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,020
Thank you, Auntie Jia Jia.

857
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:58,020
My friend, it's been a long time.

858
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:00,020
What are you doing?

859
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,020
Auntie Jia Jia, you can't be so mean.

860
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,020
Qian Dami, do you know who she is?

861
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,020
She's my dad's wife.

862
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,020
You can't be so mean.

863
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,020
Let's go.

864
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:14,020
Let's not be angry with those who beat us up.

865
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:16,020
Qian Dami.

866
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:18,020
Qian Dami, I didn't see you being so fat.

867
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,020
I'll give you a hand.

868
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,020
Auntie Jia will buy you a ride.

869
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:28,020
Okay.

870
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:30,020
You look pretty.

871
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:32,020
Let's go.

872
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:36,020
I'm so angry.

873
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,020
I'm so angry.

874
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:40,020
You're the only one who's having a baby.

875
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,020
How can you have so many children?

876
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:44,020
I can only buy one thing.

877
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,020
I won't give Qian Dami any more.

878
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:48,020
I want to find a place to buy some goods.

879
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:50,020
I'm so angry.

880
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,020
Don't be angry.

881
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:56,020
It's all my fault.

882
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:58,020
I'm the one who didn't see you.

883
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,020
Let's have a good mood.

884
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,020
I'm so angry.

885
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:30,020
I'm so angry.

886
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,020
I'm so angry.

887
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:34,020
I'm so angry.

888
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:36,020
I'm so angry.

889
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:38,020
I'm so angry.

890
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:40,020
I'm so angry.

891
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,020
I'm so angry.

892
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,020
I'm so angry.

893
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:46,020
I'm so angry.

894
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:48,020
I'm so angry.

895
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:50,020
I'm so angry.

896
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:52,020
I'm so angry.

897
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,020
I'm so angry.

898
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:56,020
I'm so angry.

899
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:58,020
I'm so angry.

900
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,020
I'm so angry.

901
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:02,020
I'm so angry.

902
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:08,020
Let's have a good mood.

903
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,020
I can only buy where you are.

904
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:12,020
I can only buy where you are.

905
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,020
If you're willing to go,

906
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:16,020
I can only buy traditions and customs,

907
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,020
andclear up your compatible past on behalf of normal families.

908
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,020
That is all.

909
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:22,020
When you get drunk,
