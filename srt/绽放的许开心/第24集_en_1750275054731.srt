1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I see your pain as you're braying too

2
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Some things we cannot just embrace

3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And there's no time to guess the ground above

4
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Create a daylight, go to the free

5
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Let's cross the wind, dancing ring Let the stars in the moonlight wane

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Oh, there's a fierce happiness, they are all bought off a journey

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo

8
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Come, Zou replacing after her dream

9
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Lesans

10
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You are late

11
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
family

12
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Mom

13
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,800
I'm trying really hard today.

14
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,000
Where did I make you suffer?

15
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I feel like I'm okay.

16
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,300
Where did I get the oil?

17
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,200
Didn't you just hate me?

18
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,100
I'm just like this.

19
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,300
When I'm in trouble, I'll become a very bad person.

20
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,100
We're not family yet.

21
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,400
Think about it.

22
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,500
If you can't accept it,

23
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,900
we'll think about it.

24
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,700
I'll regret it.

25
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,400
No, I...

26
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,700
I was going to praise you.

27
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,200
You really did a great job today.

28
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,500
You didn't even know that I thought you were afraid of the kids.

29
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,900
You're really like this.

30
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,400
Really?

31
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,500
You were just looking at that two-faced girl.

32
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,100
You've been practicing.

33
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,600
You said you really wanted to be gentle in the future.

34
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,000
What about last time?

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,500
Today, forget it.

36
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,000
You should rest.

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,900
I have to go home to work.

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You can go any day. It's convenient.

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'll come over to help you clean up.

40
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,500
There's one more thing.

41
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,400
Forget it.

42
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,000
This thing is very important.

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,200
This is not important.

44
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,300
No.

45
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,000
What do you mean?

46
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,820
Why are you scaring me?

47
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,300
Maybe you can go back to the morning.

48
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,500
Take it easy.

49
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,900
I don't want to visit any other places.

50
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,300
Why are you cruidening on the beach?

51
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,600
I'm half seatle.

52
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,000
What shall we do now?

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,100
I'll wait.

54
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,500
We'll go back to home.

55
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,900
What should we do?

56
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,700
We'll drive.

57
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,300
Lost the way of your elegy is too glorious

58
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,500
Right

59
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,180
Car key is here

60
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,180

00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:29,380
Bye-bye

Take care

64
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,140
Okay

I saw you stand over there alone

76
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,540
I'll help you borrow money

00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,060

All the money and money are broken

86
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,280
What kind of clothes are these things

87
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,060
You don't think it's why i'm poor

88
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:18,540
I am crowded

89
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,160
I am your wife

90
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,160
You should love me, not pity me.

91
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,160
Love you two, love you two, this is a hospital.

92
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,160
Do you hear me? This is a hospital.

93
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,160
There are too many people, no bones.

94
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,160
Don't touch me.

95
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,160
You bastard.

96
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,160
You bastard.

97
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,160
You bastard.

98
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,160
You bastard.

99
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,160
Qianhao, if you want to hurt me, you have to do it.

100
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,160
Don't give up on me every time.

101
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,160
You'll be sorry to me.

102
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,160
I can't bear it.

103
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,160
Can we not do this?

104
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,160
You killed me.

105
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,160
I don't want to bear it.

106
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,160
I really feel bad for you.

107
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,160
Every time I think I want to divorce, I don't.

108
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,160
I'm just a fool.

109
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,160
But you're so nice to me.

110
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,160
I'm thinking about whether these people are just temporary.

111
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,160
You must love me.

112
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,160
You can't not love me.

113
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,160
I just don't know about it.

114
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,160
Then I'll just...

115
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,160
I'll insist on it.

116
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,160
Our ending will be different.

117
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,160
But...

118
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,160
I really can't bear it.

119
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,160
Qianhao, I beg you.

120
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,160
You...

121
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,160
If you want to kill me,

122
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,160
you have to do it.

123
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,160
Or else, we'll forget those things.

124
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,160
We're like before.

125
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,160
Can we?

126
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,160
Can we?

127
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,160
Have you ever thought about

128
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,160
a man who's been through a lot?

129
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,160
What are you doing?

130
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,160
Get out of here.

131
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,160
Qianhao!

132
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,160
Qianhao!

133
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,160
I'll go back and pack my things.

134
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,160
Then I'll move out.

135
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,160
Don't worry.

136
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,160
Even if you kneel down,

137
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,160
you won't be back.

138
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,160
I'm in a city.

139
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,160
I'll keep some things.

140
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,160
I'll be back.

141
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,160
I'll be back.

142
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,160
I'll be back.

143
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,160
I'll be back.

144
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,160
I'll be back.

145
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,160
I'll be back.

146
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,160
I'll be back.

147
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,160
I'll be back.

148
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,160
I'll be back.

149
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,160
I'll be back.

150
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,160
I'll be back.

151
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,160
I'll be back.

152
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,160
I'll be back.

153
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,160
I'll be back.

154
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,160
I'll be back.

155
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,160
I'll be back.

156
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,160
I'll be back.

157
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,160
I'll be back.

158
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,160
I'll be back.

159
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,160
I'll be back.

160
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,160
Qianhao.

161
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,160
I'll come back

162
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,160
when I get out of my house.

163
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,160
Episode 1

164
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,160
You're so mean.

165
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,160
Look at this kid.

166
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,160
He's so big.

167
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,160
He almost lost himself.

168
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,160
He's still so silly.

169
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,160
I'm scared.

170
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,160
Such a big kid.

171
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,160
He can't leave anyone.

172
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,160
Qianhao is so mean.

173
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,160
He's the father of the kid.

174
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,160
He's so careless.

175
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,160
I think

176
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,160
he's just trying to

177
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,160
take this grandson's

178
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,160
wish

179
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,160
and take Xiaomi as a tool

180
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,160
to take care of this family.

181
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,160
It's not a good thing.

182
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,160
God is so interesting.

183
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,160
Qianhao's only love

184
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,160
is all on his mother.

185
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,160
I'm also

186
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,160
not a good person.

187
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,160
I think he can

188
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,160
make up for

189
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,160
his child's lack of love

190
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,160
by coming back.

191
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,160
I'm really in trouble.

192
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,160
But I think

193
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,160
Qianhao

194
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,160
will never give up.

195
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,160
Let's move.

196
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,160
We'll move right away.

197
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,160
Xiaomi will also be a kindergarten.

198
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,160
We don't want her to be raised.

199
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,160
Don't talk to this family.

200
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,160
You're right.

201
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,160
After this,

202
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,160
I finally understand

203
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,160
that it's useless to retreat.

204
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,160
Since he doesn't trust us,

205
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,160
we can't be soft on him.

206
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,160
I've made up my mind.

207
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,160
This time,

208
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,160
we must first make up for our mistakes.

209
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,160
Make up for our mistakes?

210
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,160
What do you want to do?

211
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,160
I haven't made up my mind.

212
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,160
You're talking like a man.

213
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,160
But we can't be like this.

214
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,160
We

215
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,160
have to take out the T-shirt.

216
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,160
Dad.

217
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,160
Chen Yi.

218
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,160
Come back today.

219
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,160
You can be earlier.

220
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,160
Dad.

221
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,160
Dad.

222
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,160
Chen Yi.

223
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,160
Come back today.

224
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,160
You can be earlier.

225
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,160
Dad.

226
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,160
Dad.

227
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,160
Dad.

228
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,160
Wife.

229
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,160
Wife.

230
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,160
Wife.

231
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,160
Wife.

232
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,160
Why are you so noisy?

233
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,160
I didn't see your sister.

234
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,160
Xia Chen Er.

235
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,160
Why did you come to my house?

236
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,160
Where's my wife?

237
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,160
I found her.

238
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,160
How do I know where she went?

239
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,160
Besides,

240
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,160
she came to your house.

241
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,160
My mom bought this house.

242
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,160
But she got paid.

243
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,160
I told her to

244
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,160
return to my house.

245
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,160
Don't make me feel bad.

246
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,160
We've been apart for a long time.

247
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,160
It has nothing to do with you.

248
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,160
You said where my wife went before.

249
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,160
She went to the hotel with her luggage.

250
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,160
What did you do?

251
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,160
You pissed her off and went out?

252
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,160
I told her a few times.

253
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,160
She left.

254
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,160
She's over 50.

255
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,160
She's so stubborn.

256
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,160
Who's stubborn?

257
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,160
You said you'd come back.

258
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,160
You should go to the temple.

259
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,160
Why did you come here?

260
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,160
I've been taking care of her for a long time.

261
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,160
My legs and waist.

262
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,160
I'm so tired.

263
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,160
My waist hurts.

264
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,160
I'm hungry.

265
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,160
Help me cook some food.

266
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,160
I'm a good cook.

267
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,160
I'm leaving this meeting.

268
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,160
I'll cook for you when I get back.

269
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,160
You can order some food.

270
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,160
I can't.

271
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,160
The oil is bad.

272
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,160
It's unhealthy.

273
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,160
Your sister is so hard to get back.

274
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,160
She told you to make a scallion noodles.

275
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,160
You don't want to cook?

276
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,160
Fine.

277
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,160
I'll call my mom.

278
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,160
Tell her that you and your wife

279
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,160
will bully me.

280
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,160
Sister,

281
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,160
you're a good wife.

282
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,160
You can't do anything about your child.

283
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,160
You're a good cook.

284
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,160
That's scallion noodles,

285
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,160
lotus eggs,

286
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,160
and the sun eggs.

287
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,160
If I eat them, I won't be able to cook.

288
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,160
I won't be able to cook.

289
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,160
Okay,

290
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,160
I'll take the water.

291
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,160
You'll find a new job tomorrow.

292
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,160
If you can't find one,

293
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,160
I'll make a deal for you.

294
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,160
You can do whatever you want.

295
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,160
You can choose.

296
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,160
Dad,

297
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,160
I want to be a good cook.

298
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,160
I like that job.

299
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,160
What?

300
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,160
You can't do that.

301
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,160
You're making me angry.

302
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,160
You're a bad cook.

303
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,160
You can't find a job.

304
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,160
I can't do that.

305
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,160
You can't do that.

306
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,160
You can't do that.

307
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,160
Why are you making fun of us?

308
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,160
I'm making fun of you.

309
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,160
Why are you making fun of us?

310
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,160
Is that right?

311
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,160
Chenyin,

312
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,160
is he?

313
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,160
He's making fun of you.

314
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,160
Are you guys doing this to me?

315
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,160
I'm doing this for you.

316
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,160
You're living in your room.

317
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,160
Don't you dare say that.

318
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,160
You can't do that.

319
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,160
What are you doing?

320
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,160
Don't talk.

321
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,160
What job do you have?

322
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,160
You can't find a job.

323
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,160
Isn't that a job?

324
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,160
What's so good about it?

325
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,160
What's so good about it?

326
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,160
I spent so much money.

327
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,160
I'm giving you back.

328
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,160
I'm giving you back.

329
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,160
I'm giving you back.

330
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,160
I want you to have a good job.

331
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,160
What's so good about it?

332
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,160
What's so good about it?

333
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,160
Look.

334
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,160
I want you to have a good job.

335
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,160
You can't do that.

336
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,160
I'm giving you back.

337
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,160
I'm giving you back.

338
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,160
I'm giving you back.

339
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,160
I'm giving you back.

340
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,160
I'm giving you back.

341
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,160
So cute.

342
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,160
I already have a long hair.

343
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,160
I'm so fat.

344
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,160
So good.

345
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,160
Oh.

346
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,160
I'm just full.

347
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,160
I'm just full.

348
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,160
I'm just full.

349
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,160
I'm just fat.

350
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,160
I'm just fat.

351
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,160
I'm just fat.

352
00:14:53,160 --> 00:15:19,300
And she even

353
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,300
Look, he's your mother, right?

354
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,300
You're the only one who can be so nice.

355
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,300
You're the one who can be so nice.

356
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,300
Thank you.

357
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,300
Wow, thank you.

358
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,300
You're the one who can be so nice.

359
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,300
Thank you.

360
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,300
Xia Chenggong, stop looking for me.

361
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,300
When are you going to pick up?

362
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,300
I'll be right back.

363
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,300
Hahaha!

364
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,300
Hahaha!

365
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,300
He's so funny.

366
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,300
Don't look for me!

367
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,300
I didn't understand.

368
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,300
Pick up the phone.

369
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,300
I'll be right back.

370
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,300
I'm sorry.

371
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,300
I'm sorry.

372
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,300
I'm sorry.

373
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,300
Hahaha!

374
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,300
Hahaha!

375
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,300
I'm sorry.

376
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,300
I can't remember.

377
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:53,300
I can't breathe.

378
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,300
I don't understand.

379
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:00,300
The tears in the white boat.

380
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,300
I'm afraid the darkness will disappear.

381
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,300
What if he wins the game?

382
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,300
What if he wins the game?

383
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,300
I don't even know who the father is!

384
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,300
Then who do you blame?

385
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,300
It's not that you paid for it.

386
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,100
But we don't want to live together like this anymore.

387
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,500
We really don't want to.

388
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,900
We don't want to be together.

389
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,500
I'm begging you.

390
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,700
Okay.

391
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,500
I'm begging you.

392
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,700
I'm begging you.

393
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:31,100
I won't let you get away with it.

394
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,900
I won't let you live well either.

395
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,100
I won't let you live with your dad.

396
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,500
I won't let you

397
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,900
stay in your place.

398
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,100
I won't let you live with your dad.

399
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,100
You're pregnant with someone else.

400
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,700
Why are you blaming me for Miss Zhao?

401
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,100
I told you I'm not a human.

402
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,500
I'm a man who doesn't believe in you.

403
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,100
I'm not a human.

404
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,100
We all made a mistake.

405
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,100
We should be fair.

406
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,900
Let's forget all those things.

407
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,500
Let's be together like before.

408
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,300
Don't you want to forget?

409
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,500
I said it.

410
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,100
Don't let me live with you anymore.

411
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,300
I want to be with you.

412
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:24,300
I want to be with you forever.

413
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:28,300
I'll be with you forever.

414
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:32,300
I want to be with you forever.

415
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,300
I want to be with you forever.

416
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,300
Is there time?

417
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,300
Let's meet.

418
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:40,300
I want to be with you forever.

419
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,300
I'll give you happiness in my life.

420
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:49,300
I'll be with you forever.

421
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:53,300
I'll be here.

422
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,300
Why aren't you going to school?

423
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,300
Are we going to live with Uncle Mei?

424
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,300
Why?

425
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,300
Are we going to live with him?

426
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,300
He's your boyfriend.

427
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,300
He's your mother's friend.

428
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,300
But you're his family.

429
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,300
We're just close to him.

430
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,300
It's easier for us to take care of him.

431
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,300
Is Uncle Mei's family a little friend?

432
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,300
They're as cute as you.

433
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,300
What if I don't like them?

434
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,300
Let's play together.

435
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,300
Don't you have a brother?

436
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,300
Maybe our life has changed

437
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,300
because of Uncle Mei's family.

438
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,300
But I'll respect you and Xiaomi.

439
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,300
I want to discuss something with you.

440
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,300
Can you not tell me

441
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,300
about the new house?

442
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,300
Will he take the brother away?

443
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,300
Maybe.

444
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,300
I promise I won't tell him.

445
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,300
I'll protect him.

446
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,300
Even if he can't let us part.

447
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,300
My daughter is so big.

448
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,300
Go and get him out of here.

449
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:26,300
Dad and I took Pei Qi and Qiao Zhi together.

450
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:30,300
One day, he met a lady who he liked.

451
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,300
They became neighbors.

452
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,300
Auntie Xiong Xiong also had two babies.

453
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,300
They were Xiong Da and Xiong Er.

454
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:44,300
Pei Qi and Qiao Zhi often played with Xiong Da and Xiong Er.

455
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,300
They liked each other.

456
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,300
They became friends not only in the good neighbor.

457
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,300
This story tells us

458
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:57,300
that we should be kind to our neighbor's friends.

459
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,300
Especially when we wake up.

460
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:05,300
Dad, you're taking the same story of the three bears.

461
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:09,300
And Pei Qi and Qiao Zhi and Xiong Da are not in the same story.

462
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,300
They won't be neighbors.

463
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,300
Dad, do you want to say

464
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,300
Auntie Xiong Er and us to be neighbors?

465
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,300
Maybe.

466
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,300
Maybe.

467
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,300
Maybe.

468
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,300
Auntie Xiong Er and I are the ones who dad likes.

469
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,300
Besides, we've been to the entertainment.

470
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,300
Right?

471
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,300
She will soon become our neighbor.

472
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,300
Can you be friends with Auntie Xiong Er and us?

473
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,300
Sure.

474
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,300
Okay, let's go to bed.

475
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,300
Good night, dad.

476
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,300
Okay, good night.

477
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,300
I can't sleep.

478
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,300
Me neither.

479
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,300
I can't sleep.

480
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,300
I have good news for you.

481
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,300
I've just finished talking to Yu-Guan.

482
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,300
They're willing to date with Xiao Ni.

483
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,300
Don't worry, it will be over in a minute.

484
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,300
I'll take you.

485
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,300
These two little things are so difficult to deal with.

486
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,300
I don't believe it.

487
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,300
Mei Cheng Yi will definitely be the one.

488
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,300
That's great.

489
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,300
I'm really looking forward to it.

490
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,300
Where are you?

491
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,300
Happy blood.

492
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,300
You're so bloody.

493
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,300
Hey.

494
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,300
Hey.

495
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,300
Will you be too hard on me

496
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,300
if I tell my daughter today?

497
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,300
You.

498
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,300
You should be hungry when you're a good person.

499
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,300
You should be the one who's running away.

500
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,300
How will you deal with that big girl going to the woods?

501
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,300
I'm not wrong.

502
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,300
But she's not...

503
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,300
What are you talking about?

504
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,300
I've raised her for the rest of my life.

505
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,300
I can't let her do this.

506
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,300
She's so stupid.

507
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,300
That little Xu moved here to live.

508
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,300
That's not something to be late for.

509
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,300
She's not bad.

510
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,300
Not living together.

511
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,300
In the same building,

512
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,300
she also rents a house.

513
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,300
What's going on?

514
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,300
What's going on?

515
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,300
What's going on?

516
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,300
Can you be more confident?

517
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,300
Look at that little Xu.

518
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,300
He looks good on the surface.

519
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,300
He doesn't seem to have any confidence.

520
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,300
But I'm afraid that

521
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,300
he might be cheated when he's getting married.

522
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,300
Then he'll find a fool to raise a child for him.

523
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,300
We need to be more careful.

524
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,300
If he finds a good husband,

525
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,300
he'll be cheated by him

526
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,300
before he even gets married.

527
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,300
Go to the woods.

528
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,300
Wash them all.

529
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,300
Don't come here, master.

530
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,300
Why are you angry?

531
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,300
He can't hide this from me.

532
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,300
The East Wind and the West Wind.

533
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,300
It depends on who can hold you.

534
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,300
You're so ugly today.

535
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,300
Stop it.

536
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,300
You're so weak.

537
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,300
It's time.

538
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,300
I'm not going to fight anymore.

539
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,300
If you sleep too much, you won't be able to raise a child.

540
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,300
Master, don't worry.

541
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,300
I'll accept the offer.

542
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,300
If they don't let me come to work,

543
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,300
I'll be starving to death.

544
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,300
I'll be desperate tomorrow.

545
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,300
Listen to you.

546
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,300
It means you don't have any training.

547
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,300
Listen,

548
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,300
you can't be so strict with your body.

549
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,300
You know what?

550
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,300
It's delicious.

551
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,300
Okay, I won't tell you.

552
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,300
I'm going to sleep.

553
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,300
Bye.

554
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,300
Master.

555
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,300
Master.

556
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,300
Master.

557
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,300
What's wrong?

558
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,300
You want to sleep with me?

559
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,300
That's all.

560
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,300
Master.

561
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,300
After the war,

562
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:45,300
we'll have to fight again.

563
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,300
I heard that one day,

564
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,300
you were lying flat.

565
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,300
What should we do?

566
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,300
Kill your father.

567
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,300
I'll kill him.

568
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,300
That little smoke

569
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:12,300
was used to cover up the night.

570
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:16,300
I can't remember, I can't remember

571
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:19,300
the tomorrow.

572
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:26,300
I'll exchange the things I've used for my whole life.

573
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:29,300
I'll be a good boy.

574
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,300
I'll be a good boy.

575
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:35,300
I'll be a good boy.

576
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,300
I'll be a good boy.

577
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,300
I'll be a good boy.

578
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,300
I'll be a good boy.

579
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:47,300
I'll be a good boy.

580
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:50,300
I'll be a good boy.

581
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,300
I'll be a good boy.

582
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,300
With your familiar face,

583
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,300
the sunlight is warm,

584
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:06,300
and singing courageouslyme anyway.

585
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,300
See you.

586
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,380
This is Viva...

587
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,100
senior Viva,

588
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,300
And Santa.

589
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,140
Thank you.

590
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,940
Bag.

591
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,340
Bag, bag.

592
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,420
Oh, okay.

593
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,460
Oh, who is it?!

594
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,420
I thought so.

595
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,420
What are you looking at?

596
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,420
Nothing.

597
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,420
Come back.

598
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,420
You're not pretty.

599
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,420
What?

600
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,420
I saw you look pretty.

601
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,420
I can't see you.

602
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,420
What are you talking about?

603
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,420
Xiao Xu Yi's family is here.

604
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,420
Chen Yi is helping.

605
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,420
Why do you see Chen Yi?

606
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,420
She's moving to the building.

607
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:18,420
I think I should go help her.

608
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,420
What?

609
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,420
What are you doing?

610
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,420
Are you trying to help Chen Yi?

611
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,420
Or helping an old beauty?

612
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,420
More than 60 years old.

613
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,420
And you're still eating this kind of nonsense.

614
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,420
Even if you don't have confidence in yourself,

615
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,420
you should have confidence in me too.

616
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,420
What kind of food?

617
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,420
It smells so good.

618
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,420
It's not for your daughter.

619
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,420
I made it today.

620
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,420
She loves it.

621
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,420
I didn't even open it when I was smoking.

622
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,420
I didn't believe her.

623
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,420
She's really so stubborn.

624
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,420
She didn't even eat it.

625
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,420
I'm not stubborn.

626
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,420
She's stubborn.

627
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,420
What's that smell?

628
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,420
Okay, but up and down?

629
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,420
I don't understand this word.

630
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,420
You'd rather have interim exams?

631
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,420
Mom?

632
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:38,840
What happened to him after

633
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,000
he got tattoos?

634
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,840
He had no feelings at all.

635
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,840
Mom needs medication...

636
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,840
Not medication.

637
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,840
I'm not fine.

638
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,840
I'm not fine.

639
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,840
I'm not fine.

640
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,840
I'm not fine.

641
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,840
I'm done eating.

642
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,840
I'm done eating.

643
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,840
Be careful.

644
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,840
Be careful.

645
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,840
Chen Yi.

646
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,840
Xia Xue.

647
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,840
You guys are so petty.

648
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,840
You guys are so petty.

649
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,840
We can't let you know.

650
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,840
No, no, no.

651
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,840
I'm not looking for a job.

652
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,840
Don't move.

653
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,840
What are you talking about? I'm not old enough.

654
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,840
Right?

655
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,840
This is...

656
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,840
This is Sister Lily.

657
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,840
I'm not her mother.

658
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,840
I'm her mother.

659
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,840
Hello.

660
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,840
This is my secret.

661
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,840
Chen Yi is like our son.

662
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,840
We are like a family.

663
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,840
We are like a family.

664
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,840
We are like family.

665
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,840
We are like family.

666
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,840
I'll take care of you.

667
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,840
I'm coming.

668
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,840
I'll help you.

669
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,840
Please.

670
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,840
There is a market over there.

671
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,840
There is a community hospital over there.

672
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,840
It's very convenient.

673
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,840
There is a big square over there.

674
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,840
A lot of people dance there.

675
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,840
If you are interested, you can come with me.

676
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,840
I'll take you to the wall.

677
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,840
You are so nice.

678
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,840
I'll take you to the wall, Mr. Cai.

679
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,840
I love you.

680
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,840
You are right.

681
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,840
One, two, three, four...

682
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,840
I made six.

683
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,840
One, two, three, four...

684
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,840
I made six.

685
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,840
I made six.

686
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,840
Your old account is good.

687
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,840
Yes.

688
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,840
Why didn't I see you?

689
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,840
Your parents love you, Chen Yi.

690
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,840
What's going on?

691
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,840
Slow down.

692
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,840
Let's go.

693
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,840
Why are you here?

694
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,840
I'm here.

695
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,840
I'm here at the market.

696
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,840
Let's go to the usual hospital.

697
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,840
You are not good at the old days.

698
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,840
You should go back with me.

699
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,840
You should be a good teacher.

700
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,840
I'll be back.

701
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,840
Come here.

702
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,840
I'll be back.

703
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,840
The big square is here.

704
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,840
You can go first.

705
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,840
I'll go out and see if there's anything missing.

706
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,840
Be careful.

707
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,840
Don't worry.

708
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,840
Be careful.

709
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,840
Your waist is starting to concern the people.

710
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,840
You are so annoying.

711
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,840
Think about it.

712
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,840
Think about the feeling of me being single.

713
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,840
What should I do?

714
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,840
Where should I take the car?

715
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,840
You ran faster than a rabbit.

716
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,840
You never showed up.

717
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,840
A man.

718
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,840
He's not right.

719
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,840
Did he hide something from you?

720
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,840
He asked his parents why he didn't answer you.

721
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,840
He didn't hear you.

722
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,840
Who doesn't hide anything from you?

723
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,840
We are partners now.

724
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,840
It doesn't matter if we go or not.

725
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,840
Okay.

726
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,840
Go ahead.

727
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,840
It's getting cold.

728
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,840
Have a sip.

729
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,840
Mom, have a sip.

730
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,840
Mom.

731
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,840
I have a job.

732
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,840
What?

733
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,840
I have a job.

734
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,840
You can go back.

735
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,840
It's okay.

736
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,840
I'll stay here with you.

737
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,840
I'll sleep here tonight.

738
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,840
Have a sip.

739
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,840
Mom.

740
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,840
Mom, have a sip.

741
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,840
Mom.

742
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,840
Let me do it.

743
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,840
You can go back and rest.

744
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,840
Sir, let's go.

745
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,840
I'm also a mother.

746
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,840
I know what your mother means.

747
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,840
She's more anxious.

748
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,840
She didn't have much energy.

749
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,840
She's more tired when she's with you.

750
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,840
I'll go back and sleep.

751
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,840
Please.

752
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,840
Don't worry.

753
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,840
I'm leaving.

754
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,840
Take care.

755
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,840
I'm leaving.

756
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:34,840
Mom, let's have some porridge.

757
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,840
Mom, you're not feeling well.

758
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,840
You can't eat.

759
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,840
You can eat.

760
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,840
Here, auntie.

761
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,840
Here.

762
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,840
Have some sea grass.

763
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,840
Have some sea grass.

764
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,840
Have some sea grass.

765
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,840
Have some sea grass.

766
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,840
What are you doing?

767
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,840
You're not going to work today?

768
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,840
I'll go and get some rest.

769
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,840
How is it?

770
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,840
Good.

771
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,840
So cute.

772
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,840
I have to go.

773
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:16,840
Yu'an and Yule are having dinner at her grandma's house.

774
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,840
They're coming back soon.

775
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,840
Aren't you having dinner here?

776
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,840
It's hot today.

777
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,840
I'll bring them here next time.

778
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,840
The key is to have a good time with them.

779
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,840
They're here.

780
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,840
They're here.

781
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,840
What are you doing?

782
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,840
What are you doing?

783
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,840
What are you doing?

784
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,840
I'm coming.

785
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,840
Come on.

786
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,840
Come on.

787
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,840
Hurry up.

788
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,840
Come on.

789
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,840
Come on.

790
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,840
It's so hot.

791
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,840
Be careful.

792
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,840
Dad.

793
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,840
Dad.

794
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,840
Here.

795
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,840
You're back.

796
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,840
Come on.

797
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,840
Come and have dinner.

798
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,840
Come on.

799
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,840
Come on.

800
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,840
It's almost done.

801
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,840
Let me have a bite.

802
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:18,840
This meal is so good.

803
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,840
It's got spring rolls, crayfish,

804
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,840
spring onions, lamb,

805
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,840
and egg.

806
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,840
It's so rich.

807
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,840
It's so good.

808
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,840
I'm tired of working for another old lady.

809
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,840
Can I have a bite?

810
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,840
Why are you talking?

811
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,840
Chen Yi,

812
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,840
I didn't mean that.

813
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,840
I didn't mean it.

814
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,840
It's okay. I know.

815
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,840
It's good.

816
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:00,840
One day, I had to make you two angry.

817
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,840
I didn't want to stop.

818
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,840
I was too young to be happy.

819
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,840
I was too old to be hungry.

820
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,840
I was too young to starve to death.

821
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,840
Why am I so poor?

822
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,840
You're not eating?

823
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,840
No.

824
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,840
I can't even tell him to eat.

825
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,840
It's okay.

826
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,840
Young people are hungry.

827
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,840
They won't starve.

828
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,840
What are you doing?

829
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,840
I'm not eating.

830
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,840
You guys don't talk to each other every day.

831
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,840
I don't talk to each other.

832
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,840
Mom, mom.

833
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,840
I'll go and see him.

834
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,840
Youyou.

835
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,840
Are you going in?

836
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,840
Mom.

837
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,840
Mom.

838
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,840
What's wrong?

839
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,840
Are you okay?

840
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,840
We're still worried about you.

841
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,840
Okay. It's okay.

842
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,840
Uncle.

843
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,840
You can't betray me.

844
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,840
I just want to go back to Linyuan.

845
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,840
If I don't go back, I'll be replaced by them.

846
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,840
It's okay.

847
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,840
Brother-in-law.

848
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,840
Don't look down on us, Linyuan.

849
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,840
Yongshou Linyuan, the top student in Jiangcheng.

850
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,840
Many college students and research students.

851
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,840
They're so smart.

852
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,840
Really?

853
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,840
You...

854
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,840
What's this?

855
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,840
It's a good shop.

856
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,840
I'm sorry.

857
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,840
I'm sorry.

858
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,840
I'm sorry.

859
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,840
I'm sorry.

860
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,840
I'm sorry.
