1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I see your pain as your brain ray too

2
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Some things we cannot just embrace

3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And there's no time to guess the ground up us

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Greater daylight, go to the free

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let's cross the wind, dancing ring, let the stars in room and night away

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Oh, this is peace, happiness, they are all bought off a journey

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Woo-hoo

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The End

9
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
How is it?

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
How is it, Youyou?

11
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This old man is so sick

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
He's really sick

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Let's just let him...

14
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
No, he's just a habit

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
If he doesn't eat, he'll starve to death

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
He loves to eat

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Zhenyin, let's eat

18
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Love will change

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
There's nothing that will change in this world

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Wow, so big

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So big

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Mom, the sun in the new house is so big

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I love this sun

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I like it too

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Let me see this sun

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Wow, so big

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Yes, yes, these two kids are very capable

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Look at the other side, there's a toy

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I want to see it

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Didn't I tell you?

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What did you say?

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
This is Meilao's house

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Who?

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Come, eat some fruits

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay, Li Li, who?

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Meicheng Yi?

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
No, this is the balcony

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You two are playing the game of the night

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Oh, I see

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Why do we have to climb the balcony?

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We can't go this way

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Oh, right

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
There's a little house with a small ladder

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And a steel box

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
There should be a kid over there

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Otherwise, the house won't be finished

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Mom, mom

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You two, be careful, don't get caught

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
This way

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Okay, let's have a fight

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Wish you and Meicheng Yi a good luck

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
How come Tao Chen doesn't have good wishes?

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
He's like a horror movie

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Eat, eat, eat

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Eat, eat, eat

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Here, let me give you one

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I think we can put the flowers or the toy on this shelf

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I agree with the toy

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I don't want to see it

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The memories of the past

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I don't want to tell the story

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The shadow of the lonely island

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Into the sea

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I forget the breath

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I don't understand the crying of the white boat

66
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm afraid the dark night disappears in the sky

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The memories of the deep regrets

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Like a maze

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Open your eyes

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I want to hug you and hug you

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
A life of fate, a day of destiny

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And have the courage to do my best

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I want to accompany you and protect you

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
A life of happiness, a day of happiness

75
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And have the courage to do my best

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm here

77
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The End

78
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So many dishes!

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You can do it, good cooking

80
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Why only one bowl?

81
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Hurry up, take one and eat

82
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm not hungry, you eat

83
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Why is there no sister?

84
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You don't eat?

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Okay, okay, I'll eat

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm hungry

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Honey

88
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Where are you?

89
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Come back soon

90
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Give it to me

91
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Let's continue this evening

92
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Okay

93
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Hey, Xiao'er, did you just learn from me?

94
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Who chose you?

95
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
This is our family's balcony, what do we want to do?

96
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Really rude

97
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yes, you are the child you didn't learn from

98
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Disgusting

99
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Disgusting

100
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You are the annoying

101
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Disgusting

102
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You are the annoying

103
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yuan'e

104
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Don't be small

105
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What are you doing?

106
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You

107
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Don't you remember what dad told you about the bear's story?

108
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Disgusting

109
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
No smile

110
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Disgusting

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You are the annoying

112
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Disgusting

113
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You are the annoying

114
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
No smile

115
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Disgusting

116
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Okay, okay, okay, stop

117
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Disgusting

118
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Don't be small

119
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Don't be small

120
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Don't be small

121
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Don't be small

122
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Don't be small

123
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Let's go back to the room

124
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Okay, okay

125
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Okay, I won't say it

126
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Okay, we didn't lose in the game

127
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You are not anxious at all

128
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Why are you anxious?

129
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
The children are making up

130
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's good to have their rules in the next few days

131
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You can't let them say it

132
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Then you are not afraid to affect the relationship between you and Meicheng?

133
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Who can only love love?

134
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Meicheng, if you don't understand this

135
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Then you two can't get along

136
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Young people are forced to live in love

137
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Love is a matter of mind and mind

138
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Otherwise, they will be hit by the blood

139
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Love is so hard

140
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You are not that hard

141
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Just keep your three points

142
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Three points for yourself, three points for life, three points for family

143
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And then you can leave it to love

144
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's one point

145
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
That's a lot

146
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
That's a lot

147
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So Meicheng and I can't just rely on love

148
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
We have to use our brains and our energy

149
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What do you rely on?

150
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You are different

151
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You have to rely on luck

152
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Because you don't have brain

153
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Xu Kaixi

154
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Xu Kaixi

155
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
He wants to sleep

156
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Did dad tell you that you can't fight with your friends?

157
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Okay

158
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
If you don't like it, you won't like it anymore

159
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Okay, dad

160
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Okay, sleep

161
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Bye-bye

162
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Okay, sleep

163
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Hello

164
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Good evening

165
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
How is my mom?

166
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
She's fine, she's sleeping

167
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The doctor came to check the room

168
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
She said she was very stable

169
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Don't worry

170
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Okay, thank you

171
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So late

172
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I...

173
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'll give you a red envelope

174
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I've already paid the money

175
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
No need

176
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
No

177
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You have to take it

178
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I have only one request

179
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Take care of my mom

180
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Such a big red envelope

181
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Don't worry, I will take good care of her

182
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Okay, sister

183
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
How big are you?

184
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'm going to the bathroom

185
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Master, wait for me downstairs

186
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I have to run two times in the afternoon

187
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Okay, bye

188
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Bye-bye

189
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Where are you going?

190
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I shouldn't stay here

191
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Where are you going to find that man?

192
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm going to find him

193
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
At least find someone else

194
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Who are you?

195
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Who are you?

196
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Who are you?

197
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Who are you?

198
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Let go of me, what are you doing?

199
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Who are you?

200
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm not a man

201
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm not a man

202
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm telling you, look at me

203
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Who are you?

204
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Let go of me

205
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Let go of me

206
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Let go of me

207
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Let go of me

208
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Let go of me

209
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm fine

210
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm fine

211
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Xiao Zhao, I'm fine

212
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm not going to get married, Xiao Zhao

213
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Xiao Zhao, Xiao Zhao

214
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Xiao Zhao, Xiao Zhao, Xiao Zhao

215
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Xiao Zhao, wake up

216
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Xiao Zhao, Xiao Zhao

217
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
What are you doing?

218
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I can't even find my own sister

219
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Why are you looking for me?

220
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Hello, what are you doing?

221
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Xiao Zhao, what's wrong?

222
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You should come to the hospital

223
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
What's wrong?

224
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You should tell me

225
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
What's wrong with Xiao Zhao?

226
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Xiao Zhao is pregnant, he's still strong

227
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Xiao Zhao is pregnant

228
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And he's bleeding

229
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I think the whole child is going to be cut off

230
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
So he can keep his life

231
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Oh my god, I'll be right there

232
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Xiao Zhao, will something happen?

233
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Will he come?

234
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Xiao Zhao, Xiao Zhao, don't do this

235
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You're a traitor

236
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
If Xiao Zhao is a traitor

237
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'll kill you

238
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You're a traitor

239
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You're a traitor

240
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You're a traitor

241
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Xiao Zhao, Xiao Zhao, Xiao Zhao

242
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Xiao Zhao, Xiao Zhao, Xiao Zhao

243
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
What's wrong with Xiao Zhao?

244
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
She's here, she's here

245
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I don't know, I don't know

246
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
She'll be fine if you tell her

247
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'll kill her

248
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I don't know what to do

249
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Don't be anxious

250
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
How's Xiao Zhao?

251
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Is she okay?

252
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Why don't you tell her

253
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
That you and Xiao Zhao are both dalam

254
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,800
versus Pieper

255
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Want to be paid more?

256
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Xiao Zhao!

257
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I'm not going to sleep.

258
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You're sleeping?

259
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I'm not good at driving.

260
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I have to go to the airport in seven days.

261
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I'm still drunk.

262
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Xiao Xiao, go back to your room.

263
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Then you should go to bed.

264
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I've been busy all day.

265
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'm so anxious with the kids.

266
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I'm afraid they won't get used to it.

267
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm afraid they'll get upset.

268
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
No, it's my fault.

269
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Go back to sleep.

270
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Go out.

271
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I've been helping you all day.

272
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Why don't you go and rest?

273
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It's not even a day of work today.

274
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I'll go now.

275
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Are you still sleeping?

276
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Get some food.

277
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Okay.

278
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Are you all right?

279
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Yes.

280
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Then why aren't you sleeping?

281
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I said...

282
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I said why aren't you sleeping?

283
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I said why aren't you sleeping?

284
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm afraid I'll fall asleep.

285
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Someone will call me.

286
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'm afraid I'll fall asleep.

287
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Someone will call me.

288
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I hate you.

289
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I hate you.

290
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You said today is a day of work.

291
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It's all a happy day.

292
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
You said you wanted to be happier.

293
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
The rainbow must have appeared.

294
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I said I'd be more comfortable with you.

295
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
The sun will warm up a little.

296
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Tomorrow is a wish.

297
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Open up a new world.

298
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Even if life is a storm, it's a rain.

299
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
We can enjoy the weather every day.

300
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I can go through it bravely.

301
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Give me a new self.

302
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Don't forget to smile happily.

303
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
A warm hug.

304
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Don't need to be angry.

305
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Give me a light.

306
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
The smell of the smell.

307
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
The bad smell is around you.

308
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Don't forget to smile happily.

309
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
A warm hug.

310
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Don't need to be angry.

311
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Give me a light.

312
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm lucky that I can't let go of your hand.

313
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I don't want to lose you.

314
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I don't want to lose you.

315
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I want to be happy.

316
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I can go through it bravely.

317
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Give me a light.

318
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I'm lucky that I can't let go of your hand.

319
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I don't want to lose you.

320
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,600
Let's cross the wind, dance and ring

321
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,760
Let the stars in the moonlight and the wind

322
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,160
Oh

323
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,400
Is your hand closed?

324
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,160
Yes, it's closed.

325
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,000
You're here.

326
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,560
I'll take it.

327
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,200
I know

328
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,400
Wait a minute.

329
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,360
Why do I feel like I heard them coming out?

330
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,200
No.

331
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,280
No.

332
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,720
Did you hear it wrong?

333
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,240
No?

334
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,400
No.

335
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,360
Please sit down.

336
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,400
Wait a minute.

337
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,240
I'll take it.

338
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,040
If I knew that the former rich family

339
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,560
was in the pain and panic

340
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,880
that was about to be destroyed in the Great Sha

341
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,600
I would be so scared.

342
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,880
People's sadness and sadness

343
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,440
are not connected.

344
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,360
There's no need to connect.

345
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,360
But we

346
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,360
have different experiences tonight

347
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,240
but we've been in a fight

348
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,200
and we've been talking to the former rich family.

349
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,480
In the middle of the year,

350
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,000
if you still want to live with love

351
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,920
you'll soon be in a state of failure.

352
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:35,440
I don't have any sympathy for them.

353
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,840
I'm just happy

354
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,600
to be able to live with love

355
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,480
and love in my own way.

356
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,560
No matter who it is,

357
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,920
I can't drag you in.

358
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,360
I can't drag you in.

359
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,360
I can't drag you in.

360
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,360
I can't drag you in.

361
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,360
I can't drag you in.

362
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,360
I can't drag you in.

363
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,360
I can't drag you in.

364
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,360
I can't drag you in.

365
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,360
I can't drag you in.

366
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,360
I can't drag you in.

367
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,360
I can't drag you in.

368
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,360
I can't drag you in.

369
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,360
I can't drag you in.

370
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,360
I can't drag you in.

371
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,360
I can't drag you in.

372
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,360
I can't drag you in.

373
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,360
I can't drag you in.

374
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,360
I can't drag you in.

375
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,360
I can't drag you in.

376
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,360
I can't drag you in.

377
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,360
I can't drag you in.

378
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,360
Do you hear that?

379
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,360
I can't.

380
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,360
How is it?

381
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,360
How is he?

382
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,360
He's fine.

383
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,360
The result is not so good,

384
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,360
but it's not bad.

385
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,360
You've held out a genuine amount of life.

386
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,360
But next,

387
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,460
you must make him some good health.

388
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,460
Especially, she has some things in her mind.

389
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,460
After all, she hasn't had a child.

390
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,460
And she can't be a mother anymore.

391
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,460
What's going on?

392
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,460
Xiao Qiao! Xiao Qiao!

393
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,460
Xiao Qiao! Xiao Qiao!

394
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,460
Xiao Qiao!

395
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,460
Xiao Qiao, are you okay?

396
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:36,460
Xiao Qiao is a mother. Xiao Qiao!

397
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,460
What a bastard.

398
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:46,460
Xiao Qiao! Xiao Qiao!

399
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,460
Xiao Qiao! Xiao Qiao! Xiao Qiao!

400
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:16,460
What time is it?

401
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:31,460
When did you come?

402
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,460
Yeah.

403
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,460
Okay.

404
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,460
I'm gonna sleep here.

405
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,460
I'm gonna sleep here.

406
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,460
You're too tired to sleep here.

407
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,460
Just 10 minutes.

408
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,460
I thought you could call me 10 minutes.

409
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,460
Yeah, I'm too tired to sleep here.

410
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,460
Dad!

411
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,460
Wake up!

412
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,460
Dad, I'm gonna wash up.

413
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,460
Wash your face first.

414
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,460
I'm gonna put on my clothes.

415
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,460
I'm gonna put on my clothes.

416
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,460
I'm gonna go out first.

417
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,460
I'm gonna put them on the bathroom.

418
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,460
I'm gonna take care of them.

419
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,460
Yuanyuan, Yu Le, I'm gonna wash your face.

420
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,460
I'm gonna wash your face.

421
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,460
Okay, I'm gonna go.

422
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,460
Here, here.

423
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,460
I'm gonna wash your face.

424
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,460
What's wrong?

425
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,460
I think the door is open.

426
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,460
Let me open it.

427
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,460
Let's go.

428
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,460
Okay, I'm gonna go.

429
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,460
I'm gonna go.

430
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,460
I'm gonna wash your face.

431
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,460
Dad, I'm gonna go.

432
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,460
Help me.

433
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,460
I'm gonna go.

434
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,460
I'm gonna go.

435
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,460
What's wrong?

436
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,460
I can't run anymore.

437
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,460
You're so tired.

438
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,460
Wake up.

439
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,460
Come on.

440
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,460
Don't look at me.

441
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,460
Hurry up.

442
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,460
Go.

443
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,460
Morning.

444
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,460
Yu Le, I'm here.

445
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,460
Come on, have breakfast.

446
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,460
No, no, no.

447
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,460
I've eaten.

448
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,460
Where's our boss?

449
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,460
Boss, he's gone.

450
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,460
Why are you so nervous?

451
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,460
Be a good boy.

452
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,460
You're gonna be a good old classmate.

453
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,460
I'm just kidding.

454
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,460
You're gonna do it again?

455
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,460
You're not good enough.

456
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,460
Interesting?

457
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,460
Interesting.

458
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,460
I'm gonna go.

459
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,460
Okay, I'll play with you.

460
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,460
Do you think it's interesting?

461
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,460
Last time, you told me

462
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,460
that you'll give me the house,

463
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,460
the car, and the money.

464
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,460
You'll also give me the money.

465
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,460
I've figured it out.

466
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,460
I'll transfer the money to you.

467
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,460
I'll give you the house.

468
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,460
Are you satisfied?

469
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,460
We can take care of this house.

470
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,460
I didn't wake up after drinking too much.

471
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,460
Go, go, go.

472
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,460
Don't disturb me.

473
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,460
You're not gonna admit it if you say it yourself?

474
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,460
Are you afraid of me?

475
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,460
You're really a good boy.

476
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,460
Why are you so cute?

477
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,460
Do whatever you want.

478
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,460
Huh?

479
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,260
What's the matter?

480
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:31,260
You oldc 밑fielder.

481
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,260
You taught me that.

482
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,260
I have to be strong.

483
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:42,260
What's wrong? You taught me that I wouldn't care about you.

484
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:46,260
I didn't sleep at all. I could hear you when you were awake.

485
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,260
Look at you.

486
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:52,260
How can I not pour you water?

487
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,260
Slowly.

488
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,260
Slowly.

489
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,260
Okay.

490
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,260
What did you say?

491
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:18,260
This is the first time in my life that I'm so good.

492
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,260
This is what I said.

493
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,260
It seems like I'm not human.

494
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,260
Okay, take a good rest.

495
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,260
If you have anything to say, just call me.

496
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,260
What are you looking for?

497
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,260
Don't worry.

498
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,260
My son is in Beijing.

499
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,260
I'm sorry.

500
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,260
I'm sorry.

501
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,260
I'm sorry.

502
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,260
I know that I'm sorry.

503
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:12,260
But you won't forgive me now.

504
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,260
I'm drunk.

505
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,260
I...

506
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,260
I'm drunk.

507
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,260
I don't know why I'm like this.

508
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,260
I don't know what to do.

509
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,260
I'm so drunk.

510
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,260
I'm sorry.

511
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:40,260
I know that the child is always one of us.

512
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:45,260
Now, it seems that God

513
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,260
has made a decision for us.

514
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,260
We all made a mistake.

515
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,260
This time, it's our fault.

516
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:05,260
I'll protect myself from harm.

517
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,260
I know that now.

518
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,260
I really love you.

519
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,260
I really, really love you.

520
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,260
You don't have to worry about the child.

521
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:35,260
I'll bring Xiao Mi to my face

522
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,260
and then we'll live together in foreign countries.

523
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,260
She'll be your child in the future.

524
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,260
I'll let her call you...

525
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,260
Thank you.

526
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,260
Thank you for everything you've done.

527
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,260
You've cut it off.

528
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,260
You don't even hurt now.

529
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,260
Qian Feng.

530
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:03,260
I love you.

531
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,260
I love you.

532
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,260
I'm here.

533
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,260
I'm doing well.

534
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,260
I love you.

535
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,260
Xiao Mi.

536
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,260
What's wrong with you?

537
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,260
Su Ran.

538
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,260
Did you make me do this again?

539
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:20,260
I was still young when I was born.

540
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:23,260
Why do I become a married woman now?

541
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:28,260
You're a little stubborn, okay?

542
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,260
I'm saving you.

543
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:33,260
You're not a person who's been looking for a job

544
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,260
and is only looking for a job.

545
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,260
You're a husband, okay?

546
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,260
Wait.

547
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,260
I'm going to find Xu Kai Xin.

548
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,260
Yes.

549
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,260
I'm sorry.

550
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,260
Xiao Xiao.

551
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:52,260
You can't let Xu Kai Xin go.

552
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,260
Take this.

553
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,260
It's really a secret.

554
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,260
Let's go.

555
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,260
It's okay, girl.

556
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,260
You're still young.

557
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,260
You'll have a big problem later.

558
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,260
You can find the code of your choice.

559
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,260
I'm going to get married!

560
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:44,260
I haven't eaten yet.

561
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,260
I don't want to go to the sea.

562
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:51,260
I haven't gone to the sea to see the sea.

563
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,260
I'm going to see the sea.

564
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,260
You're a bad person.

565
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:59,260
I'm going to see the sea.

566
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,260
I'm going to see the sea.

567
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,260
I'm going to see the sea.

568
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,260
I'm going to see the sea.

569
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:24,260
This guy is so smart.

570
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:26,260
He didn't kick me out of school.

571
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:32,260
Hello, Cheng Yi.

572
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,260
Secretary Qin.

573
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,260
What's going on?

574
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,260
Is President Lin sick?

575
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,260
Of course he is.

576
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,260
Don't play with me.

577
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,260
President Lin is in a bad mood.

578
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:42,260
I'm always chasing him.

579
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,260
I'm asking you if you're doing well.

580
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,260
Is there any change?

581
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:46,260
Will you be regretted?

582
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:48,260
If you really don't want to,

583
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,260
just let it go.

584
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:50,260
Are you afraid?

585
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:51,260
If you don't think it's appropriate,

586
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,260
we can talk about it.

587
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,260
You're making me laugh.

588
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,260
Help me take it.

589
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,260
I'll try to take it.

590
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:01,260
I'll deal with it in half a month.

591
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,260
I don't want to throw away

592
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:05,260
the prize I should get.

593
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,260
I'm going to see the sea.

594
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:07,260
Who said it's not the way to go?

595
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:14,260
Who said it's not the way to go?

596
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:21,260
Whose story is not fair?

597
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:31,260
How can I be a fool?

598
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:35,260
How many days have passed

599
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,260
and the shadow has passed

600
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:40,260
and the light has gone?

601
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:44,260
How many days have passed

602
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:47,260
and the tears have gone?

603
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:51,260
How many days have passed

604
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:55,260
and the light has gone?

605
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,260
How many days have passed

606
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:01,260
and the light has gone?

607
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:05,260
If you don't have the courage

608
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:09,260
to be a good boy,

609
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,260
I'll be able to do anything

610
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:16,260
and I'll be regretted.

611
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:20,260
Time's time is gone.

612
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:24,260
No one is left.

613
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:29,260
The sky will be filled with half.

614
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:34,260
Half of you.
