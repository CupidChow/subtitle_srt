the

the

00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,080
the

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,080
the

28
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,080
work

29
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:27,000
追求有能量当人站马 站马能量饮料 邀请收看长安的历史

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:37,000
梁元兄 我比现在年轻十岁的时候啊 一心想在长安闯出个名堂暴消朝廷

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
可惜时运不及 头卷也罢 科举也罢 结不能容易

32
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:51,920
直到天保实在还是一时无成 我四十岁那天

33
00:02:51,920 --> 00:03:01,920
朋友邀我去取江行船庆重 船行至一半 岸边突然升起农物

34
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:11,920
我见此情景顿时陷入了绝境 这不岔是我的人生啊

35
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:19,840
已经过半 前途依旧威盲不可见

36
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,840
我下了船 一路失魂落魄

37
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:33,840
我知不觉 我竟走到了成东村民门外一里地的上豪坊

38
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:45,760
你别听这名字啊 它算不得上豪 更不能称为坊 就是一片乱葬崗

39
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:53,760
不 随便挑了个坟头 就躺了下去

40
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:01,760
不知躺了多久 来了一个手坟的老兵

41
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:12,680
那家伙 满面风霜 还瞎了一只眼 老兵就隐居在上豪坊

42
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:19,680
说是要为他被迫杀掉的兄弟少分

43
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:30,680
他有我说 他刚击马背高的时候 就被迫从军去到西域数遍

44
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,600
那是他第一次远离亲人去了战场

45
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,600
他不知道何时会死

46
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:50,600
有一日他在战场上叫一个凶惡的敌人押在身下 眼感悲伤

47
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,600
他发起喊来 用牙

48
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,520
死掉了他的练家肉 若再侥幸犯上

49
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:10,520
只能一战 老兵想明白了 既然身临绝己退无可退

50
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,520
何不向前一步 拼死向朴

51
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,520
心血还能薄出一些威猛的希望

52
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,440
此那日起 他苦練刀术奇术

53
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,440
只要号角响起

54
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,440
他就从高处一重而下 普身把取军棋

55
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,440
就靠着这口不退之棋 败战行存

56
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,440
从西域回到了长安

57
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,440
坐上了万年县不良帅

58
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,360
听到这儿 我深感震动

59
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,360
我想我知静寓 和那老兵相比如何

60
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,360
他能多屁刀在造花上 我为何不行

61
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,360
杜卜

62
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,360
怎么样

63
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,360
你上吧

64
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,360
滚

65
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,360
慢点

66
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,280
滚

67
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,280
先走 追我们

68
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,280
可以吧 阿力

69
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,280
滚

70
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,280
马回来了

71
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,280
马回来了

72
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,280
马回来了

73
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,280
马回来了

74
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,280
马回来了

75
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,280
接马 接马

76
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,280
别老地拿

77
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,280
别老地拿

78
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,280
后面

79
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,280
马在山路上跑死了

80
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,200
马死了

81
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,200
快快快

82
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,200
阿力

83
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,200
快快快

84
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,200
进人 进人

85
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
快进人

86
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,200
进人

87
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,200
救命马都跑废了

88
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,200
一个都站不起来了

89
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,200
谁没人 谁太实

90
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,200
快快快

91
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,200
谢谢阿力

92
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,200
辛苦阿力

93
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,200
现在怎么办

94
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,200
马跑不了

95
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
我们人还能跑

96
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,200
对

97
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,200
我也能跑

98
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,120
大家已经五日没休息了

99
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,120
这附重前行

100
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,120
身体吃不消

101
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,120
李大师

102
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,120
皮尔里我是在山里边

103
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,120
遇货的

104
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,120
我能跑

105
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,120
我也能跑

106
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,120
红卫县哥

107
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,120
你这么认真的官人

108
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,120
这几日你们真是

109
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,120
太不容易了

110
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,120
这样

111
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,120
我自愿出点力

112
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,120
但就是跑不下来全程

113
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,160
我们

114
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,120
干什么

115
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,120
干什么

116
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,120
干什么

117
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,120
干什么

118
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,120
干什么

119
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,120
干什么

120
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,040
干什么

121
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,040
干什么

122
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,040
干什么

123
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,040
干什么

124
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,040
干什么

125
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,040
干什么

126
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,040
干什么

127
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,040
这事跟你们有什么关系

128
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,040
李才

129
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,040
我们要做实验

130
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,240
你们若是把李大师的

131
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,240
问衰岁了

132
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,240
影响了实验结果

133
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,040
那就是影响了

134
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,040
上任吃力吃

135
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,040
你们有几个脑袋

136
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,040
可以掉

137
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,040
不是

138
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,040
你这话说得不对

139
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,040
百姓拔刀相助

140
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,040
这是替圣人分忧

141
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,040
你不知道他们接力

142
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,040
那你能给我麻吗

143
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
对呀

144
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,040
都可以

145
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,960
我们的马可都是在侧的军马

146
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,960
师父循边之则

147
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,960
只能千亿外界

148
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,960
那人人不让用麻麻

149
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,960
你不接人家坏实验吗

150
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,960
这事你问不到我

151
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,960
我只负责服务好你

152
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,960
保障好安全

153
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,960
如今该当我问你

154
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,960
你们这实验还做不做

155
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,960
若是不做

156
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,960
我就解尽小多门

157
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,960
回去交差

158
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,960
不是

159
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,960
你这不是有一名的人吗

160
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,960
怎么有一名的人

161
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,960
怎么有一名的人

162
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,960
防守

163
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,960
防守

164
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,960
何次使说了

165
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,960
朝集会因李大使的试验暂停

166
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,960
为了确保胡商门的利益

167
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,960
胡商商会必须亲自监督

168
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,960
这次试验

169
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,960
我怎么没听说

170
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,960
李大使

171
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,960
何次使说

172
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,960
你连日来人马俱皮

173
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,960
命我前来给你送几批俊马

174
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,960
若是实验失败

175
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,880
可不能因为一句没有马了

176
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,880
就想堂错过去

177
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,880
至于起手吗

178
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,880
你看某等可否胜任

179
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,880
杭守当真

180
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,880
你的起手

181
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,880
连日奔波不止躁

182
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,880
就是抢堵之末

183
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,880
在这么死撑下去

184
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,880
怕是要闹出人命

185
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,880
杭守教训的是

186
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,800
试验继续

187
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,800
好

188
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,800
他这是分明要跟我对着干

189
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,800
你告诉我

190
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,800
是不是那把匕首的事

191
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,800
Amita在心里

192
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,800
还是过不去

193
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,800
何次使误会杭守

194
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,800
了

195
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,720
杭守此次送马

196
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,720
是知那立之已发生相辨

197
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,720
未便只待诞细之间

198
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,720
此次实验注定失败

199
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,720
如此

200
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,720
杭守便以何次使之名

201
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,720
送去的郡马

202
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,720
一来能彰显何次使

203
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,720
气良大度

204
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,720
胸怀圣人之事

205
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,720
二来也能堵住那李善德的嘴

206
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,720
不让他日后有借口

207
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,720
以马屁不俗为由

208
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,720
作为实验失败的借口

209
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,720
可为是一举两得

210
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,720
你去小东门看过

211
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,720
这实验真的撑不下去了

212
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,720
一有遗忘发生未便

213
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,720
不出一日必定全部腐坏流支

214
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,720
你要好

215
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,720
明日我就去趟小东门

216
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,720
也算给李善德

217
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,720
写个幕

218
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,720
劳何次使清陵

219
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,720
是李善德的荣幸

220
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,720
如此

221
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,720
蓝玉便告退了

222
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,720
此事

223
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,720
那个阿弥塔去了之后

224
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,720
跟那个A线豆的小兵

225
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,720
行有不利

226
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,720
实在不好下手

227
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,720
这件事情

228
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,720
残切作霸

229
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,720
阿弥塔现在

230
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,720
已经有了自己的算计了

231
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,720
我也不还你小石头

232
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,720
暂且维系中

233
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,720
可表面上的和平吧

234
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,720
明白

235
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,720
发手机

236
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,720
你为何要来做机场

237
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,720
给你比起力事

238
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,720
杀一圈

239
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,720
我就在这儿遭到了埋伏

240
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,720
你知不知道是什么人

241
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,720
放心

242
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,720
曹善麗是我帮你换来的

243
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,720
我会护你招权

244
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,720
赶紧走

245
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,720
杀

246
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,720
杀

247
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,720
杀

248
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,720
杀

249
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,720
杀

250
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,720
杀

251
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,720
杀

252
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,720
杀

253
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
余大使

254
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,720
压这么大雨

255
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,720
辛苦啊

256
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,720
孙 sr

257
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,720
你看看

258
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,720
你这个微成事业

259
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,720
搞得全城百姓都睡过

260
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,720
按你啊

261
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,720
我们这儿上元节

262
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,720
也没这么热闹过

263
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,720
你看看

264
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,720
这些胡商还有全城的百姓

265
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,720
对你这个测试结果

266
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,720
很奇葩呀

267
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,720
搞得怎么样了

268
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,720
回来了

269
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,720
回来了

270
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,720
回来了

271
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,720
回来了

272
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,720
回来了

273
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,720
杀

274
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,720
过

275
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,720
过

276
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,720
快去

277
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,720
谢谢啊

278
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,720
余大使

279
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,720
你看看

280
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,720
我多支持你的工作

281
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,720
连我一女都给你做提手了

282
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
这是全家出动啊

283
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,720
小心小心

284
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,720
走走走

285
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,720
皮肤

286
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,720
我也是为了保证商会的利益

287
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,720
他过来監督这次实验

288
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,720
还是你想着周到

289
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,720
看看

290
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,720
余大使

291
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,720
别让他跟我流汁了

292
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,720
这

293
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,720
检查看看

294
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,720
这这这

295
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,720
四雪啊

296
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,720
流汁了

297
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,720
这怎么给圣人和贵妃吃了这个

298
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,720
你没看清楚

299
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,720
这栗枝不是一棵树上采下来的

300
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,720
成熟度不一样

301
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,720
你运的时候还得考虑

302
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,720
透气跟颠簸

303
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,720
每一棵情况都不一样了

304
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,720
余 Shande

305
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,720
你怎么流汁了

306
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,720
流汁了吗

307
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,720
这也流汁了

308
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,720
哎呀 这上衣了

309
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,720
这可是完蛋了

310
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,720
假梦呢

311
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,720
假梦 假梦拿来

312
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,720
假梦 假梦

313
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,720
这假梦在这

314
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,720
好的

315
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,720
好的

316
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,720
好的 好的 好的

317
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,720
这假梦好的

318
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,720
这假梦好的

319
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,720
四眼继续

320
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,720
四眼继续

321
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,720
好的 好的

322
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,720
Go!

323
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,720
Go, Sun Yang!

324
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,720
Go!

325
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,720
Go!

326
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,720
Sun Yang!

327
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,720
Go!

328
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,720
Go!

329
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,720
Go!

330
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,720
Go!

331
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,720
Go!

332
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,720
Go!

333
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,720
Go!

334
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,720
Is it not hard to drink sugar? Drink it right away.

335
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,720
It will absorb the milk of sugar-free milk.

336
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,720
I want you to keep it up.

337
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,720
Didn't you tell me that the experiment failed?

338
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
How could it have been so good?

339
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,720
And this dream...

340
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,720
It's now.

341
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,720
It's almost finished. Why isn't it ending?

342
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,720
Mom is back!

343
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,720
Mom is back!

344
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,720
Mom is back!

345
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,720
The road is broken.

346
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,720
It's broken.

347
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,720
Li Da Xian, the road is broken.

348
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,720
The road is broken.

349
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,720
What? The road is broken?

350
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,720
Are you all right?

351
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,720
Hurry up, get down.

352
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,720
Where is the road broken?

353
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,720
It's in the front.

354
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,720
Don't fall.

355
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,720
Hurry up.

356
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,720
Hurry up.

357
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,720
Come on, get down.

358
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,720
Li Da Xian, Li Xian is fine.

359
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,720
It's all right.

360
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,720
Li Xian is fine.

361
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,720
Li Xian is fine.

362
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,720
Li Xian is fine.

363
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,720
Li Xian is fine.

364
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,720
Li Xian is fine.

365
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,720
Here.

366
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,720
We are on two separate roads.

367
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,720
Two people,

368
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,720
Brother Yuan,

369
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,720
you go down the road.

370
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,720
You go down the mountain.

371
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,720
Li!

372
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,720
Li!

373
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,720
Li, come here.

374
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,720
You go down the mountain.

375
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,720
You go to the double-tank.

376
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,720
You go to the street.

377
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,720
You go.

378
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,720
Hang Shou, you go down the mountain.

379
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,720
You go to the double-tank.

380
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,720
You go to the transport.

381
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,720
Okay?

382
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,720
Okay.

383
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,720
You, you,

384
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,720
you take people to the road.

385
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,720
Okay.

386
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,720
Don't let the experience be dangerous.

387
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,720
Come on, take action.

388
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,720
Take action.

389
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,720
No, no, no.

390
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,720
Come on, come on.

391
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,720
Help.

392
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,720
Come on.

393
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,720
Come on.

394
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,720
Come on.

395
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,720
Come on.

396
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,720
Come on.

397
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,720
Come on.

398
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,720
Come on.

399
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,720
Come on.

400
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,720
Come on.

401
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,720
Come on.

402
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,720
Come on.

403
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,720
Come on.

404
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,720
Come on.

405
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,720
Come on.

406
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,540
It's enough

407
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,300
One more

408
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,300
You can do it

409
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,180
Student, please let me go first.

410
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,500
Is the spinning wheel yours?

411
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,900
Are you sure you aren't重?

412
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,260
Everyone be careful.

413
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,060
No wheelie you will reupload this point

00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,340

00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,480

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,240
I can't do this !

420
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,060
It's time to kill !

421
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,140
It's gearbox !

422
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,720
Go!

423
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,720
Go!

424
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,720
Go!

425
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,720
Are you okay?

426
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,720
Go!

427
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,720
Go!

428
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,720
Go!

429
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,720
Go!

430
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,720
Go!

431
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,720
Go!

432
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,720
Go!

433
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,720
Go!

434
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,720
Go!

435
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,720
Go!

436
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,720
Go!

437
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,720
Lian Er Chu!

438
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,720
Go!

439
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,720
Get the horse!

440
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,720
Hurry up!

441
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,720
Get the horse!

442
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,720
Hurry up!

443
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,720
Hurry up!

444
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,720
Hurry up!

445
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,720
Hurry up!

446
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,720
Let's see what it looks like!

447
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,720
Hurry up!

448
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,720
Get the horse!

449
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,720
The horse!

450
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,720
The horse!

451
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,720
Hurry up!

452
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,720
The horse!

453
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,720
The horse!

454
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,720
Master!

455
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,720
Is this the end?

456
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,720
If it's over,

457
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,720
then let's go!

458
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,720
Let's go!

459
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,720
Let's go!

460
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,720
Master Li,

461
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,720
the test is really over.

462
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,720
Master Li.

463
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,720
Master Li.

464
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,720
These days,

465
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,720
everyone is...

466
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,720
Master Li!

467
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,720
Master Li!

468
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,720
Master Li!

469
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,720
Master Li!

470
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,720
Master Li!

471
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,720
Master Li!

472
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,720
Master Li!

473
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,720
Master Li!

474
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,720
The horse!

475
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,720
What's the matter?

476
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,720
You're awake.

477
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,720
Master, you have to go.

478
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,720
I'm getting old.

479
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,720
Shan Duo.

480
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,720
It's okay.

481
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,720
I'm busy.

482
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,720
I'm getting old.

483
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,720
I'm getting old.

484
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,720
I'm getting old.

485
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,720
Don't take it off.

486
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,720
Don't take it off.

487
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,720
I'm getting old.

488
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,720
I'm getting old.

489
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,720
Master Li, my medical staff is fine.

490
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,720
They're still fresh.

491
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,720
I'm getting old.

492
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,720
But our zookeeper has a secret recipe.

493
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,720
You can make it longer.

494
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,720
What recipe?

495
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,720
Don't take it off.

496
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,120
You're all here!

497
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,840
Oh my goodness!

498
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:13,920
Welcome back to my home!

499
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:23,240
During the previous court rally there was a cease-net to the old trees project.

500
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:26,440
We ليLe have finished rehearsing talked about the new forest.

501
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,240
I believe you have also decided on the project of the old man.

502
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,920
I hope you will take the lead and vote for him.

503
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:37,440
Do you want to continue the business of Li Zhi?

504
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:43,040
Hangshou, Li Dashi only did one experiment.

505
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,720
Do you want to give him a chance to change the food?

506
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,320
The Zanting Court has given this project a chance.

507
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,960
The two measures that Li Dashi's brain is thinking about

508
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,600
still can't make Li Zhi go to Chang'an.

509
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,000
Hangshou! Hangshou, Li Shande!

510
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,120
Li Shande is here.

511
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,400
Man Yu, please come in, Li Dashi.

512
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,960
Yes.

513
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,600
Li Dashi, please.

514
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:22,320
Hangshou, your rose, I will live.

515
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,160
I have made my promise.

516
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,120
You came here to deliver flowers for me?

517
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,640
No, I mean...

518
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:36,760
this rose can be stored in the pot.

519
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,160
What about Li Zhi?

520
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,320
Right, Li Zhi can do that too.

521
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,760
Look, the one in this pot is Li Zhi.

522
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:52,560
A child planted this rose in the soil

523
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,960
and has been living in it for a long time.

524
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,040
Although the rose is bitter,

525
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,600
the fruit is the same as the rose.

526
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,440
With this method, Li Zhi can keep on living for five to six days.

527
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,680
Li Dashi, we have witnessed your failure in the experiment.

528
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:10,240
You suddenly moved out of the pot and Li Zhi said he could take out time.

529
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,120
Who can believe what you said?

530
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,960
Li Zhi was cut off from the tree before the experiment.

531
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,160
Li Zhi has been in the soil for the past few days.

532
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,360
If you don't believe me, you can go to the small door and ask.

533
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,440
You can all make a statement.

534
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,560
Even if it's true,

535
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:27,240
the rose is not easy to survive in the soil.

536
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:30,640
If you keep on living in the pot, you will be in a terrible state.

537
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,080
No, no.

538
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,160
Everyone, this rose is not easy to survive in the soil.

539
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,560
But we can find a good rose, right?

540
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,360
We can find a good one, right?

541
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,240
We can find a good one.

542
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,720
We can only put these roses in the pot and keep them in the pot.

543
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,600
This fruit can grow in the soil in the plant.

544
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,240
When this plant is in the soil, it will cry.

545
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,960
This fruit is still fresh.

546
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,240
Look, look, the water.

547
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,440
Look.

548
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:03,800
So, how long can the rose last?

549
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,640
I call this the branch-to-tree method.

550
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:11,200
With the previous method of water-wetting,

551
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,600
Li Zhi can reach eleven days.

552
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,040
Eleven days.

553
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,240
Eleven days.

554
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,000
So, how many days do you need to plan for the long-term?

555
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,040
The route according to my plan is just eleven days.

556
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,600
Look at the plan I designed.

557
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,360
Let's spread it out.

558
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,840
Spread it out.

559
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,120
Come.

560
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,480
The route is eleven days.

561
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,480
The princess and the princess can soon eat fresh lizi.

562
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,720
It's already in your mouth.

563
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,320
You're amazing, sister.

564
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,640
You're the one who's been picked up.

565
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,720
The one who's been picked up.

566
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,240
Wait.

567
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,320
This is not right.

568
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,840
That's not right.

569
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,880
In the plan of Li's master,

570
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,960
the transfer team will enter the Xunyang,

571
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,920
and pass through the Qichun River.

572
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,680
It's indeed a perfect route.

573
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,720
But the Xunyang was suddenly flooded.

574
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,160
It was closed.

575
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,400
When will it be finished?

576
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:27,960
I don't know.

577
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,440
It's impossible.

578
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,560
Xunyang was flooded?

579
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,120
You're crazy.

580
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,120
Don't listen to me.

581
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,520
Xunyang was flooded?

582
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,080
I hate you.

583
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,840
I never want to get in.

584
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,640
I heard that

585
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,800
the Xunyang line and the Jiangzhou line

586
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,200
were flooded.

587
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,080
Master Li,

588
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,360
if there's a flood,

589
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,440
do you have any other routes?

590
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,760
The Xunyang is the fastest route.

591
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,520
If there's a flood,

592
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,360
there's a way out.

593
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,560
There's a lot of way out.

594
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,600
That means,

595
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:36,440
you need at least three days now.

596
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,680
Lord Li.

597
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,800
I ferred you to the city.

598
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,240
There was no trick to trick us.

599
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,320
But according to your plan of the transfer,

600
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,760
we still have pure plain所以.

601
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,080
Looks beautiful.

602
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,640
Tinker with such a person.

603
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,040
You don't look very good.

604
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,320
Don't sleep.

605
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,320
You're not the one who lost money.

606
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,320
You're the one who lost money.

607
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,320
You're the one who lost money.

608
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,320
You're the one who lost money.

609
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,320
You're the one who lost money.

610
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,320
You're the one who lost money.

611
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:19,320
We're also businessmen, right?

612
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,320
Who's the one who made the money?

613
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,320
You.

614
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,320
He can't reach it in terms of technology.

615
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,320
Why do we still have to keep our heads up?

616
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,320
We lost our money to the ocean.

617
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,320
Look at you sitting there.

618
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,320
Do you have your words?

619
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,320
Master Li, is there another possibility?

620
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,320
There is a possibility.

621
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,320
There is a possibility!

622
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,320
I-I think about it.

623
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,320
I think about it.

624
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,320
I think about it.

625
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,320
We went to the north

626
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,320
after we left for the south.

627
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,320
The most difficult road to the north

628
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,320
is the one that passed through Wuling.

629
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,320
It took a lot of time to get here.

630
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,320
If we could find a new road here,

631
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,320
we could save two days.

632
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,320
We could save two days.

633
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,320
You're right.

634
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,320
It's not easy.

635
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,320
So many customers left for so many years.

636
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,320
If there was a better road,

637
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,320
we would have been found.

638
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,320
You didn't try it. How did you know?

639
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,320
We have to try it.

640
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,320
When I was in Chang'an,

641
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,320
I took this job.

642
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,320
It was a dead job.

643
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,320
Right?

644
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,320
I said,

645
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,320
I couldn't get here in three days.

646
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,320
How did it go?

647
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,320
I went to the south.

648
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,320
I found a way.

649
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,320
I found another way.

650
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,320
I took another way.

651
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,320
Every time, I thought it was impossible.

652
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,320
Every time, I thought it was possible.

653
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,320
I took another step.

654
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,320
Master Li said

655
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,320
it was all from my own eyes.

656
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,320
Master Li,

657
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,320
you're a good talker.

658
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,320
You never talk.

659
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,320
You never lie.

660
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,320
You never lie.

661
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,320
So,

662
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,320
he took the situation out of the box.

663
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,320
He didn't know

664
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,320
that Li Zhi was a good doctor.

665
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,320
But he still has a lot of children.

666
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,320
Master,

667
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,320
you're a good person.

668
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,320
I'd rather believe you.

669
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,320
Master,

670
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,320
he will have a better way

671
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,320
to find the only one.

672
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,320
He will be a good doctor.

673
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,320
Master,

674
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,320
I'll give you all my life.

675
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,320
I'll give you all my life.

676
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:35,320
I'll give you all my life.

677
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,320
Everyone,

678
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,320
everyone,

679
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,320
I want to send this job to Master Li.

680
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,320
It's just that I trust Master Li.

681
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,320
We're all businessmen.

682
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,320
Businessmen are in charge.

683
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,320
The owners are in charge.

684
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,320
We invest this money

685
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,320
not for a business,

686
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,320
but for the people who run this business.

687
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,320
I'm done talking.

688
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,320
I'm just a small order

689
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,320
from the nine-point-point-point.

690
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,320
The monthly salary

691
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,320
is ten yuan per month.

692
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,320
The monthly salary is

693
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,320
about ten yuan.

694
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,320
The monthly salary is about ten yuan.

695
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,320
The monthly salary is about ten yuan.

696
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,320
But Master Su

697
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,320
gave me such a big sum today.

698
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,320
It's a big number

699
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,320
to me.

700
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,320
I can take this sum

701
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,320
and return to Chang'an.

702
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,320
I'll let my daughter

703
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,320
grow up in peace.

704
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,320
I can have a horse horse.

705
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,320
But I'll take this sum

706
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,320
and do my experiments.

707
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,320
I actually want to live.

708
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,320
Of course,

709
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,320
my life is not important to you.

710
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,320
But I want to tell you

711
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,320
what I want to say.

712
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,320
I want to live.

713
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,320
Master.

714
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,320
I want to live with my life.

715
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,320
I want to make my life

716
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,320
a business.

717
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,320
So,

718
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,320
I won't let you down.

719
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,320
I won't let you down.

720
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,320
I've said so much.

721
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,320
I believe that

722
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,320
you all have a answer.

723
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,320
Vote for me.

724
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:57,320
I want to be a good husband.

725
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,320
How can I change my name?

726
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,320
Let's call it a big fortune.

727
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,320
The sales will be open.

728
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,320
Can you start

729
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,320
the whole auction?

730
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,320
I can't.

731
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,320
I can't.

732
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,320
Can you change the red

733
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,320
of the red wine?

734
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,320
Thank you.

735
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,320
Thank you.

736
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,320
And the horses.

737
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,320
Horse horses.

738
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,320
Horse horses.

739
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,320
I'm done with this.

740
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,320
If you can do this,

741
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,320
can I be a good husband?

742
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,320
Ma Gui is like

743
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,320
a peacock in the sky.

744
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,320
When you find a girl

745
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,320
who is young and beautiful,

746
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,320
you'll be the same as her.

747
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,320
Take her away.

748
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,320
I'll take care of Li Zhishu.

749
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,320
If you come to the dormitory,

750
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,320
you'll be eaten by the bandits

751
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,320
at Chang'an.

752
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,320
You'll be eaten?

753
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,320
Yes.

754
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,320
Because you're a good husband.

755
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,320
You can see

756
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:52,320
the red wine

757
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,320
that the red wine

758
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,320
is so good.

759
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,320
Finally, you're eaten.

760
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,320
You're eaten.

761
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,320
You're eaten.

762
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,320
I'm scared.

763
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,320
I won't

764
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,320
go to a place

765
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,320
that's not far from here.

766
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,320
Let's make up the plan.

767
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,320
Do you want it?

768
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,320
Yes.

769
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,320
Ma Gui, Li Zhishu.

770
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,320
This wine is so sweet.

771
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,320
I'm going to

772
