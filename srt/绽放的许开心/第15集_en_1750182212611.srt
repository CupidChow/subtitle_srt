Auntie Business

8
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,560
There are a lot of employees so far.

00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,760
Everyday

10
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:05,900

00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,560
You,

14
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,200
Leave it to your uncle to 24

15
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,060
lost

16
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:18,320
Then your uncle will come back and take you there.

17
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,320
Come.

18
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,860
Then when will uncle come back?

19
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:27,680
In three or five days. He will probably come back.

20
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,160
My uncle will come back.

21
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,400
How can he not come back?

22
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,900
He's a living and growing up like you.

23
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,560
This is his family name.

24
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,940
If he can't come back.

25
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,940
I'm sorry.

26
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,940
If you can't come back...

27
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,940
I'm hurt.

28
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,940
Are you okay?

29
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,940
I'm so sorry for what I did.

30
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,940
I didn't put too much salt.

31
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,940
I put a lot of vinegar.

32
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,940
Auntie,

33
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,940
I didn't mean to eat too slowly.

34
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,940
It's just that it's not good.

35
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,940
I think you should learn to lose your head.

36
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:14,940
I know how to lose.

37
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,940
I mean, I can lose my head.

38
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,940
Auntie, slow down.

39
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,940
Slow down.

40
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,940
Hurry up and go.

41
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:20,940
I have a lot of work to do

42
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,940
except for the job.

43
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,940
It's too late.

44
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,940
It's too late to help me lose my head.

45
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,940
I'm not going to let myself do it.

46
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,940
I'm not good at making mistakes.

47
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,940
I'm still worried when I'm late.

48
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,940
Do you think you should have a start?

49
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,940
Auntie, you're leaving soon.

50
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,940
What's the matter?

51
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,940
Do you have to learn to clean the floor?

52
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,940
To wash clothes and cook?

53
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,940
You hurt me.

54
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,940
I can go up by myself.

55
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,940
You can do it yourself.

56
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,940
I'm the one who's the best.

57
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,940
Didn't you say you had to leave early?

58
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,940
Aren't you going to be late?

59
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,940
Go.

60
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,940
Go.

61
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,940
Did you see a girl so tall?

62
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,940
Come here.

63
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,940
Did you see a girl so tall?

64
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,940
You left alone.

65
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,940
Did you lose your head?

66
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,940
Come here.

67
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,940
Shou.

68
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,940
Shou.

69
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,940
What's wrong with you?

70
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,940
What's wrong?

71
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,940
What's wrong?

72
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,940
What's wrong?

73
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,940
Did you see a girl so tall?

74
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,940
No.

75
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,940
Did you lose your head?

76
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:29,940
No.

77
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,940
You're acting.

78
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:31,940
She didn't see it.

79
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:32,940
You're acting.

80
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,940
You're acting.

81
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,940
Shou.

82
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:36,940
Shou.

83
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,940
Shou.

84
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:45,940
You scared me.

85
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,940
You ran away.

86
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,940
You scared me.

87
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,940
I thought you were taken away.

88
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,940
I was looking for you.

89
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,940
You scared me.

90
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,940
Auntie.

91
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,940
I thought you'd leave

92
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,940
on the way.

93
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,940
Chang'an is left alone.

94
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:07,940
Otherwise, I feel lonely.

95
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,940
I just want to come to my house.

96
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,940
Do you need to stay with me?

97
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,940
Auntie.

98
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,940
You won't blame me, right?

99
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,940
I won't blame you.

100
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,940
I won't blame you.

101
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,940
Why?

102
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,940
Auntie.

103
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,940
She went out again.

104
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,940
She had a job.

105
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,940
She came back after a job.

106
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,940
Shou is a child now.

107
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,940
Can you take care of yourself?

108
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,940
Yes.

109
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,940
Shou is a child now.

110
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,940
He can take care of himself.

111
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,940
Can I come to see him again?

112
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,940
It's hard.

113
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,940
You want to come to him.

114
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,940
This is your house, right?

115
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,940
If you want to come,

116
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,940
I'll take you to my house.

117
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,940
This is your father and mother.

118
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,940
You left this house.

119
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,940
Look.

120
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,940
This is your mother's house.

121
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,940
She likes it the most.

122
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,940
How long will Auntie stay with you?

123
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,940
The house is open.

124
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,940
She'll come back.

125
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,940
That's great.

126
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,940
I'll teach her every day.

127
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,940
Let her go early.

128
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,940
Shou is coming.

129
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,940
Go.

130
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,940
Go.

131
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,940
Uncle Zhao.

132
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,940
Is Brother Lan crazy?

133
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,940
I told him to make a mess.

134
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,940
I didn't tell him to open the festival.

135
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,940
Didn't you make the arrangements?

136
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,940
What should we do?

137
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,940
He's crying.

138
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,940
He just got up.

139
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,940
He has to do something.

140
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,940
I'll show him to Li Shande.

141
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,940
Go.

142
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,940
Master Su is here to attend the court.

143
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,940
He's making money.

144
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,940
I only brought two ears today.

145
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,940
My friend, Lan Teng Du Xi.

146
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:13,940
Master Su.

147
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,940
You're in charge of the record today.

148
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,940
It's the same as in the past.

149
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:17,940
As long as it's useful,

150
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,940
I'll remember it one by one.

151
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,940
Everyone.

152
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,940
The行手 is here.

153
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,940
It's polite.

154
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,940
It's polite.

155
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,940
Everyone, please sit down.

156
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,940
Everyone, you've worked hard.

157
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,940
I came to get a cup of water.

158
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,940
I don't know if it's convenient.

159
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,940
Brother Hu Yun,

160
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,940
we're going to hold the court today.

161
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,940
I don't know why you're here.

162
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,940
The business is good.

163
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,940
The country is rich.

164
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,940
It's what you think.

165
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,940
I came here

166
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,940
to learn.

167
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,940
If you say that

168
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,940
you can have a business with the Tang people,

169
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,940
and you can work hard,

170
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,940
it's not a good thing.

171
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,940
I'm not going to get a cup of water.

172
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,940
I'll just have a cup of water.

173
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,940
If that's the case,

174
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,940
please sit down.

175
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,940
Everyone, the businessmen,

176
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,940
the top of the top is our important business.

177
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,940
Last year,

178
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,940
we opened a new business.

179
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,940
The profit has increased by two percent

180
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,940
in the past year.

181
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,940
Especially the new-growing businessmen,

182
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,940
with the personal skill

183
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,940
to exchange the products of the Western foot,

184
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,940
and the materials.

185
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,940
At the same time,

186
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,940
we've made a three-year profit.

187
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,940
What else is new

188
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,940
and good for you today?

189
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,940
Take it out and share it.

190
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,940
Old rule.

191
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,940
Who makes the profit,

192
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,940
who is the owner,

193
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,940
and who makes the profit,

194
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,940
they will pay together.

195
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,940
Great.

196
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,940
Why are you still making the profit?

197
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,940
Why are you still making the profit?

198
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,940
This is the habit of the Chao.

199
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,940
Everyone has two pieces of beef.

200
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,940
It doesn't look different.

201
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,940
It's just a piece of empty,

202
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:50,940
a piece of heart.

203
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,940
Only the person who holds it knows.

204
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,940
Heart represents consent,

205
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,940
heart represents disagreement.

206
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,940
And then,

207
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,940
we put the beef in the box

208
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,940
that represents our own hospital.

209
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,940
The first one will be put in the second box.

210
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,940
I see.

211
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,940
So,

212
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:06,940
we don't know who is the same,

213
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,940
who is different.

214
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,940
What do you mean?

215
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:10,940
Well,

216
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,940
this is our business.

217
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:14,940
The beef is all separated.

218
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,940
The Chao will start now.

219
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,940
Chao.

220
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,940
Chao.

221
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,940
Chao.

222
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,940
Chao.

223
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,940
Chao.

224
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,940
Air.

225
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,940
Air.

226
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,940
Hangshou.

227
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,940
Wei Tongguo.

228
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,940
I've been sitting here for a long time.

229
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,940
All the business is in a mess.

230
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:09,940
I'm sorry.

231
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,940
I'm sorry.

232
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,940
I'm sorry.

233
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,940
I'm sorry.

234
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,940
I'm sorry.

235
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,940
I'm sorry.

236
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,940
I'm sorry.

237
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,940
I'm sorry.

238
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:19,940
I'm sorry.

239
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,940
I've been wrong.

240
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,940
You gave us so many advantages.

241
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,940
We've done everything we can.

242
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,940
What will we do next?

243
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,940
You know this.

244
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,940
You will be worried.

245
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,940
Actually,

246
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,940
the good business has always been there.

247
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,940
We've been waiting for the meeting to be discovered.

248
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,940
We've been trying to make it happen.

249
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,940
I have an idea.

250
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,940
We had a big trend last year.

251
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,940
We're expanding our strategy this year.

252
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,940
Now,

253
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,940
the tea industry in Tang is becoming

254
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,940
a big deal.

255
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,940
So we can move back to the country

256
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,940
more efficiently,

257
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:55,940
take a break,

258
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,940
and think.

259
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,940
We'll make the whole business big.

260
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,940
We'll make profits and create new high.

261
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,940
Okay.

262
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,940
Create new high.

263
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,940
It sounds like a good business.

264
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:08,940
Let's not be afraid.

265
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,940
Let's not be afraid.

266
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,940
Last year,

267
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:14,940
Amita Hangshou

268
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,940
hosted a big deal.

269
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,940
We didn't see it.

270
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,940
If it wasn't for Hangshou,

271
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,940
the target would be a good one.

272
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,940
How could there be

273
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,940
a profit increase?

274
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,940
Since Hangshou

275
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,940
has seen it,

276
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,940
we'll

277
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,940
be the same.

278
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:36,940
Faqi.

279
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,940
Faqi.

280
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,940
Use your calculations

281
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,940
to calculate a good sum.

282
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:49,940
Let me ask you.

283
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,940
In the past,

284
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,940
when you were alone on horseback,

285
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,940
and you were on the sea,

286
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,940
how much profit did you earn?

287
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,940
Hangshou is a good place to look.

288
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:01,940
It's good.

289
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,940
The business is getting bigger and bigger.

290
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,940
But,

291
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,940
the real money in your pocket

292
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,940
is much more.

293
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,940
Or less?

294
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:17,940
You said

295
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,940
the more business you have,

296
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,940
the less money you have to pay.

297
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,940
I guess you meant it.

298
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,940
I think you're a bad guy.

299
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,940
You're a good guy.

300
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,940
You're too good.

301
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,940
Ma Langjun.

302
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,940
You're so kind.

303
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,940
What's the benefit?

304
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,940
You haven't been through anything.

305
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,940
How could you break the bridge?

306
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,940
I don't know.

307
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:52,940
This year,

308
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,940
the sea is getting bigger

309
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,940
and bigger.

310
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,940
The boat is getting bigger and bigger.

311
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:58,940
Under the influence of the milk,

312
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,940
the merchants

313
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,940
have to pay their own money

314
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,940
to bridge the bridge

315
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,940
and ship it.

316
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,940
Ma Langjun.

317
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,940
Your name is

318
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,940
the reason you're here.

319
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,940
Enough.

320
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,940
You should have changed your business

321
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,940
from then on.

322
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,940
Ma Langjun.

323
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,940
You're not happy, right?

324
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,940
I provided the business

325
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,940
that you didn't pay.

326
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,940
You're a good guy.

327
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,940
You're a good guy.

328
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,940
You're a good guy.

329
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:33,940
You're a good guy.

330
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,940
Do you want to

331
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:37,940
share your profits

332
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,940
with us?

333
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,940
Of course.

334
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:43,940
I know.

335
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,940
Now,

336
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,940
the master Li Zhi

337
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,940
is doing a business

338
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:48,940
in the east gate.

339
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,940
If you help each other

340
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:51,940
here,

341
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,940
Li Yun

342
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,940
will be in the third floor.

343
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,940
Besides,

344
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,940
Li Zhi is a commoner.

345
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,940
He's a good guy.

346
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,940
He's a good guy.

347
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,940
Li Zhi is a commoner.

348
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,940
Don't worry, everyone.

349
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:05,940
The money will be

350
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,940
spent on the business.

351
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,940
Master Su.

352
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,940
Once you're

353
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,940
registered in the court,

354
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,940
you'll never be able to take it back.

355
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,940
Don't worry.

356
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,940
The reputation is on the line.

357
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,940
I won't let you down.

358
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,940
Please.

359
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:23,940
Remember.

360
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,940
You're a good guy.

361
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,940
You can

362
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,940
make a living.

363
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,940
Master Su.

364
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,940
Why did you help Li Zhi?

365
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,940
I want to help

366
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,940
not only Li Zhi.

367
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,940
I want to help

368
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,940
everyone else.

369
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:46,940
Ma Langjun.

370
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,940
If Li Zhi

371
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:49,940
is in Chang'an,

372
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,940
what will he say

373
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,940
after he eats?

374
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,940
If he eats

375
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,940
Li Zhi,

376
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,940
he'll say

377
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,940
it's delicious.

378
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,940
He still wants to eat.

379
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,940
Is there more?

380
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,940
Yes.

381
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,940
Since Noble Consort wants to eat,

382
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,940
we still have to

383
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,940
get pregnant, right?

384
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,940
We have to get pregnant every year.

385
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,940
Li Zhi in the highland

386
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,940
should be successful.

387
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,940
We have to get pregnant every year.

388
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,940
Think about it.

389
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,940
What kind of business is this?

390
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,940
It's a business

391
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,940
that's still going on.

392
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,940
Master Su,

393
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,940
you're so kind.

394
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,940
You're so kind.

395
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,940
Even if we

396
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,940
get pregnant,

397
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,940
it's still a problem for His Majesty.

398
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,940
Ma Langjun, you're over the top.

399
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,940
As long as Hu Shang

400
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,940
has money,

401
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,940
once Li Zhi is successful,

402
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,940
the saint will ask about it.

403
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,940
As long as

404
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,940
Li Zhi is a great man,

405
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,940
Hu Shang will be successful.

406
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,940
You're so kind.

407
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,940
Do you still worry

408
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,940
that the chance to get pregnant

409
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,940
will be in someone else's hands?

410
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:04,940
At that time,

411
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,940
Li Zhi will be successful.

412
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,940
Ma Ping and Diao Pei

413
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,940
will all be with Hu Shang.

414
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,940
Maybe the battle of Yan Tu

415
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,940
will also be with Hu Shang.

416
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,940
It's a great deal.

417
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,940
There won't be such a good business in the world.

418
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,940
I think Master Su is right.

419
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,940
He's really a good businessman.

420
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,940
He's a hero.

421
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,940
Since you're so good,

422
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,940
why don't you do it yourself?

423
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,940
Before this,

424
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,940
someone once asked me the same thing.

425
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,940
The reason for the injury

426
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,940
is that Hu Shang is trying to protect Li Zhi.

427
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,940
He's trying to protect Li Zhi.

428
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,940
Master Su,

429
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,940
it's just that

430
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,940
according to the rules of the court,

431
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,940
the chance to make money

432
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,940
is shared with everyone.

433
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,940
Since the law is in a new age,

434
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,940
I will not force it.

435
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,940
I will fight back.

436
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,940
Master Su is an old man.

437
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,940
He has already seen

438
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,940
the other obstacles.

439
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,940
In the end,

440
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,940
the premise of this project

441
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,940
is that Li Zhi can get pregnant in Chang'an in time.

442
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,940
The sales of other people

443
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,940
are just small and small.

444
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,940
But this is completely in the capital.

445
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:34,940
The profit is as bad as the sky.

446
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,940
If we can't make it,

447
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,940
then all the investment in the future

448
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,940
will be in the water.

449
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,940
Hang said it's good.

450
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,940
There will be risks.

451
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,940
It's for the sake of the risk of the return.

452
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,940
You must be hard-working.

453
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,940
You must be hard-working.

454
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,940
You must not be hard-working.

455
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,940
You must be hard-working.

456
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,940
If you can be patient

457
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,940
and wait for a few more days,

458
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,940
and wait for the results of Li Zhi's experiment,

459
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,940
then it's even more difficult.

460
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,940
Why do I have to listen to this?

461
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,940
The court will not continue.

462
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,940
Is this not possible?

463
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,940
I haven't finished yet.

464
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,940
After several attempts,

465
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,940
Li Zhi has already made

466
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,940
the deadline for Li Zhi's pregnancy

467
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,940
to be 7 days.

468
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,940
This is what I personally saw.

469
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,940
The experiment that the East Gate is doing

470
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,940
is to make the time

471
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,940
for the transfer of the route

472
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,940
as soon as the experiment is successful.

473
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,940
Then Li Zhi's new pregnancy

474
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,940
will not be able to be born as a man.

475
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,940
What do you think?

476
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,940
Let me say a few words.

477
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,940
The pregnancy test

478
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,940
is sent to the right.

479
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,940
It can get your support

480
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,940
and increase the number of patients.

481
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,940
I'm also doing a test here.

482
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,940
After the experiment,

483
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,940
I will never let you down

484
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,940
and make you laugh.

485
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,940
Hang Shou is right.

486
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,940
After all, it's the investment of the real money.

487
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,940
Everyone is cautious

488
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,940
and careful.

489
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,940
It's also a good thing.

490
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,940
Since we have a court meeting,

491
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,940
it's for making money

492
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,940
and finding a good project.

493
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,940
Then there will be a peace of mind

494
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,940
in a short time.

495
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,940
It's not a matter of good food

496
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:54,940
or food.

497
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,940
It's not a matter of food.

498
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,940
If that's the case,

499
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,940
let's make a decision.

500
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,940
Is the court meeting delayed?

501
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,940
It's so troublesome.

502
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,940
If you agree,

503
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:16,940
then take a photo.

504
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,940
If you don't agree,

505
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,940
then take a photo.

506
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,940
Agree.

507
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,940
Agree.

508
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,940
Agree.

509
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,940
Since everyone wants to

510
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,940
make this wonderful meeting take a while,

511
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,940
then the court meeting

512
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:49,940
will be delayed for a few days.

513
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,940
After the trial of Master Li,

514
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,940
we will take care of it.

515
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,940
Let's go.

516
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,940
Let's go.

517
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,940
Let's go.

518
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,940
Master Li,

519
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,940
can you change the plate?

520
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,940
If you want to eat the lychee,

521
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,940
there are many dishes in the bowl.

522
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,940
The headman won't let me eat it.

523
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:52,940
How about this?

524
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,940
Take a jar,

525
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,940
put the lychee in the jar,

526
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,940
and then

527
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,940
put the fruit in it.

528
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,940
It's a little bit of a waste.

529
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,940
It's a little bit of a waste.

530
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,940
It's a little bit of a waste.

531
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,940
It's a little bit of a waste.

532
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,940
Put the fruit in it.

533
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,940
It'll be cooked in a day.

534
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,940
Remember, don't open the door too much.

535
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,940
This is my secret.

536
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,940
He knows.

537
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,940
He's not a good person.

538
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,940
I'll tell you.

539
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,940
Brother Li,

540
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,940
why are you back?

541
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,940
I saw you at the test room.

542
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:28,940
That's right.

543
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:31,940
I've been waiting for you in the Douji room.

544
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,940
Thank you, Brother Lan.

545
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,940
Thank you.

546
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,940
Come on, come on.

547
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:36,940
I'll take care of you.

548
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,940
Okay, don't be busy.

549
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:39,940
Okay.

550
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,940
I'll be back.

551
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,940
I'll be back.

552
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,940
I'll be back.

553
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,940
I'll be back.

554
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,940
I'll be back.

555
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,940
Now, let's go to the horse.

556
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,940
We'll get the gun and the enemy.

557
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,940
I want them to know that

558
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,940
it's not a romantic story.

559
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,940
Brother Li,

560
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,940
are you afraid that he'll trouble us in the future?

561
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,940
He's using the song to hide in our cage.

562
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,940
He's trying to fool me.

563
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:15,940
What did you say?

564
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,940
The court will stop?

565
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,940
Su Liang jumped out of the corner.

566
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,940
He wanted to transfer Li Shande's position.

567
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,940
He said he wanted to give everyone a 3-0.

568
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,940
Ma Guiyun wanted to help him.

569
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,940
He wanted to make it a success.

570
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:28,940
The wind has changed.

571
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,940
The five of them have stopped the court.

572
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,940
I have to give you this face.

573
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:40,940
Li Nan has been in the police force for so many years.

574
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,940
He's been acting like a crazy man.

575
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,940
He's so heartless.

576
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,940
You don't have to worry about this.

577
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,940
Let me tell the smart people here

578
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,940
to take a new path.

579
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,940
It's not easy.

580
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,940
It's better to follow me and follow me.

581
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,940
Come on.

582
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,940
They're coming.

583
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,940
They're coming.

584
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,940
They're coming.

585
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,940
They're coming.

586
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,360
Go!

587
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,900
Hurry!

588
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,960
Go!

589
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,340
Go!

590
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,280
Good luck!

591
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,340
They have come back to watch!

592
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,960
How was that?

593
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,360
No, no, no, no!

594
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,360
No problem!

595
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,760
Yes, no problem!

596
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,160
You have no problem too!

597
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,560
You have no problem!

598
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,960
Sorry, I'm late.

599
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,960
No, no, no.

600
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,960
Why did He Ci Shi suddenly say that?

601
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,960
I think it's because we voted for the election of the court.

602
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,960
Yes.

603
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,960
Mr. Jiu,

604
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,960
how can we explain to He Ci Shi later?

605
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,960
Use what they said.

606
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,960
Ice comes to the party, water comes to the party.

607
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,960
The one who comes up, the one who comes down.

608
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,960
It's getting late.

609
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,960
Everyone, let's go in first.

610
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,960
Everyone, don't be too serious.

611
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,960
In recent years, everyone has been coming and going.

612
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,960
For Gao Zhou's tax,

613
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,960
he has done so much for it.

614
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,960
As Ci Shi,

615
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,960
I have to thank everyone.

616
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,960
Come.

617
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,960
Come, come, come.

618
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,960
Xiao Na's tax is our responsibility.

619
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,960
It's a pleasure to work with Ci Shi.

620
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,960
It's our responsibility.

621
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,960
It's a pleasure to work with Ci Shi.

622
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,960
It's our duty to pay the tax for Gao Zhou.

623
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,960
It's worth it to work so hard for Gao Zhou's development.

624
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,960
Good, good, good.

625
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,960
Today is the family banquet.

626
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,960
I am here as a member of Amita's father.

627
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,960
Our Hu Shang business can be developed.

628
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,960
You can't be silent.

629
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,960
Amita is young.

630
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,960
Without your responsibility,

631
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,960
without your help and support,

632
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,960
it's impossible.

633
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,960
The second cup of wine, as a father,

634
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,960
I thank you all.

635
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,960
Sit down.

636
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,960
It should be.

637
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,960
Come, come, come.

638
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,960
I heard something recently.

639
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,960
The court has been holding a meeting.

640
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,960
Suddenly, it stopped.

641
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,960
It seems that there is an idea in the volume.

642
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,960
Is there something?

643
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,960
This one.

644
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,960
I love upon Charles BC to know the special happens in the market.

645
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,960
It brings good luck.

646
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,960
This is our Alghy tribe.

647
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,960
We Don't have the same old business.

648
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,960
There is nothing butagem three brothers,

649
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,960
confident and full reconnect.

650
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,960
We don't care about budget.

651
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,960
We don't have a cooperator.

652
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,960
With the sole Hu Shang business,

653
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,480
is the opportunity for Gao Zhou.

654
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,920
Right, Zhang?

655
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,240
Yes.

656
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,400
Actually, the Gezi Temple

657
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,040
has always been very good at this.

658
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,760
Since the time of Li Zhi Shi came to Gao Zhou,

659
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,640
it has been convenient everywhere.

660
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,600
But I didn't expect that this person

661
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,600
would talk about the new concubine.

662
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,000
Since he came to Gao Zhou,

663
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,360
he has used the name of Li Zhi Shi

664
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,160
to make money everywhere.

665
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,400
Then why did he

666
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,680
make such a big and hard experiment?

667
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,280
If he didn't make this experiment,

668
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,120
wouldn't you have the confidence to give him money?

669
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,080
Isn't this called experiment?

670
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,240
This is called performance.

671
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,640
To make a hard-working look,

672
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,840
I'm just giving it to you.

673
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,160
Dad is back!

674
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,320
Dad is back!

675
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,800
When this guy was a scumbag,

676
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,640
he told me that he wanted to make a experiment with this little East Gate.

677
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,840
I told him that

678
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,960
you should not make this experiment.

679
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,800
This is called the round-trip.

680
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,240
This is like sending Li Zhi to Tang An.

681
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,040
It's like a donkey.

682
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,040
You can put this donkey's eyes on it.

683
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,560
If he can make a round-trip with this wooden plate,

684
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,680
he can't make a thousand-meter donkey.

685
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,000
Hurry and bring him to the border to drink some cold water.

686
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,280
Put some unsuitable clothes on.

687
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,160
Put some unsuitable clothes on.

688
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,040
I'll do it.

689
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:09,960
Put a hand on it.

690
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:10,920
Put a hand on it.

691
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:11,760
Sun Mo!

692
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,800
Hurry and put it on.

693
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:13,640
Put it on.

694
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,760
Don't throw it away.

695
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,600
Be careful.

696
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,360
Such a rare experiment,

697
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,200
even if it's a success,

698
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,240
what can it prove?

699
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,840
But it's different now.

700
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,520
He put his hand on it.

701
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,920
He's not in the business.

702
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,120
He's going to make the people in the business

703
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,520
and the people in my family

704
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,720
not allow him to do that.

705
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,160
Then I'm in a bad mood.

706
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,080
I'll do it no matter what.

707
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,440
If this experiment is really a success,

708
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,760
what can it prove?

709
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,160
When he's in Chang'an, he sees the saint.

710
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,960
Can he really say his name in front of the saint?

711
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,320
He can tell his own credit.

712
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,720
I'm telling you,

713
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,640
if you make a mistake,

714
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,200
you'll be done.

715
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,000
By then,

716
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,480
you'll be out of business.

717
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,240
Yes.

718
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,960
Normally,

719
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,400
if your business is a bit of a loss,

720
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,920
you'll have to put your hands on it.

721
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,520
You won't be able to pay the money.

722
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,960
This is a matter of money transfer.

723
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,840
It's a perfect project.

724
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,320
If you pay it,

725
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,480
you'll have to pay it.

726
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,040
You won't even have a chance to transfer it.

727
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,440
Lao Zhao, don't scare him.

728
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,760
We haven't even started the business,

729
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,720
right?

730
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,480
Actually,

731
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,160
it's very simple.

732
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,840
It's a business.

733
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,000
If you're in a bad mood,

734
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,240
you'll have to act in a good way.

735
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,880
I'm thinking for everyone.

736
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,560
Next year,

737
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,440
we'll expand our business.

738
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,760
I promise,

739
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,760
everyone's profit will increase to three.

740
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,800
It's the three after the tax.

741
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,400
How can it be short?

742
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:03,680
Well,

743
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,120
to make this case,

744
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,240
will you...

745
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,400
It really might take a while

746
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,800
that we will reach a good price for this job.

747
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,320
You've been a tremendousader these days,

748
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,920
both you and the coin нет forever.

749
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,480
Leading you on this project

750
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,760
is to have every member of the beard

751
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,240
give the opportunity to feed up on each another.

752
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,920
Stop in a rush.

753
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,360
It's very simple.

754
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,340
Have the opportunity to help.

755
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,680
Have the money to cooperate with us in need!

756
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:43,160
As long as in the king, I'll be happy if you're happy!

757
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,060
Thank you, Mr He, for Rick He for taking care of me.

758
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,560

764
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,280
Dogebi

765
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:16,680
Lee

766
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:21,480
Isam서�subbi

767
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:26,920
Bring our

768
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,920
Group

769
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,680
Where you go

770
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,680
Here.

771
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,680
Mr. Li.

772
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,680
Mr. Li.

773
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,680
I have a piece of lychee.

774
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,680
This is a few-layered one.

775
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,680
It's not natural.

776
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,680
This is a piece of lychee.

777
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,680
It will definitely break.

778
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,680
Pack up the things you've transferred.

779
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,680
I...

780
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,680
Pack up.

781
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,680
I...

782
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,680
I can't.

783
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,680
I can't.

784
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,680
I'll go get the paper.

785
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,680
Paper?

786
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,680
I'll get the paper.

787
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,680
Here.

788
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,680
How is it?

789
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,680
It's back.

790
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,680
It's back.

791
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,680
Mr. Li.

792
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,680
It's hot.

793
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,680
My brothers can't stand it.

794
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,680
Luckily, he's still in the college.

795
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,680
If he falls off the horse on the mountain road,

796
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,680
the horse will run away.

797
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,680
The experiment is still not over.

798
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,680
Mr. Li.

799
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,680
My brothers can't stand it.

800
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,680
You're a total scumbag!

801
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,680
Even if you can stand it,

802
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,680
the horse...

803
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,680
the horse is gone.

804
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,680
Except for those two thousand-plus-kilograms,

805
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,680
the horse can stand for at least half a day.

806
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,680
It can't stand for so long.

807
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,680
Then finish the half-day.

808
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,680
There's no difference between the two thousand-plus-kilograms.

809
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,680
If it's a big birthday,

810
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,680
it's reasonable.

811
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,680
Then we all have to listen to the donkey.

812
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,680
What are you looking at?

813
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,680
When it's a test,

814
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,680
we all have to listen to Mr. Li.

815
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,680
Well,

816
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,680
Brother Lan.

817
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,680
We don't know that you're a big boy.

818
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,680
Everyone calls you Brother Lan.

819
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,680
I also call you Brother Lan.

820
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,680
The test horse is not just a disease.

821
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,680
You said you went to Chang'an for five thousand-plus-kilograms.

822
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,680
You have a lot of difficulties.

823
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,680
These are all not in the calculation.

824
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,680
The test is a test.

825
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,680
It's a problem of discovery and avoidance.

826
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,680
You said if we measure the fastest speed,

827
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,680
it would be easy.

828
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,680
Then we'll measure the speed of the first three days

829
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,680
and calculate it.

830
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,680
But it's not like that.

831
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,680
Only the time for the test to continue is long enough.

832
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,680
People fall and fall.

833
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,680
You put these difficulties in.

834
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,680
The data you calculate

835
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,680
is meaningful.

836
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,680
Mr. Li.

837
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,680
As long as there are a few more tests,

838
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,680
I can continue.

839
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,680
We can continue, too.

840
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,680
I can do it, too.

841
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,680
I can do it.

842
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,680
I don't want to play the drum.

843
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,680
These two brothers

844
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,680
didn't have a way to escape.

845
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,680
Let them withdraw.

846
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,680
I'll stay.

847
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,680
Thank you.

848
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,680
Now that the machine is not enough,

849
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,680
we can change it into a human and horse.

850
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,680
All three groups are in one.

851
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,680
At least everyone can sleep in a whole room.

852
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,680
Can you see it?

853
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,680
Yes.

854
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,680
Stop.

855
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,680
The game is over.

856
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,680
How is the game over?

857
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,680
Mr. Li,

858
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,680
the game is over.

859
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,680
No problem.

860
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,680
Good.

861
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,680
Mr. Gao.

862
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,680
How is it?

863
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,680
I'm not sure.

864
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,680
But the human and horse are punished.

865
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,680
For a few groups of people,

866
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,680
there are only a few people left

867
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,680
to fight.

868
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,680
I'll go and listen to that person.

869
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,680
He's a big guy.

870
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,680
He's a big guy.

871
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,680
Don't run away.

872
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,680
There's something wrong in the mountain.

873
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,680
It's also a matter of your concentration.

874
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,680
Come on.

875
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,680
Come on.

876
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,680
You guys,

877
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,680
go to the back.

878
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,680
Okay.

879
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,680
I'll go and see if there's any way to get out.

880
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,680
Hurry up.

881
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,680
Let's go.

882
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,680
Here we go.

883
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,680
Ready.

884
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,680
The emperor and the princess

885
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,680
can soon get the new Li Zhi.

886
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,680
It's like they're in their mouths.

887
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,680
You're a great person.

888
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,680
You're a great person.

889
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,680
Li Shan De.

890
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,680
You forgot to keep the food.

891
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,680
Keep the food?

892
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,680
This is a big deal.

893
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,680
I want to live.

894
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,680
Mr. Gao.

895
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,680
I want to live my life.

896
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,680
I want to make this business

897
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,680
with my life.

898
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,680
I won't let everyone down.

899
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,680
I won't let everyone down.

900
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:25,680
Don't go.

901
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,680
I was in the head of the forest, but the sky was red

902
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:34,680
The mood was floating to Chang'an, making people fall

903
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,680
Who touched my shoes, I couldn't write in the middle of the day

904
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,680
Just for the good food, I want to try it

905
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:48,680
This road is over the mountains and rivers, I'm in my dream

906
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,680
I can't hear, but I'm a crazy man

907
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:57,680
I want to see the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world

908
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:02,680
But I only see a man crying in the middle of the night

909
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,680
A little bit, a little bit, a little bit

910
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:16,680
We can't take a little risk, just for the good food, we can't take a little risk

911
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:20,680
We can't chase after the dream, we can't see the world

912
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,680
We can't see the world, we can't see the world

913
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:35,680
I can't take a little risk, just for the good food, we can't take a little risk

914
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,680
Just for the good food, I want to try it

915
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:44,680
Before I can take a little risk

916
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,680
Just for the good food, I want to try it

917
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,680
Just for the good food, I want to try it
