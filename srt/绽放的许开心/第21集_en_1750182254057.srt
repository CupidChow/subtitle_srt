1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,660
e

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:06,540
Well, I'll have to go do business here.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,660
OK, thank you.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,760
All right.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,500
Never thought you prepared...

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,260
I appeared ðŸ¤³

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,840
He's talking about his confidence.

8
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:32,600
Dark Monbaar

9
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:38,220
Episode 17

10
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,240
He still knows how to make good money.

11
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:02,300
He is now waiting for

12
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,320
Du Tai Chen

13
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,980
He is putting up a riot

14
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,040
so that the Prince had to go

15
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,280
He keeps shooting, he started wandering

16
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,720
Because you killed the bad guys.

17
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,080
I only know

18
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,880
how to stay.

19
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,680
You saved me.

20
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,880
Then go

21
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,680
and find a good master.

22
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,280
I don't want it.

23
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,280
What do you want?

24
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,280
I want revenge.

25
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,280
Who is your enemy?

26
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,280
So you don't want to be loyal.

27
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,880
What's your name?

28
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,080
Dong Xue.

29
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,680
Wen Ning.

30
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,280
Yun Qing.

31
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,880
I raised you.

32
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,080
I only want you to be my sister.

33
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,080
Who are you?

34
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,880
I come from Mekong.

35
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,880
I'm your chef.

36
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,080
Who do you work for?

37
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,880
You're my every loop.

38
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,000
You know after

39
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,280
all the harm you did to me,

40
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,440
no one else knew you.

41
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,960
But when you were with me,

42
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,960
I have to be careful with the calculations every step.

43
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,960
If there is no way to tell me about the plan,

44
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,960
I don't know how to continue.

45
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,960
Lan Yu has always been very good at playing.

46
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,960
She is very good at playing.

47
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,960
If He You Guang didn't trust me from the beginning,

48
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,960
why didn't you kill me at the beginning?

49
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,960
Because he wants to use you to honor those pirates.

50
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,960
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to stop you.

51
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,960
Come.

52
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,960
He You Guang

53
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,960
When your father was dead,

54
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,960
He You Guang didn't suspect anyone else

55
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,960
and raised him by his side.

56
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,960
He created a picture of his love for you.

57
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,960
To make other brothers believe,

58
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,960
even if he is a government official,

59
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,960
he wouldn't kill anyone in the West.

60
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,960
He pretended to kill the pirates.

61
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,960
He was actually going to wash the pirates away

62
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,960
and return to the sea.

63
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,960
This way, he can stabilize his control

64
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,960
and control the trade line on the sea.

65
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,960
As for how much money he spent these years,

66
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,960
and how much money those brothers gave him,

67
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,960
I think you are more than clear.

68
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,960
Since you know so much about these things,

69
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,960
you should have investigated for a long time.

70
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,960
Who did you do this for?

71
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,960
These years, He You Guang has been

72
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,960
giving the people a lot of care and care

73
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,960
to the people in the West.

74
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,960
It's a rare thing to do in Chang'an.

75
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,960
I can only rely on you

76
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,960
to be the one who can help He You Guang.

77
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,960
You are talking about the left.

78
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,960
These years, He You Guang has been a criminal.

79
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,960
He has been dead for a long time.

80
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,960
If you join us,

81
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,960
you can help your father take revenge.

82
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,960
I have always believed He You Guang is a good man.

83
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,960
So I have never thought

84
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,960
that I can be the right one to take the position of the right man.

85
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,960
It's all in the bookcase in the market.

86
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,960
Brother Lang.

87
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,960
Brother Lang.

88
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,960
Your Majesty.

89
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,960
I will be back.

90
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,960
So the money that my father gave me

91
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,960
was really He You Guang's money.

92
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,960
I understand your feelings.

93
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,960
He also said that the fire in the Qijing Road

94
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,960
was He You Guang's house.

95
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,960
He was killed by the fire.

96
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,960
After he knew about this,

97
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,960
he turned it down.

98
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,960
He even cut off He You Guang.

99
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,960
Now the city gate is closed.

100
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,960
He is looking for Amita.

101
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,960
In the end, Amita is also a victim.

102
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,960
He is a victim?

103
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,960
Then I am the one.

104
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,960
He is innocent.

105
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,960
He was also killed by the fire.

106
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,960
After he knew the truth,

107
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,960
he didn't have any connection with He You Guang.

108
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,960
He also made himself in danger.

109
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,960
You can laugh first.

110
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,960
Brother Lang.

111
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,960
Can you help me?

112
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
Say it.

113
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,960
Brother Lang.

114
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,960
Look at this.

115
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,960
It is our brand.

116
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,960
It is healthy and not bad for your health.

117
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,960
How old is it?

118
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,960
Ten years and three years old.

119
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,960
Brother Lang.

120
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,960
It is still four years old.

121
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,960
Although it is a little older,

122
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,960
it is experienced and not bad for your health.

123
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,960
It is not difficult to change.

124
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,960
I will take it for you.

125
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,960
You are so fast.

126
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,960
What is your name?

127
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,960
That one.

128
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,960
You are not good at using the old car.

129
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,960
You have no appetite for two days.

130
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,960
It is his.

131
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,960
It is his.

132
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,960
So the evidence can be used

133
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,960
in the long-term study room.

134
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,960
Someone has been watching the study room for a long time.

135
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,960
But the master is a vicious man.

136
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,960
He will go to Douji Fang's place

137
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,960
and study there.

138
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,960
Master.

139
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,960
Go with me.

140
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,960
It is settled.

141
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,960
Be careful.

142
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,960
Brother Lang.

143
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,960
My Guan Yun factory

144
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,960
has been in the market for a long time.

145
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,960
Yes.

146
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,960
Dear friends.

147
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,960
We are in a hurry.

148
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,960
We are in a hot market.

149
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,960
Let's go.

150
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,960
Good.

151
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,960
Good.

152
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,960
Is it okay?

153
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,960
We are in a hurry.

154
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,960
We don't need to work all our lives.

155
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,960
I am in a hurry.

156
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,960
I am so excited.

157
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,960
Excuse me.

158
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,960
Zhang Wen Yuan.

159
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,960
Zhang Wen Yuan.

160
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,960
Come with me.

161
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,960
Okay.

162
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,960
This is your Zhang Wen Yuan.

163
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,960
This is my Zhang Wen Yuan.

164
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,960
See?

165
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
I am afraid that I will be scared.

166
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,960
Zhang Wen Yuan.

167
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,960
Then.

168
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,960
I will take it.

169
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
Take it.

170
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,960
Guan Yun Chang.

171
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,960
Zhang Wen Yuan.

172
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,960
Zhang Wen Yuan.

173
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,960
Good.

174
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,960
Good.

175
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,960
Guan Yun Cheng.

176
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,960
Guan Yun Cheng.

177
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,960
Guan Yun Cheng.

178
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,960
Guan Yun Cheng.

179
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,960
Come on.

180
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,960
Let's start.

181
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,960
Brother Fang.

182
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,960
How is it going?

183
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,960
Today, your chief Niu

184
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,960
met a non-death opponent.

185
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,960
The other team

186
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,960
took this sick machine to fight.

187
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,960
It is not a good idea.

188
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,960
He is in a hurry.

189
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,960
No.

190
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,960
The witness has a favor.

191
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,960
Go and pay for the guards.

192
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,960
Go and see.

193
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,960
Can you go like this?

194
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,960
You think that someone is here to steal the books?

195
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,960
And then you will come to exchange the paper.

196
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,960
Go.

197
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,960
Go.

198
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,960
Go.

199
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,960
Go.

200
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,960
Hurry.

201
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,960
Get him!

202
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,960
Lets go.

203
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,960
Open the house.

204
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,960
Get him.

205
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,960
What's going on?

206
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,960
What's going on?

207
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,960
What are you doing?

208
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,960
What's going on? Tell me.

209
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,960
What's going on?

210
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,960
Someone broke into the study room.

211
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,960
What? Where?

212
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,960
What's going on?

213
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,960
You didn't find me?

214
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,960
What's going on?

215
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,960
Hurry up!

216
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,960
Hurry up!

217
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,960
Let's go!

218
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,960
Hurry up!

219
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,960
The machine is not working yet.

220
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,960
Shut up!

221
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,960
Shut up!

222
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,960
Shut up!

223
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,960
Are you sure you didn't lose anything?

224
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,960
All the books are here.

225
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,960
Luckily, I burned all the books.

226
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,960
Looks like someone is going to investigate me.

227
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,960
Le Zhao.

228
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,960
Amit is not there.

229
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,960
Can those people who died in the meeting find any clues?

230
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,960
This is...

231
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,960
This is not a common motive.

232
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,960
They have to send people secretly to search.

233
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,960
So they have to be put to the test.

234
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,960
The people in the middle of the circle told me

235
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,960
that those brothers in the hall were looking for him.

236
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,960
I wanted to see

237
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:58,960
which pair of eyes were looking at me in the face of the leader.

238
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,960
I was wrong.

239
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,960
Mr. Li! Mr. Li!

240
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,960
Mr. Li!

241
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,960
Come on!

242
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,960
Let's go!

243
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,960
Let's go!

244
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,960
What's wrong?

245
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,960
What's wrong?

246
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,960
Are you hurt?

247
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,960
Are you okay?

248
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,960
I'm fine.

249
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,960
I'm fine.

250
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,960
The big rain is coming.

251
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,960
We only need one day and three days.

252
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,960
We'll save two days.

253
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,960
Okay!

254
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,960
Mr. Li!

255
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,960
Mr. Li!

256
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,960
Before we move on,

257
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,960
we'll make up for the last time

258
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,960
the plan of the transfer.

259
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,960
Make up for it?

260
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,960
Okay.

261
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,960
Mr. Li!

262
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,960
Are you going back to the tea house?

263
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,960
I'm not.

264
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,960
It's the last time

265
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,960
I see this.

266
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,960
Then you have to take the responsibility

267
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,960
and return as soon as possible.

268
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,960
We are using the power here.

269
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,960
I'll leave the shares of the interest

270
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,960
to you.

271
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,960
Yes, sir.

272
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,960
Yes, sir.

273
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,960
Okay, okay.

274
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,960
Let's go up the mountain now

275
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,960
and give Mr. Li the most important interest

276
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,960
to cut the paper and make a check, okay?

277
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,960
Okay!

278
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,960
Okay!

279
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,960
Let's go!

280
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,960
Let's go!

281
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,960
Let's go!

282
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,960
Let's go!

283
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,960
Hurry up!

284
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,960
Please let me go.

285
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,960
I'm sorry.

286
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,960
I'm late.

287
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,960
I'm really sorry.

288
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,960
Let's go.

289
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,960
The route of the transfer

290
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,960
is very difficult.

291
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,960
Mr. Li, you are very generous.

292
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,960
I hope you can

293
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,960
fulfill your promise to me.

294
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,960
Now that He Ci is on the air,

295
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,960
if we are to get him in a hurry,

296
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,960
he can find a excuse

297
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,960
and deduct our business card.

298
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,960
Who can resist it?

299
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,960
Yes.

300
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,960
Amita has been with He Ci for so many years.

301
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,960
He gave up when he said he would give up.

302
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,960
He Ci has been very generous to us.

303
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,960
We are not even happy with him.

304
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,960
Now, we still have no money

305
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,960
to pay for the test.

306
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,960
We can't move.

307
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,960
Let's just keep an eye on the situation.

308
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,960
But

309
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,960
we are in a dilemma now.

310
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,960
If we are to pay for the transfer,

311
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,960
we will be in a dilemma.

312
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,960
Mr. Li, you have said that

313
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,960
taking this picture

314
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,960
will be a bad idea.

315
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,960
We can't stop Li Zhi from

316
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,960
taking the picture and

317
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,960
we can't let Li Zhi get away.

318
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,960
So we have to work hard.

319
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,960
We really can't

320
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,960
invest the money.

321
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,960
Xiao Yunchuan said

322
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,960
that Li Zhi's transfer

323
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,960
doesn't need to be voted by the stock market.

324
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,960
We can feel it ourselves.

325
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,960
But even if he says so,

326
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,960
he is obviously

327
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,960
trying to pressure us.

328
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,960
Mr. Su,

329
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,960
the stock market is in a dilemma.

330
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,960
You can't keep an eye on it.

331
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,960
I will make a move.

332
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,960
Mr. Su,

333
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,960
we are here to talk about

334
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,960
the past.

335
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,960
Mr. Su,

336
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,960
you can leave now.

337
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,960
As you said,

338
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,960
I am very grateful to you.

339
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,960
You are kind and kind.

340
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,960
You are very powerful.

341
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,960
You are the best.

342
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,960
But these years,

343
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,960
I am afraid that

344
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,960
we will be injured

345
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,960
by gold and sea.

346
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,960
It's dangerous.

347
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,960
We will be in danger.

348
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,960
We will be in danger.

349
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,960
You can take it.

350
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,960
But you can't do anything.

351
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,960
You are so foolish.

352
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,960
You are so stupid.

353
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,960
We can't make money without money.

354
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,960
We can't expect anything.

355
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,960
There is no money left.

356
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,960
Li Zhi's transfer

357
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,960
is a perfect opportunity

358
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,960
for me and the stock market.

359
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,960
It's a human's job.

360
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,960
Mr. Su,

361
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,960
we need to get out

362
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,960
of this old house

363
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,960
and make another move.

364
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,960
Mr. Su,

365
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,960
you are so powerful.

366
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,960
Don't be so impulsive.

367
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,960
The gold and sea

368
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,960
are really moving.

369
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,960
No one can stop them.

370
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,960
Yes.

371
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,960
It makes sense.

372
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,960
Mr. Su,

373
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,960
you should think about it.

374
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,960
So many beautiful colors.

375
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,960
You wrote them all.

376
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,960
You are so powerful.

377
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,960
Do you want to give them to me?

378
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,960
No.

379
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,960
This is Li Zhi's transfer.

380
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,960
When we arrive in Chang'an,

381
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,960
I have to take it and make a move.

382
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,960
This is Li Wucheng.

383
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,960
Li Zhi's transfer

384
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,960
needs a lot of teeth and

385
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,960
some cooperation.

386
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,960
So I have to let this business

387
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,960
enter Li Wucheng.

388
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,960
I don't understand.

389
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,960
You don't understand?

390
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,960
I mean,

391
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,960
I have to let my secret agent know

392
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,960
that Li Zhi can enter Chang'an.

393
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,960
Mr. Li.

394
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,960
Mr. Su.

395
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,960
We are almost ready.

396
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,960
There is no problem in theory.

397
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,960
Just look at the test on the road.

398
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,960
Sit.

399
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,960
People in this world

400
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,960
are really happy.

401
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,960
Mr. Li.

402
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,960
Li Zhi's transfer

403
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,960
was originally

404
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,960
a piece of wood.

405
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,960
Mr. Li actually

406
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,960
drew a piece of wood as a magic.

407
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,960
It's hard to believe

408
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,960
that it's a piece of wood.

409
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,960
But

410
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,960
it's still a little

411
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,960
suspicious.

412
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,960
What if...

413
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,960
I mean, what if...

414
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,960
Mr. Su.

415
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,960
This is the last chance

416
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,960
I have.

417
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,960
I just want to let this old man

418
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,960
have a good time.

419
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,960
I have to follow him

420
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,960
from the beginning to the end.

421
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,960
Even if

422
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,960
he has a lot of teeth in front of him,

423
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,960
I have to listen to him.

424
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,960
Okay.

425
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,960
I won't succeed.

426
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,960
I am a human.

427
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,960
The master's soul is broken.

428
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,960
That old man

429
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,960
is attacked by the palace.

430
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,960
He is helpless.

431
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,960
Let's not talk about this.

432
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,960
The money from the back...

433
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,960
is still in the wrong place.

434
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,960
But

435
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,960
after five days,

436
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,960
the old man...

437
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,960
I can't do it.

438
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,960
I can't do it.

439
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,960
Time doesn't wait for people.

440
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,960
It's already the first day of April.

441
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,960
The interest has been checked.

442
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,960
I have to leave

443
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,960
on the day after tomorrow.

444
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,960
The day after tomorrow?

445
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,960
Yes.

446
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,960
Don't worry, master.

447
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,960
The day after tomorrow,

448
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,960
before the morning,

449
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,960
the old man

450
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,960
must take the risk of the Yan Tu

451
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,960
and take the master's hand.

452
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,960
I heard that those foxes

453
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,960
can't hold on anymore

454
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,960
and are starting to take the position of the leader.

455
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,960
The position of the leader is like a head and a tail.

456
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,960
The big fish and the small fish

457
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,960
can't bear to fight.

458
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,960
Let them fight.

459
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,960
This is a fatal situation.

460
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,960
This is a fatal situation.

461
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,960
Now, it's just a luck.

462
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,960
What can we do about the people's glory?

463
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,960
In the end,

464
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,960
it's just a matter of time.

465
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,960
I'm so scared.

466
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,960
But Mr. Kong,

467
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,960
I don't want to wait for the leader.

468
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,960
I want to take the initiative to break the rules.

469
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,960
Have you thought of the way to break the rules?

470
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,960
Although I can't get the account book,

471
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,960
I can take all the accounts.

472
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,960
I'm a witness.

473
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,960
I want to visit Chang'an and see my son-in-law.

474
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,960
Mr. Kong,

475
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,960
would you like to help me?

476
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,960
Jian Feng.

477
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,960
Xun'an.

478
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,960
You're going back to Chang'an?

479
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,960
I have to personally

480
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,960
do a transfer experiment.

481
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,960
I'll move to the police station today.

482
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,960
Jian Feng.

483
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,960
Sit down.

484
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,960
I'm busy.

485
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,960
Sit down.

486
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,960
I'm busy.

487
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,960
Gao.

488
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,960
Do your work.

489
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,960
I'm busy.

490
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,960
Go.

491
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,960
What are you doing?

492
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,960
What?

493
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,960
Help me take a person.

494
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,960
You can't do this.

495
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,960
You're yourself.

496
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,960
Who are you taking?

497
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,960
Amita.

498
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,960
Amita.

499
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,960
I remember I told you before.

500
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,960
I want to move to Youxiang.

501
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,960
Now I have a chance.

502
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,960
Amita is a very important code in our hands.

503
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,960
Now He Yougwang is in Mancheng.

504
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,960
If He Yougwang finds him,

505
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,960
he will definitely bring him to Chang'an.

506
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,960
He has a chance.

507
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,960
He can survive.

508
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,960
Amita is He Yougwang's adopted daughter.

509
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,960
Why did He Yougwang kill her?

510
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,960
It's not necessary.

511
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,960
She's her own daughter.

512
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,960
This is a long story.

513
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,960
I won't say it.

514
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,960
You have to say it long.

515
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,960
It's a little bit easier.

516
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,960
Amita's aunt is He Yougwang's murderer.

517
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,960
He Yougwang is Amita's murderer.

518
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,960
Amita has been in the valley.

519
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,960
Now she's against it.

520
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,960
She's a thief.

521
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,960
She lost her way to He Yougwang.

522
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,960
Amita knows it.

523
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,960
Now she's going to Chang'an to see the left side of the sword.

524
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,960
If she can move to He Yougwang,

525
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,960
she can take revenge for her murder.

526
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,960
If she can move to Youxiang,

527
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,960
I can take revenge for my murder.

528
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,960
I don't know if I can do it.

529
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,960
Am I clear?

530
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,960
Why are you all the same?

531
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,960
It's very hard to take revenge for your murder.

532
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,960
I'm not afraid.

533
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,960
Amita is a thief.

534
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,960
She's a thief.

535
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,960
We can't even save her.

536
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,960
How can we take revenge on Amita?

537
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,960
I've thought it over.

538
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,960
Amita can be your pawn.

539
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,960
She's a great pawn.

540
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,960
Think about it.

541
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,960
You have a stable.

542
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,960
When you pay the money,

543
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,960
hide her.

544
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,960
She can help you.

545
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,960
She can't follow your back.

546
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,960
When are you leaving?

547
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,960
I'm leaving in the morning.

548
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,960
Where are you going?

549
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,960
I told you.

550
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,960
You can't leave without me.

551
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,960
Wait for her.

552
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,960
Gao, go.

553
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,960
Gao.

554
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,960
It's okay.

555
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,960
Amita has a problem.

556
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,960
You can't pay the money.

557
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,960
Change the tag.

558
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,960
I don't want to take the flower.

559
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,960
I'll take it.

560
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,960
Mr. Dai,

561
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,960
the shipyard of Jafar and Haru's family is in trouble.

562
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,960
You're wrong.

563
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,960
Amita's family is in a hurry.

564
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,960
Why?

565
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,960
We have to wait.

566
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,960
You deduct the ship.

567
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,960
Let them stay calm.

568
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,960
Go.

569
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,960
Please.

570
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,960
What do you want?

571
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,960
You're so stubborn.

572
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,960
Even if you want to do it,

573
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,960
you can't do it.

574
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,960
I'll do it first.

575
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,960
Let's talk about it later.

576
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,960
Go.

577
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,960
Mr. Su.

578
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,960
Mr. Xiao.

579
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,960
Sorry, Mr. Su.

580
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,960
I'm busy with work.

581
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,960
I'll take care of you.

582
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,960
Don't blame me.

583
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,960
I'm not.

584
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,960
I'm sorry.

585
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,960
I'm sorry.

586
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,960
I'm sorry.

587
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,960
I'm sorry.

588
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,960
Mr. Su.

589
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,960
Mr. Su,

590
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,960
I'm here to thank you.

591
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,960
Thank you.

592
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,960
You've made my heart beat.

593
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,960
I can't stop myself.

594
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,960
I've changed my mind.

595
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,960
I can see your kind heart.

596
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,960
I'm so happy to see you.

597
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,960
I'm here to take care of you.

598
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,960
Thank you, Mr. Su.

599
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,000
Thank you.

600
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Mr. Su, please sit.

601
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,440
Mr. Su, today...

602
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,760
You are Dao He.

603
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,760
I am...

604
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,360
I have something to discuss.

605
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,360
If Mr. Su is going to say

606
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,040
that the transfer of the business card

607
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,800
or the opening of business card,

608
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,520
I am just a large business leader.

609
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,520
I have a lot in stock of stock,

610
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,160
but I am not capable of it.

611
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,440
The truth has changed continuously.

612
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,320
The viewersede should be tired

613
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,520
of serious business.

614
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,680
Take it which way..

615
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,360
You will not be vraagurful.

616
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,400
But...

617
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,680
For theìž¬ transfer,

618
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:15,960
You,

619
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:21,960
You will never give up on all things.

620
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,960
Don't worry, Hangshou.

621
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,960
I will not borrow money from you.

622
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,960
I will not force you to do so.

623
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,960
I just want...

624
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,960
I just want to discuss with you.

625
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,960
There is a business ship.

626
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:54,960
Hangshou, can you please help me to get the ship?

627
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,960
You can leave now.

628
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,960
You can leave too.

629
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,960
Hangshou,

630
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,960
Su Long,

631
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,960
didn't you want to sell the ship to Li Zhishi?

632
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,960
Yes.

633
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,960
Then all the Shen family will be crushed by him?

634
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,960
I am willing to bet.

635
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,960
You...

636
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,960
Actually,

637
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,960
General Hangshou gave it to you.

638
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,960
I am sure you saw the money transfer from Li Zhishi.

639
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,960
Hangshou, don't worry.

640
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,960
I will sell the ship to you.

641
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,960
I will give you the money.

642
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,960
Hangshou will not be implicated.

643
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,960
After the matter is done,

644
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,960
the promise before the trip,

645
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:21,960
I will share it with Hangshou

646
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,960
with Li Zhishi.

647
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,960
Then how do we get the ship?

648
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,960
The original ship's six ships.

649
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,960
Okay.

650
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,960
I accept the ship.

651
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,960
Take these.

652
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,960
Remember,

653
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,960
you can't lose face for me

654
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,960
when you help Li Zhishi to transfer.

655
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,960
Okay.

656
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,960
Don't lose face for me.

657
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,960
You have to be the most stable and the fastest.

658
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,960
Brother,

659
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,960
why do you help Li Zhishi?

660
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,960
In Linan,

661
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,960
we have to live a good life here.

662
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,960
We can't get out of here forever.

663
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,960
This time,

664
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,960
we have to transfer Li Zhishi to Chang'an.

665
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,960
It's a good opportunity.

666
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,960
I want to get a chance.

667
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,960
Brother Lan, don't worry.

668
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,960
We will help you get a chance.

669
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,960
It's also a chance for you.

670
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,960
Yes.

671
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,960
Go ahead.

672
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,960
Brother,

673
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,960
take care.

674
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,960
There can only be one civilisation benefactor.

675
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,960
It's shall time.

676
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,960
Brother.

677
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,960
Here you go.

678
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,320
Here you go.

679
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,960
Commander Zhao,

680
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,960
look for the strike.

681
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,960
Lan.

682
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:31,000
The third Ð¼Ð¸Ñ€g.

683
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,960
No problem,

684
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,960
bear his body.

685
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,960
sister Lan.

686
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,960
I'm not a newbie.

687
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,960
Hey, Lan.

688
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,960
You're here to see if there's anyone here to help me find someone.

689
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,960
Who?

690
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,960
Amita.

691
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,960
Amita?

692
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,960
He's my uncle.

693
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,960
I'll do my best to find the person he wants.

694
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,960
Okay.

695
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,960
That's great.

696
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,960
Thank you for your 100 million.

697
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,960
Thanks to you, I've won 100 million.

698
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,960
I'm glad you're here to help me find someone.

699
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,960
Thank you.

700
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,960
Hey.

701
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,960
Aliya.

702
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,960
Are you afraid of being late for the food?

703
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,960
You're going to be late for the road tomorrow, right?

704
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,960
Thank you for your hard work, Ali.

705
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,960
Thank you.

706
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,960
You won't be late.

707
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,960
I won't take you to Chang'an tomorrow.

708
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:36,960
But I promise I'll bring you some wine from Chang'an, okay?

709
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,960
Come.

710
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:05,960
You mean, I'll be back to the ancestral temple after I leave tomorrow?

711
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,960
You can't go back.

712
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,960
Those are bad eggs.

713
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,960
You can stay here.

714
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,960
You can stay at the ancestral temple.

715
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,960
You can ask them.

716
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,960
I'll be back.

717
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,960
I'll pick you up at the ancestral temple.

718
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,960
Okay?

719
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,960
If that uncle wants to bully you and beat you again,

720
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,960
I'll have a good deal with them.

721
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,960
This one.

722
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,960
leaning

723
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,960
The southern gate has increased due to the military.

724
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,960
They're making a meeting next hour.

725
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,960
Ä…d proposal to take people out for deliver.

726
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,960
Stop.

727
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,960
Police!

728
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,960
Tomorrow morning, we must send Amita to the city.

729
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,960
The police will meet with the chief of the police.

730
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,960
I'm afraid that I'll be too late to call myself Mr. Kong Lang.

731
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,960
Even if I'm in trouble, I'll have to do it.

732
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,960
Who's the person on the car?

733
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,960
The Kong Lang gang is helping Mr. Zhao do something.

734
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,960
If you don't believe me, call Mr. Zhao to the hospital.

735
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,960
If it's a matter of delay, you can take responsibility.

736
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,960
I'll lead the troops for Hangshou.

737
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,960
Hangshou?

738
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,960
Hangshou, this is all because of Lanyu.

739
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,960
I'm afraid that Hangshou will give Lanyu a chance to be punished.

740
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,960
Let's go.

741
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,960
Mr. Zhang.

742
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,960
What's the matter?

743
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,960
Brother Lang sent a message saying that he saw Amita outside the city.

744
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,960
He went to the police station in the direction of the Hong Kong gang.

745
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,960
Are you sure that he's talking about Amita?

746
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,960
Absolutely.

747
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,960
Hurry up and inform Yaoxiao.

748
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,960
Yes.

749
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,960
Get in the car.

750
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,960
Stop the car and check.

751
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,960
What's the goods on the side?

752
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,960
Get in the car.

753
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,960
The police has ordered that you must be on the car.

754
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,960
Wait!

755
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,960
This guy.

756
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,960
I'm from the fighter's team.

757
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,960
The cars are all fighter's.

758
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,960
If you don't know me, you can.

759
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,960
But you have to know these wings.

760
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,960
I don't care what you know.

761
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,960
Brother Lang.

762
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,960
Mr. Lang.

763
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,960
I saw the problem.

764
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,960
It's really you.

765
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,960
What's the situation?

766
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,960
The wings.

767
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,960
Whose wings?

768
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,960
The wings of the fighter.

769
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,960
This guy.

770
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,960
This is the master of the fighter.

771
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,960
Su Hua said that he will be a master for the rest of his life.

772
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,960
If you don't know him,

773
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,960
you won't be good either.

774
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,960
Why are you so bad?

775
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,960
Why should I know him?

776
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,960
Who is the fighter?

777
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,960
It's dangerous to say that.

778
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,960
You don't know the fighter?

779
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,960
Where's the gatekeeper?

780
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,960
The gatekeeper!

781
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,960
The gatekeeper!

782
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,960
Who's shouting at me?

783
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,960
The gatekeeper!

784
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,960
Ma Lang.

785
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,960
You can't control the little brother.

786
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,960
No one knows who the fighter is.

787
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,960
Yes, yes, yes.

788
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,960
It's my fault.

789
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,960
The normal number of the fish

790
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,960
is a ten-degree angle.

791
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,960
Brother Lang.

792
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,960
In your car,

793
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,960
is this the treasure of the Hezi family?

794
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,960
This guy has a good taste.

795
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,960
It's indeed the treasure of the Hezi family.

796
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,960
I was going to take it to the mountain.

797
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,960
But this guy had to let me take the car.

798
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,960
If this treasure is a gold,

799
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,960
the Hezi family will be guilty.

800
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,960
If you can keep it,

801
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,960
I'll take it.

802
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,960
It's all a misunderstanding.

803
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,960
My brother is responsible for it.

804
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,960
The car is not a joke.

805
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,960
Do you want to check it or not?

806
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,960
I want to check it.

807
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,960
It's the order of the Hezi family, after all.

808
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,960
This is also their duty.

809
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,960
Brother Lang, we have to cooperate.

810
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,960
Let them check it.

811
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,960
I've been training this treasure for two months.

812
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,960
I'm in the oxygen.

813
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,960
I can't see the light.

814
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,960
Look at this.

815
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,960
The enemy is coming from the other side.

816
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,960
The enemy is coming from the other side.

817
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,960
The enemy is coming from the other side.

818
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,960
The enemy is coming from the other side.

819
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,960
Please stop them.

820
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,960
Please stop them.

821
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,960
Brother Douji.

822
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,960
We can't keep them.

823
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,960
Let's go.

824
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,960
This guy is in trouble.

825
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,960
Let's go.

826
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,960
Let's go.

827
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:20,960
Hangshou.

828
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,960
If I can escape from the heaven this time,

829
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,960
I'll wait for you on the sea.

830
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,960
Take care.

831
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,960
If you lose again,

832
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,960
what should I do?

833
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,960
Even if I fail,

834
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,960
I want to know

835
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,960
how far I can go

836
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:54,960
in the middle of the distance.

837
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,960
Thank you for saving me.

838
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,960
How many miles

839
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,960
is this place from Chang'an?

840
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:07,960
Chang'an.

841
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,960
I want to eat all the food.

842
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,960
I'm in a dream on this road.

843
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,960
I can't hear the sound of my bomb.

844
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,960
I want to see the world of the Chinese.

845
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,960
But I only see a man

846
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,960
who is full of tears.

847
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,960
A little bit.

848
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,960
A little bit.

849
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,960
A little bit.

850
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,960
The wind and the moon.

851
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,960
Before I want to wake up.

852
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,960
A little bit.

853
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,960
A little bit.

854
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,960
A little bit.

855
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,960
A little bit.

856
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,960
Ah...

857
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,960
I can't even write a letter.

858
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,960
I only write the letter in my heart.

859
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:27,960
I want to see you on Chang'an.

860
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,960
I want to see you on Chang'an.

861
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,960
I want to see you on Chang'an.

862
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,960
I want to see you on Chang'an.

863
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,960
I want to see you on Chang'an.

864
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,960
I want to see you on Chang'an.

865
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,960
I want to see you on Chang'an.

866
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,960
I want to see you on Chang'an.

867
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,960
I want to see you on Chang'an.

868
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,960
I want to see you on Chang'an.
