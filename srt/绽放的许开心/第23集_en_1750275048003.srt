1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I see your pain as you're braying too

2
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And some things we cannot just de-brains

3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And there's no time to guess the count of us

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Greater daylight, go to the free

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let's cross the wind, dancing ring, let it start to do my night away

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
There's a face, happiness, fear, all bought of one Johnny

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:36,120
Woo,

8
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:42,160
Don't bealten

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm just being nice to you.

10
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
To be honest, I don't really like being nice.

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Master, don't worry.

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I and my team will not resign.

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
After all, the financial compensation is more important.

14
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
If there's nothing else, I'll go out and work.

15
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You guys work.

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm not talking about business.

17
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm not talking about business.

18
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm not talking about business.

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm not talking about business.

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You bastard!

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You're so annoying.

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's over.

23
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Trans sembla

24
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Where does thiscome from?

25
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,920
Go ahead.

26
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,760
Gentlemen, follow me.

27
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,700
Got two

28
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,440
Morning, Miss

29
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,580
Yeah morning

30
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,740
You can give me more

31
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,740
I don't want to drink. I've had it before.

32
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,740
You eat.

33
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,740
Okay.

34
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,740
Wang Ke, there's no one to bother you today, right?

35
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,740
No, everything is fine.

36
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,740
What's wrong, sis?

37
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,740
It's okay. You eat.

38
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,740
It's pretty good.

39
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,740
I'm going to the hospital.

40
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,740
I'm going to the hospital.

41
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,740
I'm going to the hospital.

42
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,740
I'm going to the hospital.

43
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,740
I'm going to the hospital.

44
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,740
I'm going to the hospital.

45
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,740
I'm going to the hospital.

46
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,740
I'm going to the hospital.

47
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,740
I'm going to the hospital.

48
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:19,740
Where are we going?

49
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,740
It's so far away.

50
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,740
I didn't see him get off the car.

51
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,740
He's going to talk to someone.

52
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,740
Who's he talking to?

53
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,740
He's so far away.

54
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,740
I'll see.

55
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,740
I'll follow him.

56
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,740
We'll find out later.

57
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:49,740
This house looks good.

58
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,740
But it's too much.

59
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,740
It's not like home.

60
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,740
Just buy a set of money.

61
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,740
You'll have to pay first.

62
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,740
If you're afraid of getting a stable income,

63
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,740
I'll have to withdraw the money.

64
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,740
What if I break up with Mei Cheng?

65
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,740
We'll sit in the opposite side.

66
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,740
It's so embarrassing.

67
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,740
You're being bitten by snakes.

68
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,740
Why? You're not getting married for the rest of your life?

69
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,740
What's the need to sign a contract?

70
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,740
Think about it.

71
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,740
I'm not married.

72
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,740
I have a problem.

73
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:30,740
Marriage is a guarantee to women.

74
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,740
Women's guarantee is their own mind.

75
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,740
Like the fool I used to be,

76
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,740
he can't even protect me.

77
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,740
How about this?

78
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,740
I'll go to Li Xiaoyao's place to get a set of money.

79
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,740
You'll find a reliable man.

80
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,740
You're a dead girl.

81
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,740
I'm old enough to find a man.

82
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,740
I'll take the money to be a guarantee.

83
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,740
I can't imagine you.

84
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,740
Do you think I'm a man?

85
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,740
Why do you have to force me to get married?

86
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,740
You're right.

87
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,740
Mei Cheng is a man who can live a good life.

88
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,740
I said I'd find a house yesterday.

89
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,740
But the house is already cleaned up.

90
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,740
But it's just me.

91
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,740
I have a month left.

92
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,740
I'm not losing money.

93
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,740
The university of Dami is still far away.

94
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,740
It's not convenient for you to pick up the money every day.

95
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,740
Let's exchange the money for the second one.

96
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,740
It's good that you can keep the money.

97
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,740
I'm sorry.

98
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,740
I'm sorry.

99
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,740
I'm sorry.

100
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,740
I'm sorry.

101
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,740
I'm sorry.

102
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,740
I'm sorry.

103
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,740
I'm sorry.

104
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,740
I'm sorry.

105
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,740
I'm sorry.

106
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,740
I'm sorry.

107
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,740
I'm sorry.

108
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,740
I'm sorry.

109
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,740
I'm sorry.

110
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,740
I'm sorry.

111
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,740
Isn't this the new Mo Yuan?

112
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,740
Why is he here?

113
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,740
He's not going to work.

114
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,740
He's here to see his sister.

115
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,740
He doesn't know that Mo Yuan is here.

116
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,740
He's never been here before.

117
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,740
Is it Chen Yi's hand?

118
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,740
Don't put the food on the table.

119
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,740
We'll find out soon.

120
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,740
Why are you here?

121
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,740
You're useless even if you tell me?

122
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,740
Hurry up.

123
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,740
You're here.

124
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,740
You're useless even if you tell me?

125
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,740
The teacher gives the nurse every day.

126
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,740
I'm afraid that one day,

127
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,740
someone will come and take care of him.

128
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,740
Go.

129
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,740
I'm sorry.

130
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,740
Sister,

131
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,740
you're happy today.

132
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,740
My brother-in-law is criticizing me.

133
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,740
I'll arrange someone to

134
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,740
re-touch you.

135
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,740
You're making me

136
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,740
the manager of the school.

137
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,740
This kid

138
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,740
came to see his sister.

139
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,740
He still can't let go.

140
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,740
Who can let go?

141
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,740
You and I can let go.

142
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,740
But our family doesn't lack money

143
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,740
and we don't need his salary.

144
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,740
He can hire a family

145
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,740
and let the company have its salary.

146
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,740
Then I'll go back.

147
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,740
Go back and start.

148
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,740
We have to be here to take care of the students.

149
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,740
He might go to the company

150
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,740
after he sees his sister.

151
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,740
Don't let him get into trouble.

152
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,740
I'm going to work.

153
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,740
I'll come to see you tomorrow.

154
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,740
Don't go.

155
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,740
I'm going to work.

156
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,740
Go.

157
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,740
Dad.

158
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,740
Is Grandma okay?

159
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,740
Hello.

160
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,740
Mom, I'm the father of the child.

161
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,740
I'll take her to the hospital.

162
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,740
Wait a minute.

163
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,740
I'll contact Xiaobin's mom.

164
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,740
No, I'm her biological father.

165
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,740
I have the right to take her.

166
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,740
No, Xiaobin's mom has said hello to us.

167
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,740
She's the only one who can pick up the child.

168
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,740
You must communicate with her.

169
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,740
No, I don't.

170
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,740
Brother, you can't hug the child like this.

171
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,740
Dad, you can put the child on the floor first.

172
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,740
You can call her later.

173
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,740
Hurry up.

174
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,740
Let me take the child.

175
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,740
Open the door.

176
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,740
The child.

177
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,740
Open the door.

178
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,740
Open the door.

179
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,740
I can't make the phone call at this time.

180
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,740
Brother.

181
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,740
Brother.

182
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,740
I'm back.

183
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,740
You're back?

184
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,740
Yes.

185
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,740
Xiaobin.

186
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,740
Let's go.

187
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,740
Let's go.

188
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,740
Grandpa.

189
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,740
Xiao Mi.

190
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,740
Isn't she going to the kindergarten?

191
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,740
My mom is already like this.

192
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,740
She's the eldest grandson of the old family.

193
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,740
She must stay here with us.

194
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,740
Then Xu Kaiqing can agree?

195
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,740
I don't care so much.

196
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,740
Are you hiding it from her?

197
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,740
I said you're looking for a job.

198
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,740
Isn't it useful to be here at such a big place?

199
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,740
You have to hide it.

200
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,740
If you don't say hello,

201
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,740
aren't you going to get in trouble?

202
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,740
What's wrong?

203
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,740
She has been my mom for a few years.

204
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,740
She's also a mother-in-law.

205
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,740
I didn't let her stay here with us.

206
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,740
She's not bad.

207
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:27,260
Xiao Mi is my mom's

208
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,740
daughter-in-law.

209
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,740
Mom.

210
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,740
I'll give her the phone.

211
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,740
Yes.

212
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,740
No.

213
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,740
I want to eat noodles.

214
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,740
You want to buy it for you?

215
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,740
But I want to eat now.

216
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,740
Now you want to eat noodles?

217
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,740
No.

218
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,740
I want to go back to kindergarten.

219
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,740
I want to find a teacher.

220
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,740
I want to find a mother.

221
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,740
What are you doing?

222
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,740
Where are you going?

223
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,740
Let me go.

224
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,740
No.

225
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,740
Why did you hit her?

226
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,740
Why did you hit her?

227
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,740
No.

228
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,740
What do you know about the child?

229
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,740
I'm so tired.

230
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,740
Fine.

231
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,740
I'll buy it for you.

232
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,740
I told you not to be so upset.

233
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,740
You have to take it from her.

234
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,740
You can't take care of yourself.

235
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,740
You can't even talk to her.

236
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,740
You're so mean.

237
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,740
Fine.

238
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,740
I'll buy it for you.

239
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,740
Fine.

240
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,740
Come back early.

241
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,740
I think...

242
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,740
Well,

243
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,740
I think we should buy more.

244
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,740
What kind of little thing?

245
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,740
And the little flower circle.

246
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,740
The chicken ball.

247
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,740
And the small alley on the top.

248
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,740
The best selling.

249
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,740
And the big festival of the beautiful street.

250
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,740
I've made a lot of money.

251
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,740
One, two, three.

252
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,740
I've got the long-sleeved one.

253
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,740
The civil system.

254
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,740
I think we should buy some flowers today.

255
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,740
The little flower you gave your sister.

256
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,740
I think it's good.

257
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,740
Actually, I'll buy the carrot.

258
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,740
Right?

259
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,740
It's hot and refreshing.

260
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,740
Think about it.

261
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,740
The only baby on the other side.

262
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,740
So cool.

263
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,740
Chinese people

264
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,740
have to have their own heroes.

265
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,740
Yes,

266
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,740
these crying trees are all picked up.

267
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,740
Be careful.

268
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,740
Be careful.

269
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,740
Don't step on the bottom.

270
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,740
It's already late.

271
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,740
What are you doing here?

272
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,740
Why don't you go to work?

273
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,740
What work?

274
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,740
Haven't you noticed?

275
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,740
Our daughter was cheated

276
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,740
by this Kang Meng Yuan.

277
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,740
Cheated?

278
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,740
She must have known her sister.

279
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,740
I've seen her before.

280
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,740
Oh, right.

281
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,740
When the game was coming,

282
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,740
she was the one who saw the movie.

283
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,740
She saw the movie?

284
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,740
Let me see.

285
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,740
She's almost 40.

286
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,740
She's almost 20 years old.

287
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,740
She's still thinking about the game.

288
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,740
She's so stupid.

289
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,740
She's a stupid girl.

290
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,740
I don't know how to talk to her.

291
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,740
Old man.

292
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,740
What's so dirty about your hair?

293
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,740
Dad, I don't know who I am.

294
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,740
What are you doing?

295
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,740
Dad,

296
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,740
why are you so shameless?

297
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,740
How old are you?

298
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,740
You said you didn't know how to go to work.

299
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,740
We both don't agree.

300
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,740
I'm a woman.

301
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,740
Dad.

302
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,740
She's my boss.

303
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,740
What's your name?

304
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,740
I said she's my boss.

305
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,740
I'm working here.

306
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,740
Old man.

307
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,740
Brother Mei.

308
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,740
Brother Mei.

309
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,740
Look at this.

310
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,740
Put it here.

311
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,740
What's that on the screen?

312
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,740
What?

313
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,740
Her game.

314
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,740
Game?

315
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,240
This is my brother,

316
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,240
miro unrealisticist.

317
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,740
It's deranged now.

318
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,740
Don't touch Tayqicheng's words.

319
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,740
I knew.

320
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,740
What'all wants is trust.

321
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,740
They don't listen to me.

322
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,740
It's not Prould.

323
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,240
It's just me.

324
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,240
Who told them?

325
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,740
I don't give a crack to words.

326
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,740
They don't listen to my words.

327
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,740
When was this talk?

328
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,740
Not until this morning.

329
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,240
All smooth badness.

330
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,240
He's been working as a tracker.

331
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,740
Germ Illdz was not understanding play uh.

332
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,740
Then he got the kit on the ground.

333
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,740
He heard it on the antenna.

334
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,740
antenna

335
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,740
It was my brother,

336
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,740
miro mornings.

337
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,740
Meige is the white man who is holding the brother.

338
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,740
I've been with her for so many years.

339
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,740
I've seen her like this for the first time.

340
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,740
You didn't notice that we are in the same team.

341
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,740
It's even worse than yesterday.

342
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,740
What's wrong?

343
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,740
Where did you come from?

344
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,740
What's wrong?

345
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,740
Don't be surprised.

346
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,740
I heard that the boss has been married.

347
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,740
He has been married for 14 days.

348
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,740
14 days?

349
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,740
14 days.

350
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,740
He has been married for 14 days.

351
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,740
Hello, Mr. Li.

352
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,740
This...

353
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,740
This flower is for water, right?

354
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,740
This flower is for water.

355
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,740
It's very wet.

356
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,740
A lot of flowers are blowing every day.

357
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,740
Don't worry about it.

358
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,740
It's for the body.

359
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,740
Anyway, it has not닭.

360
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,740
It becomes humid.

361
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,740
It's OH aantiated.

362
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,740
It's like a ball surely.

363
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,740
Sorry, targets.

364
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,740
Mr. Li, what's wrong?

365
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,740
Long face and rich face.

366
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,540
Come and have fun.

367
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,580
What?

368
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,540
Who gave the price of Mei Cheng Yi's annual price?

369
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,540
How come I don't know?

370
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,540
That's it?

371
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,540
The fire is so big.

372
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,540
You scared me.

373
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,540
You even beat me.

374
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,540
Mei Cheng Yi gave the medical certificate of the hospital.

375
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,540
So no matter the annual price or the medical price, I have to give it.

376
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,540
You can't let people get sick.

377
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,540
You have to work hard and earn money.

378
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,540
You have to pay a fine.

379
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,540
He gave the price for half a month.

380
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,540
The payment for the three-fourth period

381
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,540
and the contract for the first half of the year.

382
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,540
What should I do?

383
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,540
I wanted to make him proud.

384
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,540
But before the next month,

385
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,540
I had to earn as much as I could.

386
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,540
Now, I'm leaving.

387
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:15,540
You have to pay a fine for the mess behind me.

388
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,540
No, no, no.

389
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,540
Mr. Li, you have to pay a fine for the mess.

390
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,540
You can solve it yourself.

391
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,540
What do you mean?

392
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,540
You want to throw the country?

393
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,540
Look at you.

394
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,540
You're young and smart.

395
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,540
I wanted to give our mutual face.

396
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,540
But Mr. Li, you just don't want it.

397
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,540
This is the annual summary of the headquarters.

398
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,540
The contracts you mentioned

399
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,540
seem to have been under your name.

400
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,540
It has nothing to do with business.

401
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,540
Why can't it be him?

402
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,540
Now, the company needs the rich.

403
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,540
Does it have anything to do with Mr. Li's lazy work?

404
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,540
I remember now.

405
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:59,540
You're the kindest person to be lazy.

406
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,540
What?

407
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,540
You're used to it.

408
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,540
You think everyone is used to you?

409
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,540
I'm done.

410
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,540
No, you...

411
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,540
That's not the kind of work you're doing.

412
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,540
Now, you're brain is blank.

413
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,540
Why are you talking to me?

414
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,540
You're asking for money?

415
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,540
What a nice situation.

416
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,540
It's all messed up.

417
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,540
I'm sorry.

418
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,540
Yes, thank you.

419
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,540
Hello?

420
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,540
It's me.

421
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,540
I didn't hear you.

422
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,540
I'm here again.

423
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,540
Hello?

424
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,540
Okay, okay.

425
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,540
Okay, okay.

426
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,540
Where are you?

427
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,540
I'm at home.

428
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,540
I just arrived.

429
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,540
I'm at the 4S store.

430
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,540
I've already handled your car.

431
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,540
I'll take you there.

432
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,540
Don't you have to work today?

433
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,540
No.

434
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,540
You're so afraid of my time.

435
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,540
I'm afraid of your time.

436
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,540
I'm afraid of your time.

437
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,540
You're so afraid of my time.

438
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,540
Don't worry. I won't change your money.

439
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,540
I've hired two-weeks of work.

440
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,540
I want to work on the repair and repair process.

441
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,540
Think about it.

442
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,540
Just take it as a tool to repair the work.

443
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,540
So, I have time now.

444
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,540
Well, are you going to come over now?

445
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,540
Yes.

446
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,540
I'll help you pack up the things.

447
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,540
How long?

448
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,540
About 20 minutes.

449
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,540
Okay, I'll take it.

450
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,540
Okay, I'll be right back.

451
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,540
Brother Mei, can you stop playing with your voice?

452
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,540
What are you doing?

453
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,540
Boss, I've never seen you

454
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,540
focus on repairing the work.

455
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,540
Is something wrong at home?

456
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,540
I'm just a little bit of a nuisance.

457
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,540
I think President Li is about to break up.

458
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,540
The company wants to take the risk of killing the fish.

459
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,540
We're not only taking the risk of the project,

460
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,540
but also taking the risk of the project

461
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,540
that everyone should take.

462
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,540
Let's take the risk.

463
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,540
At least we have a second-person plus one.

464
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,540
We can't waste the annual price.

465
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,540
What do you think?

466
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,540
I'm sorry.

467
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,540
Mom.

468
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,540
Honey.

469
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,540
How are you feeling now?

470
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,540
I'm just in the dorm.

471
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,540
Are you okay?

472
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,540
Yes.

473
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,540
I'm fine.

474
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,540
I'm fine.

475
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,540
I'm fine.

476
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,540
I'm fine.

477
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,540
I'm fine.

478
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,540
I'm fine.

479
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,540
Okay?

480
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,540
Don't be anxious.

481
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,540
Get up.

482
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,540
Come on.

483
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,540
Have some water.

484
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,540
Have some water.

485
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,540
I'll take it.

486
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,540
Come on.

487
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,540
Have some water.

488
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,540
Be careful.

489
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,540
Go home.

490
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,540
What are you doing?

491
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,540
Go home with me.

492
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,540
Don't leave me here.

493
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,540
Go home with me.

494
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,540
Mom, I'm going to work.

495
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,540
Go home.

496
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,540
Don't worry.

497
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,540
Work?

498
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,540
Is this where you work?

499
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,540
Don't waste money.

500
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,540
You're a good girl.

501
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,540
Mom.

502
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,540
I'm not going to waste money.

503
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,540
I don't know what to waste.

504
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,540
Let go of me.

505
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,540
You're not going to waste money.

506
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,540
You're not going to waste money.

507
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,540
You're a good girl.

508
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,540
You're a good girl.

509
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,540
Don't be anxious.

510
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,540
I'm telling you.

511
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,540
I'm going to raise you.

512
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,540
I'm not letting you stay here.

513
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,540
Don't worry.

514
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,540
Look at you.

515
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,540
Look at you.

516
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,540
Sit down.

517
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,540
What are you doing?

518
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,540
I'm so angry.

519
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,540
I'm so angry.

520
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,540
I'm so angry.

521
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,540
Don't be angry.

522
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,540
I'm so angry.

523
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,540
I'm so angry.

524
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,540
Youyou.

525
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,540
Come here.

526
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,540
I'm telling you.

527
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,540
Look at you.

528
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,540
You're making your mom angry.

529
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,540
I'm not angry.

530
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,540
I'm not angry.

531
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,540
I'm not angry.

532
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,540
Okay.

533
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,540
Let's not talk about this.

534
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,540
Think about it.

535
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,540
Dad and mom

536
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,540
have been so hard-working

537
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,540
to send you abroad to study abroad.

538
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,540
I hope you can have a good development in China.

539
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,540
What's the result?

540
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,540
I like this job.

541
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,540
Look.

542
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,540
What kind of job are you?

543
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,540
What are we going to tell the people?

544
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,540
Who are you going to tell?

545
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,540
Dad is like you.

546
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,540
Okay.

547
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,540
Let's not talk about this.

548
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,540
Don't forget.

549
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,540
Your mom is angry.

550
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,540
Go home.

551
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,540
Mom.

552
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,540
Come.

553
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,540
Let's go home.

554
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,540
Let's go.

555
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,540
Go.

556
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,540
Go home.

557
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,540
Go home.

558
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,540
Be careful.

559
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,540
Be careful.

560
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,540
Be careful.

561
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,540
Go.

562
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,540
Go to the villa.

563
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,540
Maybe we will be

564
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,540
left alone again.

565
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,540
Let's go.

566
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,540
Go.

567
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,540
Dad.

568
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,540
When will mom come to pick me up?

569
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,540
You can't talk for five minutes.

570
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,540
Five minutes.

571
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,540
Dad.

572
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,540
I'm thirsty.

573
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,540
Okay.

574
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,540
I'll buy some for you.

575
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,540
Okay.

576
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,540
Don't be noisy.

577
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,540
Don't be noisy.

578
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,540
Dad.

579
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,540
I want to pee.

580
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,540
Aren't you thirsty?

581
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,540
You want to pee.

582
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,540
What do you want?

583
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,540
I'm going to pee my pants.

584
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,540
Are you done?

585
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,540
Mom is so noisy.

586
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,540
Hurry up.

587
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,540
Hello.

588
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,540
Okay.

589
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,540
I'm in the hospital.

590
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,540
I'm busy.

591
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,540
I'm busy.

592
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,540
Dad, I'm busy.

593
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,540
I'm going to pee.

594
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,540
Dad.

595
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,540
Dad.

596
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,540
Dad, I'm in trouble.

597
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,540
I'm conscious.

598
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,540
The symptoms are all stable.

599
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,540
They are all cured.

600
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,540
I feel that

601
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,540
I've been through this.

602
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,540
I'm not in trouble.

603
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,540
Thank you.

604
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,540
Thank you.

605
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,540
Thank you.

606
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,540
Thank you.

607
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,540
I've seen you here

608
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,540
for two days.

609
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,540
You really treat the elderly well.

610
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,540
You'd better go back.

611
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,540
It's normal for a patient

612
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,540
to take care of such a patient.

613
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,540
If you ruin your own health,

614
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,540
you'll be fine.

615
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,540
Thank you.

616
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,540
By the way,

617
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,540
I remember last month

618
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,540
I attended a research conference.

619
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,540
There was a lab abroad.

620
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,540
They provided a new

621
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,540
treatment and plan.

622
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,540
If the elderly have a suitable business plan,

623
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,540
you can try it.

624
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,540
Otherwise, it's a waste.

625
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,540
The average family

626
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,540
really can't afford it.

627
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,540
It's okay.

628
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,540
It doesn't matter.

629
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,540
As long as there is a limit,

630
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,540
I'm willing to try it.

631
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,540
Okay.

632
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,540
Then I'll ask

633
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,540
the director of this research conference

634
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,540
if he can help you contact him.

635
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,540
Thank you.

636
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,540
Thank you.

637
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,540
Thank you.

638
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,540
It's okay.

639
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,540
Let's go.

640
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,540
This guy is not so bad.

641
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,540
He's also so filial.

642
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,540
Where's the rice?

643
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,540
What are you doing?

644
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,540
Don't move.

645
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,540
What are you doing?

646
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,540
What are you doing?

647
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,540
Are you crazy?

648
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,540
Do you see a child?

649
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,540
I don't see a child.

650
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,540
What are you doing?

651
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,540
Are you crazy?

652
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,540
You're a child.

653
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,540
What are you doing?

654
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,540
Are you crazy?

655
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,540
You're a child.

656
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,540
Don't move.

657
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,540
What's wrong?

658
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,540
How can you leave such a small child

659
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,540
out of the question?

660
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,540
You won't take him back.

661
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,540
What else can you do?

662
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,540
Don't lie to me.

663
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,540
Don't lie to me.

664
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,540
Jesus.

665
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,540
Jesus.

666
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,540
Jesus.

667
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,540
Hello, sir.

668
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,540
This is Mr. Mei.

669
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,540
Hello.

670
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,540
Mr. Mei.

671
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,540
I'm...

672
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,540
Your dinner.

673
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,540
Take it.

674
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,540
Goodbye.

675
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,540
Goodbye.

676
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,540
Xiao Yan.

677
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,540
I'm going to take the wedding ring today.

678
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,540
Take it.

679
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,540
I'm going to take you

680
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,540
as a god.

681
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,540
I'll take you there.

682
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,540
Let's go.

683
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,540
Oh.

684
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,540
Yeah.

685
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,540
I've heard it.

686
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,540
I've heard it.

687
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,540
I've fixed the adverts.

688
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,540
I can't tell.

689
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,540
Thank you.

690
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,540
You're welcome.

691
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,540
I'm still thinking about it.

692
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,540
He went to the old college

693
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,540
to take the class.

694
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,540
He can come back in a few hours.

695
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,540
Hurry up.

696
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,540
What's the hurry?

697
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,540
The advance is ready.

698
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,540
You can order it.

699
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,540
Why are you fixing it?

700
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,540
You used it.

701
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,540
It's not important.

702
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,540
Before the agreement,

703
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,540
we have to make the advance.

704
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,540
We need to make sure

705
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,540
that everyone goes.

706
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,540
Wait a minute.

707
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,540
Do you want to call Li Xie

708
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,540
and ask me to take the class?

709
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,540
No, I can't.

710
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,540
I'm like this now.

711
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,540
I'm so worried.

712
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,540
I have a crush on someone.

713
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,540
She's been looking for me.

714
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,540
I don't know how to meet her.

715
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,540
Sister Li, where are you?

716
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,540
I brought fish and soup when you're back.

717
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,540
I think it's four o'clock

718
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,540
in the old college.

719
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,540
You can pick up Xiaomin.

720
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,540
You pick up Da Li.

721
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,540
Don't worry, Mo Shang.

722
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,540
Don't worry.

723
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,540
What if Li Xie is your girlfriend?

724
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,540
Hello?

725
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,540
What?

726
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,540
What's wrong?

727
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,540
Xiaomin was taken away by the money.

728
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,540
She's lost in the hospital.

729
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,540
Don't worry.

730
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,540
We'll be there soon.

731
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,540
Sit down.

732
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,540
I'm going.

733
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,540
Aunt,

734
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,540
bring me the smoke stick.

735
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,540
It's so hot, my dear.

736
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,540
I'm almost dead.

737
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,540
I'm almost dead.

738
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,540
Thank you.

739
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,540
Aunt,

740
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,540
look, my hand is all wet.

741
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,540
Hurry and get me the hand cream.

742
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,540
Here's your hand cream.

743
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,540
Thank you.

744
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,540
Baby,

745
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,540
I think you're doing well.

746
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,540
How about this?

747
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,540
Come here.

748
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,540
I'll go and lie down.

749
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,540
You slept for more than

750
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,540
an hour in the headroom,

751
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,540
okay?

752
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,540
It's tiring to fly.

753
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:22,540
You'll be in the hotel if you're tired.

754
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,540
You're a father and son-in-law.

755
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,540
Why did you lie down

756
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,540
when I'm sitting here?

757
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,540
And,

758
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,540
I have to tell you,

759
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,540
this nurse is also an old man.

760
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,540
She paid me for it.

761
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,540
She didn't come to take care of you.

762
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,540
Do you have a conscience?

763
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,540
Your mother came to pick you up

764
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,540
to get you on a plane.

765
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,540
What did you take care of me?

766
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,540
Other things.

767
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,540
You ate the ice cream.

768
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,540
The toilet is for you.

769
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,540
Aunt paid me for it.

770
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,540
What did you do?

771
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,540
I'm here to accompany you.

772
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,540
This is what you need the most.

773
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,540
Baby,

774
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,540
I know you love me the most.

775
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,540
Right?

776
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,540
Mom,

777
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,540
I love you so much.

778
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,540
I love you so much.

779
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,540
Then,

780
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,540
go back to your room

781
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,540
and have a good rest.

782
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,540
Okay?

783
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,540
You can take care of me

784
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,540
when you're done.

785
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,540
I want to rest too.

786
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,540
Mom,

787
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,540
you really don't need me.

788
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,540
Okay.

789
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,540
I'll go to your uncle's house.

790
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,540
Have a good night.

791
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,540
I'll come to visit you

792
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,540
when you're awake.

793
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,540
You have money.

794
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,540
Can you open a hotel by yourself?

795
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,540
Don't bother to bother my uncle.

796
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,540
Sister is a good girl.

797
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,540
It's normal.

798
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,540
Bye-bye.

799
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,540
Mom,

800
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,540
mom.

801
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,540
I'm sorry.

802
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,540
Miss,

803
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,540
that big sister

804
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,540
was your mom.

805
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,540
She's a good girl.

806
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,540
She's a good mother.

807
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,540
But,

808
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,540
she did something on purpose.

809
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,540
This is the first time

810
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,540
I've seen such a mother.

811
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,540
I thought she was protecting her.

812
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,540
How is my mother?

813
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,540
What's your problem?

814
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,540
You're a good girl.

815
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,540
You're not different.

816
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,540
I'm doing this for your own good.

817
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,540
I'm asking you.

818
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,540
I'm asking you.

819
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,540
I'm asking you.

820
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,540
I'm asking you.

821
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,540
I'm asking you.

822
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,540
I'm asking you to take care of me.

823
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,540
I'm not here to discuss our family matters.

824
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,540
I'm here to take care of you.

825
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,540
I'm here to take care of you.

826
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,540
Sister,

827
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:11,540
don't do it.

828
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,540
You're more troublesome than you are.

829
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,540
I'm not going to do it.

830
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,540
Give me money.

831
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,540
Xiaobin.

832
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,540
Xiaobin.

833
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,540
Mom.

834
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,540
Why are you here?

835
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,540
Dad is in my house.

836
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,540
I can't find him.

837
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,540
I miss you so much.

838
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,540
I want to find noodles.

839
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,540
Aunt Hu Shu is here to eat noodles.

840
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,540
And I want to see them.

841
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,540
Okay, okay.

842
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,540
The child is fine.

843
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,540
Let's go home.

844
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,540
It's okay.

845
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,540
Let's go.

846
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,540
Let's go.

847
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,540
Xiaobin.

848
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,540
What are you running?

849
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,540
You just found me.

850
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,540
I'm so worried.

851
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,540
What are you doing?

852
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,540
You're making the child.

853
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,540
Why are you still here?

854
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,540
Is it my fault?

855
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,540
I can't run away from my home.

856
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,540
You can't take care of my child.

857
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,540
What are you doing here?

858
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,540
I'm telling you,

859
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,540
you're my old friend.

860
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,540
It's none of your business.

861
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,540
Xiaobin.

862
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,540
Xiaobin.

863
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,540
What's wrong with you?

864
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,540
You're almost awake.

865
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,540
I'm still here.

866
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,540
What are you doing?

867
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,540
Who told you I'm here?

868
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,540
You didn't mention it.

869
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,540
I didn't.

870
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,540
He's my girlfriend.

871
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,540
You've been together for so long.

872
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,540
You're now a nurse.

873
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,540
How could I not take care of you?

874
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,540
I won't tell you.

875
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,540
Xiaobin.

876
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,540
What's wrong with you?

877
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,540
I'm warning you.

878
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,540
From now on,

879
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,540
you can't see my two children.

880
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,540
They're all money.

881
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,540
Why can't they be in the hospital?

882
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,540
When you're with your grandma,

883
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,540
where are you?

884
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,540
You're crying in the yard.

885
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,540
You're not sleeping.

886
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,540
When I went to the hospital with you,

887
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,540
where are you?

888
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,540
You and Xiaobin

889
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,540
were planning to

890
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,540
take care of

891
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,540
my child's house.

892
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,540
Do you have any idea

893
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,540
what they're doing?

894
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,540
I'm telling you,

895
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,540
these two kids

896
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:00,540
are not for your child's sake.

897
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,540
After Xiaomin and Dami

898
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,540
have a chance to get together,

899
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,540
I'll let you get your life back.

900
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,540
Let's go.

901
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,540
Stand up.

902
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,540
Hello, wife.

903
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:31,540
Xia Chenggong,

904
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,540
come home with me.

905
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:33,540
Right now.

906
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,540
What's going on?

907
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,540
I have to send a message to the Yuge.

908
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,540
Okay.

909
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,540
As long as you're not afraid

910
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,540
I'll be with you for a while.

911
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,540
Do you want to go back?

912
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,540
I'm not going to go back.

913
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,540
I'm not going to go back.

914
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,540
I'm not going to go back.

915
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,540
I'm not going to go back.

916
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:54,540
I'm not going to go back.

917
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,540
I'm not going to go back.

918
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,540
I'm not going to go back.

919
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,540
The front front head,

920
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,540
move forward.

921
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:01,540
The more you move, the better.

922
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,540
President Xiao,

923
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,540
can we get together?

924
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,540
Please.

925
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:05,540
What can we do?

926
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:06,540
This is important.

927
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:15,540
The operation is going well.

928
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,540
The operation is stable.

929
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,540
You have a purple attack machine.

930
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,540
This needs to be taken into account.

931
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,540
The child's weight is getting bigger.

932
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,540
The machine will be affected by the speed

933
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,540
and the child will grow faster.

934
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:28,540
It's easier to wipe out the blood.

935
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:29,540
So,

936
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,540
after five or six months,

937
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,540
I still suggest that I take the baby.

938
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,540
If it's raw, it's a waste.

939
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,540
I'll take the baby away at once.

940
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:40,540
Doctor, I want to go to the hospital.

941
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:43,540
Okay.

942
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:45,540
I'll give you a hospital bill.

943
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,540
Write the prescription and the transplant.

944
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,540
Okay.

945
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:49,540
Let me do it.

946
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,540
Okay.
