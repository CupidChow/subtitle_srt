1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Cinderella yen

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I see your pain

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And your bravery too

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Some things we cannot just embrace

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And there's no time to get stuck on the past

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Create a day line, go to the free

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let's cross the wind, dance in rain

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Let the stars in the room and never wait

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh, this I feel is happiness

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
They are all part of a journey

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Oh, this I feel is happiness

12
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 2

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
How is it?

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Go to the public office.

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Why go to the public office?

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Sign a contract.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Qian Hao said that if he wants to take Xiao Mi away again,

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
the house will be divided into two.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I...

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Why can't I believe it?

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I don't believe it either.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
How can a dog change to eat gold?

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Then why do you want to sign it?

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's not like we can never see each other again.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
This is a layer of guarantee.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Anyway, I've decided that if it happens again,

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
we'll take the house back.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Passed! Passed!

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Why did you say I was the leader?

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You have to pass the test.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Didn't you say that these two are not divorcing?

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The internal division is already here.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
If you can't do it on the left, let's go to the right.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Wife owes money, husband pays.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's natural.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
If it doesn't work, double the money.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Okay, okay, okay.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I have a picture of his wife.

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
This bad girl is very beautiful.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
She posts selfies every day.

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm going to change my hair.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
How about this?

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I download a small yellow film.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Change it to her wife's face and send it to her husband.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You see, the cheater is more than a dozen.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
If you don't go in time, you'll be eliminated.

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yan Da, do you still need to download it?

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I have a picture of the blind.

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I have this. Open it.

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
This, this.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Look, Yan Da, Yan Da.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yes, get up, get up, get up.

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What's wrong with you?

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Get up.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Mom, look at you.

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Don't you want to divorce?

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Want to continue?

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Okay, I'll take you there now.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
No, who doesn't divorce?

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
My grandson doesn't divorce.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So, if you want to divorce, why are you so half-dead?

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's like no one has ever broken up.

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I tell you, your aunt went to buy that very delicious roast wheat.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Let's get up and try on clothes.

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Go, go to the roast wheat.

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Mom, I don't eat it.

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's boring to eat, it's boring to drink, it's boring to live.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
This roast wheat is so delicious.

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Start over, don't think about these.

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Get up.

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I don't eat it.

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
This roast wheat is delicious.

73
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You can't eat it when you go abroad.

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You really don't eat it?

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Then I'll eat it all.

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm leaving.

77
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Mom, eat more.

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
This roast wheat is really delicious.

79
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Some people really don't eat it when they go abroad.

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
100,000 yuan

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
100,000 yuan, take a break.

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Otherwise, this video will be broadcasted to your and your wife's friends and family on the same phone.

83
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
300,000 yuan, take a break.

84
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Otherwise, this video will be broadcasted to your and your wife's friends and family on the same phone.

85
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
100,000 yuan, take a break.

86
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What are you doing?

87
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
100,000 yuan is scary enough, you still change it to 300,000 yuan.

88
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
They are going to divorce.

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Which idiot can give 300,000 yuan to the right wife?

90
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You are going to pay 300,000 yuan to the right wife.

91
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Did you forget what the teacher said in class?

92
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Reality is often lower than your psychological expectation.

93
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You want to control the person to ask for 100,000 yuan.

94
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Then you have to leave some space for people to fight.

95
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What is it?

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You can do it.

97
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's all secret.

98
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Come and see, learn.

99
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Learn, learn, learn.

100
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
The money is all here.

101
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Look, look, look.

102
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I see that you look beautiful.

103
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Really handsome.

104
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Really handsome.

105
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Can the little head of teacher do this?

106
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Real handsome.

107
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Really handsome.

108
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Stunning.

109
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Then I'm going to school and work for a while.

110
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Then I will learn letter and call again.

111
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Then extended right foot.

112
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Then longè…³.

113
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You shouldn't take.

114
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Look often away.

115
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
After looking hard.

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
In the case of running rear wheel.

117
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What are your parents?

118
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Mmm.

119
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,840
I'm so worried.

120
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,440
And my master.

121
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,840
He said he was sick.

122
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,360
He quit his job.

123
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,840
It's been half a month.

124
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,760
He didn't answer my calls or messages.

125
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,600
He left me alone.

126
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,040
I seriously suspect

127
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,720
he went out to work.

128
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,600
He left his poor little disciple

129
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,760
to work alone.

130
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,920
But, sister,

131
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,080
I'm here every day.

132
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,920
I feel so relieved.

133
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,640
I feel like

134
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,680
you're watching over me.

135
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,360
I'm going to work.

136
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,480
I'll come to see you tomorrow.

137
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,440
I'm going to work.

138
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,600
I'll come to see you tomorrow.

139
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,000
How is it?

140
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,600
Did you receive the flowers I sent you?

141
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,040
It's not here yet.

142
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,640
I have something more important to do.

143
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,720
Something more important?

144
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,600
What is it?

145
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,920
You're not sitting here?

146
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,720
Ms. Liu.

147
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,600
Are you free?

148
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,320
Let's talk.

149
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,560
Sure, I'm free.

150
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,160
Let's go.

151
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,840
Don't worry, boss.

152
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,920
Where is your mom now?

153
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,560
At home.

154
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,880
She's lying in bed.

155
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,040
How about this?

156
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,640
After you're free,

157
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,000
I'll send you the food.

158
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,960
Give me a pack of five-cent powder.

159
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,240
How?

160
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,680
The old rules.

161
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,440
The deposit.

162
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,160
If these two kids don't feel wronged,

163
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,120
I'll give them to you.

164
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,080
I'm their father.

165
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,040
Really?

166
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,000
Okay, fine.

167
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,480
Qu Happy.

168
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,160
What time is it?

169
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:23,680
Why aren't you here yet?

170
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,920
You have a business today.

171
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,520
But you went to the secret hospital.

172
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,040
Why are you here?

173
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,160
I can't come to the secret hospital.

174
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,440
I also brought you

175
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,400
a messenger.

176
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,520
Song Ran, talk to him.

177
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,040
Boss Xu.

178
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,120
Can we hurry up?

179
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,040
Don't be too anxious.

180
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,920
Hurry up.

181
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,520
Okay, I'll be there soon.

182
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,440
Okay.

183
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:44,920
Who?

184
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,920
Song Ran and Xiaoxiao.

185
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,680
They're having a chat.

186
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,160
What?

187
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,560
It's all a dream.

188
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,800
Thank you.

189
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,000
Mr. Li,

190
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,560
Mei Cheng colleagues added thosemÃªme to the HR office.

191
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,920
keit.

192
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,480
We must fix this.

193
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,440
Don't be so polite. Just treat this place as your own home.

194
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,880
It's a bit more relaxed.

195
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,440
Come, come. I'll get you some snacks.

196
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,480
Here, eat.

197
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,280
Okay.

198
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:44,080
How is it? How's your year-end vacation going?

199
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,000
It's pretty good.

200
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,320
This should be the most comfortable day in my career.

201
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,480
You're comfortable.

202
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,600
Our side is almost a mess.

203
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,920
You're talking about the company's disbandment, right?

204
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,320
Didn't Director Lei tell you?

205
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,600
So spicy.

206
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,400
How is this spicy?

207
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,680
I wanted to talk about the disbandment,

208
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,240
but it might be different from what you think.

209
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,120
Director Li is the one who's going to disband the company.

210
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,720
I hope you can take his place.

211
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,440
What?

212
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,280
What kind of joke is this?

213
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,480
What kind of joke is this?

214
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,520
I want to say it too.

215
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,960
Is this a joke?

216
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,760
You're not eating?

217
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,720
No, I...

218
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,560
Okay, I won't be polite then.

219
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,760
Look.

220
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,920
My uncle is just talking nonsense.

221
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,880
I'll be the one who's going to offend him.

222
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,920
I realized that if I'm the one he likes,

223
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,640
I'm the one who's going to beg his grandpa and grandma to leave him.

224
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,760
We're all working.

225
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,560
We're in the underworld.

226
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,160
We should understand each other.

227
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,200
But...

228
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,520
The company wants to take our whole team.

229
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,880
Do you think it's possible?

230
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,280
You've been resting for so long.

231
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,160
Your team has been off work for so long.

232
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,360
The weekly and monthly reports of the company

233
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,400
have become so ugly.

234
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,680
Do you think the company doesn't understand

235
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,400
who's the problem?

236
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,080
My uncle just came back from abroad.

237
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,280
He's been on the top three.

238
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,560
He's not a mess.

239
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,440
In my opinion,

240
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,320
Mr. Li is too young, too naive,

241
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,520
and too smart.

242
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,720
He wants to use people on one side,

243
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,120
and he wants to suppress them on the other.

244
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,000
In the end, he's the only one who has the performance and credit.

245
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,720
Something happened.

246
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,320
The blame is on you.

247
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,280
That's why the company thinks your team is a fake.

248
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,320
Now the company is going to open it.

249
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,000
Don't blame the company for being cruel.

250
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,800
It's just a trick.

251
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,800
No.

252
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,960
No matter what,

253
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,440
he's still my master after all.

254
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,080
Yeah.

255
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,880
I didn't say he's not your master.

256
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,720
Your master also said you're too stingy.

257
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,720
He can take care of you.

258
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,200
Now the company is going to open you.

259
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,480
He can't handle your work.

260
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,400
Don't worry.

261
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,920
Everything is under my control.

262
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,840
I've made a new consideration.

263
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,240
Your master is the senior manager.

264
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,880
His annual salary, bonus, social security, and pay,

265
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,400
are all high-level.

266
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,440
The company almost gave him the stock.

267
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,680
Fortunately, something like this happened.

268
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,480
He was anxious, so he admitted to me.

269
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,320
Your team is the big anime of the whole department.

270
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,840
It's totally different from the annual summary

271
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,480
he gave to the headquarters in previous years.

272
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,720
I've re-examined it.

273
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,440
I think it's more appropriate to reduce the capital to increase the school

274
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,320
or to reduce his capital to increase mine.

275
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,760
Well, I'm sorry.

276
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,600
Brother-in-law came to see you again.

277
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,280
We signed an agreement.

278
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,480
Of course.

279
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,080
Our circle is not big.

280
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,160
I know the company you're working for.

281
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,120
I know who you're talking to.

282
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,200
Here's the thing.

283
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,240
After Mr. Li left,

284
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,760
his position is yours.

285
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,120
The bottom line and the whole line are different now.

286
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,520
It will definitely satisfy you.

287
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,120
But I'm telling you in advance.

288
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,920
After he left,

289
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,320
your team will have to fire two more people.

290
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,640
Is there any trouble with Happy?

291
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,120
You don't believe it?

292
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,560
It seems that other companies have given a lot.

293
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,640
Oh, no.

294
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,880
I think the company is going to be in big trouble.

295
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,560
How about this?

296
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,240
If you're really not satisfied,

297
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,240
we can talk about the proportion of the proposal.

298
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,280
Well, I'm sorry.

299
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:02,960
Here's the thing.

300
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,720
I have something important to deal with.

301
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,240
I understand what the company means.

302
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,320
I'll go back and take a good test.

303
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,560
I'll tell you first.

304
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,600
Hey, no.

305
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,160
Oh, no.

306
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:13,920
This is bad.

307
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,960
If we can't keep it,

308
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,240
the company will lose a lot.

309
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,960
Did I not perform sincerely enough just now?

310
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,720
This snack must be not to his taste.

311
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,920
I'm the only one who can't do it.

312
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,400
How can I pull him?

313
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,920
Dad.

314
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,200
You're back.

315
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,680
How's my mom?

316
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,760
Good.

317
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,560
She had a bowl of noodles in the morning and now she's sleeping.

318
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,920
Dad,

319
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,920
you can't do it if you can't do it.

320
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,040
I'll just go back to my aunt.

321
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,440
You want to piss your mom off?

322
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,560
And a woman cooks with me every day.

323
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,560
You don't have to think about it.

324
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,640
You know what she'll do.

325
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,240
Then you can just find a male aunt.

326
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,640
Forget it.

327
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,880
You're a family.

328
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,080
You can't do it.

329
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,120
You can't do it.

330
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,200
You can't do it.

331
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,200
You can't do it.

332
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,200
You can't do it.

333
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,200
You can't do it.

334
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,200
You can't do it.

335
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
You can't do it.

336
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,200
You can't do it.

337
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,960
It's weird to have a stranger at home.

338
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,960
I can handle it.

339
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,040
I figured it out before retirement.

340
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,040
People have to learn to embrace change.

341
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,880
I'll go to sleep.

342
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,640
I'll go to sleep.

343
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,920
Then I'll go to sleep with you.

344
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,440
She's back.

345
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,440
She's back.

346
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,440
She's really confused.

347
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,680
She thought I was in the video.

348
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,440
That fool.

349
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,720
She thought she was wearing a green hat.

350
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,720
Or they would have a divorce.

351
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,720
You bitch.

352
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,720
You let us cheat five thousand.

353
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,720
That's enough.

354
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,720
You have to cheat ten thousand.

355
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,720
You're the result of your bad luck.

356
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,720
I'm your retribution.

357
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,720
How do we go back?

358
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,720
How do we go back?

359
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,720
Burn the firewood in her house.

360
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,720
You do it.

361
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,720
You do it.

362
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,720
Stop talking nonsense.

363
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,720
We're broke.

364
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,720
If you give us the money,

365
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,720
we'll delete the video.

366
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,720
We swear to God,

367
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,720
we won't leave any evidence.

368
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,720
But if you don't want to,

369
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,720
I'll post it on the website.

370
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,720
Let everyone appreciate your wife's bad luck.

371
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,720
Know you're green and watered down.

372
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,720
I advise you not to call the police.

373
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,720
The police are busy every day.

374
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,720
They're not in the mood to do such a thing.

375
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,720
I'll post the video on the website.

376
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,720
You won't catch it.

377
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,720
Only the reputation of the loser.

378
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,720
Think it over.

379
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,720
I'll give you only twelve hours to think about it.

380
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,720
The money is in place tonight.

381
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,720
See you online.

382
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,720
Are you there?

383
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,720
Stop talking nonsense.

384
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,720
Why did you tell her so much?

385
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,720
She's not in the mood.

386
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,720
You're so smelly and long.

387
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,720
I'll say it in six words.

388
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,720
You're so arrogant.

389
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,720
I'll kill you if you don't pay me.

390
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,720
Let's get to work.

391
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,720
Happy Cake. Newly opened.

392
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,720
Take this leaflet.

393
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,720
We'll eat it for free today.

394
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,720
The cake is delicious.

395
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,720
You'll be happy after eating it.

396
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,720
Okay.

397
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,720
Beauty.

398
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,720
Happy Cake. Newly opened.

399
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,720
Take this leaflet. Free to eat.

400
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,720
It's not good to wait for me.

401
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,720
Really?

402
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,720
It's free.

403
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,720
Really?

404
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,720
I'll buy it after eating it.

405
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,720
Beauty.

406
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,720
Hello.

407
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,720
Happy Cake. Free to eat today.

408
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,720
You can get it for free.

409
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,720
Come on.

410
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,720
Thank you.

411
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,720
Hello.

412
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,720
Come and see our cake shop.

413
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,720
We just opened it.

414
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,720
It's very good.

415
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,720
There are many kinds.

416
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,720
There's a cake card.

417
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,720
Hello.

418
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,720
Welcome.

419
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,720
We have activities for you to buy today.

420
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,720
Come and see.

421
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,720
We have everything.

422
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,720
We have activities.

423
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,720
Thank you.

424
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,720
I'll buy it for you.

425
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,720
WeChat.

426
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,720
I'll buy it for you.

427
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,720
Happy Cake.

428
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,720
I'll call you next time.

429
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,720
Okay.

430
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,720
Yes.

431
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,720
Don't be shy.

432
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,720
Only one left.

433
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,720
Come on.

434
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,720
I'll get it for you.

435
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,720
This is for you.

436
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,720
Wait a minute.

437
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,720
What else do you want?

438
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,720
Happy Cake.

439
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,720
I'll buy it for you.

440
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,720
The next one is so fast.

441
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,720
I'll prepare more next time.

442
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,720
Come on.

443
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,720
Come on.

444
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,720
Here it is.

445
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,720
Come on.

446
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,720
Welcome.

447
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,720
Thank you.

448
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,720
Come on.

449
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,720
Give it to me.

450
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,720
Give me three.

451
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,720
Thank you.

452
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,720
This one.

453
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,720
I'll buy it for you.

454
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,720
I'm going to be hot.

455
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,720
Give it to him.

456
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,720
Wait a minute.

457
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,720
No.

458
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,720
No.

459
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,720
Li Li.

460
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,720
It's too cold.

461
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,720
Boss Xu.

462
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,720
You can't drink cold water.

463
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,720
You know?

464
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,720
No.

465
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,720
Because I and Ran Ran are going to be pregnant.

466
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,720
We want a little fairy who belongs to us.

467
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,720
So he said that

468
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,720
his daughter must be like me.

469
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,720
She's pretty.

470
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,720
Can you talk straight?

471
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,720
And you two.

472
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,720
Why don't you go to the hospital?

473
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,720
Why are you here?

474
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,720
I gave you my red hair.

475
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,720
I'm a person of high status.

476
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,720
I'll leave after you finish your business.

477
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,720
Don't worry.

478
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,720
Xu Happy.

479
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,720
You and I are always the rightful concubines.

480
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,720
Our Ran Ran is a noble consort.

481
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,720
What's wrong with you?

482
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,720
You're so annoying.

483
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,720
Forget it.

484
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,720
Sit here.

485
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,720
Hey.

486
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,720
Miss me?

487
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,720
She came to you.

488
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,720
I'm going now.

489
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,720
No.

490
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,720
She signed a contract with me.

491
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,720
If you take four children with you in the future,

492
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,720
the previous property will be half of me.

493
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,720
I'm not stupid.

494
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,720
I'm not stupid.

495
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,720
I'll go to the justice office right away.

496
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,720
Okay.

497
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,720
That's good.

498
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,720
How's business today?

499
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,720
The first three days are the most popular.

500
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,720
But the volume is still okay.

501
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,720
Okay.

502
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,720
Go back to your work.

503
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,720
I might leave today.

504
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,720
I'll wait for you when I'm done.

505
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,720
Okay.

506
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,720
Okay. See you tonight.

507
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,720
Bye.

508
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,720
Bye.

509
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,720
Mr. Lei.

510
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,720
Did Mr. Liu talk to you?

511
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,720
I lost.

512
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,720
You're like this.

513
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,720
I told you a few months ago.

514
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,720
You were already in the company's contract list.

515
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,720
You said you would listen to me.

516
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,720
I can help you say a few words

517
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,720
after you finish your work.

518
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,720
But you're a bad guy.

519
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,720
You just took a break from your family.

520
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,720
You're a man.

521
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,720
You have two children.

522
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,720
What should you do?

523
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,720
We've been trying to get along for so many years.

524
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,720
Right?

525
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,720
If you need my help in the future,

526
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,720
just tell me.

527
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,720
Do you hear me?

528
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,720
Don't be embarrassed.

529
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,720
Go.

530
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,720
Go.

531
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,720
Mom.

532
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,720
Why didn't you call me when you were in the bathroom?

533
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,720
I was helping you.

534
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,720
What if you fell down?

535
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,720
I'm fine.

536
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,720
Come on.

537
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,720
Sit down.

538
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,720
Why are you so loud?

539
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,720
You called me.

540
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,720
I'm home.

541
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,720
You're right.

542
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,720
I'll ask Da Xiaomi to come with you tonight.

543
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,720
Really?

544
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,720
Really.

545
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,720
I can see my grandson.

546
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,720
Wait.

547
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,720
Hold on.

548
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,720
Hurry.

549
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,720
Xiaomi will talk to us soon.

550
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,720
Xu...

551
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,720
Xu Happy.

552
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,720
Is she coming?

553
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,720
I contacted a life research institute in Guai.

554
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,720
They have a new drug.

555
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,720
I heard it's very useful.

556
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,720
I want to take you there.

557
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,720
By the way,

558
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,720
let's take Xiaomi out of the house.

559
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,720
As long as we get out,

560
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,720
Xu Happy won't find us.

561
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,720
Can...

562
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,720
Can this work?

563
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,720
But...

564
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,720
As long as we get out,

565
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,720
no one will care about the emperor or the emperor.

566
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,720
Right?

567
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,720
And then,

568
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,720
father, grandfather, grandmother,

569
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,720
and their grandchildren will be out of the country.

570
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,720
It shouldn't be illegal.

571
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,720
It won't be illegal.

572
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,720
It won't be illegal.

573
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,720
It won't be illegal.

574
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,720
It's okay.

575
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,720
Then,

576
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,720
we have to do this quickly.

577
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,720
Hurry up.

578
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,720
Don't worry.

579
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,720
I've already done it.

580
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,720
I've already quit my job.

581
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,720
I'll go to sell houses.

582
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,720
As for this,

583
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,720
I won't be back for a while.

584
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,720
Don't do this.

585
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,720
You can't do this at night.

586
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,720
The big picture is the mirror.

587
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,720
You can't let her see it.

588
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,720
Okay?

589
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,720
I know.

590
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,720
Then,

591
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,720
what about the baby in Xiao Qiao's belly?

592
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,720
Or,

593
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,720
don't argue with her.

594
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,720
After she's born,

595
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,720
we'll think of a way.

596
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,720
Anyway, you have a little secret now.

597
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,720
I'm telling you the truth.

598
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,720
I divorced with Hu Xiao Qiao.

599
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,720
The baby in her belly

600
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,720
is not mine.

601
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,720
How could this happen?

602
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,720
Mom, don't be angry.

603
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,720
Don't be like this.

604
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,720
I'm just afraid of others.

605
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,720
I didn't tell you.

606
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,720
Mom.

607
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,720
Mom, don't be angry.

608
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,720
It's okay.

609
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,720
Don't be angry.

610
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,720
It's okay.

611
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,720
It's okay.

612
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,720
I've already seen it.

613
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,720
Hu Jin is not a person who can live.

614
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,720
He just...

615
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,720
He just pitied my son.

616
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,720
But,

617
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,720
it's really...

618
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,720
It's been delayed.

619
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,720
Don't say that.

620
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,720
I have my own problem.

621
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,720
Your problem is that you're too kind.

622
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,720
You're too nice to him.

623
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,720
You want to say

624
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,720
how to sing a song?

625
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,720
The freedom you gave him

626
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,720
is too much.

627
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,720
Too much.

628
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,720
I'm sorry.

629
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,720
I'm sorry.

630
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,720
I'm sorry.

631
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,720
I'm sorry.

632
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,720
I'm sorry.

633
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,720
I'm sorry.

634
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,720
I'm sorry.

635
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,720
I'm sorry.

636
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,720
I'm sorry.

637
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,720
I'm sorry.

638
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,720
I'm sorry.

639
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,720
I'm sorry.

640
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,720
I'm sorry.

641
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,720
I'm sorry.

642
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,720
I'm sorry.

643
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,720
I'm sorry.

644
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,720
I'm sorry.

645
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,720
I'm sorry.

646
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,720
I'm sorry.

647
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,720
I'm sorry.

648
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,720
I'm sorry.

649
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,720
I'm sorry.

650
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,720
I'm sorry.

651
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,720
I'm sorry.

652
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,720
I'm sorry.

653
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,720
I'm sorry.

654
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,720
I'm sorry.

655
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,720
I'm sorry.

656
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,720
I'm sorry.

657
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,920
I'm sorry.

658
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,920
I'm sorry.

659
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,920
I'm sorry.

660
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,720
Excuse me.

661
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,720
Can you say hello to me?

662
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,720
I'll take you upstairs.

663
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,720
Let me put on my earphones.

664
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,720
This one...

665
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,720
You can come down later.

666
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,720
Say hello to me.

667
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,720
Barely heard you say hi.

668
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,720
What's the meaning of it?

669
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,720
Just take my earphones.

670
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,720
Happy birthday dear closely

671
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,700
soon

672
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,600
healthy

673
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,460
every COVID-19

674
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,580
we guard them

675
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,040
to make up for discrepancies

676
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,000
I am so dead

677
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,720
you two young men are still not as good as me

678
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,880
not even great

679
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:00,500
not as good as me

680
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,780
I'm so sorry.

681
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,500
Shu Kai Qi, why didn't Mei Cheng Yi

682
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,380
come to help?

683
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,900
Mei Cheng Yi helped me

684
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,180
with the whole decoration.

685
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:07,900
Otherwise,

686
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,060
how could she finish her work in a week?

687
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,740
Besides, she has to work today.

688
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,940
A married couple like us

689
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:13,940
will be most disappointed

690
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:14,940
if we push all the work

691
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,060
to each other.

692
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,140
It's already hard enough

693
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,420
for a king and a lady.

694
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,540
If the two kings want to live a good life together,

695
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,460
they have to take care of their own business.

696
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,500
Don't take anyone as the big boss.

697
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,500
Besides, Mei Cheng Yi

698
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,420
has given me enough surprises.

699
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,500
I think I'm a little bit cheap.

700
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,260
I like to be the big boss.

701
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,460
I like to take care of our family.

702
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,660
Come on, give me a hug.

703
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,620
Xiaoxiao has a good husband.

704
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,380
You two,

705
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,860
go back and pack up.

706
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,660
Prepare for your

707
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,260
honeymoon in Nanjing.

708
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:45,860
After you arrive in Nanjing,

709
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,380
send me more photos.

710
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,380
Work hard and make a living.

711
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,780
Try to get two or three.

712
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,500
What's going on?

713
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,580
It's up to you.

714
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,580
Okay.

715
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,060
We're leaving.

716
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,700
Happy, I'll miss you.

717
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,220
Dad.

718
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,740
Sister Li, give me a hug.

719
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,660
I'm so tired.

720
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,740
Dad.

721
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,900
I'll miss you.

722
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,500
Okay, go.

723
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,220
I'm leaving.

724
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,300
I'll give this to your wife.

725
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,060
Don't miss me.

726
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:09,740
Don't forget to give me a hug.

727
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,500
I'll definitely give you a hug.

728
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,700
Bye, Sister Li.

729
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,780
Bye.

730
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,100
I'll bring you a gift.

731
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:14,940
Happy, I'll bring you a gift.

732
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,660
Bye.

733
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,660
Take care.

734
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,660
I'll do it.

735
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,100
Are you tired?

736
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:19,700
Let's go.

737
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,420
I'm so tired.

738
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,420
I'll give you a hug.

739
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:28,620
Okay.

740
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,060
Let's meet.

741
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,340
Isn't it Brother Mei's birthday?

742
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:41,620
It's supposed to be today.

743
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,980
I haven't celebrated my birthday for many years.

744
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,060
We haven't met for a long time.

745
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,860
I want to invite everyone to have a meal

746
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,140
on my birthday.

747
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,140
Brother Mei,

748
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,460
is it our third meal?

749
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,660
Let's have a meal together.

750
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,220
Don't think too much.

751
00:29:59,220 --> 00:29:59,860
Well,

752
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,100
actually,

753
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,700
H12 just talked to me.

754
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,820
It's not a layman.

755
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,060
It's a promotion.

756
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,820
A promotion?

757
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,060
It's not a layman.

758
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,140
It's a promotion.

759
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,140
It's been a long time since we woke up.

760
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,060
Yes.

761
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:17,900
Brother Mei,

762
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,500
if you were promoted,

763
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,580
we wouldn't have been fired, right?

764
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,100
Of course.

765
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,420
I know.

766
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,420
We must have been fired recently.

767
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,860
The company finally knows

768
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,580
our importance.

769
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,540
No.

770
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,540
Brother Mei,

771
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,060
you must not leave.

772
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,060
If you leave, we'll be doomed.

773
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,780
It's hard to find a job now.

774
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,940
You're so lucky.

775
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,620
But if Brother Mei is promoted,

776
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,740
we'll get the bonus.

777
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,020
That's right.

778
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,780
But, Brother Mei,

779
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,700
what do you think?

780
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,540
Right.

781
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,660
I don't know.

782
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,460
The company is changing too fast.

783
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,580
I'm a little confused.

784
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,140
I was...

785
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,500
Well,

786
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,820
I'll think about it.

787
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,060
Okay.

788
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,740
Brother Mei, you're so early.

789
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:06,060
Anyway, it's good news.

790
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,820
And today is Brother Mei's birthday.

791
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,180
Let's celebrate together.

792
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,260
Let's toast to Brother Mei.

793
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,100
Yes.

794
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:11,780
Come on.

795
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,660
Happy birthday, Brother Mei.

796
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,300
Okay, thank you.

797
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,220
Happy birthday, Brother Mei.

798
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:14,980
Cheers.

799
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,140
Happy birthday, Brother Mei.

800
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,500
Brother Mei,

801
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,060
if you're promoted,

802
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,820
can we all be more considerate?

803
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,060
Of course.

804
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,860
The pattern.

805
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:30,980
Think about it.

806
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,100
Brother Mei is promoted.

807
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,260
It means we're promoted too, right?

808
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,260
Of course.

809
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,900
Brother Mei, don't worry.

810
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,460
As long as you're still in the company,

811
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,260
we'll do our best.

812
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,860
We must let the company know

813
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,700
our team's strength.

814
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,460
Come on.

815
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:46,820
Come on.

816
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:47,780
Let's eat.

817
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,020
Excuse me.

818
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,740
I'm full.

819
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,540
What do you mean?

820
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,380
You told me to fire Mei Cheng Yi.

821
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,380
You told Mei Cheng Yi to promote him.

822
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,500
I'll do it.

823
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,100
You two are so naughty.

824
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,300
Or else, how can I say

825
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,500
you're young and childish?

826
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,780
Mr. Li, here's the thing.

827
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,620
If Mei Cheng Yi really leaves,

828
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,260
how much can you make up for

829
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,260
the hole he's left?

830
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,820
If you let him sign the contract,

831
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,740
I can guarantee

832
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,940
he'll sign half of the contract.

833
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,820
Of course.

834
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,220
If he can stay,

835
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,820
there won't be any problem.

836
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,780
Right.

837
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,820
If you're my uncle

838
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,580
and you face this situation,

839
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,700
you want to reduce your income and keep it,

840
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,940
what will you do?

841
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,580
Of course I'll change my talent.

842
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,660
I'll keep my strength

843
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,020
and get rid of Guan Jin Yao.

844
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:50,740
Oh.

845
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,900
You finally figured it out.

846
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,380
Mr. Li.

847
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,580
You're mature.

848
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,900
You're stable.

849
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,860
You know how to

850
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,780
burn yourself and light others up.

851
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,420
Your current awareness

852
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,060
is really unimaginable.

853
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,260
I'm really

854
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,500
embarrassed.

855
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,140
I don't know

856
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,860
how to talk to you.

857
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,860
Since you're so smart,

858
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,020
I'll be honest.

859
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,140
Considering the situation

860
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,220
and the company's situation,

861
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,460
I'll try to apply

862
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,420
whatever compensation you want

863
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,740
from the company.

864
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,980
What do you mean?

865
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,540
Are you trying to step on me?

866
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,740
I'm childish.

867
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,660
I'll eat.

868
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,940
I'll shut my mouth.

869
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,620
I'll get wet.

870
00:33:48,180 --> 00:34:02,860
Remove the

871
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,620
Sister Li Li.

872
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,140
I'm going to pick up Da Mi and Xiaomi

873
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,500
and send them to their grandma first.

874
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,060
I'll pick them up later.

875
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,340
If thinking kids

876
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,420
will1 blink their eyes,

877
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,220
my receipts are only seven thousand.

878
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:13,940
Don't worry.

879
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,300
Da Mi is more competent.

880
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,940
And she can call us

881
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,380
You can call us anytime.

882
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:23,740
If you're tired,

883
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:24,300
pack up earlier.

884
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,300
Don't push yourself too hard.

885
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,220
Okay, go.

886
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,060
Bye.

887
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:28,860
Their coffee

888
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,060
is really good.

889
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:49,340
I used to be a young man.

890
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,860
Now I'm an old man.

891
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,540
What nonsense are you talking about?

892
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,540
What did you say?

893
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,540
Who's talking nonsense?

894
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,660
Look at you, being so stubborn.

895
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,580
I'm not stubborn.

896
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,220
I'm just sighing.

897
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,060
Time is not forgiving.

898
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,140
Aren't you changing into new clothes?

899
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,740
Don't be so

900
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,420
suspicious and weird every day.

901
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,180
Okay?

902
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,020
I'm wearing an old man's pants.

903
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,500
You'll be happy

904
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,540
if I keep pulling it.

905
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,460
You...

906
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,260
Since you started working at Happy's,

907
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,620
you've been helping

908
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,100
for three days.

909
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,140
We help each other.

910
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:33,820
You?

911
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,980
Are you a working person?

912
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,020
You're not used to

913
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,700
having a bottle of oil at home.

914
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,380
You're not used to having a bowl of water.

915
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:40,900
Here it comes again.

916
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,900
You're not used to having a bowl of water.

917
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,900
You're not used to having a bowl of water.

918
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,260
You've made the water so deep

919
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,660
that you've even drowned the people downstairs.

920
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,180
I'll let you move some things.

921
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,180
You can live in the hospital for half a month

922
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,580
with your back bent.

923
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,500
Are you helping or embarrassing me?

924
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,820
I'm warning you.

925
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,140
Don't embarrass me.

926
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,580
You're just helping

927
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,980
and causing trouble to the family.

928
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,500
It's been 800 years.

929
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,100
Is it interesting to find out?

930
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,580
Don't look at my daughter ignoring me.

931
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,100
She even gave me money.

932
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,420
It's the first time I've seen Youyou

933
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,180
give me money back.

934
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,020
She even gave you 8,000 yuan.

935
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,820
She doesn't spend much.

936
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,300
She even gave it to us.

937
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,860
Even if she wants to spend money,

938
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,100
where can she spend it?

939
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,060
You're right.

940
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,020
Boss.

941
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,420
About Youyou's job,

942
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,660
I think

943
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,860
her master just said something.

944
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:53,100
She must be in a bad mood.

945
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,260
So, during this period of time,

946
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,980
don't give her too much pressure.

947
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:57,740
Just follow her.

948
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,100
Follow her a little bit.

949
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,500
She likes to play the game of the bull's-eye.

950
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,980
If she can't think straight

951
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,780
and goes too far,

952
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,580
this kind of thing

953
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,900
can't happen again.

954
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,660
Now,

955
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,620
we have to be careful about her.

956
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,580
Maybe one day,

957
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,620
after she's over 3 minutes of heat,

958
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,540
she'll want to change her job.

959
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,340
Fine.

960
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,620
Just follow her.

961
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,580
She didn't ask me to go back

962
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,860
even if she got the money.

963
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,820
Is this the end?

964
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,620
Ye Ersan.

965
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,260
We have a family dinner today.

966
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,580
Ye Ersan.

967
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,300
Ye Ersan.

968
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,700
Ye Ersan.

969
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,860
Ye Ersan.

970
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:11,080
Wenjing

971
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:11,540
Wenjing

972
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,420
Wow!

973
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,820
So bright.

974
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,420
Hmm?

975
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,660
Mom, I got a seat today.

976
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:41,900
Great.

977
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,540
Mom, mom.

978
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,820
I'm in kindergarten today.

979
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,420
You're pulling the car yourself.

980
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,780
You're so good.

981
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,700
Mom, are you coming to pick me up?

982
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,140
I'll pick you up in a moment.

983
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,700
What if dad loses me again?

984
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,780
That's impossible.

985
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,460
As long as your grandma is here,

986
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,860
grandma will lose herself

987
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,940
and she can pick you up.

988
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,780
How can you drive?

989
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,820
Don't talk to me.

990
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,380
I was nervous just now.

991
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,260
123.

992
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,140
I knew you were here.

993
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:20,740
123.

994
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:27,820
123.

995
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,500
You don't want the can now?

996
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,620
I won't agree even if you call me.

997
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:35,540
What?

998
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,340
I won't come to you

999
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,580
when it gets dark.

1000
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,660
This is really sold out.

1001
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,780
Why is there really someone

1002
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,780
protecting Lu Hua?

1003
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,220
Your master Hu

1004
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,780
is really a little wild.

1005
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,180
But he'll have to change his shop in the future.

1006
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,220
No, no, no.

1007
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,420
It's better not to blow.

1008
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,500
You're so noisy.

1009
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,140
You know,

1010
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,060
I haven't heard

1011
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:28,260
his

1012
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:05,140
lazy, pie- led heart until today.

1013
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,420
Xiaodiao.

1014
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,420
I've told you not to go outside.

1015
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,180
As long as you're happy.

1016
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:33,480
Please.

1017
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,040
I won't let you see me again.

1018
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,480
Just go.

1019
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,100
Hello.

1020
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,260
I chatted with your parents downstairs.

1021
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,660
Get two miles.

1022
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:49,900
Sure.

1023
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,180
Don't push me away!

1024
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,480
No, I beg you to prepare my dedicate the speech.

1025
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,640
Okay?

1026
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,880
Your card's extra long.

1027
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,600
Are you trying toç›´ me out!

1028
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,140
Why are you hitting me?

1029
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,900
Didn't we already make a deal

1030
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,140
We should give them 12 hours of thinking

1031
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:30,380
This guy is miserable.

1032
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,940
His wife has given him a raise.

1033
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,340
We have to cheat him.

1034
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,740
Cheating can cause a mess in Tong Qing Xin's life.

1035
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:38,020
Then...

1036
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,100
Then let's not cheat him.

1037
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:40,820
No way.

1038
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:42,940
It's a deal.

1039
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,780
Tong Qing Xin is not a good person

1040
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:45,540
in front of her professional ethics.

1041
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,100
You are a professional.

1042
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,060
A professional.
