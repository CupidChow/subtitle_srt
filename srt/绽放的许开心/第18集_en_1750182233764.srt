1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,360
Now, sir.

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,900
The Xiao대�身構

3
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:43,660
rays

4
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,900
Clouds

5
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,300
The windyjin

6
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,900
Waters

7
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,760
You're on fire.

8
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:55,360
So are you whatever you want.

9
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,020
You'm going to get wet later.

10
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,160
Thecio-arteted

11
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,200
You don't have to worry about me.

12
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,200
very bad

13
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,120
very bad

14
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,540
I didn't know it was Li Jian who came to the farmhouse.

15
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,800
Here, you earn money in working hours last week.

16
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,860
So, how?

17
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,540
I've been working all morning at home.

18
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:57,920
I feel dizzy after drinking soda.

19
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,920
I'm really worried about you.

20
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,920
I promised not to run.

21
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,920
I'm a little nervous.

22
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,920
Yes.

23
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,920
The new road was smooth.

24
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,920
There was no accident.

25
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,920
Li Tianqing!

26
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,920
Li Tianqing!

27
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,920
Go, go, go!

28
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,920
Li Tianqing!

29
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,920
Li Tianqing!

30
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,920
Tianqing!

31
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,920
Langjun!

32
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,920
Why are you back?

33
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,920
The old man from the Wolf Army is back.

34
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,920
Didn't he tell you?

35
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,920
I was delayed by him.

36
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,920
He was in the small woods.

37
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,920
He took me in.

38
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,920
We were delayed by another donkey.

39
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,920
It's a long time.

40
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,920
Let's not talk about the donkey.

41
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,920
You came back later than the plan.

42
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,920
Is there something hard?

43
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,920
No.

44
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,920
I've been busy on the road.

45
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,920
If I don't miss you,

46
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,920
I'll have to go back.

47
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,920
You still have to go back.

48
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,920
Everyone, today's guest room dinner is free.

49
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,920
Change the room.

50
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,920
Change the environment.

51
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,920
Let's go.

52
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,920
It's too expensive.

53
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,920
No, it's not.

54
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,920
I'm making money.

55
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,920
Go back.

56
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,920
It's free.

57
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,920
That's a waste of money.

58
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,920
I'm so tired.

59
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,920
Open your eyes.

60
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,920
Open your eyes.

61
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,920
It's not free.

62
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,920
I'll do it.

63
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,920
What are you doing, Lv Shan De?

64
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,920
I'm saving you.

65
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,920
What are you doing?

66
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,920
You dare to touch my ritual?

67
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,920
This thing is poisonous.

68
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,920
This is the flower and leaves of the Mantua Tower.

69
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,920
After the match,

70
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,920
everyone will have a hallucination.

71
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,920
It's poisonous.

72
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,920
Do you believe me or the person who believes you?

73
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,920
I've seen this thing many times.

74
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,920
When I was sick,

75
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,920
I was fine.

76
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,920
Then you're not sick.

77
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,920
It's because of the anesthesia.

78
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,920
It only makes you sick.

79
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,920
You're sick and you're covered with a blanket.

80
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,920
Don't touch it.

81
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,920
How can a man like you know so many things?

82
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,920
This is my specialty.

83
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,920
I'm not leaving.

84
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,920
Where?

85
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,920
I'm not leaving.

86
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,920
The God has already given me a chance.

87
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,920
The God said,

88
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,920
this man will change our life

89
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,920
and we'll have to keep an eye on him.

90
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,920
The house is in Chang'an.

91
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,920
There's a house in the house.

92
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,920
The house is not cheap.

93
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,920
The house is cheap.

94
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,920
The house is not cheap.

95
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,920
If you bring it,

96
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,920
then there's no savings in the house.

97
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,920
How much money do you have?

98
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,920
How much money do you have?

99
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,920
When are you going to pay back?

100
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,920
Do you have any plans?

101
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,920
What?

102
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,920
Good for you.

103
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,920
Good for you.

104
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,920
You're really not good at this.

105
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,920
But you're a teacher in front of me.

106
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,920
You're a person.

107
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,920
I'm not going to teach you anything else.

108
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,920
If you're going to return to Chang'an

109
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,920
with the token of your marriage,

110
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,920
you're going to return to Chang'an

111
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,920
or go to Gaozhou?

112
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,920
I'm going to return to Chang'an.

113
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,920
No way.

114
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,920
My A-Tong can't go back to Chang'an with you.

115
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,920
A-Tong doesn't have to go back to Chang'an with me.

116
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,920
My token is going to be taken.

117
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,920
The saint has to eat the token first.

118
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,920
The token is used for token.

119
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,920
No one dares to come to the market.

120
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,920
A-Tong can stay in this token.

121
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,920
You don't have to go to Chang'an with me.

122
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,920
But you two can't meet.

123
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,920
Tian is a different person.

124
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,920
He...

125
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,920
You misunderstood him.

126
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,920
I only have my daughter in my heart.

127
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,920
I've never had a girlfriend like A-Tong.

128
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,920
We're friends.

129
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,920
I've told him before.

130
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,920
A-Tong is...

131
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,920
The country's color is the world's.

132
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,920
The country's color is the world's.

133
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,920
The world's color is the world's.

134
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,920
Right?

135
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,920
Yes.

136
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,920
She's kind-hearted.

137
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,920
Aunt,

138
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,920
don't give me the money.

139
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,920
We're really friends.

140
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,920
You think I'm not good at this?

141
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,920
I don't have to ask.

142
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,920
What if you're going to be a big fan?

143
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,920
If you don't want me to ask,

144
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,920
I'll go back to Danyushan now.

145
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,920
I'm leaving.

146
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,920
You let this man

147
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,920
stay in this token for a day.

148
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,920
I'll never come back.

149
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,920
Da Wu.

150
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,920
You said you came from Danyushan.

151
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,920
Is Danyushan in the north of Lengnan?

152
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,920
If you go north,

153
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,920
it's the west of Jiangnan.

154
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,920
What's wrong?

155
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,920
You can't see our Qiongshan's ass, right?

156
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,920
No, no, no.

157
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,920
I just...

158
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,920
I'm a little bit greedy.

159
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,920
Da Wu.

160
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,920
I'm going to ask you something.

161
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,920
Look.

162
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,920
Is the height of the station

163
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,920
even more beautiful?

164
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,920
The Pingyun Mountain in this world

165
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,920
is always the most suspicious.

166
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,920
The ancient cloud

167
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,920
has become the water's low.

168
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,920
It's floating with the wind.

169
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,920
It's all wet.

170
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,920
Sometimes, when you enter the Qingquan,

171
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,920
you'll be in the cup of the noble.

172
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,920
Sometimes, you'll be in the grass.

173
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,920
You'll be the water's low.

174
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,920
You'll be in the Qingquan.

175
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,920
And I'll be the water's low.

176
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,920
Miss.

177
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,920
We can't say that.

178
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,920
We can't choose our birth place.

179
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,920
But through hard work,

180
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,920
we'll definitely change our own environment.

181
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,920
Are you crying?

182
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,920
Lord Lang, you misunderstood.

183
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,920
It's just that the mountain is so big.

184
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,920
I have a bit of a blind eye.

185
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,920
Lord Lang is willing to come out and play with me today.

186
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,920
I'm very happy.

187
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,920
Lord Lang is so kind and generous.

188
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,920
He's willing to be with me.

189
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,920
I'm so happy that I can't come.

190
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,920
If you don't mind,

191
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,920
I'll follow you to the palace.

192
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,920
Even if I'm in Chang'an,

193
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,920
I don't need to ask for your name.

194
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,920
I just hope you can contact me.

195
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,920
Miss.

196
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,920
You believe in these words?

197
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,920
Then you're very strong.

198
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,920
If you can't make up your mind today,

199
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,920
can't you go back and explain it to me?

200
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,920
I don't understand what Lord Lang is saying.

201
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,920
Of course you understand.

202
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,920
Of course you know what I'm saying.

203
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,920
I'm not saying anything.

204
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,920
I know what I'm saying.

205
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,920
As a person, you can't just focus on the topic.

206
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,920
We don't know each other very well.

207
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,920
We just don't want to focus on the topic.

208
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,920
Then we can take our time.

209
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,920
No, no, no.

210
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,920
Think about it.

211
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,920
The board is not ready yet.

212
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,920
The shooting is useless.

213
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,920
The eyes can't fool people.

214
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,920
Look at me carefully.

215
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,920
Miss, you're almost hungry.

216
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,920
I... I know my own food.

217
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,920
We met a few times before.

218
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,920
You've never seen me like this.

219
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,920
You suddenly showed me a little bit of love yesterday.

220
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,920
You must have done it for others.

221
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,920
I came out with you today

222
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,920
to relax you.

223
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,920
You don't need to act anymore.

224
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,920
You're very tired.

225
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,920
So you know Ma Lan Jun already.

226
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,920
I just don't understand.

227
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,920
Why does Mr. Zhao care so much about my feelings?

228
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,920
He...

229
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,920
It's okay if you don't say it.

230
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,920
If Mr. Zhao asks, you'll say...

231
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,920
I'm sorry.

232
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,920
I'm sorry.

233
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,920
I'm sorry.

234
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,920
I'm sorry.

235
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,920
I'm sorry.

236
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,920
I just want to know.

237
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,920
I'm so happy.

238
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,920
The man and woman can't be forced.

239
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,920
Okay?

240
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,920
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhao.

241
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,920
The transfer of interest

242
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,920
has to pass the Great Fish Mountain.

243
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,920
It has to go to the west of the river.

244
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,920
But the Great Fish Mountain is too dangerous.

245
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,920
It takes two days to reach the mountain.

246
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,920
So is there a new route?

247
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,920
If I can get it out in two days,

248
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,920
wouldn't I be successful?

249
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,920
I just want to ask you

250
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,920
if you know there's such a way.

251
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,920
Brother.

252
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,920
Go away.

253
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,920
Go get some toys.

254
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,920
Don't you have a dream?

255
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,920
The Great Fish Mountain is just a dream.

256
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,920
Can you help me?

257
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,920
I can't help you.

258
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,920
I can help him.

259
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,920
But he doesn't believe me.

260
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,920
Dao.

261
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,920
Dao.

262
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,920
I believe I'm a man like you.

263
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,920
Don't talk like you know me.

264
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,920
Look.

265
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,920
Tong is my friend.

266
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,920
Yes.

267
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,920
I know it's not easy to live in the mountains.

268
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,920
She needs to be treated.

269
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,920
She can only die if she is hurt.

270
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,920
You are the best person to take the God's hand

271
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,920
and provide them with the highest level of relief.

272
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,920
I know the pain in her heart.

273
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,920
So I have no other choice.

274
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,920
I only have Qing Pei.

275
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,920
Really?

276
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,920
You are not the best talker in Chang Ren.

277
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,920
But you can understand us so much.

278
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,920
It's rare.

279
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,920
I'm sincerely begging you.

280
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,920
Aunt, please help him.

281
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,920
In this tribe,

282
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,920
there is a man named A Tu.

283
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,920
He is the only one in our tribe

284
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,920
who lives in the highland.

285
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,920
One day, A Tu came back to the mountain.

286
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,920
He took the pen and paper

287
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,920
from Chang Ren.

288
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,920
He was drawing there.

289
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,920
I was curious.

290
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,920
I asked him,

291
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,920
what are you doing?

292
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,920
He told me that

293
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,920
when he was a hunter,

294
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,920
he found a secret small dream on the mountain.

295
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,920
If he can draw it,

296
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,920
he can make a big money

297
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,920
by moving it out of the south.

298
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,920
We won't eat and drink in our tribe.

299
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,920
So there is really such a dream?

300
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,920
Yes.

301
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,920
But he suddenly disappeared.

302
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,920
It's been ten years.

303
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,920
There is no reason to find him.

304
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,920
Does anyone else know this road?

305
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,920
Only he knows.

306
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,920
This...

307
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,920
This is a caveman.

308
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,920
This is not a joke with Chang Ren.

309
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,920
So he doesn't know the news.

310
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,920
Where are you going, Shan De?

311
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,920
I'm dead.

312
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,920
I'm dead.

313
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,920
There is a good news.

314
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,920
What good news?

315
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,920
Don't be so hasty.

316
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,920
Tell us slowly.

317
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,920
What good news?

318
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,920
This...

319
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,920
A big house came from the far side.

320
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,920
Big house?

321
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,920
Big house.

322
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,920
Say it.

323
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,920
Say this...

324
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,920
There is a barrier in the rain.

325
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,920
A barrier?

326
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,920
It can not go to the mountain.

327
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,920
It can save two days of filming time.

328
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,920
This is a good news.

329
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,920
But now there is a problem.

330
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,920
What problem?

331
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,920
I don't know where this road is.

332
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,920
This is not a good news.

333
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,920
But someone knows.

334
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,920
Who?

335
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,920
A caveman named Atu.

336
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,920
Atu?

337
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,920
Where is he?

338
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,920
It's been ten years.

339
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,920
Then?

340
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,920
There is no signal.

341
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,920
What good news?

342
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,920
I'll come.

343
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,920
Can you use your relationship?

344
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,920
Help me find Atu.

345
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,920
We have a plan.

346
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,920
Isn't this a good news?

347
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,920
You said Amita's maid is chasing after you.

348
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,920
Yes.

349
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,920
Yes.

350
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,920
Interesting.

351
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,920
You said I was in Chang'an.

352
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,920
I can take down the wine in Chang'an.

353
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,920
Now I'm in Lingnan.

354
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,920
I'm so confused about the water in the battlefield.

355
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,920
By my side...

356
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,920
By my side, I always surround these dark and dark.

357
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,920
I'm so annoyed.

358
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,920
You must be excited.

359
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,920
You didn't meet such a good job in Chang'an.

360
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,920
You misunderstood me.

361
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,920
I just think that I'm dealing with this aspect of love.

362
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,920
I'm extremely talented.

363
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,920
I'm a good person.

364
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,920
I'm not a bad person.

365
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,920
But that girl in blue...

366
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,920
She's really pretty.

367
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,920
If you fall in love,

368
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,920
you can't fake your true love.

369
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,920
You're not a good person.

370
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,920
You misunderstood me again.

371
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,920
Although Lan Yu is a good girl,

372
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,920
I like her.

373
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,920
She's talented.

374
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,920
All right.

375
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,920
Let's talk about the truth.

376
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,920
From the clues we found,

377
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,920
the one who was in the building

378
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,920
was the one who was in the building.

379
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,920
It was the one who was in the building.

380
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,920
Before we found out who was in the building,

381
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,920
Lan Yu was eating two thousand sea cucumbers.

382
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,920
You mean...

383
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,920
the one who was eating two thousand sea cucumbers

384
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,920
was the one who was on the TV?

385
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,920
Yes.

386
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,920
Most of the sea cucumbers were built on the reputation of the sea tiger.

387
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,920
The meaning of the sea tiger was that the sea cucumbers were completely destroyed.

388
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,920
All the high-cost goods were all in the hands.

389
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,920
The man in blue also had no money to buy the blood.

390
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,920
He had a big mess.

391
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,920
Do you have any evidence

392
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,920
that he was a good person?

393
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,920
No.

394
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,920
But the two thousand sea cucumbers

395
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,920
were bought by a former guest of A Tu.

396
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,920
If we find him,

397
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,920
we might find the truth.

398
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,920
It's burnt.

399
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,920
Oh no.

400
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,920
Didn't you say that the fish in A Tu's hands

401
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,920
was in the building?

402
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,920
You can't find it.

403
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,920
You said A Tu?

404
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,920
He was burned to death ten years ago.

405
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,920
Erwen didn't have any evidence.

406
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,920
It's impossible.

407
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,920
Five years ago,

408
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,920
he even asked a businessman

409
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,920
to bring us some food.

410
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,920
Did you see him?

411
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,920
I didn't see him.

412
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,920
But he asked a businessman

413
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,920
to bring some medicine to his parents.

414
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,920
Did he leave anything?

415
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,920
No.

416
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,920
Then who was the businessman?

417
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,920
I don't know.

418
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,920
He left the food and saw it.

419
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,920
There was no big difference

420
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,920
between the missing and the dead.

421
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,920
It's impossible to find the truth.

422
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,920
Dao, think about it.

423
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,920
What else is there?

424
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,920
The truth.

425
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,920
The truth.

426
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,920
I remember.

427
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,920
That businessman

428
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,920
kept staring at me since he came.

429
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,920
He hated me so much.

430
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,920
I scolded him.

431
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,920
But he explained to me

432
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,920
that he was a evil eye.

433
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,920
Brother Lan,

434
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,920
you lost your money.

435
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,920
Give me the money.

436
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,920
Yes.

437
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,920
You need to have a lot of money.

438
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,920
You...

439
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,920
You don't want to believe me?

440
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,920
I...

441
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,920
I...

442
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,920
I'm not like your mother.

443
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,920
I'm too old to remember.

444
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,920
You were too old to remember.

445
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,920
You made our family suffer.

446
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,920
Luckily, I could have a good life.

447
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,920
I don't want to be a blessing.

448
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,920
But you have to come with me to see the view.

449
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,920
It was a strange thing.

450
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,920
I bought the sea urchin.

451
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,920
It was a risk-free payment.

452
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,920
I helped you to get the money.

453
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,920
You are the sea urchin.

454
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,920
Your mother

455
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,920
paid for it all by herself.

456
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,920
You are irresponsible.

457
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,920
You are responsible.

458
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,920
You are so irresponsible.

459
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,920
What have I done these years?

460
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,920
You know it.

461
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,920
I didn't think about it.

462
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,920
I had some money.

463
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,920
I gave it to the chicken farm.

464
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,920
I can't live like this.

465
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,920
I'm sick.

466
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,920
Then you should have the money.

467
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,920
What should I do?

468
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,920
I don't have enough money.

469
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,920
I'm old.

470
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,920
I've been in debt for 10 years.

471
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,920
I can't live like this.

472
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,920
Brother Lan.

473
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,920
I'm your uncle.

474
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,920
Please help me.

475
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,920
Why should I help you?

476
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,920
Because you let me be your family.

477
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,920
I'm sorry.

478
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,920
Thenschaftk冷珊珍.

479
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,920
gratification.

480
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,380
Hey you are

481
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:34,920
great!

482
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,920
I'm glad you gave my folder.

483
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,880
My dad is pessoa

484
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,480
You have never had such food until now.

485
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,920
KFC's their favorite food.

486
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,920
Warm fruits can視 your health keeps you healthy more effectively.

487
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,920
San can take your 1st.

488
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,420
Click on my career profile.

489
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:51,920
My kid.

490
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,920
All right.

491
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,920
Milk?

492
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,920
No way.

493
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,920
Is it not hard to make sugar?

494
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,920
Drink it right away.

495
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,920
The milk that will absorb sugar-free milk right away

496
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,920
will be your wonderful performance.

497
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,920
Okay.

498
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,920
One more.

499
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,920
Okay.

500
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,920
I'm done.

501
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,920
Come on.

502
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,920
Come on!

503
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,920
Mr. Zhao.

504
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,920
How is it?

505
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,920
All the maids are watching.

506
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,920
You said the maids watched our new search?

507
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,920
Yes.

508
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,920
I don't care if he watches or not.

509
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,920
He's moving his heart.

510
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,920
No.

511
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,920
I've never seen you do that.

512
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,920
It seems that the people around you are really amazing.

513
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,920
You've done a lot of special training.

514
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,920
Then will he talk to the director?

515
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,920
No.

516
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,920
If the director knows that I can lie to him...

517
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,920
If he really wants to pursue Amita

518
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,920
he will never let it go.

519
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,920
I'll think about it.

520
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,920
You go back first.

521
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,920
Then I'll find the director.

522
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,920
I'll take my leave.

523
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,920
Come and have some tea.

524
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,920
Come and have some tea.

525
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,920
My aunt is at the Imperial College there.

526
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,920
Who is that Ase?

527
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,920
I'll have MorningWAVE.

528
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,640
Well, for example,

529
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,560
alone,

530
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,240
and처럼,

531
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,840
No matter what I do,

532
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,760
I still hate it.

533
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,280
Why do I feel like

534
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,600
inside my duet,

535
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,600
Mr. Hu is fucking fresh?

536
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,120
Mr. Hu.

537
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,880
Don't be a scammer,

538
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,000
the girl who's your 추-inDR Havens.

539
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,920
They say that they won't cherish it easily.

540
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,920
It seems that I let my husband

541
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,920
take over the easy part.

542
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,920
What are you talking about?

543
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,920
What do you know?

544
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,920
I'm giving him a peach blossom festival.

545
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,920
He's very good at it.

546
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,920
He's very good at it.

547
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,920
He has his own way of doing it.

548
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,920
It seems that

549
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,920
you still want to go to Chang'an?

550
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,920
Madam,

551
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,920
even if I,

552
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,920
Wen'an Xie Yipengni,

553
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,920
win the Bailing Festival of the Revenge,

554
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,920
I will never let you down.

555
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,920
It's just that

556
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,920
this is a very bad change.

557
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,920
The Hu family

558
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,920
are all starting to support the transition.

559
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,920
If the future is

560
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,920
a transition,

561
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,920
I don't know what it will be.

562
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,920
Old things are not for someone to rely on.

563
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,920
I'm thinking about the future.

564
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,920
Maybe Ma Guiyun is our descendant.

565
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,920
But husband,

566
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,920
how can you be so close to Ma Guiyun?

567
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,920
I just want to say the truth.

568
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,920
We are close.

569
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,920
We are all from Chu.

570
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,920
I'm sorry.

571
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,920
I came out today

572
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,920
and I want to apologize.

573
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,920
I am sorry for what happened.

574
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,920
Don't be so sad,

575
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,920
Mr. Zhao.

576
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,920
I was very surprised.

577
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,920
I didn't know.

578
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,920
I just want to say this.

579
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,920
You're so kind.

580
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,920
I'm sorry.

581
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,920
Today,

582
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,920
the spring is coming.

583
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,920
The rain is not in the way.

584
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,920
But it suddenly came down.

585
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,920
I had the chance to

586
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,920
have a chat with you.

587
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,920
I'm the most envious

588
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,920
of the life of the new brother.

589
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,920
Unlike Chang'an,

590
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,920
there is always something to do.

591
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,920
One thing is the next.

592
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,920
It's the 12th hour.

593
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,920
It won't stop.

594
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,920
Chang'an is prosperous.

595
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,920
How many other rich people

596
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,920
are thinking about it.

597
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,920
Actually, I once had the chance

598
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,920
to go to Chang'an.

599
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,920
But at that time,

600
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,920
Mrs. Yu decided to give up

601
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,920
the opportunity to live a life.

602
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,920
Now,

603
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,920
I dreamt about it for five nights.

604
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,920
You will think,

605
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,920
if I went to Chang'an,

606
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,920
what would happen?

607
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,920
The new brother is a genius.

608
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,920
It's natural to be rewarded by a noble man.

609
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,920
But,

610
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,920
the Tianmu business is set up.

611
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,920
I don't understand.

612
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,920
I want to be

613
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,920
a good man.

614
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,920
I once had a noble face.

615
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,920
I went to the building.

616
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,920
I came out of the building,

617
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,920
and I was a good man.

618
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,920
I was a good man.

619
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,920
I sold the sea-shrine.

620
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,920
I did everything.

621
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,920
I was a good man.

622
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,920
I was a good man.

623
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,920
I heard that the sea-shrine

624
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,920
was closed in the south.

625
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,920
Many people were invited to the building

626
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,920
to be a good man.

627
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,920
At that time,

628
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,920
it was a miracle.

629
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,920
A miracle?

630
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,920
It was a miracle.

631
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,920
It seems that

632
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,920
I was a good man.

633
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,920
I was a good man.

634
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,920
I wanted to be a good man.

635
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,920
I was a good man.

636
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,920
I could do this.

637
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,920
So, I invited people to be my friends.

638
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,920
I was a good man.

639
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,920
I did not do anything

640
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,920
since I was a good man.

641
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,920
Half of my best buddies

642
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,920
wanted to be a good man.

643
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,920
But no one was a good man.

644
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,920
It was not that easy.

645
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,920
You had a son and a mother.

646
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,920
You always made the mistake.

647
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,920
I am short-tempered to do things

648
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,920
simple and well.

649
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,920
I have to deal with it.

650
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,920
What the opposite?

651
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,920
If I had a good one,

652
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,920
There are some rumors.

653
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,320
But I heard that

654
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,920
the number of people who died

655
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,320
should be a motive.

656
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,320
What they told you is A Tu.

657
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,960
How can a motive like that

658
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,160
compare to me?

659
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,920
He is just the last one

660
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,080
who was in the last month.

661
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,280
I don't know who it is.

662
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,520
He suddenly got two thousand.

663
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,360
A Tu went to the heaven

664
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,520
to steal these pills.

665
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,320
What happened?

666
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,560
He died in the fire

667
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,480
in the seven-cylinder tunnel.

668
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,880
Life is so long.

669
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,680
A Tu, Bai Hu

670
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,320
died in the fire.

671
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,520
The revenge has become a waste of paper.

672
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,520
Or else,

673
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,920
I would have been rich.

674
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:04,920
Of course,

675
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,520
there is no such thing as fate

676
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,520
as a brother.

677
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,520
It's a pity.

678
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,320
Here.

679
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,720
Brother Ximin,

680
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,320
people are loyal.

681
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,320
They will not be defeated.

682
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,320
Don't worry.

683
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,520
When I return to Chang'an,

684
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,520
I will give you

685
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,520
a piece of advice.

686
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,920
Your talent

687
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,720
will not be buried in the south.

688
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,120
Don't be so proud.

689
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,520
I am doing this with my own hands.

690
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,920
I am very satisfied.

691
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,720
I am not lying.

692
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:31,920
Brother Ximin,

693
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,320
if you have any knowledge,

694
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,720
please take it as a reward.

695
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,720
The seven-cylinder tunnel is very far away.

696
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,720
There are some sales in the old and new buildings.

697
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,720
What's the use of the warehouse?

698
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,320
How can the people who died in the year of death

699
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,720
come here alive?

700
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,120
Find them and find a dead person.

701
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,120
I am not sure.

702
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,120
I don't know.

703
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,120
I don't know.

704
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,120
I don't know.

705
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,120
I don't know.

706
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,120
I don't know.

707
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,120
I don't know.

708
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,120
I don't know.

709
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,120
I don't know.

710
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,120
I don't know.

711
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,520
The clue is broken again.

712
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,720
Ping'an.

713
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,120
Ping'an.

714
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,720
Master.

715
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,920
You have to go out again.

716
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,320
What's wrong?

717
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,120
You.

718
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,520
Help me find a dead person in the south.

719
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,720
Who?

720
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,120
There is a caveman called A Tu.

721
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,120
Find this person.

722
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,720
A Tu in the south.

723
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,120
What's wrong with you?

724
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,120
I am looking for the evidence of Hei Guang's disappearance.

725
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,120
It's good to have something to do with this person.

726
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,520
He...

727
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,720
He is too clever.

728
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,320
What did he find?

729
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,320
He found it.

730
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,320
Where is it?

731
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,120
He is dead.

732
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,120
He is burned to death.

733
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,520
When did he burn to death?

734
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,920
He burned to death ten years ago.

735
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,120
Then you are overconfident.

736
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,720
He is not dead.

737
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,520
He is alive in the fire.

738
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,720
But he is going to hide.

739
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,520
He must know what will be the secret of the murder.

740
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,720
This is interesting.

741
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,120
We are looking for him.

742
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,720
Li Shande is also looking for him.

743
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,120
It seems that this is the key.

744
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,320
Sir.

745
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,720
I want to give you an advice.

746
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,520
Please listen.

747
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,120
Can we talk about something else?

748
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,920
We must have a way to know.

749
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,520
Okay.

750
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,920
What do you want to talk about?

751
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,720
I am a fool.

752
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,520
I don't know what to talk about.

753
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,920
I can't be asked.

754
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,520
There are many things you can talk about.

755
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,320
For example?

756
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,520
For example,

757
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,120
love and love.

758
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,320
For example,

759
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,520
poetry and singing.

760
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,120
For example,

761
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,720
the moon and the flowers.

762
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,520
Gao.

763
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,720
Go out.

764
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:07,920
Sir.

765
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,720
I didn't go in.

766
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,720
I...

767
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,120
We don't spend money.

768
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,720
We only talk about the moon.

769
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,720
But...

770
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,720
Let's talk about this after you finish.

771
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,920
Go back first.

772
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,720
I will ask Luo Tuo to check the news about the murder of that actor.

773
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:29,920
No.

774
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,720
Look, you are alone.

775
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,720
You are going down the stage alone.

776
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,320
Mr. Xu.

777
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,520
Mr. Zhao.

778
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,720
What's the matter?

779
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,120
Before this,

780
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,020
Mr. Zhao bought the best tea and

781
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,120
tea leaves for Mr. Zhao.

782
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,120
This is...

783
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,520
I am grateful.

784
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,520
Sit down.

785
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,720
It's not a big deal.

786
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,520
This is a new idea.

787
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,720
I will help you.

788
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,120
Mr. Zhao will help you.

789
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,520
Mr. Xiao is very generous.

790
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,520
He is a good friend

791
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,120
who is always looking for the right one.

792
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,520
I have been doing the money class for many years.

793
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,920
If I am doing the money class,

794
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,320
I will be broke.

795
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:38,920
That's not right.

796
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,720
Mr. Zhao

797
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,720
helped me save money for the money class.

798
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,720
He also helped me save time.

799
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,720
Time is the money

800
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,120
for us.

801
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,120
If you don't take it,

802
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,320
you will be in trouble.

803
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,520
That's not enough.

804
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,320
Mr. Xiao is suitable.

805
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,920
I will take it.

806
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,920
I really can't escape from Mr. Zhao's eyes.

807
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,920
The business meeting is in a hurry.

808
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,520
The position of the leader is not finished yet.

809
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,520
I also invite Mr. Zhao

810
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,120
to meet me

811
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,920
when we are together.

812
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,720
This matter...

813
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,320
This matter is really...

814
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,720
It's not easy to handle.

815
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,720
It's not easy to handle.

816
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,720
It's not easy to handle.

817
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,720
It's not easy to handle.

818
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,720
Yun Chuan is missing Mr. Zhao's mercy.

819
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,320
I hope Mr. Zhao

820
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,320
can make this case as soon as possible.

821
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,720
I am willing to share the three-layered pure

822
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,720
with Mr. Zhao.

823
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,720
This is the letter of the Qi.

824
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,720
The letter of the Qi.

825
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,720
I will take it.

826
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,720
I will take it first.

827
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,720
Okay, I will take it.

828
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,720
The blind businessman that Zheng Lang mentioned

829
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,720
is called the blind man.

830
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,720
The police are far away from the blue song

831
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,720
of Dou Ji Fang.

832
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,720
But the Dou Ji Fang is very sharp.

833
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,720
I can't see it in the empty room.

834
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,720
So I will take Lang Jun

835
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,720
to Dou Ji Fang's place to investigate.

836
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,720
But this Dou Ji Fang

837
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,720
is a place where there is light.

838
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,720
I will go there to find it.

839
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,720
Is it convenient?

840
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,720
Lang Jun found out

841
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,720
that the key character of A Tu

842
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,720
is Mr. Zhao who is very sensitive.

843
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,720
Mr. Zhao said that

844
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,720
the talent of Lang Jun

845
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,720
is not only good at drinking.

846
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,720
It is also a great honor for Lang Jun

847
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,720
to be a smart man

848
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,720
and to know how to use other helpers to fight.

849
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,720
I am very impressed.

850
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,720
You are right.

851
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,720
Qi Liang,

852
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,720
the assassins are very common.

853
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,720
What if we meet them?

854
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,720
Don't be so impulsive.

855
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,720
This is not a simple thing.

856
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,720
Otherwise, what are you afraid of?

857
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,720
Don't talk nonsense.

858
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,720
Qi Liang is not bad.

859
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,720
Qi Liang is smart.

860
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,720
He is very smart.

861
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,720
He is very smart.

862
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,720
He is very smart.

863
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,720
He is very smart.

864
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,720
I am here to find you.

865
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,720
You are looking for me?

866
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,720
You are looking for me?

867
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,720
You go outside.

868
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,720
I saw you.

869
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,720
I suddenly remembered.

870
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,720
I bought you a thing.

871
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,720
I forgot to take it.

872
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,720
I will take it.

873
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,720
You are so smart.

874
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,720
Before we meet,

875
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,720
you can take it.

876
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,720
It is not that important.

877
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,720
What do you want me to do?

878
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,720
About the situation,

879
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,720
I...

880
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,720
What do you think?

881
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,720
I have a little bit of a impression of Amita.

882
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,720
She is very ordinary.

883
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,720
I have a little bit of a impression of Amita.

884
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,720
She is like a girl.

885
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,720
She is a person of the same kind.

886
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,720
I can't deal with this kind of relationship.

887
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,720
How can I deal with her?

888
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,720
She is so good to you.

889
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,720
She is so beautiful.

890
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,720
She is so beautiful.

891
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,720
She is so beautiful.

892
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,720
I am your girl.

893
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,720
I choose Amita.

894
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,720
Why?

895
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,720
Look.

896
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,720
Look.

897
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,720
This old man.

898
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,720
You have to love him.

899
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,720
Just my girl.

900
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,720
I know her very well.

901
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,720
She has been so naughty since she was a child.

902
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,720
And she has a lot of skills.

903
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,720
The biggest love is to hit people.

904
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,720
To hit people.

905
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,720
How can you be so thin?

906
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,720
She is different from a girl in the blue.

907
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,720
She is gentle and sweet.

908
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,720
She is so sweet.

909
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,720
I ask you this.

910
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,720
You think you are so sweet.

911
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,720
You want to be nice to me every day.

912
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,720
Or you want to be nice to me every day?

913
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,720
Of course, I want to be nice to you.

914
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,720
I am so happy.

915
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,720
Blue rain.

916
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,720
You are here today.

917
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,720
Wait for me.

918
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,720
Blue wave.

919
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,720
Blue wave.

920
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,720
Come here.

921
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,720
I want to be a hero.

922
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,720
A hero.

923
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,720
Blue wave.

924
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,720
Help me pick a piece.

925
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,720
A very strong battle machine.

926
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,720
Let me be a hero.

927
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,720
Play.

928
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,720
OK?

929
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,720
Remember my trick.

930
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,720
OK?

931
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,720
You want to play.

932
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,720
Play once.

933
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,720
It is fun.

934
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,720
Take care.

935
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,720
Brother Lan.

936
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,720
I want to talk to you.

937
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,720
Please.

938
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,720
I want to talk to you.

939
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,720
What is your name?

940
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,720
What?

941
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,720
You know someone.

942
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,720
His name is Xie Yanfeng.

943
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,720
I want to ask a former merchant

944
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,720

Yes.

947
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,720
That merchant

948
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,720
suddenly sold 2000 seafood.

949
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,720
You should know that

950
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,720
at that time,

951
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,720
if anyone has money,

that seafood was going to happen,

955
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,720
it is impossible to sell seafood.

956
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,720

You came to help me

961
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,720
without the permission of qualified merchant.

962

What is the use of this?

963
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,720
