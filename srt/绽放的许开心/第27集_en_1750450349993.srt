The Love by Hypnotic

5
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

6
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The one sitting in front of you

7
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
is a person with a hidden identity.

8
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What identity?

9
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The head of the Mu Ying group.

10
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
My god, you're a genius.

11
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
A man can pull two little girls

12
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
so big,

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
but not so talented.

14
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
But I really have gained a lot of opinions

15
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
from the group.

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I think there's a way to...

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Mr. Bai, I want to interrupt you.

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Go ahead.

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's like this.

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I opened this cake shop

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
for two kids at first.

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Later, it became famous in the community.

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Many moms asked me to open it.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
There were more and more customers.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So recently, I plan to open

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
a physical shop at the school gate.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Can you help me promote it in the group?

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I want to do a free gift

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
to expand my business.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What do you think?

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Xu Happy,

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm using this group

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
to help us solve the problem.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You can come and do the ad.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
If you don't agree,

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'll regret the first one.

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I want to double the number of times.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Fine.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You can send it to me.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I wrote it.

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yang Gui, do you know

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
there's really a child expert

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
in my group?

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
He said

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
the group of 212

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
should not be anxious

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
to let them merge.

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Now, children

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
have some illegal psychological problems.

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We can't put ourselves

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
in the parents' shoes.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
We can just be a small group.

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
We are two managers.

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
One is the main group.

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The other is the negative group.

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
We can't let them merge.

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We have some curious psychological problems.

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The more we don't let them merge,

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
the more they want to merge.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It sounds reasonable.

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
But we can try.

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Okay.

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The last question.

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The problem of life.

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The problem of life?

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I think your problem of life

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
is already very good.

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I just hope

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
we can love our own family first.

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And love the big family

71
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
we built together.

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The contract deadline?

73
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
One year and one thousand.

74
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
If the cooperation is happy,

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
we can still renew the contract.

76
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Happy cooperation, Miss Xu.

77
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Mr. Mei Cheng Yi.

78
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Happy cooperation.

79
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Slow down.

80
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm sorry.

82
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Dad.

88
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You're here.

89
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You miss me, right?

90
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Dad, you miss me.

91
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So you're looking for me.

92
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Of course.

93
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Well.

94
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Dad, this is good.

95
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
This is good.

96
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Do you have anything else?

97
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Take it.

98
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Buy whatever you want.

99
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Okay. Thank you, dad.

100
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
How's grandma?

101
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Grandma is fine.

102
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Did you move?

103
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yes.

104
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We moved to the next door of Uncle Mei.

105
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
He's my mom's boyfriend.

106
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Where's the new house?

107
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Tell me.

108
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Dad will give you some gifts.

109
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'll take you and Di Di out to play.

110
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm sorry, dad.

111
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I promised mom

112
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I wouldn't sell her.

113
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The kids have to keep their promise.

114
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Daming.

115
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Listen to me.

116
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Dad, I want to give you...

117
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Dad, take the 200 yuan.

118
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Buy more nutrition for grandma.

119
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I have class.

120
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm leaving.

121
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
No, Daming.

122
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Daming.

123
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Daming.

124
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Think about it.

125
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
If you work in that place,

126
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
would he think

127
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
the scenery there is good and the air is fresh?

128
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The scenery is good and the air is fresh?

129
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Why didn't he go to the zoo?

130
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What?

131
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You're a father who doesn't do anything.

132
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's your fault.

133
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You're going back on your own.

134
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You're a young girl.

135
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You spent so much money abroad.

136
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Ask your friend where he works.

138
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What?

139
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
If he has the conditions,

140
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
he'll work there even if he dies.

141
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
OK, I'll support him.

142
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
As long as he insists, I'll be his first client.

143
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
This is nice.

144
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Let's take a break.

145
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
This place is really nice.

146
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
We buried Dad here.

147
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
That's right.

148
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm glad you're happy.

149
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm glad you're happy.

150
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm glad you're happy.

151
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You're here too?

152
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You're talking nonsense.

153
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
We have to come here sooner or later.

154
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
How long are you going to be here?

155
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
My feet are like sticks.

156
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
My feet are like sticks?

157
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm the eldest. You're the second.

158
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Let's not talk about each other.

159
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm sorry.

160
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Why don't you blow it?

161
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's so hot that my brain hurts.

162
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You don't know how to appreciate.

163
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You're laughing so hard.

164
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Hello, Ma'am.

165
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Thank you.

166
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Have a good day.

167
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Thank you.

168
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Master, what are you doing?

169
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Do you want to play a few games?

170
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'll take you to fly.

171
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Hello, who are you?

172
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Hello, is that Youyou?

173
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yes, you are?

174
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm the deputy director of the Civil Affairs Bureau.

175
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Your time is up.

176
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
There are not enough people in the forest.

177
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Can you report it immediately?

178
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Didn't my master tell you?

179
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's Hu Pei.

180
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Hu Pei is a famous person in the forest.

181
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
He is a good guy.

182
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm not a good guy.

183
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm a good guy.

184
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm a good guy.

185
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm a good guy.

186
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Didn't my master tell you?

187
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's Hu Pei.

188
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
He is my master.

189
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's because Hu Pei is ill.

190
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
He was in an emergency hospital.

191
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Now it's confirmed.

192
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
No one can stand the forest.

193
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Okay, I'll be right back.

194
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Right away.

195
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Okay, that's good.

196
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
We won't make any other arrangements.

197
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Otherwise, we have to find someone else.

198
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm sorry, can I ask

199
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
what's wrong with my master?

200
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
He's always in good health.

201
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
He even broke the neck.

202
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It shouldn't be sudden.

203
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I don't know the details.

204
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Okay, you can go back to work immediately.

205
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yes.

206
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Master, don't leave.

207
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Master, don't leave.

208
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Master, don't leave.

209
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Okay, I'm banana.

210
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's done.

211
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
These three colors.

212
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
How many are they?

213
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
One, three, four.

214
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,600
Does the filter look like aell?

215
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,000
D师 wawer

216
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
must have torn off a lot of it.

217
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Hey, now that these two colors

218
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
are Someone you know

219
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,280
Why did your dad call you?

220
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,120
He gave me 200 yuan first.

221
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,800
And asked if we moved.

222
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,760
Where did we move to?

223
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,920
You didn't say anything wrong, right?

224
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,840
No.

225
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm not a fool like Xiao Mi.

226
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,280
I can stand the temptation.

227
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,480
I threw 200 yuan to him.

228
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,920
I was shocked.

229
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:26,920
Good.

230
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,800
Good job.

231
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,360
Let's go.

232
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,080
I'm going to the bathroom.

233
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,400
How can we meet this kind of thing?

234
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,920
How can you tell the child?

235
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,280
You said you were a good teacher.

236
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,440
Is this still good?

237
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,400
I can't see the temple.

238
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,360
I just took the medicine out of his pocket.

239
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,400
And it got into his mouth.

240
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,480
I saw that his body didn't get up.

241
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,480
No breath.

242
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,640
And when the ambulance came,

243
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,600
the doctor touched his pulse.

244
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,680
He shook his head.

245
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,960
I forgot to go.

246
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,120
If I can't touch it,

247
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,480
at least I feel bad.

248
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,640
What's this?

249
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,720
Dad, mom.

250
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,600
There's an emergency at the office.

251
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,120
I have to go back to the rescue.

252
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:34,920
This is serious.

253
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,800
Don't make a fuss.

254
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,400
What should we do?

255
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,600
What else can we do?

256
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,920
This kind of thing happened.

257
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,440
We fought in 2012.

258
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,760
We can't

259
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,240
get our daughter back now.

260
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,040
123.

261
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,800
Come on, 123.

262
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,600
123.

263
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,800
Come here.

264
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,200
You know me?

265
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,400
123.

266
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,400
123.

267
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,400
You're not happy to see me come back?

268
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,400
I know you miss me.

269
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,400
I'm back.

270
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,200
I'm sure you'll come back, too.

271
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,000
Right?

272
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,000
Let's go.

273
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,000
Let's go.

274
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,200
Let's go.

275
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,300
The

276
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,400
Qian Hao.

277
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,200
Uncle.

278
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,800
Three days later, at 1 p.m.,

279
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,000
on the day Xiao Jiao was discharged,

280
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,800
you took your passport,

281
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,800
your marriage certificate,

282
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,000
and went to the Civil Affairs Bureau

283
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
to get a divorce.

284
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,800
Uncle.

285
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,600
Well,

286
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,600
now I'm no longer

287
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,000
the biggest obstacle between me and Xiao Jiao.

288
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,200
I don't want to divorce Xiao Jiao.

289
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,000
Qian Hao, I'm not discussing it with you.

290
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,200
I'm informing you.

291
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,000
Don't think about it.

292
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,800
You're not afraid of being threatened by me.

293
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,000
I don't care.

294
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,800
At worst, I'll quit being the head of the department.

295
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,000
But I promise

296
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,400
Jiang Cheng will not be your life.

297
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,800
Of course,

298
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,400
if you divorce Xiao Jiao

299
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,200
honestly,

300
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,000
although I don't like you,

301
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,800
but for Xiao Jiao's sake,

302
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,800
we'll see each other in the future.

303
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,200
You can measure it yourself.

304
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,000
Remember,

305
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,400
three days later, at 1 p.m.,

306
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,800
see you at the door of the Civil Affairs Bureau.

307
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,800
Uncle.

308
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,400
We're back.

309
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,400
Mom, we're back.

310
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,400
We're back.

311
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,200
Come in.

312
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,400
Mom, why can't I see the next door?

313
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,600
In order to prevent the second world war,

314
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,600
we have to wait for the next war.

315
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,600
I'm sorry.

316
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,600
I'm sorry.

317
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,600
I'm sorry.

318
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,600
I'm sorry.

319
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,600
I'm sorry.

320
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,600
I'm sorry.

321
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,600
I'm sorry.

322
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,600
I'm sorry.

323
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,600
I'm sorry.

324
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,800
The second world war

325
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,600
starts today.

326
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,400
You're not allowed to play with your neighbor's children.

327
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,200
But isn't Uncle Mei your boyfriend?

328
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,800
So what if he's my boyfriend?

329
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,400
His child has nothing to do with you.

330
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,400
This family

331
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,200
will always belong to you and Xiaomi.

332
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,200
Mom.

333
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,200
Eat.

334
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,200
Okay.

335
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,400
Come on, eat.

336
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,400
Eat.

337
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,200
Dad, why can't we

338
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,800
play with the hateful ghosts?

339
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,800
Yeah.

340
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,600
Because they're hateful ghosts.

341
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,800
If you don't like them,

342
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,400
then let's not play with them.

343
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,800
We can't be wronged by Yu An and Yu Le, right?

344
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,400
But they're happy, Auntie.

345
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,800
Happy, Auntie.

346
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,600
If you don't like them,

347
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,200
you can still keep your distance.

348
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
But...

349
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,600
Okay, eat first.

350
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,000
Come to the balcony. There's a hearty meal.

351
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,200
Eat more.

352
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,400
Here.

353
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,800
What is it?

354
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,000
Open it.

355
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,200
Jiu Cai You Hua?

356
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,200
Just eat it.

357
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,400
Honey, hurry up.

358
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,200
You can't be late today.

359
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,800
Xiao Jiao will go to the Civil Affairs Bureau to divorce later.

360
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,800
Will Qian Hao go?

361
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,600
Divorce is not that simple.

362
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,000
As long as you don't be greedy,

363
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,600
there's no divorce.

364
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,400
They don't have any common property.

365
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,400
That house is Qian Hao's.

366
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,000
Xiao Jiao's property is all money.

367
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,200
The money my sister gave him these years,

368
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,400
Xiao Jiao spent two on one.

369
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,400
I think he doesn't have much left.

370
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,400
As for Qian Hao's salary and share,

371
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,200
I'll just give it to his mother to cure his illness.

372
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,400
My sister doesn't need that money anyway.

373
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,800
Divorce is a big deal.

374
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,200
There's a follow-up question.

375
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,800
What is it?

376
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,400
Where do your sister and Xiao Jiao live?

377
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,400
Honey, let's let them stay at home for a few days.

378
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,000
I promise,

379
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,600
no matter how long they stay,

380
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,400
my sister will take Xiao Jiao abroad.

381
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,800
By then,

382
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:09,000
we'll still be living a good life.

383
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,400
Then you pray.

384
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,800
Pray that they won't divorce in these few days.

385
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,400
No, no.

386
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,400
They won't.

387
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,400
Don't worry.

388
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,400
Honey, what's wrong?

389
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,400
You can't do that.

390
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,400
You just had surgery.

391
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,400
Mom, I'm fine.

392
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,400
I'm lying down. I'm all stiff.

393
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,400
I'm fine.

394
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,400
You can't move.

395
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,400
Slowly.

396
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,400
Tidy up.

397
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,400
Tian Ya is giving me a bad temper.

398
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,400
I don't know what she's up to.

399
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,400
Mom,

400
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,400
you're still lying to Tian Ya?

401
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,400
I'm not lying.

402
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,400
We're communicating.

403
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,400
Mom, stop it.

404
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,400
You can't get the money back.

405
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,400
What should we do?

406
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,400
Mom will know if we have the money.

407
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,400
Why did she lie to us?

408
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,400
Half a dollar.

409
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,400
What are you doing?

410
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,400
I'm collecting it.

411
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,400
I have to collect it.

412
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,400
This is great.

413
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,400
No, mom.

414
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,400
You're lying.

415
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
My ancestors,

416
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,400
I'm begging you.

417
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,400
The world is in a bad mood.

418
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,400
I'm begging you.

419
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,400
Don't give me any more bad things.

420
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,400
Hurry up.

421
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
Give the money back to her.

422
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,400
And you can give us the money back.

423
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,400
That's a good person.

424
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,400
Besides, Tian Ya is not a liar.

425
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,400
You're such a silly kid.

426
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,400
Let me tell you.

427
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,400
Look at this group.

428
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,400
This group is actually set up for you by Tian Ya.

429
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,400
It's all liars.

430
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,400
I know that killing the main character

431
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,400
killed a lot of high-level intellectuals.

432
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,400
University students, PhD students, and PhD students.

433
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,400
I didn't expect my daughter

434
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,400
to be fooled by him.

435
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,400
You're the one who's lying.

436
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,400
Shut up.

437
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,400
How could I lie to him?

438
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,400
This is my investment profit.

439
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,400
He gave it to me.

440
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,400
Of course I'll take it.

441
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,400
I told him that

442
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,400
we have a lot of money.

443
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,400
If you have a high profit,

444
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,400
we'll invest another 1.8 million.

445
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,400
So he thought that

446
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,400
I might still invest if I have a chance.

447
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,400
That's why he gave me such a high profit.

448
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,400
Of course I'll take it.

449
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,400
I'll give you 5,000.

450
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,400
You take it.

451
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
Even though flies are small, they're meat.

452
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,400
That's how our family makes money.

453
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,400
I'll have to get rid of them.

454
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,400
Mum.

455
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,400
You're going to delete it?

456
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,400
I have to delete it.

457
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,400
You're so silly.

458
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,400
I'll delete it.

459
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,400
If you keep contacting him, I'll lie to him.

460
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,400
You can't contact him.

461
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,400
Give me your hand.

462
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,400
You've deleted it.

463
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,400
Fine, I'll give you my hand.

464
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,400
Don't be angry.

465
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,400
It's bad for your health.

466
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,400
I know you're kind and pure.

467
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,400
But these people

468
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,400
want to set a trap for us.

469
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,400
No way.

470
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,400
This woman is really rich.

471
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,400
She's a little silly.

472
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,400
I'm too embarrassed to lie to her.

473
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,400
Let's do this.

474
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,400
Let's just cheat him 100,000.

475
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,400
Let's just pay him.

476
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,400
Are you a fool?

477
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,400
You're afraid that I'll get a big client.

478
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,400
What's wrong with you?

479
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,400
What are you doing?

480
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,400
The more soft-hearted a man is,

481
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,400
the more he can't hide from the big thing.

482
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,400
You can use the transformation software to talk to him.

483
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,400
If you lie to him again today,

484
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,400
and then only pay him back the interest,

485
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,400
then we'll have a stable and stable relationship.

486
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,400
It's a small thing.

487
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,400
Look at it.

488
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,400
Look at this.

489
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
This technology is really amazing.

490
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,400
It's just a little thing.

491
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,400
You're not talking to yourself.

492
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,400
You can choose between men and women.

493
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,400
But the sound is still good.

494
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,400
Wait.

495
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,400
Jiu Jiu.

496
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,400
You've seen the profit of this project.

497
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,400
It's really a rare opportunity.

498
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,400
If you're interested,

499
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,400
I can talk to the partner.

500
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,400
I'll leave you some

501
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,400
to invest in the family.

502
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,400
You don't have to follow me

503
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,400
to make that money.

504
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,400
You're not his friend.

505
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,400
Please send a friend to verify your request.

506
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,400
Who is this?

507
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,400
Who dares to cheat?

508
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,400
If you cheat,

509
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,400
you'll be killed by the group.

510
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,400
Brothers,

511
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,400
gather.

512
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,400
Come on.

513
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,400
Now the signal of our battle has been blown.

514
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,400
I don't believe this evil.

515
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,400
If this bill can't get 300,000,

516
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,400
I'll jump off this cloud.

517
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,400
Open the door.

518
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,400
Open the door.

519
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,400
Open the door.

520
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,400
It's been five minutes.

521
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,400
Did Qian Hao change his mind?

522
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,400
He changed.

523
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,400
If he doesn't come,

524
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,400
I'll find someone to tie him up.

525
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,400
I have to tie him up here.

526
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,400
Why?

527
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,400
I'll call him.

528
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,400
My uncle is not bad.

529
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,400
He's getting divorced soon.

530
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,400
I want to be polite.

531
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,400
This is very precious.

532
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,400
Thank you.

533
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,400
Let's go in.

534
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,400
Go in.

535
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,400
It's so romantic to get divorced.

536
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,400
See?

537
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,400
After experiencing this,

538
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,400
Xiao Qiao seems to grow up suddenly.

539
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,400
The 30-day calm period is a good date for you.

540
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,400
Come and get your divorce certificate.

541
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,400
Xiao Qiao,

542
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,400
my mom's illness

543
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,400
needs money recently.

544
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,400
When it's over,

545
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,400
I'll definitely give you more money.

546
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,400
Qian Hao,

547
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,400
if I lack money,

548
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,400
I won't bother to be with you.

549
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,400
I'm sorry.

550
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,400
I have another request.

551
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,400
Go ahead.

552
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,400
Can I

553
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,400
see you get a divorce certificate in the end?

554
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,400
Okay.

555
00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:00,400
I didn't expect to be afraid of the shadow of light

556
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:05,400
Let time let myself be transparent

557
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:10,400
Wait for him to deal with it alone every night

558
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:16,400
Sea bird waits for you every day

559
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,400
Winter is for waiting for spring to come

560
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:26,400
Stopped to start better

561
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,400
Growing up is not not to be willful

562
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:38,400
But not afraid of losing

563
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,400
In a city

564
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,400
Leave some unknown

565
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,400
Give yourself a wonderful story

566
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,400
There is a end, there is a time

567
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,400
There is love, there is persistence

568
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,400
For yourself, there are thousands of times

569
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,400
Know each other

570
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,400
Choose to be stubborn

571
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,400
Don't be afraid of ignorance

572
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,400
Only want to be an adult's childish

573
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,400
Use the key of the heart

574
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,400
Open the silent house

575
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:49,400
Open the silent house

576
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,400
Hurry up.

577
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,400
Get up.

578
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,400
Get up, Qingcheng.

579
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,400
Hurry up.

580
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,400
You're late.

581
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,400
Hurry up.

582
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,400
Yuan Yule.

583
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,400
Hurry up.

584
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,400
Hurry up.

585
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,400
Let's go.

586
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,400
Let's go.

587
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,400
Let's go.

588
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,400
Yuan, put it back.

589
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,400
Okay.

590
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,400
Hurry up.

591
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,400
Yuan,

592
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,400
I'll take care of you.

593
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,400
Have you made your choice?

594
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,400
Hurry up.

595
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,400
Let's make a choice.

596
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,400
I can do it.

597
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,400
Go.

598
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,620
Feng sing.

599
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,560
so much

600
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,520
New year is opening.

601
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,600
I prepared a basket for you.

602
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:29,600
works hard

603
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,220
Tell your mother to order more.

604
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,380
Shut up!

605
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,520
my family and my people and his family

606
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,420
lived next to my home.

607
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,480
s sing life

608
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,080
Sometimes, the happiness needs to be helped

609
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,080
and full of emotional value.

610
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,280
Both families should keep their own independence

611
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,280
and respect each other's life.

612
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,280
They should also put their teeth on each other.

613
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,280
Everything is harmonious.

614
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:59,480
Except for the unsuitable four-year-old.

615
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,080
We're here to play.

616
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,080
We're leaving first.

617
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,080
Xiao Mi, go.

618
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,480
Mom, we're leaving first.

619
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,880
Only you can play.

620
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,880
We can too.

621
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,480
Mom, mom, mom.

622
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,480
Go.

623
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,680
We're leaving first.

624
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,680
Let's go.

625
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,680
Let's go.

626
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,680
Sister, let them solve the child's problem.

627
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,080
Yes, let them solve it themselves.

628
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,680
We're leaving first.

629
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,280
We're leaving first.

630
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,080
My brother is also very good.

631
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,480
Whoever bullies me, I'll bite him.

632
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,280
My sister is also very good.

633
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,080
My brother is also very good.

634
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:27,880
What are you doing?

635
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,480
Sister, I...

636
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,280
Shut up.

637
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:29,880
What is it?

638
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,280
My sister is also very good.

639
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,080
Sister, go.

640
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,480
I don't want to.

641
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,280
No.

642
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,080
Then my dad is also very good.

643
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,880
Dad, mom, go.

644
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,680
Mom, go.

645
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,680
Mom, go.

646
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,680
Hurry up.

647
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,080
Go.

648
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:43,880
Go.

649
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,680
Hurry up.

650
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,480
We're running out of time.

651
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,280
Hurry up.

652
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,880
Mom, we have a car.

653
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,280
Mom has a car too.

654
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,280
Let's go.

655
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,080
Okay, okay.

656
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,480
My mom is a tiger.

657
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,280
Hurry up.

658
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,080
Mom has a car too.

659
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,080
Get in the car.

660
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,480
Hurry up.

661
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:58,880
Hurry up.

662
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,480
Get in the car.

663
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,480
We have a car.

664
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,280
We're running out of time.

665
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:01,680
Stop arguing.

666
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,680
Hurry up.

667
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,680
We have a car.

668
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,680
Happy.

669
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,880
Mom, drive.

670
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,480
My dad's car is the best.

671
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,880
I'll get you some fruit.

672
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,080
I'll drive.

673
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,080
Thank you.

674
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,080
My dad has a car too.

675
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,280
Mom has a car too.

676
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,680
Stop arguing.

677
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,280
You did a great job today.

678
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:31,880
You know what?

679
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,880
Your duty is to protect your sister.

680
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,480
I'll let you be my little knight.

681
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,480
Yes, Your Highness.

682
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,080
Love you without any jokes.

683
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,080
Love you without any lies.

684
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,080
Love you with all your heart and no despair.

685
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,080
It's all happiness every day.

686
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,080
You said, happy.

687
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,080
Life is a battle every day.

688
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,080
I once read this saying in my old age.

689
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,080
If a person can escape the natural disaster and avoid war in his life,

690
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,080
it's already a great life if he doesn't get sick from a bad person.

691
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,080
If he can still have a stable family and a harmonious income,

692
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,080
it's a great blessing.

693
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,080
In the impermanence of life,

694
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:16,080
a family can be in peace and harmony.

695
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,080
I don't know which one of you knows the life summary.

696
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,080
It's the effect of my fatigue.

697
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,080
So I appreciate the life I have now.

698
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,080
But if Qian Feng hadn't appeared in the time of the destruction,

699
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,080
I think I would be more grateful.

700
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,080
Da Yuan.

701
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,080
Bye.

702
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,080
Bye.

703
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,080
Let's go.

704
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,080
Lin Yun.

705
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,080
I'm sorry.

706
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,080
I was crazy about things before.

707
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,080
Now I'm calm.

708
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,080
Can we have a good chat?

709
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,080
Okay.

710
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,080
Ten minutes.

711
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,080
You're so busy now.

712
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,080
It's been a minute now.

713
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,080
I'll wait for you.

714
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,080
I'll go with you.

715
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,080
No need.

716
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,080
This matter will be discussed sooner or later.

717
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:27,080
You don't know that Da Mi has been following him every day after school.

718
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:31,080
Da Mi is going to go back home several times in order not to expose our new home.

719
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,080
It's not good to do this.

720
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,080
It will be solved sooner and more stable.

721
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,080
I'm sorry.

722
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,080
It's too early.

723
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,080
There is no cafe.

724
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,080
We can only eat here.

725
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,080
It's good.

726
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,080
This soy milk is healthier than coffee.

727
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,080
But I have eaten breakfast.

728
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,080
I forgot.

729
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:00,080
You are a woman who can take care of yourself and others.

730
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,080
You can exercise these things.

731
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,080
You have eaten it.

732
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,080
I remember you like this crab soup bun.

733
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,080
I ordered it for you.

734
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,080
Thank you.

735
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,080
I'm not polite.

736
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,080
You look calm.

737
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,080
Is your mother's condition better?

738
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:28,080
Life is changing.

739
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,080
It's always changing.

740
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,080
You used to call her mother.

741
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,080
Now it can only be a mother-in-law.

742
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,080
Then call your mother.

743
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,080
At least there is a mother.

744
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,080
It's harmonious now.

745
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,080
Xu Kai Qi, you...

746
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,080
How can you be so angry now?

747
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,080
You are getting more and more...

748
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,080
You were so gentle and virtuous before.

749
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,080
My mother was sick.

750
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,080
You ran ahead and ran back.

751
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,080
I didn't even worry about it.

752
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,080
Aren't we divorced now?

753
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:56,080
Do you need to be so good at talking and doing things?

754
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,080
Qian Hao, I found that you are a very exquisite

755
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,080
and quick-witted person.

756
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,080
Let me tell you.

757
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,080
First of all, you lost the millet thread.

758
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,080
I only added conditions to ensure the safety of the child.

759
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,080
And your mother's life is life.

760
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,080
My life with the child is not life.

761
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,080
Do you remember what you were arguing with your mother at that time?

762
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,080
You said you thought of the scene when I was producing.

763
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,080
You feel disgusting.

764
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,080
Your mother is more interesting.

765
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,080
When she saw that Da Mi was a daughter, she left.

766
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,080
She was pretending to be sick all month.

767
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,080
She didn't show her face.

768
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,080
At least I'm telling the truth.

769
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,080
I didn't do anything wrong.

770
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,080
I insisted on applying medicine for you, right?

771
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,080
My mother's health has always been bad.

772
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,080
What's more to say?

773
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,080
I don't want to talk about these things with you.

774
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,080
It's the hardest thing to raise this child before he was three years old.

775
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,080
How much power did your family contribute?

776
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,080
Now you come to ask for millet's custody.

777
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,080
Tell me what kind of inheritance.

778
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,080
Qian Hao.

779
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,080
I didn't think about having a second child at that time.

780
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,080
How I was pregnant with you is the most clear to you.

781
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:02,080
If you didn't use Yinzhao, you could have millet.

782
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,080
You dare to say you love children.

783
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,080
Motherly love is the nature of women.

784
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,080
Although I am not a woman, I know women.

785
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,080
I also know motherly love.

786
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,080
What should a mother do?

787
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,080
Production will cause irreversible damage to women.

788
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:20,080
After giving birth to a child, women face the pressure and burden of life.

789
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,080
Many mothers have depression after giving birth.

790
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,080
They can even resist the child.

791
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:30,080
But as a mother, everyone knows that the child is not his only choice in this world.

792
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,080
Since the choice is born, you have to be responsible for him.

793
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,080
Is it difficult to have a child?

794
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,080
I tell you, it's difficult.

795
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,080
But the hardest thing here is to rely on you and your mother and son.

796
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,080
All mothers have been through this.

797
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,080
When my mother gave birth to me, my father didn't come home.

798
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,080
He was also raised by me alone.

799
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,080
Now my mother is sick.

800
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,080
My father has let go of everything and went home to accompany my mother.

801
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,080
After all, we are a family.

802
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,080
Then you should be a family.

803
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,080
Let him take care of you and respect you.

804
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,080
But please don't disturb my life.

805
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:06,080
We are both now passersby except for these two children.

806
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,080
Brother Mei, come back.

807
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,080
Brother Mei.

808
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,080
Brother Mei, you are back.

809
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,080
You are on vacation.

810
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,080
We don't know where we are.

811
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,080
Like a fly.

812
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,080
What's going on?

813
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,080
I was going to celebrate my birthday.

814
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,080
I asked for a year's leave.

815
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,080
I'll treat everyone to dinner on my birthday.

816
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,080
I'll make up for it.

817
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,080
Okay.

818
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,080
Great.

819
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,080
President Li, I've already told Ke Wu about that.

820
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,080
The location has been agreed.

821
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,080
Don't worry.

822
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,080
This bitch.

823
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:11,080
Why did she delete me after she took my money?

824
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,080
If she has this IQ,

825
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:18,080
then who was the main character between her and us?

826
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:21,080
She is so bad.

827
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,080
Yes.

828
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,080
She cheated us five thousand yuan.

829
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,080
If she can't get it back,

830
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,080
she will be our colleague.

831
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,080
She is so bad.

832
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,080
There are more things to be done in the world.

833
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,080
The hardest thing in the world is to persist.

834
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,080
How can she persist?

835
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,080
She deleted us.

836
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,080
We can't get the money back.

837
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,080
The key is to be a good person.

838
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,080
I know.

839
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,080
I know.

840
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,080
If she deleted us,

841
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,080
we can't get the money back.

842
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,080
The key is to be a good person.

843
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,080
This is for you.

844
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,080
I've prepared two plans.

845
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,080
Since the first plan can't work,

846
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,080
it's the second one.

847
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,080
I promise you.

848
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,080
If I take Xiaomi away again,

849
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,080
we will divorce and make a deal.

850
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,080
I will give you the house.

851
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,080
Really?

852
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,080
I have no choice.

853
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,080
My mother's body is already like this.

854
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,080
Hu Xiaojiao is going to divorce me soon.

855
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,080
I don't need the house without them.

856
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,080
I just beg you.

857
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,080
Let Xiaomi accompany my mother more.

858
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,080
Okay?

859
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,080
If you had taken this out earlier,

860
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,080
our conversation today

861
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,080
would have been very happy.

862
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,080
I'll treat you breakfast.

863
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,080
Do you want to eat something else?

864
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,080
No, I'm full.

865
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,080
Let's go to the public office.

866
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,080
Why are you in a hurry?

867
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,080
The business is about to start.

868
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,080
It's all set.

869
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,080
That's right.

870
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,080
It's okay to be late.

871
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,080
We were also on time when we got married.

872
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,080
We didn't have to work.

873
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,080
You...

874
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:09,080
Xu Kai, why are you so realistic now?

875
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,080
No, I just don't want to

876
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,080
delay your divorce with Hu Xiaojiao.

877
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,080
Hurry up.

878
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,080
Your wife has a picture of me.

879
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,080
Do you want to see it?

880
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,080
What's wrong?

881
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,080
You regretted it so soon?

882
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,080
No, it's impossible.

883
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,080
How is it?

884
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,080
Go to the public office.

885
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,080
Why go to the public office?

886
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,080
Sign a contract.

887
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,080
I'm sorry.

888
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,080
I'm sorry.

889
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,080
I'm sorry.

890
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,080
I'm sorry.

891
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,080
I'm sorry.

892
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,080
I'm sorry.

893
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,080
I'm sorry.

894
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,080
I'm sorry.

895
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,080
I'm sorry.

896
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,080
I'm sorry.

897
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,080
I'm sorry.

898
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,080
I'm sorry.

899
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,080
I'm sorry.

900
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,080
I'm sorry.

901
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,080
I'm sorry.

902
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,080
I'm sorry.

903
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,080
I'm sorry.

904
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,080
I'm sorry.

905
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,080
I'm sorry.

906
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,080
I'm sorry.

907
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,080
I'm sorry.

908
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,080
I'm sorry.

909
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,080
I'm sorry.

910
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,080
I'm sorry.

911
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,080
I'm sorry.

912
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,080
I'm sorry.

913
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,080
I'm sorry.

914
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,080
I'm sorry.

915
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,080
I'm sorry.

916
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,080
I'm sorry.

917
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,080
I'm sorry.

918
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,080
I'm sorry.

919
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,080
I'm sorry.

920
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,080
I'm sorry.

921
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,080
I'm sorry.

922
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,080
I'm sorry.

923
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,080
I'm sorry.

924
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,080
I'm sorry.

925
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,080
I'm sorry.

926
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,080
I'm sorry.

927
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,080
I'm sorry.

928
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,080
I'm sorry.

929
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,080
I'm sorry.

930
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,080
I'm sorry.

931
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,080
I'm sorry.

932
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,080
I'm sorry.

933
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,080
I'm sorry.

934
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,080
I'm sorry.

935
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,080
I'm sorry.

936
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,080
I'm sorry.

937
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:02,080
I'm sorry.

938
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,080
I'm sorry.

939
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,080
I'm sorry.

940
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,080
