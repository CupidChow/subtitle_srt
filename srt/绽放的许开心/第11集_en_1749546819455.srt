1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I see your pain as you're braying too

2
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Some things we cannot just embrace

3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And there's no time to guess the ground above

4
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Create a daylight, go to the free

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let's cross the wind, dance in rain Let it start to move my net away

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,160
Oh, this I feel is happiness

7
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,200
They are all bought of a journey

8
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,940
I'm just an ordinary middle-aged man

9
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,240
How could I hold it for a lifetime

10
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,260
If you...

11
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,440
Help!

12
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,080
Someone jumped

13
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,080
Help!

14
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,080
Help!

15
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,080
Help!

16
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,080
Help!

17
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,080
Don't you dare to scare me!

18
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,080
Help!

19
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,080
Help!

20
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,080
Help!

21
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,080
Help!

22
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,080
Dad!

23
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,080
This is not my dad!

24
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,080
Dad!

25
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,080
Who are you?

26
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,080
Dad!

27
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,080
Help!

28
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,080
Help!

29
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,080
Help!

30
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,080
Help!

31
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,080
Help!

32
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,080
Help!

33
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,080
Help!

34
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,080
Dad!

35
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,080
Dad!

36
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,080
Dad!

37
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,080
Help!

38
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,080
Don't be like this!

39
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,080
Hurry!

40
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,080
Help!

41
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,080
Alma!

42
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,080
Look for her!

43
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,080
Help!

44
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,080
Don't be afraid!

45
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,080
No, I can't reach her.

46
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,080
Don't be afraid.

47
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,080
Come on!

48
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,080
Don't be afraid.

49
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,080
Watch out.

50
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,080
Pull him up!

51
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,080
What are you doing?

52
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,080
Move! Move!

53
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,080
What are you doing?

54
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,080
What are you doing?

55
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,080
I heard that someone was dancing.

56
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,080
I saw that person wearing the same clothes as you.

57
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,080
I didn't think about it.

58
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,080
Are you okay?

59
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,080
I'm fine.

60
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,080
Are you okay?

61
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,080
I'm fine.

62
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,080
I'm fine.

63
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,080
I'm fine.

64
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,080
I'm fine.

65
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,080
I'm fine.

66
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,080
I'm fine.

67
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,080
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,080
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,080
I'm fine.

70
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,080
I'm fine.

71
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,080
I'm fine.

72
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,080
It's really nice to have a daughter in the family.

73
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,080
You should take care of her.

74
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,080
By the way, how is your relationship with Xu Kai Xin?

75
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,080
It's about time.

76
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,080
He's become...

77
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,080
He's completely out of his mind.

78
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,080
I've been suspecting him for so many years.

79
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,080
Is he the same person as me?

80
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,080
How could that be?

81
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,080
But son,

82
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,080
when you got divorced,

83
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,080
we seemed to have done something too harsh.

84
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,080
But it's okay.

85
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,080
Didn't Hu Xiaojiao get pregnant?

86
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,080
Don't let Hu Xiaojiao know about this.

87
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,080
It's over.

88
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,080
I've already called Hu Xiaojiao.

89
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,080
How could you do this, Xu Kai Xin?

90
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,080
What are you going to do?

91
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,080
Don't be so mean.

92
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,080
Don't mention it. I'll send you home.

93
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,080
You...

94
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,080
Don't fight.

95
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,080
It's a small matter.

96
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,080
Your child is in a big trouble.

97
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,080
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,080
I'm sorry.

99
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,080
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,080
I'm sorry.

101
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,080
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,080
I'm sorry.

103
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,080
I'm sorry.

104
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,080
I'm sorry.

105
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,080
I'm sorry.

106
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,080
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,080
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,080
I'm sorry.

109
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,080
I'm sorry.

110
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,080
I'm sorry.

111
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,080
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,080
I'm sorry.

113
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,080
I'm sorry.

114
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,080
I'm sorry.

115
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,080
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,080
I'm sorry.

117
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,080
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,080
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,080
I'm sorry.

120
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,080
I'm sorry.

121
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,080
I'm sorry.

122
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,080
I'm sorry.

123
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,080
I'm sorry.

124
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,080
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,080
I'm sorry.

126
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,080
I'm sorry.

127
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,080
I'm sorry.

128
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,080
I'm sorry.

129
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,080
I'm sorry.

130
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,080
I'm sorry.

131
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,080
I'm sorry.

132
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,080
I'm sorry.

133
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,080
I'm sorry.

134
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,080
I'm sorry.

135
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,080
I'm sorry.

136
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,080
I'm sorry.

137
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,080
I'm sorry.

138
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,080
I'm sorry.

139
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,080
I'm sorry.

140
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,080
I'm sorry.

141
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,080
I'm sorry.

142
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,080
Hello, Mr. Hai.

143
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,080
Open the door.

144
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,080
I'm really regretful now.

145
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,080
I really realized what I've missed these past years.

146
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,080
In my heart,

147
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,080
the child in the little hole is never bigger than the one in the big one.

148
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,080
I'm sorry.

149
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,080
I'm sorry.

150
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,080
I'm sorry.

151
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,080
I'm sorry.

152
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,080
I'm sorry.

153
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,080
I'm sorry.

154
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,080
I'm sorry.

155
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,080
I'm sorry.

156
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,080
I'm sorry.

157
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,080
Hello?

158
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,080
Hello, Xiaoxiao.

159
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,080
Your husband is being arrested.

160
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,080
Come and do the procedures.

161
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,080
I'm sorry.

162
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,080
Ghost!

163
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,080
Ghost!

164
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,080
You're the ghost.

165
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,080
You're all ghosts.

166
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,080
Ghost!

167
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,080
I'm scared to death.

168
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,080
Didn't you go to your son's house these days?

169
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,080
Why didn't you say hello and come back?

170
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,080
You're sleeping in the bed all night.

171
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,080
What are you doing?

172
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,080
I came back all of a sudden.

173
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,080
I came to see if you had broken your shoes.

174
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,080
I came to do the shoulder.

175
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,080
I've been thinking about it all day.

176
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,080
It's a bit positive.

177
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,080
Okay, okay.

178
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,080
I don't want to argue with you.

179
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,080
I'm going to sleep.

180
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,080
I'm kidding.

181
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,080
I have good news to tell you.

182
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,080
What good news?

183
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,080
I'm coming.

184
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,080
We're talking.

185
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,080
Good news?

186
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,080
I have to talk.

187
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,080
Come on.

188
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,080
Hu Xiaojiao is pregnant.

189
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,080
You're going to have a grandson in your family.

190
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,080
That's all?

191
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,080
Isn't that good news?

192
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,080
Okay, okay.

193
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,080
I know.

194
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,080
I'm going to sleep.

195
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,080
What's your attitude?

196
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,080
I'm the one who's busy with money.

197
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,080
The emperor doesn't have time to do that.

198
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,080
You're going to have a grandson in your family.

199
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,080
You're really the attitude.

200
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,080
I really don't know what you're going to do when you're old.

201
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,080
You're going to have a grandson and a granddaughter.

202
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,080
Now you're going to have a grandson and a granddaughter.

203
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,080
You're going to have a grandson and a granddaughter.

204
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,080
Is that good news?

205
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,080
Of course.

206
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,080
Xu Kexin is in the middle.

207
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,080
Mi and Mi won't kiss us.

208
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,080
They won't live here.

209
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,080
Why don't they kiss their relatives?

210
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,080
You're in the middle of money, okay?

211
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,080
Why don't you go abroad?

212
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,080
Yes, I'm in the middle of money.

213
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,080
How can I go abroad?

214
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,080
Don't be so angry with me.

215
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,080
I'm angry with you.

216
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,080
I'm telling you.

217
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,080
Didn't you say that your son is a flower-hearted person?

218
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,080
That's your family's memory.

219
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,080
What does it have to do with me?

220
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,080
I admit it.

221
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,080
But I'm better than your son.

222
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,080
Do you have any feelings for him?

223
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,080
You and your son thought that

224
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,080
Xu Kexin was a girl in his belly.

225
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,080
You were just pretending to be divorced.

226
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,080
You asked him to take her away.

227
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,080
What did I say?

228
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,080
Did I force you to oppose it?

229
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,080
I told my son that

230
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,080
you're going to get married soon.

231
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,080
You have to keep your family's red flag.

232
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,080
You're a dead man.

233
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,080
What red flag?

234
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,080
I'm telling you.

235
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,080
I got divorced with you for my son.

236
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,080
You're a loser.

237
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,080
You're a loser.

238
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,080
I have a few more to talk about.

239
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,080
What about you?

240
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,080
You're a bad boy.

241
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,080
You and your son are not bad people.

242
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,080
I'm a bad person.

243
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,080
I'm a bad woman.

244
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,080
Why are you in the same bed with me?

245
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,080
Get out.

246
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,080
Get out.

247
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,080
Get out.

248
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,080
Get out.

249
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,080
I'm still a bad woman.

250
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,080
Go find the partners.

251
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,080
Go find the partners.

252
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:53,340
The workers of

253
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,340
Don't sleep here.

254
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,340
Don't sleep here.

255
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:59,340
Oh, right. Chen Yi.

256
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,340
It's getting late.

257
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,340
The kids are all asleep.

258
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,340
Don't wake them up.

259
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,340
Let them sleep here.

260
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,340
Chen Yi hasn't changed his clothes yet.

261
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,340
His hair hasn't blown yet.

262
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,340
Youyou, hurry up.

263
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,340
Let's go find something to wear.

264
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,340
Take your dad's clothes.

265
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,340
No, no, no.

266
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,340
Put them on first.

267
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,340
No, no, no.

268
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,340
It's really okay.

269
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,340
The house is not far away.

270
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,340
I'll go back and change.

271
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,340
I'm already disturbed.

272
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,340
I'll take them away.

273
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,340
You...

274
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,340
The kids are asleep.

275
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,340
Don't bother them.

276
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,340
It's really okay.

277
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,340
I'll take them away.

278
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,340
You can have a good rest.

279
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,340
Why do you have to take them away?

280
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,340
What are you doing?

281
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,340
You haven't finished your hair yet.

282
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,340
No, no, no.

283
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,340
It's getting late.

284
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,340
You go to bed first.

285
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,340
There's something wrong.

286
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,340
Jin Mi.

287
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,340
Go wash your face.

288
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,340
Go to bed early.

289
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,340
I'm leaving.

290
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,340
I'll wash my face.

291
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,340
Come on.

292
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,340
Jin Mi, bye.

293
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,340
Chen Yi,

294
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:19,340
when will you take the kids away?

295
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,340
I'll kill you.

296
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:23,340
You should be careful with those things.

297
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,340
Just sit down.

298
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,340
You two should sit down and rest.

299
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,340
Sister.

300
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,340
Go to bed.

301
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,340
But I can't sleep.

302
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,340
Tomorrow, you have to go to school.

303
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,340
You have to go to kindergarten.

304
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,340
Why didn't Dad want me?

305
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,340
Who said he didn't want you?

306
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,340
He didn't want you to go with him.

307
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,340
He didn't want you to go with him.

308
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:24,340
He and Grandma don't want me.

309
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,340
Why?

310
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,340
Why?

311
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,340
Because you're a girl.

312
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,340
Dad comes to me every time.

313
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,340
He asks me questions.

314
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,340
He asks you.

315
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,340
He asks me to pick you up.

316
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,340
I said I was stupid.

317
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,340
Don't you want to betray us and go to Dad?

318
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,340
Dad hugged me today.

319
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,340
But I still want him to hug me.

320
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,340
Hug me.

321
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:59,340
My good friend's parents are divorced.

322
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,340
He said we're the most pitiful kids.

323
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,340
No matter if Dad and Mom love us or not,

324
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:06,340
we don't have the right to choose them.

325
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,340
We just want to be with them.

326
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,340
I'm sorry.

327
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,340
I want us to be like this.

328
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,340
I'm sorry.

329
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,340
Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad.

330
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,340
Come on.

331
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,340
Come on.

332
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,340
Be careful.

333
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,340
Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad.

334
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,340
Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad.

335
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,340
Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad.

336
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,340
Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad.

337
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,340
Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad.

338
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,340
Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad.

339
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,340
Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad.

340
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,340
Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad.

341
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,340
Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad.

342
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,340
Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad.

343
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,340
Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad.

344
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,340
Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad.

345
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,340
Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad.

346
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,340
Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad.

347
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,340
Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad.

348
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,340
Mom, Dad, Mom, Mom, Dad, Mom.

349
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,340
Mom, Dad, Dad, Mom, Dad.

350
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,340
Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad.

351
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,340
Li Xiao-qiao.

352
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,340
You went to college to take the serious class.

353
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,340
As a child, you're always so unfair.

354
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,340
Why are you asking me for your education?

355
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,340
Because I probably made her a phone call.

356
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,340
I'm not.

357
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,340
My mom,

358
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,340
the news is too big tonight.

359
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,340
Qianhao is harassing you again.

360
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,340
No,

361
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,340
Zhanna and her mom

362
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,340
are chasing after her home.

363
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,340
Oh, right.

364
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,340
Qianhao said Hu Xiaojiao is pregnant.

365
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,340
Her mom wants to do medical work.

366
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,340
She left this for her stomach.

367
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,340
She was rejected.

368
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,340
She says she only has rice in her heart.

369
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,340
She has been with Hu Xiaojiao for a long time.

370
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,340
Hello.

371
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,340
Hello.

372
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,340
Little girl.

373
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,340
I don't know what I said

374
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,340
about these two kids.

375
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,340
They've been running around.

376
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,340
I don't have any private space now.

377
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,340
Zhanna, come back.

378
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,340
Are you crazy?

379
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,340
You're the one who's responsible.

380
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,340
These are all Hu Xiaojiao's information.

381
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,340
No, wait a minute.

382
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,340
I'll give you a summary.

383
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,340
Hu Xiaojiao is pregnant.

384
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,340
Zhanna doesn't want to be responsible.

385
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,340
She's just like Qianqi.

386
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,340
Qianhao is not a spiritual separation.

387
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,340
She's just...

388
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,340
She's not her mother.

389
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,340
She's a cat anyway.

390
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,340
If Qianhao finds out about this,

391
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,340
she'll be dead.

392
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,340
But you're so cool.

393
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,340
You just called Hu Xiaojiao.

394
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:21,340
She must be so mad.

395
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,340
She can't even think of her own appearance.

396
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,340
I was so blind that I...

397
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,340
I was 18 years old.

398
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,340
When I was in college,

399
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,340
I still thought she was pretty.

400
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,340
How was it?

401
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,340
Did you see her?

402
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,340
Did you see her?

403
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,340
No, I said

404
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,340
you're a bad mother.

405
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,340
How can you still bring your own daughter?

406
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,340
I've been through her.

407
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,340
I've been through her.

408
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,340
Why?

409
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,340
These two people are so rude.

410
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,340
I'm just a little bit of a bad guy.

411
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,340
I have a feeling.

412
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,340
Even if you don't want to be a test-diver,

413
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,340
but you can't stop being a test-diver,

414
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,340
and you're not even close to your feet,

415
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,340
I'll tell you what.

416
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,340
Oh, my God.

417
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,340
You're talking like a child.

418
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,340
I'm really a little bit of a bad guy.

419
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,340
Right.

420
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,340
Hey, Xu Leixin.

421
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,340
Hey!

422
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,340
You're still sleeping.

423
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,340
You can't sleep.

424
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,340
Or I'll go to the doctor now

425
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,340
and get you a cup of coffee.

426
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,340
Drink it.

427
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,340
Don't tell me...

428
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,340
It's all my fault.

429
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,340
I don't care.

430
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,340
This is a big deal.

431
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,340
You're a little girl.

432
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,340
You must be a little bit upset.

433
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,340
Don't come over.

434
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,340
Just clear the air.

435
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,340
I'll go to the kitchen and get something.

436
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,340
What's wrong?

437
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,340
Xu Leixin, hurry up and get some.

438
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,340
Okay, okay, okay.

439
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,340
You're so mean.

440
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,340
Okay.

441
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,340
Xu Leixin, you're not a businesswoman.

442
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,340
I know you're a bad guy.

443
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,340
Do you want me to take off your clothes?

444
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:19,340
I'm going to wear a shirt of black and white.

445
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,340
I'll keep it for you.

446
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,340
I also prepared some gold and silver.

447
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,340
By the way,

448
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,340
I saw some very suitable clothes

449
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,340
on my website today.

450
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,340
You should wipe your mouth quickly.

451
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,340
You'll be left with no more mouth.

452
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,340
Come.

453
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:40,340
Let's celebrate the anniversary of the death of Hu Lijing and Zhanan.

454
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:43,340
The best thing is to spend your life together.

455
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:46,340
We'll be together forever.

456
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,340
Why do I feel that you hate Qianhao?

457
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,340
I feel that you're the one who's in the front.

458
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,340
You're not allowed to drink.

459
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:01,340
You're a fool.

460
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,340
Zhanan is so nice to him.

461
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,340
He's a good sister.

462
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,340
He's always scolding him at the door.

463
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:11,340
We're like fools protecting him.

464
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:14,340
We don't know what he's doing.

465
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,340
If he had known Qianhao long ago,

466
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,340
I wouldn't have taken him to your place.

467
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:22,340
He's just taking me as a ladder.

468
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,340
He's taking me as a ladder.

469
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,340
He knows you.

470
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:31,340
And he's taking you to Qianhao.

471
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,340
Even if he doesn't have a red pepper,

472
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,340
he has a Li pepper and Song pepper.

473
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,340
I should thank him for that.

474
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:40,340
He made me realize the face of Qianhao's family.

475
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:43,340
I think God sent him to suffer for me.

476
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,340
I'm sorry.

477
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,340
I'm sorry.

478
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,340
I'm sorry.

479
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,340
I've been taking you so long.

480
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,340
I'm sorry.

481
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:05,340
If it weren't for the wolf in my 250-year-old house,

482
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,340
you,

483
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,340
Ming,

484
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,340
and Xiaomin,

485
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,340
and Li Lingxian,

486
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:15,340
I wouldn't have been so hard these years.

487
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:19,340
Why do I feel like you're getting closer and closer?

488
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,340
Why are you crying?

489
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:24,340
I feel like I'm getting used to it.

490
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,340
Listen, Li Xiaoxiao.

491
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,340
When you're not feeling well,

492
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,340
you want to be like a wolf every few days.

493
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,340
You even have a lot of people to see.

494
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,340
This is called the wolf.

495
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,340
It's called the wolf.

496
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:39,340
It's said that there are always mistakes in life.

497
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,340
But it's not a mistake to be a wolf.

498
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,340
It's the biggest mistake to have children

499
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,340
and not a child.

500
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,340
But it's not a mistake to have children.

501
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,340
I don't regret it.

502
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,340
I think the best gift for my first birthday

503
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,340
is for you and Xiaomin.

504
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,340
Li Xiaoxiao.

505
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,340
Li Xiaoxiao.

506
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,340
I find out that when I talk to him about his health,

507
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,340
he has to sleep.

508
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,340
He's asking you.

509
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,340
When I first divorced,

510
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,340
I had a lot of bad dreams.

511
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:21,340
I was so sad that I couldn't even turn my head.

512
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,340
Now, my dream is true.

513
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,340
I'm happy.

514
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:28,340
But I also have a sad feeling.

515
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,340
After all, I was in love with someone when I was young.

516
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:34,340
I was a young man who was smiling in the middle of the sun

517
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:37,340
and was happy with his face.

518
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:41,340
I was so happy that I could comfort myself.

519
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:45,340
The scientists said that everyone's body cells

520
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,340
would be completely changed once in seven years.

521
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,340
So the number of years after seven years

522
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,340
is no longer one person than the age of the time.

523
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:55,340
It seems that the beautiful youth

524
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:58,340
will not be polluted by the dirty later.

525
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,340
The love used to be clean.

526
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,340
Youth is also the same.

527
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,340
But we slowly turned into another person.

528
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,340
Okay, I'll leave now.

529
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:44,340
I found the beautiful love.

530
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,340
Don't be so sad.

531
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,340
Don't be so sad.

532
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,340
Go back and wash your face.

533
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,340
Have a good rest.

534
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,340
Let's just pretend that nothing has happened.

535
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:12,340
Anyway, the police told me that

536
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:15,340
you didn't sleep well and didn't sleep well.

537
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,340
I did.

538
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,340
It's not enough.

539
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:26,340
If the police hadn't come in, I would have been in the second round.

540
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:30,340
I'm telling you, I can't do it.

541
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:33,340
I'm against you.

542
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:37,340
I'm against you.

543
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:41,340
I'm against you.

544
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,340
I'm against you.

545
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:47,340
I'm against you.

546
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:50,340
I'm against you.

547
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,340
I'm against you.

548
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,340
I'm against you.

549
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,340
I'm against you.

550
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,340
I'm against you.

551
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,340
I'm against you.

552
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,340
I'm against you.

553
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,340
I'm against you.

554
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:26,340
I'm against you.

555
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:29,340
I'm against you.

556
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,340
What are you doing?

557
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:11,340
Did you sleep? What are you doing?

558
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:44,340
I'm not making this story of loneliness

559
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:51,340
be heard by anyone.

560
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:58,340
How can I be a part of it?

561
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:06,340
Did he scare her?

562
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,340
Because about thesn many years

563
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,340
since the end of time,

564
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,340
since Feldberg could finish the story.

565
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:17,340
He would fail to reveal today.

566
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,340
He doesn't really talk in his game.

567
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,340
He just makes Teiling's love against Sh그 deductions

568
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,340
because of his example.

569
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,340
He wants to see her in this moment,

570
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,340
smile and nickname herself.

571
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,340
Smile and người meals are not fulfilling enough.

572
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:32,340
The final moment contradicts his character.

573
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,340
Don't even know when she will be solely Yuko,

574
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:40,340
Maybe because the world of adults is too rulesy, too much to control.

575
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:44,340
I put myself in a happy place in the past,

576
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,340
and close my eyes to a new world.

577
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:49,340
Happy blood bravely resisted the passion of this world.

578
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:53,340
I laughed at them like a brave warrior.

579
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,340
If I don't move, I'll be old.

580
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:02,340
This seems to be good.

581
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:10,060
visible

582
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,340
Andigtual receptor

583
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,660
Hello?

584
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,660
Cl smelled

585
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,660
and어� univers

586
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,660
You're Virtual

587
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,660
What are you doing?

588
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,380
I've just finished, and I'm going to bed

589
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,460
I got daydreaming

590
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,460
I should get in bed

591
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,500
Sleepy

592
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,500
Xiaoman is asleep.

593
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,500
What about Xiaoman?

594
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,180
Did you pack up?

595
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:07,860
No, no.

596
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,980
You suddenly felt a little bit awake

597
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,940
when you came here.

598
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,540
You're sleepy.

599
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,500
You're still sleepy.

600
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,620
You should go to sleep.

601
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,500
No, no, no.

602
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,580
We can talk for a minute before going to sleep.

603
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,260
Okay.

604
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,660
Where are you?

605
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:29,940
Down your house.

606
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,460
Down my house?

607
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,300
Are you kidding me?

608
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,340
Are you downstairs?

609
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,260
You're the one I stopped yesterday.

610
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:38,740
You're not even going to change your mouth.

611
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,740
I'm serious.

612
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,060
It's not true.

613
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,220
Stay here.

614
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:43,980
Don't move.

615
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,540
What are you doing in the middle of the night?

616
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:53,660
Sister Li Li,

617
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,260
Xiaoman is sleeping in my room.

618
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,140
I have to go out.

619
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,060
Take care of her.

620
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,740
Where are you going so late?

621
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,740
I'm going to work.

622
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,740
What work do you have to do in the middle of the night?

623
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,220
Work hard.

624
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:51,740
Ah cuvcs

625
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,540
Why are you here?

626
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,620
Found a cafe

627
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,620
Why do you keep looking at me?

628
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,620
I'm trying to find a way to escape.

629
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,620
It's all a neighbor.

630
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,620
How about we exchange my money for a little?

631
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,620
What can I do for you?

632
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,620
What can you do for me?

633
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,620
What can I do for you?

634
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,620
What can I do?

635
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,620
What are you doing?

636
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,620
What are you doing?

637
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,620
Don't do this to each other.

638
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:59,620
If you really don't want to divorce me,

639
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:02,620
let's forget all these things.

640
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:05,620
Let's be a car flat, okay?

641
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,620
Okay.

642
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,620
I'll go.

643
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,620
Okay.

644
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,620
Okay.

645
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,620
Okay.

646
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,620
Okay.

647
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,620
Okay.

648
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:27,620
I forgot why you were with me.

649
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:31,620
I also forgot you were my reason.

650
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:34,620
I forgot what you did tonight.

651
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:37,620
I didn't beat the child up.

652
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:40,620
You also forgot about him. You forgot about me.

653
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:43,620
I really didn't mean it.

654
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:47,620
You know that I really love you.

655
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,620
When I was in college, I liked you.

656
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,620
I liked you so much.

657
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:53,620
We were so close.

658
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:57,620
I won't ask you to kiss me again.

659
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:00,620
Let's start over, okay?

660
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:04,620
Xiao Man, we're really a car flat.

661
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,620
Okay?

662
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:10,620
Let's get divorced and start over.

663
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,620
Choose a path.

664
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,620
I'll go with you.

665
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,620
I'll go with you.

666
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,620
But let's not be like this.

667
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,620
Don't make each other's faces like this.

668
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,620
I really don't want it anymore.

669
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,620
I don't want it anymore, Xiao Man.

670
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,620
I beg you.

671
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,620
I beg you.

672
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,620
I beg you.

673
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,620
I beg you.

674
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:33,620
I beg you.

675
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,620
Okay?

676
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,620
Xiao Man.

677
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,620
Xiao Man.

678
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:45,620
I won't divorce you.

679
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:49,620
I won't live with you well.

680
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:53,620
I'll watch you kill the baby.

681
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:58,620
And watch you die in the mud.

682
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,620
I'll go with you.

683
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,620
It's time to go.

684
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:50,620
You must go.

685
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,620
Hey, Ge Nui.

686
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,620
What are you doing?

687
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,620
Why are you awake?

688
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:05,620
I'm afraid my dad will catch a cold and bring him some water.

689
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,620
Are you two going to talk?

690
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,620
Your dad is afraid that you'll catch a cold.

691
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,620
So I prepared some ginger and water for you.

692
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,820
I'm sorry.

693
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,420
I'm sorry.

694
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,220
I don't know what's good for you.

695
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,420
It's painful at the same time.

696
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,820
It's really painful.

697
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,220
Gugun,

698
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:24,220
she's not good at speaking.

699
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,620
You're a dead drug addict.

700
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,620
If it's you...

701
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,420
Then I'll think about it.

702
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,220
I'll find someone.

703
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,220
I'll go to work tomorrow.

704
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,420
Gugun,

705
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,420
what did you just say?

706
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,220
I said,

707
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,820
I'll think about it.

708
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,820
I'll go to work tomorrow.

709
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,820
Old man!

710
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,820
Come out!

711
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:52,420
What's wrong?

712
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,620
Gugun,

713
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,220
I want to find a job!

714
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,420
What did you just say?

715
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,220
Gugun,

716
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,420
I said I want to find a job!

717
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,220
Really?

718
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,420
Really, Gugun!

719
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:04,420
Hey, Gugun!

720
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,620
Gugun,

721
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,820
you really want to find a job?

722
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:08,620
Really?

723
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,620
What are you doing?

724
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,220
You're like a heavy prize.

725
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:14,220
What are you talking about?

726
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,220
Your father has the ability.

727
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,220
You have to work hard.

728
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,820
Your father can give you anything.

729
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,820
Oh, that's great!

730
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,020
You're so good!

731
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,220
You're so good!

732
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,220
You're so good!

733
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,220
You're so good!

734
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,220
You're so good!

735
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,220
You're so good!

736
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,220
You're so good!

737
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,220
You're so good!

738
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,220
You're so good!

739
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,020
People say,

740
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:37,220
family is more important than the wind.

741
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,620
They used to make me

742
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,620
not believe in them.

743
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,620
I was hiding at home for too long.

744
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,620
I only complained about the pain

745
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,020
my family had brought me.

746
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,220
I was crying.

747
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,220
They were the ones

748
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:51,620
who blocked all the wind and rain for me.

749
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,620
Tonight,

750
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:55,020
I realized that

751
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,220
being an old woman like me

752
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,620
is really old.

753
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:02,420
Even though I'm not feeling well,

754
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,820
I, a bird,

755
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:06,620
have to take my head off the sand

756
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:09,620
and face the real world alone.

757
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:13,620
I'm not going to let you go.

758
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:16,620
I'm not going to let you go.

759
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,620
I'm not going to let you go.

760
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,620
I'm not going to let you go.

761
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,620
I'm not going to let you go.

762
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,620
I'm not going to let you go.

763
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,620
I'm not going to let you go.

764
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,620
I'm not going to let you go.

765
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,620
I'm not going to let you go.

766
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,620
I'm not going to let you go.

767
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,620
I'm not going to let you go.

768
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,620
I'm not going to let you go.

769
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,620
I'm not going to let you go.

770
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:43,140
I didn't want to set the scarf.

771
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:46,620
I didn't want to exact what I've said

772
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:58,120
but why do I need it?

773
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,520
Don't cover up your eyes.

774
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,440
Don't cover up your eyes.

775
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,180
Don't cover up your eyes.

776
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:08,080
I'm kissing her.

777
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:08,840
Time to leave

778
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,080
I'll go now

779
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:24,800
Bye

780
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,560
I porfume

781
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:32,560
I'm in a rush

782
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,800
Yes

783
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,800
It's so good.

784
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,800
It's not comfortable.

785
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,800
I'll get you some water.

786
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,800
I'll get you some water.

787
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,800
I'll get you some water.

788
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,800
I'll get you some water.

789
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,800
I'll get you some water.

790
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,800
I'll get you some water.

791
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,800
I'll get you some water.

792
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,800
I'll get you some water.
