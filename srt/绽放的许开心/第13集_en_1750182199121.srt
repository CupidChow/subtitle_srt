I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm sure it's a little bit of a shame.

I'm not sure if you can see it, but I'm sure it's a little bit of a shame.

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:27,340
highly

31
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,340
He is in the far place.

32
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,340
He is making a move.

33
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,340
What is it?

34
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,340
Can't move.

35
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,340
Shut up.

36
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,340
Ping.

37
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,340

Wang Yuan.

00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,340
Wei Yuan.

40
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,340
What is it?

41
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,340
A rose?

42
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,340
This.

43
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,340
He...

44
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,340
He uses this.

45
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,340
This?

46
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,340
This?

47
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,340
No.

48
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,340
What?

49
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,340
What?

50
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,340
What?

51
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,340
This is nonsense.

52
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,340
What?

53
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,340
What?

54
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,340
What?

55
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,340
What?

56
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,340
What?

57
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,340
What?

58
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,340
What?

59
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,340
What?

60
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,340
What?

61
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,340
What did you say?

62
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,340
The mountain is...

63
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,340
far.

64
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,340
The mountain is far?

65
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,340
Yes.

66
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:52,340
Far.

67
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,340
Far?

68
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,340
You are tired of me.

69
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,340
You are useless.

70
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,340
You should go back to the palace.

71
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,340
If you have any problem, just report it.

72
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,340
Yes.

73
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,340
You are tired of me.

74
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,340
You are useless.

75
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,340
You should go back to the palace.

76
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,340
If you have any problem, just report it.

77
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,340
Yes.

78
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,340
You are tired of me.

79
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,340
Yes.

80
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,340
Yes.

81
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,340
Is it too hot?

82
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,340
Is it better?

83
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,340
It's too hot.

84
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,340
Shan Shan.

85
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,340
Li.

86
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,340
It's so late.

87
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,340
Where are you going?

88
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,340
You...

89
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,340
You are not going to the mountain to watch the stars, are you?

90
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,340
Yes.

91
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,340
But Li An is so late.

92
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,340
He can't sleep.

93
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,340
He must be missing his family.

94
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,340
Don't worry.

95
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,340
As long as Li Shan doesn't take you away,

96
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,340
I won't abandon you.

97
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,340
Li Zhiyuan is also your family.

98
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,340
Go to bed early.

99
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,340
Tomorrow,

100
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,340
I will accompany him to make some weird soup.

101
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,340
Go to bed early.

102
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,340
This is...

103
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,340
Li Shan...

104
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,340
He is useless.

105
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,340
He can't control his stomach.

106
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,340
Well,

107
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,340
Li Yilong said

108
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,340
he has been living in the country for a very long time.

109
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,340
It seems that

110
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,340
the transfer experiment

111
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,340
is a lie.

112
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,340
That's good.

113
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,340
Leave him alone.

114
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,340
Zhang,

115
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,340
you don't know that

116
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,340
I am still

117
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,340
a child.

118
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,340
When the spring and summer are over,

119
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,340
especially in summer,

120
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,340
my butt is like a human.

121
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,340
Don't let me catch this thing.

122
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,340
I have been a kid.

123
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,340
I have been a thousand-thousand-past.

124
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,340
I can't do it.

125
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,340
I have a patient who has been treated with medicine.

126
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,340
He is in a coma.

127
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,340
After he is completely cured,

128
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,340
he will be in a state of deep pain.

129
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,340
Wait.

130
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,340
You mean

131
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,340
those people

132
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,340
are all worth this?

133
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,340
A little bit.

134
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,340
Yes.

135
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,340
Yes.

136
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,340
But at that time,

137
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,340
there were a thousand-thousand-past in the sea.

138
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,340
How could they

139
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,340
be so stupid?

140
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,340
No.

141
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,340
Let me tell you.

142
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,340
I was a little bit

143
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,340
stupid in the sea.

144
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,340
I was in a coma.

145
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,340
I was in a deep sleep.

146
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,340
I forgot to tell you.

147
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,340
As I said,

148
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,340
the army is so small.

149
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,340
They lost a young man.

150
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,340
I didn't do anything.

151
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,340
I was just lying.

152
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,340
Luckily, I didn't eat much that day.

153
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,340
Otherwise,

154
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,340
I would be embarrassed.

155
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,340
Don't stand here.

156
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,340
You are a serious person.

157
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,340
Hurry up.

158
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,340
Amita told me

159
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,340
that you designed four routes

160
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,340
and prepared a test.

161
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,340
You still need a hundred rounds.

162
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,340
But you know that

163
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,340
I am a chef.

164
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,340
It's not a horse race.

165
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,340
So even if I support you,

166
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,340
I can't afford it.

167
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,340
It's okay.

168
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,340
It's solved.

169
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,340
It's solved.

170
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,340
It's solved.

171
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,340
It's solved.

172
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,340
I designed a plan.

173
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,340
I am going to do a long-term experiment.

174
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,340
If I can get the power back,

175
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,340
I don't need so many horses.

176
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,340
I am here today.

177
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:47,340
Please take me to the east gate of He Ci's.

178
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,340
Weicheng Gou.

179
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,340
Are you a little bit of a fool?

180
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,340
I am telling you.

181
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,340
Go to Chang'an by the jade pendant.

182
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,340
You are in Lingnan.

183
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,340
What can I do?

184
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,340
I am serious.

185
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,340
I am serious.

186
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,340
I am serious.

187
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,340
Not serious.

188
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,340
No.

189
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,340
I am a busy roadside.

190
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,340
I calculated a roadside

191
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,340
between the mountain road and the screen road

192
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,340
in Lingnan.

193
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,340
The roundabout is 30 miles.

194
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:19,340
It's just between the two stations.

195
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,340
It's the point of the street.

196
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,340
When the light is dark,

197
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,340
I will just calculate it.

198
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,340
How many rounds are we going to make?

199
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,340
I can know where the light will be broken

200
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,340
by the last round.

201
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,340
Right?

202
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,340
There must be a lot of people

203
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,340
in the test that day.

204
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,340
I was afraid that it would cause chaos.

205
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,340
So I asked He Ci's

206
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,340
to send someone to maintain order.

207
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,340
Mr. Li.

208
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,340
It's rare that you think so.

209
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,340
I think

210
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:52,340
you should not be too concerned about this.

211
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,340
I have my own arrangement.

212
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,340
Okay?

213
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,340
Come.

214
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,340
Mr. Li.

215
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,340
Please.

216
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,340
The matter of the horse is solved.

217
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,340
I haven't even started yet.

218
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,340
Please help me find some time to start.

219
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,340
Why are you so busy?

220
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,340
I am busy.

221
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,340
I am responsible for it.

222
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,340
Let me tell you.

223
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,340
In Lingnan,

224
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,340
if you want me to find

225
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,340
a good hand in the operation,

226
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,340
then the place is

227
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,340
to find a good hand.

228
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,340
It's hard.

229
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,340
How do you say that word?

230
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,340
Love can't live.

231
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,340
I understand.

232
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,340
I understand.

233
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,340
That's it.

234
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,340
There is such a thing.

235
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,340
Mr. Li.

236
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,340
A few days ago,

237
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,340
I had something at home.

238
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,340
I hired a pick-up service.

239
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,340
This pick-up service

240
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,340
knows that I am with He Ci.

241
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,340
We have a relationship.

242
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,340
He told me

243
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,340
about a promise 10 years ago.

244
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,340
He said that he had a relative.

245
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,340
He was a soldier in the army.

246
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,340
He was a good hand in horse-drawn operations.

247
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,340
He was very good.

248
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,340
He was very good.

249
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,340
This soldier was killed

250
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,340
by a heavy wound

251
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,340
in the sea.

252
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,340
He was injured by a heavy wound.

253
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,340
But he didn't die.

254
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,340
When the wounded returned to Lingnan,

255
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,340
his comrades

256
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,340
were all sentenced to death.

257
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,340
His relative

258
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,340
was so close to He Ci.

259
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,340
He was so close to him.

260
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,340
He asked me

261
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,340
if He Ci

262
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,340
could help these soldiers

263
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,340
to set up a case.

264
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,340
If we could give them back the money,

265
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,340
I would be the one to take the risk.

266
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,340
Mr. Li.

267
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,340
You are not talking anymore.

268
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,340
That's too serious.

269
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,340
No matter what you say,

270
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,340
you can't let a soldier take the risk.

271
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,340
Are you angry with me?

272
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,340
No.

273
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,340
You don't mean that.

274
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,340
I...

275
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,340
I mean that.

276
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,340
It's hard to find.

277
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,340
It's hard to find.

278
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,340
It's hard to find.

279
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,340
Besides,

280
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,340
even if a man like you

281
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,340
tells you

282
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,340
a big trick,

283
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,340
you will believe it.

284
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,340
What if the soldier

285
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,340
can't stop the pain in the sea?

286
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,340
He will escape.

287
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,340
What do you say?

288
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,340
No.

289
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,340
It's serious.

290
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,340
He has details.

291
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,340
This...

292
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,340
The man said

293
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,340
when he escaped from the sea

294
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,340
and killed himself,

295
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,340
the man was shocked

296
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,340
and jumped into the sea.

297
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,340
He even hit his butt.

298
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,340
Look, these are all...

299
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,340
Okay, okay.

300
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,340
How about this?

301
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,340
I promise you

302
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,340
that you will

303
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,340
escape from the sea.

304
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,340
Mr. Zhao,

305
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,340
you can check it again.

306
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,340
Okay.

307
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,340
If you have any news,

308
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,340
I will inform you as soon as possible.

309
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,340
Okay.

310
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,340
Okay.

311
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,340
I will leave now.

312
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,340
Goodbye.

313
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,340
What's this?

314
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,340
It's medicine.

315
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,340
I have a question for you.

316
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,340
What he said just now,

317
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,340
why didn't Lin Yiming tell you?

318
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,340
Why did you send him there?

319
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,340
Let me see.

320
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,340
Lin Yiming must have been killed

321
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,340
by Li Shande.

322
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,340
He is a bastard.

323
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,340
Can't you see it?

324
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,340
It's clearly Li Shande

325
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,340
who found out

326
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,340
that he was stealing his horse.

327
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,340
He deliberately jumped out of the sea

328
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,340
and started to threaten me.

329
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,340
You, you, you, you, tell me.

330
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,340
How can I threaten him?

331
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,340
It's easy.

332
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,340
I thought

333
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,340
Li Shande would make a big move

334
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,340
by running away.

335
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,340
We will have a chance

336
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,340
to make him sad.

337
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,340
I remember

338
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,340
Lan Guang, the fighter,

339
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,340
was a horse master.

340
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,340
If he could become

341
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,340
Li Shande's knight,

342
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,340
he would definitely retreat

343
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,340
when he was born.

344
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,340
Don't look at the Lan family.

345
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,340
I have my own reason.

346
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,340
Come here.

347
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,340
If this matter

348
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,340
is going to happen,

349
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,340
I mean,

350
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,340
if Amita asks you,

351
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,340
what do you say?

352
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,340
I don't think so.

353
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,340
I have a feeling

354
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,340
that

355
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,340
the dagger you mentioned

356
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,340
is really useful.

357
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,340
Sir,

358
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,340
the air waves have been investigating this matter.

359
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,340
The rumors that

360
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,340
the shipwrecks and his men

361
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,340
were in a dream

362
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,340
were a dagger.

363
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,340
They were holding a dagger

364
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,340
and a gold dagger.

365
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,340
Each dagger

366
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,340
has a different treasure.

367
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,340
As for the one

368
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,340
that was holding

369
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,340
the red treasure,

370
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,340
who is it?

371
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,340
The one who held the dagger

372
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,340
was not aware of it.

373
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,340
The tiger is a hero.

374
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,340
He only knew

375
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,340
how to steal the medicine.

376
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,340
But you said

377
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,340
the dagger was a

378
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,340
commercial of a drug.

379
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,340
So,

380
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,340
the master of the dagger

381
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,340
must have hidden the tiger

382
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,340
from the shipwreck.

383
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,340
It was the turn of the seven gold bars.

384
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,340
There may be

385
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,340
thousands of miles of contact.

386
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,340
But ten years ago,

387
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,340
the old man

388
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,340
had to spend some time

389
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,340
to check the waves.

390
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,340
But there are two people

391
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,340
who must know

392
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,340
who the master

393
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,340
of the red treasure is.

394
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,340
Amita and He Yougwang?

395
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,340
That's really

396
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,340
more and more interesting.

397
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,340
Mr. Fang,

398
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,340
there is a new

399
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,340
emergency in the commercial of the shipwrecks.

400
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,340
The big tigers

401
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,340
should be here soon.

402
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,340
You need to meet

403
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,340
the good merchant

404
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,340
from Quzhou this afternoon.

405
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,340
I see.

406
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,340
Okay. I'll go get it ready.

407
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,340
Hero Gui,

408
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,340
why are you here?

409
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,340
There are many

410
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,340
commercial affairs these days.

411
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,340
Please go back if there is nothing else.

412
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,340
This matter

413
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,340
is related to your aunt.

414
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,340
Please tell me.

415
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,340
I opened the door and saw the mountain.

416
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,340
The old man

417
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,340
asked me

418
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,340
to meet him

419
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,340
at a garden

420
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,340
near the tavern.

421
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,340
Ten years ago,

422
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,340
the tiger's son

423
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,340
took a

424
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,340
ship of a transport herbs.

425
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,340
A soldier found it.

426
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,340
Then this soldier

427
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,340
took a

428
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,340
silver dagger

429
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,340
from a pirate.

430
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,340
The dagger

431
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,340
was engraved

432
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,340
in a letter.

433
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,340
It was like a red treasure.

434
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,340
It was a secret treasure.

435
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,340
It was a secret treasure.

436
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,340
Then the pirate

437
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,340
colluded with the government

438
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,340
and sent this soldier

439
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,340
to escape the war.

440
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,340
Li Shande went to

441
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,340
the Hezi City to seek forgiveness.

442
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,340
Hezi City was not a meeting place.

443
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,340
He came to me again.

444
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,340
I also passed him the candy.

445
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,340
Yesterday, I heard

446
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,340
someone talking about this

447
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,340
between the seven-leaf clover.

448
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,340
They all said

449
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,340
that I stole the herbs.

450
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,340
He was not a fool.

451
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,340
If this matter

452
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,340
becomes a talk of

453
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,340
the man's tea after dinner,

454
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,340
will it

455
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,340
affect your mother's business?

456
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,340
This hearing

457
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,340
is the rumor about the apple tree.

458
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,340
No one will believe it.

459
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,340
Gu Yunxiong should know

460
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,340
that rumors are only about the wise.

461
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,340
There is no need to be self-managed.

462
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,340
Yes.

463
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,340
The leader is really

464
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,340
a man of his heart.

465
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,340
He is as good as a wind.

466
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,340
It's better to be in heaven.

467
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,340
I won't bother you.

468
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,340
I'll take my leave.

469
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,340
Gu Yunxiong,

470
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,340
do you really think

471
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,340
it was ten years ago?

472
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,340
Ten years ago.

473
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,340
Li.

474
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,340
These days,

475
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,340
you must keep your order.

476
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,340
You need to keep your food

477
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,340
and your food.

478
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,340
You need to keep your food

479
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,340
and your food.

480
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,340
When the time comes,

481
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,340
add some sugar

482
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,340
to the water

483
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,340
and make it more durable.

484
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,340
Mr. Li.

485
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,340
Mr. Li.

486
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,340
Be careful.

487
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,340
Be careful.

488
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,340
Look, there is a lot of grass.

489
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,340
Enough.

490
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,340
Thank you.

491
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,340
I think

492
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,340
we need to come back to the car.

493
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,340
When the time comes,

494
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,340
we will have no time to do it.

495
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,340
Mr. Li.

496
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,340
Mr. Li.

497
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,340
Look.

498
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,340
The road is so clear.

499
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,340
There is a good place.

500
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,340
We can't go there.

501
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,340
There is a good tree.

502
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,340
It's very rough.

503
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,340
I'll take care of both of them tomorrow.

504
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,340
I'll clear the road.

505
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,340
I'll mark the place

506
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,340
where the location is.

507
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,340
Come on, drink some water.

508
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,340
Actually,

509
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,340
we don't need to clear the road.

510
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,340
Even in the south,

511
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,340
the road to Chang'an

512
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,340
is more complicated than this.

513
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,340
Right?

514
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,340
It's a bit of a barrier.

515
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,340
It's good.

516
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,340
But I'll check the location.

517
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,340
Drink some water.

518
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,340
There is a well inside.

519
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,340
No need to go outside.

520
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,340
There is a lot of things inside.

521
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,340
Okay.

522
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,340
There is a well inside.

523
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,340
Okay.

524
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,340
Tong.

525
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,340
Okay.

526
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,340
When the experiment starts,

527
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,340
many people

528
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,340
will wash the horse,

529
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,340
feed the horse,

530
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,340
and send it to the boat.

531
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,340
The day and night will not stop.

532
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,340
Everyone should be on the right track.

533
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,340
I'll ask Su Lao

534
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,340
to give us some money.

535
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,340
We're preparing for you now.

536
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,340
But I'm not looking for money for you.

537
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,340
I know.

538
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,340
You're a student.

539
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,340
Why don't you give us money

540
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,340
for each station?

541
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,340
I'll let you do the work.

542
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,340
The money for each station

543
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,340
is for you.

544
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,340
That's good.

545
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,340
Thank you.

546
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,340
Thank you.

547
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,340
Here comes the food.

548
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,340
Eat later.

549
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,340
One, two, three.

550
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,340
Come on, come on.

551
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,340
Come on, eat.

552
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,340
Come on, eat.

553
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,340
Come on, eat.

554
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,340
Come on, eat.

555
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,340
Come on, eat.

556
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,340
All of you, all of you.

557
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,340
You eat.

558
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,340
You eat.

559
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,340
You eat.

560
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,340
Come on, eat.

561
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,340
You eat.

562
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,340
You eat.

563
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,340
Don't worry.

564
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,340
Eat.

565
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,340
All of you.

566
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,340
Don't worry.

567
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,340
Eat.

568
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,340
I'll make it for you.

569
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,340
Come on, kid.

570
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,340
Come on, take it.

571
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,340
Take it.

572
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,340
What's this?

573
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,340
This is spicy oyster sauce.

574
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,340
Okay.

575
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,340
This is not edible.

576
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,340
This is poisonous.

577
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,340
This is spicy oyster sauce.

578
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,340
This is poisonous.

579
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,340
This is not edible.

580
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,340
Mr. Li,

581
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,340
we've been eating for decades.

582
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,340
It's okay.

583
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,340
What's okay?

584
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,340
You're fine now.

585
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,340
It's not out yet.

586
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,340
This is poisonous.

587
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,340
It looks like a mustard.

588
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,340
This is spicy,

589
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,340
poisonous.

590
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,340
It's bad for your health.

591
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,340
This is spicy.

592
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,340
You can't eat it.

593
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,340
It's not edible.

594
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,340
We can't eat it without the food.

595
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,340
We don't eat it without the food.

596
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,340
We eat it without the food.

597
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,340
We eat it without food.

598
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,340
We eat it without food.

599
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,340
Right?

600
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,340
Right.

601
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,340
Take it.

602
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,340
Here.

603
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,340
Mr. Wang.

604
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,340
The money from the pig's brain is coming down.

605
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,340
Take the money

606
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,340
and buy some noodles

607
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,340
and eggs for everyone.

608
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,340
The most important thing is

609
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,340
that you can't go on for a long time.

610
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,340
Then,

611
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,340
don't eat it.

612
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,340
I'll get you something else.

613
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,340
This is good for the child.

614
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,340
Come on.

615
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,340
Eat it.

616
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,340
If you want to eat it, come here.

617
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,340
Come on.

618
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,340
Come on.

619
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,340
Everyone, come on.

620
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,340
Come on.

621
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,340
Mr. Li.

622
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,340
Why are you here?

623
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,340
I'm waiting for you.

624
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,340
Why are you waiting for me?

625
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,340
It seems that you don't welcome me.

626
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,340
But I've been waiting for you for so long.

627
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,340
Should I come in and sit down?

628
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,340
I have something to do tonight.

629
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,340
I'll just delay you for a moment.

630
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,340
If you don't agree,

631
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,340
you'll have to take revenge on me.

632
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,340
You take good care of this flower.

633
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,340
It's not wrong.

634
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,340
Are you here to look at the flowers?

635
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,340
Of course not.

636
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,340
Please enjoy yourself.

637
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,340
I heard that you were helping a fugitive in private.

638
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,340
So I came to ask you

639
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,340
why you made this rumor.

640
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,340
I didn't make a rumor.

641
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,340
It does have a meaning.

642
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,340
How do you know that?

643
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,340
You've seen this fugitive.

644
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,340
I've never seen her.

645
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,340
I heard a fugitive say it.

646
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,340
If you hear a fugitive say it,

647
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,340
will you be so serious?

648
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,340
I'm willing to believe her.

649
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,340
How do you prove that she's telling the truth?

650
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:21,340
How do you prove that she's telling the truth?

651
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,340
Okay.

652
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,340
Then take me to see that fugitive.

653
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,340
I'll ask her in person.

654
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,340
Fugitive?

655
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,340
You don't know where she's heading now.

656
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,340
Since she's waiting for you to get pregnant,

657
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,340
she'll leave you a way to contact her.

658
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,340
What do you want?

659
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,340
I'm here to confirm a few things.

660
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,340
First,

661
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,340
are you sure that the sea island

662
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,340
is a ship of transport drugs?

663
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,340
Second,

664
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,340
are you sure that she's getting married

665
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,340
to a silver-glazed flower

666
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:52,340
that's like a silver dagger?

667
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,340
Third,

668
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:58,340
are you sure that it's ten years ago?

669
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,340
Lishan De,

670
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,340
I'm the adopted daughter of He Ci Shi.

671
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,340
I know

672
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,340
you have some doubts about me,

673
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,340
but this is not the usual

674
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,340
way to stop the drug business

675
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,340
and take care of my father's reputation.

676
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,340
Why don't we make a deal?

677
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,340
You don't have to help this person.

678
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,340
I'll go and make a deal with him.

679
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,340
I only have one request.

680
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,340
If I make it,

681
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,340
take me to see him.

682
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,340
I'll go and see

683
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,340
who the fugitive is

684
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,340
and confirm who his master is.

685
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,340
Deal?

686
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,340
I'll come to you again

687
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,340
when I'm done with the operation.

688
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,340
Good!

689
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,340
Master,

690
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,340
sit down.

691
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,340
Master,

692
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,340
you're so anxious.

693
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,340
You're on the stage.

694
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,340
The winner stays,

695
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,340
the loser leaves.

696
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,340
The winner is the winner.

697
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,340
The winner is the winner.

698
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,340
You're so anxious.

699
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,340
Can you play the game?

700
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,340
I'm so anxious.

701
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,340
Lin Nan,

702
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,340
you're so hardworking.

703
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,340
You're so fast.

704
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,340
You're so hardworking.

705
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,340
You can't find

706
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,340
any good players.

707
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,340
Master Su,

708
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,340
I have

709
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,340
one request.

710
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,340
You

711
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,340
help me find

712
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,340
one more player.

713
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,340
Only one player.

714
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,340
If you have two players,

715
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,340
I can

716
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,340
use them to play the game.

717
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,340
It's hard.

718
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,340
It's hard to play one player.

719
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,340
You can't change the game.

720
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,340
I'm worried

721
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,340
that if we have the money,

722
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,340
we'll lose the game.

723
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,340
Master Su,

724
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,340
I have a game.

725
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,340
Can we add

726
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,340
a little bit of money

727
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,340
to the money

728
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,340
in the future?

729
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,340
I'm 13.

730
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,340
You're crazy.

731
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,340
You're 13.

732
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,340
You're 13.

733
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,340
You're 13.

734
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,340
You forgot the price.

735
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,340
It's okay.

736
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,340
Master Su,

737
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,340
I'm sure

738
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,340
I'll win the next game.

739
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,340
I'll give you the money.

740
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,340
I'll give you the money.

741
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,340
I'm a chicken-headed man.

742
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,340
But I don't do anything.

743
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,340
I'll be a chicken-headed man.

744
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,340
If I give you the money,

745
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,340
I'll be a chicken-headed man.

746
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,340
If you're in the family,

747
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,340
your family will lock you up.

748
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,340
The law will lock you up.

749
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,340
Even the fake house will lock you up.

750
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,340
You'll regret it.

751
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,340
You'll regret it.

752
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,340
You'll regret it.

753
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,340
You'll regret it.

754
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,340
Sit down.

755
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,340
Wait.

756
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,340
I knew

757
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,340
that Brother Lan is too kind.

758
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,340
He's been a chicken-headed man for so many years.

759
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,340
But he's been here

760
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,340
for so many years.

761
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,340
He must have stopped you.

762
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,340
Didn't Brother Lan say

763
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,340
that we're a chicken-headed man.

764
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,340
Uncle and aunt are in South China.

765
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,340
But we're not the ones who do good things.

766
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,340
We're just children.

767
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,340
We're the ones who are the most important.

768
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,340
We're not a chicken-headed man.

769
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,340
Brother Lan is a good-looking man.

770
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,340
He's a good-looking man.

771
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,340
Old Cai,

772
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,340
you've been with Brother Lan for the longest time.

773
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,340
Do you think he's in a good mood?

774
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,340
Ask the staff if they know.

775
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,340
Come on, Master Lan.

776
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,340
Come on, Master Lan.

777
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,340
Please come inside.

778
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,340
Brother Lan.

779
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,340
Old Cai.

780
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,340
Today is a good day.

781
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,340
Let's fight.

782
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,340
What are you fighting for?

783
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,340
You're not even here.

784
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,340
I'm telling you to adjust.

785
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,340
How is it?

786
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,340
It's not good.

787
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,340
I just adjusted the spirit of the spirit.

788
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,340
I've adjusted their height.

789
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,340
I just want to train them to be cool.

790
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,340
Fang Ke can go to the battlefield.

791
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:34,340
Why do you want me to train them to be cool?

792
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,340
It's to make the opponent feel better.

793
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,340
No fighting or fighting.

794
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,340
No matter how strong the opponent is,

795
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,340
they're weak and weak.

796
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,340
The inside is very strong.

797
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,340
Fang Ke is very sensitive.

798
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,340
It's good to hear.

799
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,340
It's all fair.

800
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,340
Actually, I have something else to do today.

801
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,340
Can you help me?

802
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,340
Ma.

803
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,340
I've been fighting for years.

804
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,340
The magic tree is also wasted.

805
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:10,340
I really don't need the magic tree.

806
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,340
You know that

807
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,340
we have a good teacher.

808
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,340
She has to take the magic tree

809
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,340
at the gate of Xiaodong.

810
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,340
She has to be a good teacher.

811
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:23,340
I just want you to be a good teacher.

812
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,340
At least be interested.

813
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,340
You can go and have a look.

814
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,340
Then you can have a look.

815
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,340
You can run.

816
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,340
You can run.

817
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,340
You can run slowly.

818
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,340
You can take the magic tree.

819
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:48,220
You can run to the

820
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,220
gate of Xiaodong.

821
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:53,220
You can run slowly.

822
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,220
You can run slowly.

823
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,220
I've been fighting for years.

824
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,220
I'll introduce a few more

825
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:01,220
to the gate of Xiaodong.

826
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,220
Let's go.

827
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,220
I'm sorry for the lady.

828
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,220
I have to go.

829
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,220
Go.

830
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,220
The wine is not coming.

831
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,220
It's coming.

832
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,220
It's cold.

833
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,220
Look at you.

834
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,220
It's not coming.

835
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,220
The wine is coming.

836
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,220
It's really white.

837
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,220
It looks real.

838
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,220
Lin Yang.

839
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,220
If you promise me

840
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,220
that you will do it for me,

841
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:45,220
I will do it for you.

842
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,220
I will do it for you.

843
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,220
It's really good.

844
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,220
It's really good.

845
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,220
Mr. Zhao.

846
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,220
Amitabha.

847
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,220
Mr. Zhao.

848
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,220
Where is my clothes?

849
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,220
I went to the bathroom.

850
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,220
What's the matter?

851
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,220
It's not urgent.

852
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,220
It's a little hot.

853
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,220
Mr. Zhao.

854
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,220
Did you come to the house

855
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,220
a few days ago

856
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,220
to give a escapee a body?

857
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,220
I haven't heard of it.

858
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,220
You are pregnant.

859
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,220
A man who ran on the wrong way

860
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,220
can't escape your eyes.

861
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,220
You don't know

862
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,220
what else?

863
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,220
That's too much.

864
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,220
I went out for a few days.

865
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,220
I didn't have time to stay in the house.

866
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,220
There are too many things to do in the house.

867
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,220
You can't even get over it.

868
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,220
Look, it's getting late.

869
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,220
I have to go to the office.

870
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,220
I won't accompany you.

871
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,220
Wait a minute.

872
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,220
The night is just opened.

873
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,220
It's fresh.

874
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,220
Water.

875
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,220
Mr. Zhao.

876
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,220
Amitabha, what's the matter?

877
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,220
Amitabha.

878
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,220
Uncle.

879
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,220
Sit down.

880
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,220
You didn't tell me in advance

881
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,220
that you came.

882
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,220
I was going to prepare

883
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,220
something you like to eat.

884
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,220
You are going back to the news

885
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,220
in Sashan?

886
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,220
The storage is ready.

887
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,220
But

888
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,220
I don't think it's a season now.

889
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,220
Let's wait a few days.

890
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,220
These things are not urgent.

891
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,220
The most important thing now

892
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,220
is that you can contact the salesman.

893
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,220
Other things

894
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,220
can't be done later.

895
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,220
Speaking of salesman,

896
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:48,220
Su Liang has invested in the green transfer.

897
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:51,220
He has been in charge of the position of my salesman.

898
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,220
If this green is really successful,

899
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,220
he will be a threat to me.

900
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,220
What threat?

901
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,220
He can't succeed in this green.

902
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,220
Don't worry.

903
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,220
How do I think

904
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,220
this is not a reasonable decision?

905
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,220
He is a dead man.

906
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,220
Even if the experiment fails this time,

907
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,220
he will still have a chance.

908
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,220
We'd better prepare for it.

909
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,220
I gave him two horses.

910
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,220
I think it's a good idea.

911
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:20,220
You just walk around.

912
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,220
Even if Li Zhi really gets to Chang'an,

913
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,220
his parents will be in the same place.

914
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:30,220
I will also have a chance to visit the market.

915
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,220
No.

916
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,220
Listen to me.

917
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,220
Li Shan De is not a normal person.

918
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,220
He came to me a few days ago.

919
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,220
He said something special about Xiaobing.

920
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,220
He said something.

921
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,220
If I promise him,

922
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,220
next time,

923
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:47,220
he will still be a good man.

924
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,220
He will be a good man.

925
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,220
It's over.

926
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,220
I heard about it.

927
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,220
Li Zhi really went to the garden

928
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,220
for a escape.

929
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,220
And Ma Guiyun also found me.

930
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,220
They said that ten years ago,

931
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,220
my father's men

932
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:03,220
stole a delivery of herbs.

933
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,020
This thing is full of

934
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:07,220
crazy and unknowing things.

935
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,220
It's not good for the clothes.

936
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,220
It's not good for my father's reputation.

937
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,220
As you said,

938
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:17,220
my position as a salesman is not easy to handle.

939
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,220
You just got the clothes from the Imperial Manor.

940
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,220
You have a lot of things to do.

941
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,220
Why don't you put the rumor

942
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,220
on the line as soon as possible?

943
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,220
Put it on the table.

944
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,220
What rumor?

945
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,220
How can it be on the line?

946
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,220
I actually have a thing.

947
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,220
I hid the clothes.

948
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:40,220
I saw Li Shantou before I came here.

949
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:44,220
I made an agreement with him.

950
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:47,220
I used a special order to lure him out.

951
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,220
I changed him to Mr. Xiaobin.

952
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,220
Otherwise, we wouldn't have found that person.

953
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,220
So,

954
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:04,220
you two have been talking about it, right?

955
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:10,220
I just talked to him about the condition.

956
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,220
But in the end, you still have to decide.

957
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,220
Your father is stubborn.

958
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,220
I won't leave you to eat.

959
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,220
I'll go back first.

960
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,220
Hang Shou,

961
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,220
why did you have to help Li Zhishi

962
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,220
and Shemian, the little soldier?

963
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,220
Because I have to ask him clearly

964
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,220
who was the one who was sent to the hospital

965
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,220
by my father.

966
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,220
Brother.

967
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,220
Brother.

968
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:43,220
How much is the face of a person who can afford to ride a thousand miles?

969
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:47,220
How much is the face of a person who can afford to ride a thousand miles?

970
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,220
Can you afford it?

971
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,220
I'm willing to.

972
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:58,220
If you can afford a thousand miles,

973
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:01,220
your money is more than the other riders.

974
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,220
You can add one more day to the money.

975
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,220
This is too complicated.

976
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,220
You don't need to pay for the money.

977
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,220
But you have to pay half of the money today.

978
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:16,220
This person is very stubborn.

979
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:20,220
Be careful that he is a man of honor.

980
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,220
What are you talking about?

981
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,220
I tell you,

982
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,220
when my brother was riding a horse,

983
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,220
he was a person with no name and no name.

984
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,220
Do you know what it means?

985
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,220
Jiang Sheng will not find his son-in-law.

986
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,220
You are a professional rider?

987
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:38,220
I am a rider.

988
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,220
This is a cross-country.

989
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,220
Then why don't you ride it?

990
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,220
I think that the horse has a spirit.

991
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,220
When it is in the sky,

992
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,220
it should not be confused by Jiang Sheng.

993
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:00,220
Now Ji Yang wants to do something for Xiao Shi.

994
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:04,220
Then you can do it.

995
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,220
If you can ride it,

996
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,220
then you can do as you say.

997
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,220
Nanyi, I will go to the Japanese.

998
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,220
Okay.

999
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,220
Be careful.

1000
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,220
Good horse, long-distance ride,

1001
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,220
it is difficult to ride.

1002
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,220
This man,

1003
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:29,220
I have a good reminder.

1004
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,220
This is a horse.

1005
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,220
If you have to ride it,

1006
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:37,220
you have to have a face mask.

1007
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:41,220
It is not easy for a person with no name.

1008
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,220
Do you know how to speak?

1009
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,220
Thank you.

1010
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,220
Go.

1011
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,220
Go.

1012
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,220
Go.

1013
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,220
Master Li, go.

1014
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,220
Go.

1015
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,220
Go.

1016
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,220
Go.

1017
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,220
Go.

1018
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,220
Go.

1019
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,220
Go.

1020
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,220
Go.

1021
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,220
Master Li,

1022
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,220
go.

1023
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,220
Go.

1024
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,220
Amazing.

1025
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,220
I am so impressed by you.

1026
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,220
The brotherhood in the world,

1027
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,220
Gao Zhou and Lan Ge.

1028
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,220
Lan Ge.

1029
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,220
Brother, it is you.

1030
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,220
Lan Ge,

1031
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,220
you have made me so happy.

1032
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,220
My brothers are also good.

1033
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:33,220
Can they try your military skills?

1034
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,220
Okay.

1035
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,220
Do more.

1036
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,220
All are brothers.

1037
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,220
All are brothers.

1038
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,220
Do more.

1039
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,220
Remember,

1040
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,220
sometimes,

1041
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,220
the truth is more than lies.

1042
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:51,220
Don't say that you seem to know me very well.

1043
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,220
I want to know.

1044
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,220
I want to know.

1045
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,220
Tomorrow,

1046
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:59,220
I will be able to help you

1047
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:01,220
to improve your skills.

1048
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:04,220
I will give you a result.

1049
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,220
Okay.

1050
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,220
Go.

1051
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,220
Go.

1052
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,220
I have never made such a big money.

1053
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,220
I have no money left.

1054
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:26,220
