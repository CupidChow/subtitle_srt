1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I see your pain and your bravery too

2
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Some things we cannot just embrace

3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And there's no time to guess the ground above

4
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Greater daylight, go to the free

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let's cross the wind, dancing ring, let the stars in room and night away

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
This half is happiness, dear Oh, both of a journey

7
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Oh, yeah, let's cross the wind, dancing ring, let the stars in room and night away

8
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I was really upset today.

9
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I was really upset.

10
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I saw the photos I posted.

11
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I was so surprised.

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I was so happy.

13
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I just wanted to let you know.

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I was so happy.

15
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Are you feeling better now?

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What do you think?

17
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What do you think?

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Let me ask you something serious.

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Have you ever dated before?

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I've dated before.

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But I know that I have two daughters.

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I don't have a son.

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm afraid that they might affect their lives.

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm asking you something.

25
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You're so stubborn.

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Forget it.

27
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You're sorry?

30
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You ran away?

31
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Didn't you call the police?

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Didn't the police leave?

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Don't look at my son.

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I've been teaching him.

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
He must protect himself.

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The bad guys are in the house.

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Especially the handsome boy.

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
He's easily fooled.

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You're not like that.

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
How could I be like this?

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm a rich man.

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm looking for a family partner.

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm mentally ill.

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Speaking of a partner,

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
we're just a step away from each other.

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yes.

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Well, we're not going to talk.

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We'll talk in the morning.

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'll go to the shower.

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm going to take a shower.

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You're going to take a shower?

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You are so stubborn.

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You can't take a shower.

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm going to take a shower.

55
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Where are you going?

57
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm going to take a shower.

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You're so stubborn.

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You're so stubborn.

60
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You're so stubborn.

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What?

62
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's a cow.

63
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
A cow?

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
How...

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
How...

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
How do you call it a cow?

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I...

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Let's go to the hospital.

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What are you doing?

70
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
How do you call it a cow?

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Slow down.

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Slow down.

73
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
This is too sudden.

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's okay.

75
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
No, it's possible that I hugged the two kids

76
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
and I was just fooling around.

77
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I jumped back and saved my father.

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I was just adding meat.

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's okay.

80
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'll pay you this time.

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Okay.

82
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'll pay you back later.

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Okay.

84
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's okay.

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Don't take advantage of my partner's personality.

86
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
No, I can't.

87
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I can't.

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Please help me.

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's okay.

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Okay.

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'll help you.

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Okay.

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Slow down.

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's not your smile.

95
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's okay.

96
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Slow down.

97
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Let's go to the middle.

98
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Let's go.

99
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
One shot.

100
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'll hit him.

101
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Let's go.

102
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Hey, hey, hey.

103
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Okay.

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
One shot.

105
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Don't hit him.

106
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Don't hit him.

107
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You didn't see him?

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's going down.

109
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's getting serious.

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I can't move.

111
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm going to sleep.

112
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
My wife is going to work.

113
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I can't sleep for long.

114
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Or else, I'll burn my face.

115
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Hey, look at you.

116
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You can't sleep.

117
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You're so tired every night.

118
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I sleep often.

119
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I can't sleep at night.

120
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You guys go to sleep.

121
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Bye.

122
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Okay.

123
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Bye.

124
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm going to sleep.

125
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm going to sleep.

126
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
A geneticthough

127
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,700
Why are you talking to me all the time!

128
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:11,700
I remember someone was dancing.

129
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:16,700
I saw that person wearing the same clothes as you.

130
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,700
I didn't even think about it.

131
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,700
I was dancing.

132
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,700
I can't believe it.

133
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,700
I've been thinking about it for years.

134
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,700
I've been thinking about it for years.

135
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,700
I'm not sure if I can communicate with you.

136
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,700
Communicate with you?

137
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,700
Why do I have to do that?

138
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,700
Old man!

139
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,700
What's wrong?

140
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,700
I told you to go out and find a job!

141
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,700
What are you doing?

142
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,700
Girl, you really have to find a job?

143
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,700
Really?

144
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,700
What are you doing?

145
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,700
You're like a big award.

146
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,700
What's the big prize?

147
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,700
Your dad has the ability to do this.

148
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,700
You have to work hard.

149
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,700
Your dad can give you anything.

150
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,700
That's great!

151
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,700
This is a good day.

152
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,700
I'm going to eat.

153
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,700
That's crazy!

154
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,700
This is a good day.

155
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,700
I'm going to eat.

156
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,700
I'm going to eat.

157
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,700
I'm going to eat.

158
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,700
I'm going to eat.

159
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:07,700
We're going to buy a car tomorrow.

160
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,700
We haven't made money yet.

161
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,700
He can make it in time.

162
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,700
He has to work.

163
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,700
I'm going to eat.

164
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,700
Thank you.

165
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,700
I'm going to eat.

166
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,700
I'm going to eat.

167
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,700
I'm going to eat.

168
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,700
I'm going to eat.

169
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,700
I'm going to eat.

170
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,700
I'm going to eat.

171
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,700
I'm going to eat.

172
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,700
I'm going to eat.

173
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,700
I'm going to eat.

174
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,700
I'm going to eat.

175
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,700
I'm going to eat.

176
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,700
I'm going to eat.

177
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,700
I'm going to eat.

178
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,700
I'm going to eat.

179
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,700
Who are you?

180
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,700
I'm here.

181
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,700
Who are you?

182
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,700
Your name doesn't matter.

183
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,700
You just need to know that I'm a person who has been protecting you for years.

184
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,700
I'm going to eat.

185
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,700
I'm going to eat.

186
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,700
I'm going to eat.

187
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,700
I'm going to eat.

188
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,700
I'm going to eat.

189
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,700
I'm going to eat.

190
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,700
I'm going to eat.

191
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,700
I'm going to eat.

192
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,700
I'm going to eat.

193
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,700
I'm going to eat.

194
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,700
I'm going to eat.

195
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,700
I'm going to eat.

196
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,700
I'm going to eat.

197
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,700
I'm going to eat.

198
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,700
I'm eating.

199
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,700
cheating dead families.

200
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,700
I'm in a bad mood today.

201
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,700
Don't魯 me.

202
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,700
You usually wear a white dress when you go to school.

203
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,700
Very beautiful.

204
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,700
Why are you in a bad mood?

205
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,700
I can be your pet.

206
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,700
Anyway, I'm not in a hurry.

207
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,700
I have some problems with my husband's relationship.

208
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,700
He doesn't want to divorce me.

209
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,700
He doesn't want to divorce me.

210
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,700
He doesn't want to live well.

211
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,700
He wants to torture you.

212
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,700
Yes, he wants to divorce me.

213
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,700
It hurts.

214
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,700
It hurts.

215
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,700
It hurts.

216
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,700
It hurts.

217
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,700
It hurts.

218
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,700
It really hurts.

219
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,700
It doesn't hurt.

220
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,700
It doesn't hurt.

221
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,700
Are you okay?

222
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,700
I'm fine.

223
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,700
It hurts.

224
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,700
It hurts.

225
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,700
It doesn't hurt.

226
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,700
It doesn't hurt.

227
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,700
It hurts.

228
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,700
Be careful.

229
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,700
I'm not in a hurry.

230
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,700
Okay.

231
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,700
I'll give you some more medicine.

232
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,700
Okay.

233
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,700
Okay.

234
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,700
Take the medicine.

235
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,700
Okay.

236
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,700
I'll go now.

237
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,700
Okay.

238
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,700
Take care.

239
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,700
It's not a young man.

240
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,700
We have to be careful.

241
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,700
Okay.

242
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,700
Listen to me.

243
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,700
Listen to me.

244
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,700
I'm talking about you.

245
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,700
I'm going to the bathroom.

246
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,700
I'll go now.

247
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,700
This way.

248
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,700
This way.

249
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,700
Okay.

250
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,700
Okay.

251
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,700
I'll go now.

252
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,700
I'm not going in.

253
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,700
I'll give you some medicine.

254
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,700
No.

255
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,700
I can't.

256
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,700
You can go if you want.

257
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,700
You don't even give me a massage.

258
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,700
Are you used to it?

259
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,700
No.

260
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,700
I'm just talking about your daughter.

261
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,700
She's going to the public house to sell her wife.

262
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,700
How can I come out to look for you?

263
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,700
Okay.

264
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,700
I'll take care of you.

265
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,700
You're a young man.

266
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,700
I'm just worried about you.

267
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,700
I know.

268
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,700
Take care.

269
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,700
Okay.

270
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,700
Take care.

271
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,700
You guys are so clean.

272
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,700
Our family's house is so clean.

273
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,700
They're cleaning the house every day.

274
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,700
It's impossible.

275
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,700
I'm a little bit of a clean-cut.

276
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,700
First, you buy things and go home.

277
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,700
Every day,

278
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,700
Yu'an and Yu'le

279
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,700
sleep together.

280
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,700
I have to clean it up for 40 minutes.

281
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,700
Come in.

282
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,700
Okay.

283
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,700
Wait.

284
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,700
I have to go to wash my face.

285
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,700
I'll wash my face.

286
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,700
I'll go to the toilet.

287
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,700
I'll go to the toilet.

288
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,700
Okay.

289
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,700
I'll call you later.

290
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,700
Okay.

291
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,700
Kaixin.

292
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,700
Kaixin.

293
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,700
Kaixin.

294
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,700
Kaixin.

295
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,700
Kaixin.

296
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,700
Kaixin.

297
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,700
Kaixin.

298
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,700
Good morning.

299
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,700
I'm happy to give you a day.

300
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,700
Good morning.

301
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,700
Good morning.

302
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,700
Good morning.

303
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,700
Oh my god.

304
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,700
Why does this man

305
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,700
look so beautiful on my face?

306
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,700
Why is he staring at me like that?

307
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,700
I'm thinking of kissing me again.

308
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,700
No.

309
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,700
I haven't brushed my teeth yet.

310
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,700
Oh my god.

311
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,700
I don't know if his eyes are okay.

312
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,700
He's not that close.

313
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,700
He's got a lot of pores on his face.

314
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,700
He can do anything.

315
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,700
What are you thinking about?

316
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,700
Well...

317
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,700
You...

318
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,700
Help me get up.

319
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,700
I need your help.

320
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,700
Help me change my clothes.

321
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,700
Look at my hand.

322
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,700
Slowly.

323
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,700
Slowly.

324
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,700
Why are you taking so long?

325
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,700
My baby is going to work.

326
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,700
She needs to eat something better.

327
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,700
I'll go to buy her a small bag

328
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,700
and a small bowl of chicken stew.

329
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,700
She loves it the most.

330
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,700
Why don't we have a day-to-day meal?

331
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,700
Or a baby?

332
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,700
It's better to have a baby in the spring.

333
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,700
Hey.

334
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,700
You don't understand.

335
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,700
This is called the form of love.

336
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,700
Don't forget to call it the form of love.

337
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,700
Well...

338
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,700
Help me put these books in the bag.

339
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,700
Okay.

340
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,700
Don't forget the pen.

341
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,700
Okay.

342
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,700
Time is running out.

343
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,700
I finally feel the history of this night.

344
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,700
The relationship between the middle-aged man is really not like the young man.

345
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,700
He is taller than the sky and has a lot of life.

346
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,700
Every man is free to open his own family mode when he is old.

347
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,700
He doesn't admit defeat, but he is responsible.

348
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,700
And we don't have time to feel sad

349
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,700
about the harem in the East.

350
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,700
Because...

351
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,700
I have to go to my grandma's house to pick them up for school.

352
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,700
I have an appointment with Yu.

353
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,700
Is it okay for your son and daughter to sleep?

354
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,700
Yes.

355
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,700
They are getting up.

356
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,700
Well...

357
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,700
Let's go together.

358
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,700
Okay. Take care.

359
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,700
By the way, we still have to make an appointment.

360
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,700
We have to talk about the contract.

361
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,700
You are going to date with me?

362
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,700
Didn't we agree yesterday?

363
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,700
Yes.

364
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,700
What? You are back?

365
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,700
I am serious.

366
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,700
No, no, no.

367
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,700
What about after the contract?

368
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,700
We will have dinner together with your family.

369
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,700
After that, we will get the certificate.

370
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,700
What certificate?

371
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,700
The marriage certificate?

372
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,700
If we don't get the certificate,

373
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,700
we will have to work together.

374
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,700
We have to protect each other's legal rights.

375
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,700
When we first met, I told you that

376
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,700
I am a person who only gets married because of love.

377
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,700
Love is not the case now.

378
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,700
It is just a kind of high-pitched feeling for other women.

379
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:58,700
But I want to try my best to be the spirit of her family and partner.

380
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,700
Xu Kai Xin seems to have a kind of

381
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,700
letting me see and feel relaxed.

382
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,700
A woman who can provide such emotions to a fake woman

383
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,700
will definitely be a great family and partner.

384
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,700
And this is also the middle-aged life of the body.

385
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,700
I hope to get it the most.

386
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,700
But I am not a thief.

387
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,700
I am not a thief.

388
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,700
Chen is here too.

389
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,700
Let me do it.

390
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,700
Okay, okay.

391
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,700
Come on.

392
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,700
Let me tell you something.

393
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,700
Don't be shy.

394
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,700
After you finish talking,

395
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,700
eat something.

396
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,700
I will send you to the kindergarten.

397
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,700
Don't think that I am a girl.

398
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,700
I have been holding a hand for a long time.

399
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,700
I can't even hold a hand.

400
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,700
It's okay. I can do it.

401
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,700
Where is dad?

402
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,700
He went to the early morning.

403
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,700
Oh.

404
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,700
By the way, Zhang Ye.

405
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,700
I have good news for you.

406
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,700
Youyou is going to work.

407
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,700
Really?

408
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,700
Yes.

409
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,700
I should have known that old man is so good at dancing.

410
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,700
I would have kicked him out long ago.

411
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,700
You go to the office first.

412
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,700
I will go to call you.

413
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,700
I am going to work.

414
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,700
I can't sleep.

415
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,700
I am busy.

416
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,700
Youyou, mom is coming.

417
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,700
Dad.

418
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,700
I am coming.

419
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,700
Bye.

420
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,700
Come on.

421
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,700
Come on.

422
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,700
It's early.

423
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,700
Youyou is not in the room.

424
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,700
I am going to work.

425
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,700
I am going to work.

426
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,700
I am going to work.

427
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,700
Mom.

428
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,700
Why are you here so early?

429
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,700
Yesterday I made some big beans.

430
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,700
I woke up this morning and made a bean paste.

431
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,700
I made some cakes and tea eggs.

432
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,700
I will bring you some.

433
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,700
If I don't come today,

434
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,700
you will have to go to the store to sell.

435
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,700
I will buy some for you.

436
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,700
I am going to make some for you.

437
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,700
I am going to make some for you.

438
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,700
I am going to make some for you.

439
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,700
If I don't come today,

440
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,700
you will have to go to the store to sell.

441
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,700
Can you sell that?

442
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,700
My grandson is the most important.

443
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,700
If your daughter-in-law can get up early

444
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,700
and make breakfast for you,

445
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,700
do you need me to go to the store to sell?

446
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,700
Why are you sleeping on the sofa?

447
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,700
You are sleeping in the living room.

448
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,700
Can you sleep well?

449
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,700
I had a drink last night.

450
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,700
I fell asleep after I didn't eat.

451
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,700
Don't drink.

452
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,700
Eat.

453
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,700
Shaoxiao, you are up.

454
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,700
Look, mom, the breakfast is ready.

455
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,700
Come and eat.

456
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,700
Shaoxiao, my mom is talking to you.

457
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,700
Mom, I need to tell you something.

458
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,700
What is this?

459
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,700
The money was spent on the day before yesterday.

460
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,700
I paid 5000 yuan to pay the bill.

461
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:19,700
That means your son was looking for a friend last night.

462
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,700
What are you doing?

463
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,700
What are you doing?

464
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,700
There are children in your belly.

465
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,700
It's okay, mom.

466
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,700
Just give me the money.

467
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,700
After all, the husband is a good father.

468
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,700
It's not easy to say this.

469
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,700
I don't know if he is rich or rich.

470
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,700
It's okay, you can't fight with me.

471
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,700
My grandson.

472
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,700
You don't want to get involved, do you?

473
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,700
You have children in your belly.

474
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,700
Why are you looking for news?

475
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,700
I told you, I can't.

476
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,700
It's your fault.

477
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,700
Don't let it happen.

478
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,700
What?

479
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,700
You want to kill me again?

480
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,700
Come on.

481
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,700
You are so stubborn.

482
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,700
You are so stubborn.

483
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,700
You are so stubborn.

484
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,700
Don't be afraid.

485
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,700
Jiang Hao, don't be afraid of me.

486
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,700
Because I was begging you last night.

487
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,700
You didn't live a good life.

488
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,700
You had to make me get depressed.

489
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,700
Let's just get down together.

490
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,700
I dare to sing with your mom.

491
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,700
You dare to say that I am not your child.

492
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,700
Come on.

493
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,700
Husband.

494
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,700
You don't want to get married.

495
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,700
I am a little bit reluctant.

496
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,700
I have been a child for so many years.

497
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,700
But from today on,

498
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,700
I want to get married twice.

499
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,700
We have talked about it in the marriage test.

500
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,700
We want to live and die together.

501
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:10,700
It's good that you don't want to be in my arms.

502
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,700
You are so stubborn.

503
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,700
Look.

504
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,700
You are so stubborn.

505
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,700
Husband.

506
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,700
Husband.

507
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,700
Husband.

508
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,700
If a man wants to torture and revenge you with marriage,

509
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,700
it's not easy to solve it.

510
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,700
Don't leave the house and sign the papers.

511
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,700
Instead, you should rush out like a lion.

512
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,700
If he rewards you with love and respect,

513
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,700
you should hide your knife and blow it back.

514
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,700
Marriage is about meeting and sharing.

515
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,700
It's about the future.

516
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,700
You should be careful.

517
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,700
You should be careful.

518
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,700
You should be careful.

519
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,700
You should be careful.

520
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,700
You should be careful.

521
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,700
You should be careful.

522
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,700
You should be careful.

523
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,700
You should be careful.

524
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,700
You are so stubborn.

525
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,700
I said you should be careful.

526
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,700
What happened to you?

527
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,700
Did you hit the bell?

528
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,700
Yes, I hit it.

529
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,700
I hit it.

530
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,700
It's okay.

531
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,700
I know.

532
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,700
You can't bear to do that.

533
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,700
Mom.

534
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,700
You don't know.

535
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,700
I was wrong.

536
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,700
I won't do it again.

537
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,700
I'm back.

538
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,700
Xu Kai Xin,

539
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,700
stop there.

540
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,700
Where did you go yesterday?

541
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,700
I went to the hospital with a friend.

542
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,700
Stop.

543
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,700
You are stopping.

544
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,700
You are not going back to the dormitory.

545
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,700
I've been teaching you since you were a kid.

546
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,700
Lin Xi.

547
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,700
Lin Xi.

548
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,700
What are you doing?

549
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,700
I'm going to the hospital.

550
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,700
I'm going to the hospital.

551
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,700
I'm going to the hospital.

552
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,700
I'm going to the hospital.

553
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,700
Lin Xi.

554
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,700
I'm going to the hospital.

555
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,700
I'll stay there for a night.

556
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,700
I'll be out of battery.

557
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,700
You are a kid.

558
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,700
What else do you need?

559
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,700
I'm going to call him.

560
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,700
If you are with him,

561
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,700
I'll forget it.

562
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,700
Stop.

563
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,700
Stand there.

564
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,700
Hello, Sister Lily.

565
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,700
Xiao Xiao.

566
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,700
Did you spend the night with him?

567
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,700
Of course not, Sister Lily.

568
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,700
I'm going to the hospital.

569
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,700
Sister Lily.

570
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,700
Xu Kai Xin didn't go home last night.

571
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,700
You have to tell him the truth.

572
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,700
I knew it.

573
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,700
Wait here.

574
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,700
Sister Lily.

575
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,700
I brought you some noodles.

576
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,700
Noodles?

577
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,700
I gave you the noodles.

578
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,700
Hurry up.

579
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,700
I'll go in.

580
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,700
I'll go in today.

581
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,700
I'll go in today.

582
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,700
Sister.

583
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,700
Do you need to ask for mother's help?

584
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,700
You know nothing about kids.

585
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,700
Sister Lily is the hidden boss of the family.

586
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,700
She never gives me any votes.

587
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,700
Now I have to give them votes.

588
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,700
Everyone else.

589
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,700
Mother is still asking for the money.

590
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,700
Who dares to do this?

591
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,700
You!

592
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,700
I'll beat you to death!

593
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,700
You!

594
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,700
You!

595
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,700
I'll go in!

596
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,700
I'll go in!

597
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,700
Look over there.

598
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,700
The hospital is on fire!

599
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,700
Xu Kai Xin.

600
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,700
You think I'm blind?

601
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,700
This is the hotel's room tower.

602
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,700
Look.

603
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,700
Wait a minute.

604
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,700
Xu Kai Xin didn't go home last night?

605
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,700
Okay.

606
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,700
You're not old enough.

607
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,700
You can do it.

608
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,700
Have some.

609
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,700
Have some.

610
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,700
Have some.

611
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,700
Tian Hao.

612
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,700
Come on, Xiao Jiu.

613
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,700
I'm going to eat.

614
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,700
I'm not hungry.

615
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,700
Xiao Jiu.

616
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,700
Xiao Jiu.

617
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,700
What are you doing?

618
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,700
Xiao Jiu.

619
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,700
Don't be angry.

620
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,700
You're angry with your child.

621
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,700
You won't be healthy.

622
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,700
Mother, I've already scolded her for you.

623
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,700
Besides,

624
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,700
Mother said she's fine.

625
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,700
Otherwise, the champion

626
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,700
wouldn't have let her go back, right?

627
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,700
Mother, you just say it.

628
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,700
Will you pay for this $5,000 fine?

629
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,700
It's a pity.

630
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,700
My husband went to Piao City.

631
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,700
I paid for it.

632
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,700
If I don't have a good mood for this child...

633
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,700
Come on, come on.

634
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,700
Turn, turn, turn.

635
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,700
Turn.

636
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,700
Turn.

637
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,700
$6,600, okay?

638
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,700
Okay.

639
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,700
Okay, give me a discount.

640
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,700
Turn.

641
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,700
It's done.

642
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,700
Turn.

643
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,700
Thank you, mother.

644
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,700
Don't be angry.

645
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,700
Don't be angry.

646
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,700
You can go in.

647
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,700
$6,600, it's gone.

648
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,700
The world of adults is cruel and cruel.

649
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:44,700
No matter if it's a gold-plated or a royal robe,

650
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,700
when the sun rises on the second day,

651
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,700
you have to add more battlefields.

652
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,700
You should pretend to be a grandson.

653
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,700
Continue pretending to be a grandson.

654
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,700
Brother Lei, this is the money you want.

655
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,700
I've put it on for you.

656
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,700
Have a look.

657
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,700
Okay, put it on.

658
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,700
It's okay.

659
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,700
Mr. Chen,

660
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,700
about our agreement yesterday,

661
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,700
let's talk about the following.

662
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,700
Well,

663
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,700
you can go to the toilet first.

664
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,700
Yes.

665
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,700
Your mother...

666
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,700
Your mother...

667
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,700
I understand.

668
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,700
Yes.

669
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,700
Who is the one who encountered this?

670
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,700
Yes, it's not me.

671
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,700
Yes.

672
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,700
I'm sorry.

673
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,700
I'm sorry.

674
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,700
I'm not saying.

675
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,700
Hello?

676
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,700
You're not home?

677
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,700
Open the door for me.

678
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,700
Okay, I'll go in.

679
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,700
Okay.

680
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,700
Come in.

681
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,700
Manager,

682
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,700
Mr. Xia has approved the contract.

683
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,700
When did you get this?

684
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,700
Today.

685
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,700
I called him to say that

686
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,700
he was so polite

687
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,700
that he told me that he had already passed it.

688
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,700
Then he sent us the contract.

689
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,700
I got it.

690
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,700
Go back to work.

691
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,700
How did you know about this family?

692
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,700
I'm a big fan of Yuan.

693
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,700
Yes.

694
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,700
creator is out.

695
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,700
He exposed it.

696
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,700
Who do you think you are?

697
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,700
Can you stop set me up?

698
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,700
I've had enough of it.

699
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,700
I've had enough of it.

700
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,700
I've had too much of it.

701
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,700
Oh my god, Xue Kai Xi.

702
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,700
I've been beaten up by a scumbag since I came back.

703
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,700
This sister-in-law is not a scumbag.

704
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,700
She's just a scumbag.

705
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,700
She's just a scumbag.

706
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,700
In front of the two kids,

707
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,700
where's my mom and dad?

708
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,700
When I was in the middle of the class,

709
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,700
I was still in the middle of the class.

710
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,700
Why is the old lady getting more and more powerful?

711
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,700
Wait, wait, wait.

712
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,700
Bring it back.

713
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:26,700
You said you were still a scumbag between Mei Cheng Yi and you.

714
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,700
You told me that you were a scumbag.

715
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,700
Is this not appropriate for you?

716
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,700
I know.

717
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,700
Mei Cheng Yi, she...

718
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,700
can't do it.

719
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,700
No, she can't.

720
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,700
She doesn't know if she can do it or not.

721
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,700
Is she really okay?

722
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,700
It was supposed to happen.

723
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,700
But she got a sprain.

724
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,700
Why did she go to the hospital and get a big sprain?

725
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,700
It seems that the face looks so young.

726
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,700
It's useless.

727
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,700
I'm telling you.

728
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,700
Although she didn't get a sprain,

729
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,700
but...

730
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,700
You're talking about half of the words.

731
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,700
I'm already...

732
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,700
You're talking about...

733
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,700
I'm done talking.

734
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,700
Tell me.

735
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,700
She told me that she wanted to get married.

736
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,700
And then?

737
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,700
Get married!

738
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,700
No, Xu Kai Xin, say it again.

739
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,700
Get married!

740
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,700
I'm not getting married.

741
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,700
I haven't gotten married yet.

742
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,700
You're getting married again?

743
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,700
No, right?

744
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,700
It seems that I'm a bit rude.

745
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,700
You're so rude.

746
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,700
I don't want to be a big mother here.

747
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,700
I'm a big mother in the house.

748
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,700
I'm married in my parents' house.

749
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,700
I'm...

750
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,700
I'm so sorry.

751
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,700
No, why are you acting like a nobody?

752
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,700
What am I doing?

753
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,700
This is not a normal thing.

754
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,700
She wants to get married to you.

00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,700
Why are you here?

776
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,700
I'm here for a guest.

777
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,700
Let's go.

778
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,700
Hello.

779
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,700
Hello.

780
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,700
Hey, little girl.

781
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,700
Come here.

782
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,700
Sit down.

783
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,700
Yes.

784
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,700
I can't sit down.

785
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:01,700
I can't sit down.

786
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,700
You're already married.

787
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,700
You're still hiding it from me.

788
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,700
No way.

789
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,700
No matter what you say,

790
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,700
you have to bring her back to me.

791
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,700
Yes, who says no?

792
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,700
Sister Lili.

793
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,700
Her name is Mei Cheng Yi.

794
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,700
Mei Cheng Yi?

795
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,700
You can't just look at her name.

796
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:21,700
I object.

797
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,700
I object to my consent.

798
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,700
Of course.

799
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,700
Of course.

800
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,700
If you don't agree,

801
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:27,700
I wouldn't agree.

802
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:37,700
Wait a minute.

803
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,700
I'll finish it.

804
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,700
Sorry.

805
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,700
I...

806
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,700
I...

807
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,700
You're playing too hard.

808
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:21,700
I'm sorry.

809
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,700
I'm sorry.

810
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:21,700
I'm sorry.

811
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:51,700
I'm sorry.

812
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:21,700
