1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:29,120
Duan에는

2
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:36,120
I see your pain

3
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,120
And your brain, brain too

4
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,120
Some things we cannot just embrace

5
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:02,120
And there's no time to get stuck on the past

6
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:12,120
Create a day line, go to the free

7
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,120
Let's cross the wind, dance in rain

8
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,120
Let the stars in the room and let them wait

9
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,120
Oh, this is a feast, happiness

10
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,120
They are all about our journey

11
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,120
Come, sit down

12
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,120
My grandson is here, Xiaomi

13
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,120
Grandma misses you so much

14
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,120
When I was in the hospital, Grandma always missed you

15
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,120
Do you miss Grandma?

16
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,120
Grandma, I miss you too

17
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,120
What do you want to eat?

18
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,120
There are so many things

19
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,120
What do you want to eat?

20
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,120
Hamburger, fries, ice cream

21
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,120
No, I can't eat these at night

22
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,120
I will have tooth decay

23
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,120
Mom won't allow

24
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,120
It's okay, occasionally

25
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,120
I will buy it for you later

26
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,120
What else do you want?

27
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,120
Toy car

28
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,120
No, you have too many toys

29
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,120
I can't put them down at home

30
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,120
Xiaomi, it's okay

31
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,120
Since you are here, you have to be happy

32
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,120
Okay, I will buy it for you later

33
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,120
Okay

34
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,120
Yes, yes, yes

35
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,120
Look, today Grandpa prepared a lot of delicious food for you

36
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,120
Wow, I am so happy

37
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,120
I am so happy

38
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,120
I am so happy

39
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,120
Which one do you want?

40
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,120
I will peel it for you

41
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,120
This one

42
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,120
My grandson is happy

43
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,120
Dad, grandma, you can't hang it like this

44
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,120
It's okay, occasionally

45
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,120
I will peel it for you later

46
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,120
Look, how happy Grandma is now

47
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,120
Just this one time

48
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,120
Be good

49
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,120
Be good

50
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,120
I miss mom

51
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,120
Every day of the middle-aged is like a war of effort

52
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,120
It's a luxury to let go

53
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,120
There are many people like me

54
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,120
Enjoying their solitude in front of the door

55
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,120
The beautiful starry sky

56
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,120
Give them to yourself in these five minutes

57
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:50,120
A river, two parts of the city

58
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,120
A lamp, the light of the day and night

59
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:04,120
A memory, the flow of time

60
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:10,120
There are always half of me and half of you

61
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,120
How many stars have passed by at that time

62
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,120
The ice is yellow

63
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,120
How many days and nights have passed by

64
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,120
The lightning is lightning

65
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,120
How many days and nights have passed by

66
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,120
The sadness of time

67
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,120
Be a good friend

68
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,120
I want to be your friend

69
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,120
That moment

70
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,120
Happy

71
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,120
Happy

72
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,120
Happy

73
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,120
Is Yuan Yang around tomorrow?

74
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,120
I went to Grandma's place

75
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,120
Stay with me

76
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,120
I will

77
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,440
Why are you stopping me?

78
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,240
уh

79
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,520
One after another

80
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,820
The child

81
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:47,940
record

82
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,480
The child

83
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,840
has a morning

84
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,160
and a late

85
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,400
of Mulberry

86
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,500
good

87
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,280
oh

88
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,360
Xiao Mi

89
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,540
Where are you my

90
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,840
my

91
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,120
Wait for me.

92
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,280
Grandma, grandma.

93
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,600
I want to eat blueberries and watermelon.

94
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,560
Qian Xiao Mi, you're too much.

95
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,600
You ate so much sugar last night.

96
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,960
You ate all the fruit and it's in your stomach.

97
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,760
It's okay.

98
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,720
Your mom is so mean.

99
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,680
Why did you come here?

100
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,640
Eat whatever you want.

101
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,720
Go wash it.

102
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,160
It's not good for kids to eat so much at night.

103
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,840
What's wrong with you?

104
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,320
I said I understand you, you said you want to wash it.

105
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,680
Can't you make me happy?

106
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,440
Okay, okay, I'll wash it.

107
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,360
I'll help you wash it.

108
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,760
No, I'll sit here.

109
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,800
You can't spoil Xiao Mi like this.

110
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,600
No matter how good the kid is, he'll spoil her.

111
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,480
I have something to tell you.

112
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,640
What is it?

113
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,760
I'm going to take you and my mom abroad

114
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,600
to treat my mom.

115
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,920
I know.

116
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,400
One, two, three.

117
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,120
I want to take Xiao Mi away with me.

118
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,840
What?

119
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,560
Are you crazy?

120
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,560
Can Xu Kai Xin agree?

121
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,480
She can't.

122
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,760
I'm the father of the kid.

123
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,120
I won't break the law if I take the kid away.

124
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,200
As long as we go abroad,

125
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,760
Xu Kai Xin won't find us.

126
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,480
You...

127
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,440
Isn't this nonsense?

128
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,960
You can take away such a small kid?

129
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,280
Can she not wake up her mom?

130
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,240
I know.

131
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,960
But I'm so angry because I like her.

132
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,960
Otherwise, do you think

133
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,760
why I signed that agreement with Xu Kai Xin?

134
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,960
I want her to relax

135
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,960
and let Xiao Mi get along with us.

136
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,160
When she gets along with us,

137
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,560
she won't make trouble again.

138
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,520
No, no, you can't be ridiculous.

139
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,120
Our family owes Xu Kai Xin less.

140
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,360
I only care about my mom.

141
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,360
I don't care about others.

142
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,400
You two

143
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,200
are really

144
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,640
refreshing my understanding of the bottom line.

145
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,760
Bro, it's time.

146
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,040
Have you made up your mind?

147
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,960
Do you want money or face?

148
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,560
You guys are really busy.

149
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,360
You haven't opened for three years.

150
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,080
Open for three years.

151
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,880
Why didn't she reply?

152
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,560
Say more.

153
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,080
It's exciting.

154
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,080
Take a shower.

155
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,280
What else can I say?

156
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:46,760
I've already

157
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,840
got these in my head.

158
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,800
Look at you.

159
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,400
Come on, get up.

160
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,040
Why did you say I'm the leader?

161
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,720
Right?

162
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,600
Bro.

163
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,720
Let's put it this way.

164
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,720
Since I can find you,

165
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,840
I can also find

166
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,480
your and her relatives and friends.

167
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,240
Right?

168
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,080
Right.

169
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,280
I didn't give you a chance.

170
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,840
If I can't get the money

171
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,240
in ten minutes,

172
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,920
I won't miss

173
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,440
any video or photo.

174
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,640
To show my sincerity,

175
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,400
I'll give you a gift.

176
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,040
You have to talk like this.

177
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,360
You've learned it.

178
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,200
Let's go back.

179
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,960
Love feelings

180
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,680
A single oriented poem.

181
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,360
Pisces.

182
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,600
Have we failed?

183
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,360
What shall we do?

184
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Are we

185
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,960
just over bekommt?

186
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,560
RMB300,000?

187
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,880
Shall we lower the quality?

188
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,480
At least lower.

189
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,880
I thought that this bitch would give us 100,000 yuan.

190
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,880
We just need 100,000 yuan. Even if it's 350,000 yuan,

191
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,680
we can just take revenge and stop hating each other.

192
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,680
But 300,000 yuan... Only a fool can give us that much.

193
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,880
Yes, that's right.

194
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,880
Let me add one more thing.

195
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:50,880
You... If you think 300,000 yuan is too much,

196
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,680
I'm not unreasonable.

197
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,480
You are indeed a victim.

198
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,680
If you can't, let's make a discount.

199
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,280
300,000 yuan is not enough.

200
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,480
Then 300,000 yuan is also a good deal.

201
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,280
Be gentle. I'm typing.

202
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,280
Money, money, money.

203
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,680
300,000 yuan is here.

204
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,280
Come on.

205
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,480
Come on.

206
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,080
Come on.

207
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,880
I just found out.

208
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,480
I'll chase you.

209
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,880
If you think 300,000 yuan is too much,

210
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,680
I'm not unreasonable.

211
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,880
You are indeed a victim.

212
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,080
If you can't, let's make a discount.

213
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,280
300,000 yuan is not enough.

214
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,280
Then 300,000 yuan is also a good deal.

215
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,080
This money is more important than being a loser.

216
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,280
Bro, we are friends.

217
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,080
It's too sudden.

218
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,880
Hmm...

219
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,680
Hello,

220
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,280
I'm from Bank of the developed attacks.

221
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,280
I have a question for you.

222
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,680
If you use your bank card to transfer money,

223
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,520
and if you made a mistake,

224
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,320
would you have the chance to return it?

225
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,680
For example,

226
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,000
say, 30,000 yuan

227
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,200
has been transferred to 300,000 yuan.

228
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,360
300,000 yuan!

229
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,760
300,000 yuan!

230
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,520
300,000 yuan!

231
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,680
300,000 yuan!

232
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,680
300,000 yuan!

233
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,080
300,000 yuan!

234
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,280
300,000 yuan!

235
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,080
300,000 yuan!

236
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,080
300,000 yuan!

237
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,200
300,000 yuan!

238
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,360
Yes.

239
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,000
This...

240
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,600
Long-life noodles.

241
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,560
This?

242
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,840
This is the one in your house.

243
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,120
No, I don't think so.

244
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,920
The one on the top of the cabinet is this.

245
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,080
It's been seven years.

246
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,400
It's been too long.

247
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,520
So it's called long-life noodles.

248
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,400
You're not satisfied, are you?

249
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,240
Wait for me.

250
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,680
Happy birthday!

251
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,320
Xu Weixin.

252
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,320
I found out that you

253
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,800
want to give me property.

254
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,960
No, it's a standard.

255
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,240
Let me help you.

256
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:04,840
Let me help you.

257
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,880
One for each.

258
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,480
This...

259
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,160
This...

260
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,120
This...

261
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,800
This...

262
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,520
This...

263
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,080
This...

264
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,080
It's delicious.

265
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,600
I want some, too.

266
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,800
I'll have some.

267
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,600
You're still eating the noodles.

268
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,640
I'm full.

269
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,280
Goodbye, grandma.

270
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,320
Goodbye, grandpa.

271
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,320
Goodbye, grandma.

272
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,400
Xiao Mi, come again.

273
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,600
Come to see grandma again.

274
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,040
Let's go.

275
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,000
Let's go back and rest.

276
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,400
Let's go back and rest.

277
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,000
Be careful.

278
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,760
Be careful.

279
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,760
Goodbye, grandma.

280
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,240
Xiao Mi.

281
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,560
From now on,

282
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,320
don't tell mom about this.

283
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,320
Don't tell her.

284
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,320
No buts.

285
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,160
I'll go to the school to find you.

286
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,640
Did you dump me?

287
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,640
Let's just call it even.

288
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,600
Okay.

289
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,600
I trust you.

290
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,200
Dad, sister,

291
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,400
hurry up.

292
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,760
Let's go.

293
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,400
Okay.

294
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,880
Mom is here.

295
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:23,880
Here.

296
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,120
Mom, I miss you.

297
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,720
Baby, I miss you, too.

298
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,320
Are you happy today?

299
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,160
Happy.

300
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,320
Very happy.

301
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,560
Are you happy?

302
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,600
I'm sorry.

303
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,200
Are you happy?

304
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,120
Yes, I am.

305
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,120
I'm very happy.

306
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,040
This is

307
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,520
what my mom bought for my kids.

308
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,680
My mom is very happy today.

309
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,320
I'm very grateful to you.

310
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,120
You know my mom's condition

311
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,440
is getting worse and worse.

312
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,240
Maybe I'll pick up my kids

313
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,520
to spend time with her.

314
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,280
As long as you keep your promise,

315
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,040
don't just take away Han Sen.

316
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,320
I can understand.

317
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:06,720
I understand.

318
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,680
Let's go.

319
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,840
I'll take a photo of you.

320
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,720
No.

321
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,920
Baby,

322
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,640
don't go.

323
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:49,800
Right.

324
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:50,880
I'm right about my mom

325
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,520
now.

326
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:56,800
I just wanna

327
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,440
disappear too soon,

328
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,040
your mom won't be able

329
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,040
to take care of you right now.

330
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,760
You need to be considerationate of her.

331
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,680
I'll leaveよ since she's dead.

332
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,880
I'm leaving too.

333
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,760
Look here.

334
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,060
What are you doing? stem machine is helping you.

335
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,500
When the time comes,

336
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,180
there's one week left.

337
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:42,860
Xiao Jiao and Qian Hao will be getting divorced.

338
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,380
They're getting divorced. What are you getting excited about?

339
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,780
After they get divorced,

340
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,420
my sister will take Xiao Jiao to go abroad.

341
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,660
We'll be free.

342
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,860
Xiao Jiao and Qian Hao.

343
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,060
Heaven and earth,

344
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,940
God of the road, please bless Hu Xiao Jiao and Qian Hao.

345
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,340
May they get divorced.

346
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,860
Of course.

347
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,060
Master, Master.

348
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,380
My disciple is calling for you.

349
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,380
When will you be back?

350
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,660
You You, hello.

351
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,780
Master, you're finally awake.

352
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,260
Master, you've been missing for so long.

353
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,540
Is it like a painting?

354
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,540
Master, I'm back.

355
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,060
I'm back.

356
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,060
You've been missing for so long. Is it like a painting?

357
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,260
I'm alone now. How many people are there?

358
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,260
One, two, three, four. You're thinking about the time of forgetfulness.

359
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,460
I'm lying in your place all day.

360
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,860
Come back.

361
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,060
You You.

362
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,260
Stop sleeping. Stop sleeping.

363
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,460
It's already late.

364
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,660
Look at how this room has turned out.

365
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,660
Come.

366
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,860
Stop sleeping.

367
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,460
How can I live like this in such a good day?

368
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,660
Good day.

369
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,260
Good day.

370
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,860
How can I live like this?

371
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,860
Good day.

372
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,660
Xiao Jiao.

373
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,060
You're going out?

374
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,260
Yes, I have something to do outside.

375
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:48,260
Yes, it's good for you to go out and sunbathe.

376
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,660
It's good for your health.

377
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,660
But there's one thing. You can't go to the front.

378
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,660
Yes, yes.

379
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,260
You can't go to the front.

380
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:01,060
Even if I have a knife on my neck, I won't turn around.

381
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,660
I'm going to see Xu Happy.

382
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,460
Some people can't understand what's in their hearts.

383
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,460
They can't let go completely.

384
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,460
Then, it's like meeting enemies and seeing each other.

385
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,060
What if you get into a fight?

386
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,860
With your small body,

387
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,460
I'll go with you.

388
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,860
Yes, we'll go together.

389
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:23,060
No, Happy is very happy now.

390
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:26,060
I owe him a sincere apology.

391
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:31,260
Maybe he doesn't need it anymore, but I need it.

392
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,460
I'm going.

393
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:56,460
You can't live

394
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,660
you know you're living.

395
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:02,260
Very, very well.

396
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,060
I'm coming.

397
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,060
Bye.

398
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,860
Goodbye.

399
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,460
Don't touch.

400
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,860
Bye, happy birthday.

401
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,060
Have a good day.

402
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,460
You can decide what you want to eat.

403
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,260
What will my mom eat?

404
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,060
She's the same as you. She hasn't slept yet.

405
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:28,060
I don't know when she'll get up.

406
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,060
Let's talk when she gets up.

407
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,460
I'm not Hu Pei.

408
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,060
Master, stop it.

409
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,060
You're an adult now.

410
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,060
Fine. You just want to end the annual leave

411
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,060
and die of exhaustion.

412
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,060
You'll be happy, right?

413
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,060
I'm sorry.

414
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,060
Hu Pei is no longer here.

415
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,060
He doesn't have a family.

416
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,060
He left a will before he died.

417
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,060
He left everything to me.

418
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,060
He was in charge of his funeral.

419
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,060
After I finished communicating with the lawyer,

420
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:28,060
I charged his phone and saw your message.

421
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:31,060
Hu Pei left a sum of money for 123.

422
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:34,060
If possible, I hope to hand it over to you.

423
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,060
Master,

424
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,060
I'm just kidding.

425
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,060
If you're going to have a stomachache,

426
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,060
I'm going to be mad.

427
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,060
Master.

428
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,060
Master.

429
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,060
I'm sorry.

430
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,060
I'm sorry.

431
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:17,060
I'm sorry.

432
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:48,060
Thanks.

433
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:48,620
OK.

434
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,700
Hi.

435
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,060
Youyou,

436
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,540
long time no see.

437
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,140
I knew you would come back.

438
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,980
You can't leave here.

439
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:18,700
Go take a break.

440
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,140
I'm okay.

441
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,820
My wife got pregnant.

442
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,860
Her child is my strand.

443
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,340
Is this a real identity?

444
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,060
Is this a Statue of Liberty?

445
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,020
Yeah.

446
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:40,020
It's a유

447
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,380
You're crying?

448
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,340
One, two

449
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,460
I'll play the fox and the frog.

450
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,180
It's fun and joyful.

451
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:52,980
Think about it.

452
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:56,580
The bodyguards around the tomb are so cool.

453
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,380
Chinese people

454
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,260
should have their own heroes.

455
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,220
Am I right?

456
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,460
You...

457
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:25,320
i d coat

458
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,000
Hi.

459
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,160
Are you Youyou?

460
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,820
0 is 2 is the power of safety.

461
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,240
damp

462
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,480
safety

463
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,920
safety

464
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:00,900
safety

465
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,580
rules

466
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,340
are doubtful

467
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,360
you will die

468
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,100
and then fuckin die

469
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,700
cover and put out

470
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,340
10 you answer

471
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,340
After the full meeting

472
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,060
you say

473
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:15,980
no

474
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,940
10

475
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,900
I don't have a sister like you.

476
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,500
I don't have a brother like you.

477
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,140
Stop it.

478
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,220
Where did you go last time?

479
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,060
I don't know.

480
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,660
I haven't finished my homework.

481
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,740
You can only go to the store with me and Li Li.

482
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,540
Okay, I'll bring the homework to the store.

483
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,220
Wait.

484
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,780
You said you were fine with your grandma last time.

485
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,580
I'm fine.

486
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,060
I just haven't finished my homework.

487
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,380
Okay.

488
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,580
I'll cook you something delicious later.

489
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,460
Okay.

490
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,340
Xiao Mi, hurry up.

491
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,220
Okay, I'll cook and eat later.

492
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,380
Okay.

493
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:52,900
Itchy.

494
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,580
I want you to change my sister.

495
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,780
Change my sister.

496
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,060
It's annoying.

497
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,340
Change my sister.

498
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,220
The little red bean is very sweet.

499
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,220
You won't be sad if you eat it.

500
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,220
Here you are.

501
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,220
Thank you, Miss.

502
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,220
It's so sweet.

503
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,220
It's so sweet.

504
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,220
Right?

505
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,220
You fatso.

506
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,220
Give it back to him.

507
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,220
Don't bully him.

508
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,220
Give it back to him.

509
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,220
Give it back to him.

510
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,220
Give it back to him.

511
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,220
What's wrong?

512
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,220
What's wrong?

513
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,220
What's wrong, Little Red Bean?

514
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,220
What's wrong?

515
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,220
Miss, wait for me.

516
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:17,080
protein

517
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,020
Put abusive words into words.

518
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,720
protein

519
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,220
Get off me.

520
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,140
Don't do what you've done.

521
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,220
You're right.

522
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,220
Between them,

523
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:39,220
if I emuscate our family,

524
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,220
we will become the police.

525
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,220
Don't be western heavy.

526
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:44,700
Oh, right.

527
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:45,620
Later,

528
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,820
I'll send Yuan and Yule to business class.

529
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,500
They'll go abroad for business class.

530
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,740
If there's nothing else,

531
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,900
I'll go to the store to help you.

532
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,060
Forget it.

533
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,260
Just go back and rest.

534
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,700
Don't break everyone.

535
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,620
We're each other's fuel station.

536
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,620
We're not burden.

537
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:01,980
Okay.

538
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,140
I'll see to it then.

539
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,740
Is there something

540
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,660
bothering you recently?

541
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,540
Work?

542
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,380
You can't escape from anything.

543
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,700
Of course.

544
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:19,700
If I say so,

545
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,740
you can quit your job.

546
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,820
You can work in the cake shop with me.

547
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,700
Maybe we can

548
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,700
make a big chain

549
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,060
and make a big hit.

550
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,980
Don't worry.

551
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,020
I'm just being myself.

552
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,220
The old company

553
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,900
gave me a new job.

554
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,740
But I'm not close to it.

555
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,220
As for the new company,

556
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,900
you can't take these old colleagues.

557
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,060
I'll be here for a while.

558
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,420
Since it's a hard choice,

559
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,380
it's hard to make a decision.

560
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,340
It proves

561
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,940
they're of the same kind.

562
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:52,980
That's easy.

563
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,340
Choose the one that's more profitable.

564
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,580
Don't listen to those capitalists

565
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,860
and compare them with you.

566
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:00,180
The one who gets it is the real one.

567
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,340
You're the real one.

568
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,460
But it makes sense.

569
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,220
Jiang Xiaozhen.

570
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,660
I'm going to work soon.

571
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,980
Shouldn't you

572
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,740
give me some motivation?

573
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,100
Where's mine?

574
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,460
You have so much white hair.

575
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,460
So much white hair.

576
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,620
Sister, what are they doing?

577
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,660
Stop dyeing. I'll do it for you.

578
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,580
Uncle Mei wants his mom to kiss him.

579
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,660
But she didn't kiss him.

580
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,900
She even pulled his hair.

581
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,340
Oh.

582
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,140
Not only one.

583
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,820
You can't dye your hair.

584
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,100
I see.

585
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,060
Aunt Xu pulled

586
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,580
dad's black hair.

587
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,100
It's so black.

588
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,940
It's not black hair at all.

589
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,420
Aunt Xu is lying.

590
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,060
Why would she lie?

591
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,900
What are you doing here?

592
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,820
I'll get you some noodles.

593
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,380
What are you doing?

594
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,060
What are you doing?

595
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:09,700
Okay.

596
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,540
I'll get it.

597
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,260
I'll get it.

598
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,620
I'll get it ready for class.

599
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,740
Dad,

600
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,140
let's go.

601
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,220
We're going to be late.

602
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:35,860
It's still morning.

603
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,780
Zhao Longjie.

604
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,060
Are you really afraid of being late?

605
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,140
Or do you want to find

606
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,780
this rice millet to fight?

607
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,860
Or do you want to play with them?

608
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,500
I want to play with them.

609
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,740
Who just gave

610
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,500
millet a hug?

611
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,100
He.

612
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:53,700
He.

613
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,420
He.

614
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,140
He.

615
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:55,900
He.

616
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,460
It's the best to

617
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,940
express your kindness.

618
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:00,500
Who?

619
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,100
I.

620
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:01,820
I.

621
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,340
I.

622
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:03,700
Okay.

623
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,540
Let's go.

624
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,860
Dad, let's go.

625
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:08,380
Come on.

626
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,460
Hurry up.

627
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:09,980
Be careful.

628
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,660
Be careful.

629
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,460
Dad, hurry up.

630
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:11,940
Hurry up.

631
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,220
Hurry up.

632
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,340
Coming.

633
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:15,980
Look at him.

634
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,500
He's gone too far.

635
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,220
He's been broke up for almost 20 years.

636
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,580
He never contacted me.

637
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,260
He left his will

638
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,380
and asked me to help him with his funeral.

639
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,380
He left so many relics to his ex-girlfriend.

640
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,260
He's been so willful

641
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,460
and mischievous all his life.

642
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,580
I know I met him.

643
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,420
I just realized

644
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,620
love

645
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,020
is not just about life.

646
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,500
Someone is standing in front of you

647
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,660
and smiling at you.

648
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,660
You want to give the whole world to him.

649
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,660
He mentioned you yesterday.

650
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,580
He said

651
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,460
there's a person he loves

652
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,100
just because he saw him

653
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,340
in the crowd.

654
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,580
He wanted to give the whole world to him.

655
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,540
He was a man of his word.

656
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,740
He didn't say that

657
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,700
when he refused to break up with me.

658
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,060
He was not soft-hearted

659
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,740
when I tried to kill myself.

660
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,540
He even asked a woman to get angry with me

661
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,780
and asked me to give up.

662
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,700
I thought he was joking.

663
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,100
I know he did it for my own good.

664
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,820
He left his will.

665
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,740
He was afraid that he would drag me down.

666
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,660
But I still blamed him

667
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,100
for choosing my life for me.

668
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,700
But...

669
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,500
But, Fu Zan,

670
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,460
why did you

671
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,180
suddenly save me?

672
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,180
He left this to you.

673
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,660
The lawyer gave it to me.

674
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,860
You should know it after reading it.

675
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,580
There's a card inside.

676
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:19,180
It's the living expenses he left for 123.

677
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,820
I'm afraid that

678
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,740
he wanted to keep the dog when he was with me.

679
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,580
He still kept it.

680
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,740
Little Youyou,

681
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,180
I'm sending you a letter.

682
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,660
When you saw this letter,

683
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,700
I must have been in heaven.

684
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,900
You didn't expect that, right?

685
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:54,980
I'm the biggest client you've ever hidden.

686
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,380
I've been standing

687
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,380
at the best spot for a long time.

688
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:04,460
Don't be sad, little girl.

689
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,460
Actually,

690
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,060
I've already made a lot of money.

691
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,660
I have a genetic heart disease.

692
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,300
My father,

693
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,300
my grandfather,

694
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,780
my grandfather's grandfather,

695
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,580
my grandfather's grandfather's grandfather,

696
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,580
I heard that

697
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,580
they're all not alive until they're 40.

698
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,940
So,

699
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,180
since I was born,

700
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,580
I've been in the countdown for death.

701
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,580
Let me introduce you.

702
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,420
To be precise,

703
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,500
everyone is in the countdown.

704
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,780
But my race

705
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,500
started from the moment I started to race.

706
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,820
I'm destined to be

707
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,420
half shorter than others.

708
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,740
This is called a funeral.

709
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,740
You have to put on a firecracker later.

710
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,180
But there are no people here.

711
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,380
What's there to celebrate?

712
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,620
Everyone doesn't want to get old.

713
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,060
But do you know

714
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,540
how many people

715
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,540
can't live to the end?

716
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,860
I'm already 44.

717
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,500
I've made a lot of money

718
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,500
every day.

719
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,540
You came to Lingyuan to treat your heart disease.

720
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,940
I'm not uncomfortable.

721
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:07,060
I'm more afraid of death than anyone else.

722
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:11,020
Every day I work in Lingyuan,

723
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,820
I try to adapt to

724
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,620
this home that will last forever.

725
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,180
I have to praise myself for this.

726
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:21,180
I must have taken good care of this home.

727
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,580
Sometimes,

728
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:27,020
I sit in front of my tomb,

729
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,780
looking far into the clear mountains,

730
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,060
and I feel that

731
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:32,300
I've lived here for many lifetimes.

732
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,500
It seems to be good.

733
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,300
This should be my favorite home.

734
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,860
My neighbors know me.

735
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,540
So, little girl,

736
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,140
don't worry.

737
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:46,980
I must be very happy now.

738
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,420
I don't know

739
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,300
if you will come back to Lingyuan.

740
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,580
I think it's up to you.

741
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,220
Maybe your heart has been untangled.

742
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,260
From now on,

743
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,500
the sky is high and the sea is wide.

744
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,580
That's good.

745
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,380
I'm not worried that

746
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,980
you will never come back.

747
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,500
With your sister here,

748
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,780
when you come to see her,

749
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,580
you can give me some skewers

750
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,180
and two bottles of wine.

751
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,700
Then you won't waste our master and disciple.

752
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:25,980
I'm only worried about 123.

753
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,580
This silly dog is too old.

754
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,980
So I'm asking you

755
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,180
to take care of 123.

756
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,900
I've saved

757
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,700
all his life's maintenance fee.

758
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,020
If you don't agree,

759
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,340
I won't let you go even if I'm a thief.

760
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,140
All right, little girl.

761
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,020
Don't be sad.

762
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,660
There's a saying that's very common,

763
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,460
but it really hit me.

764
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:53,220
Because we will die for a long time,

765
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:56,900
we should live better.

766
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:01,380
Master is going to die now.

767
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:04,220
But you should live well

768
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,500
for your sister and master.

769
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:10,700
He Dongxian, enjoy yourself.

770
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,500
It smells so good.

771
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,900
We have to save the fire.

772
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,700
Hurry up.

773
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,300
Master is blocked again.

774
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,700
What's up, Youyou?

775
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:31,700
Is Master's level increasing?

776
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,300
Go away.

777
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,500
Master.

778
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,300
You want to scare me to death?

779
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,100
Why did you come here in the middle of the night?

780
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,100
Youyou,

781
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,100
you should know

782
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,700
that people's life

783
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,500
will pass very quickly.

784
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,500
You should know how to enjoy it.

785
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,900
How to take care of yourself?

786
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,900
Master, how old are you?

787
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,700
Over 40.

788
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:03,500
Why do you always

789
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,500
look like an old man?

790
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,700
This is...

791
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,900
a crown.

792
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,500
You're so scary.

793
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,700
This is called pulling the string,

794
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,900
strengthening the body,

795
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,500
and giving up.

796
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,500
Goodbye, little girl.

797
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,100
We won't change.

798
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,500
We will meet again 100 years later.

799
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,700
Do you believe it?

800
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,100
I am still

801
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,700
the most handsome young man.

802
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,100
In the end,

803
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,100
Master made a joke for you.

804
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,900
I will rely on her to fool the little girl.

805
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:37,700
Can you guess

806
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,700
why there are only 160

807
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,900
seven gourd dolls?

808
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,500
You can't guess it, right?

809
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,900
Because the six dolls are invisible dolls.

810
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,700
She's invisible.

811
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,100
A river

812
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:32,500
Two parts of the city

813
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:35,300
A lamp

814
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:39,500
The light of the day and night

815
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,100
A memory

816
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:46,700
The flow of time

817
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:49,100
There is always someone

818
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,700
I want to be with

819
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:55,700
There is always someone

820
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:58,700
Half happy and half sad

821
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,700
Who said it wasn't

822
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:07,700
Wasting time

823
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,700
Who said it wasn't

824
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:14,700
Riding alone

825
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:17,700
Whose story

826
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:22,700
Is there no balance

827
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:25,700
Half of the story

828
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:29,700
Half

829
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:35,700
How many times at that time

830
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:40,700
Who has walked through the ice and desert

831
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:43,700
How many days and nights

832
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:47,700
How many days and nights

833
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:51,700
The sorrow of time

834
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:55,700
Be a lonely

835
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:57,700
Only in the past

836
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:01,700
I'm happy

837
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:05,700
If the young courage

838
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:09,700
Never be destroyed by laughter

839
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:12,700
The simple and simple

840
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:16,700
There is no regret

841
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:20,700
The sorrow of time

842
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:24,700
No one

843
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:29,700
The sky will be dark

844
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:34,700
Tearful
