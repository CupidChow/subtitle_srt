1
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:49,966
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

2
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,436
Your Majesty, the wind is cold.

3
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,188
You should head to your chambers.

4
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,397
YI HEON
KING OF JOSEON

5
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,815
All right. We shall go.

6
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,610
Wait, Your Majesty.

7
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,072
Can you tell us where we're…

8
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,698
KANG MOK-JU
FOURTH JUNIOR CONSORT, YI HEON'S CONCUBINE

9
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,033
…headed?

10
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,577
Why do you ask? Are you afraid?

11
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,828
Of course I am.

12
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:22,207
Everything around me
is unfamiliar and scary right now.

13
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,087
SHIN SU-HYEOK
COMMANDER OF URIMWI

14
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,090
What the heck?

15
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,302
How is that?

16
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:37,555
Are your surroundings
less unfamiliar and scary now?

17
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:41,434
Yes. I can't see anything now,
so there's nothing to fear.

18
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:42,393
Thanks a lot.

19
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:45,063
What a remarkably fresh approach.

20
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:50,777
I have prepared
a special residence for you.

21
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,446
You may look forward to it.

22
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,115
I will.

23
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,034
We shall go.

24
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:08,503
In this era, is it natural and ordinary
for the king to do as he pleases?

25
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:11,131
I told you to watch what you say!

26
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:40,493
How is His Majesty?

27
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,081
An unknown ointment
was applied to the wound,

28
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,374
which seems to have stopped the bleeding.

29
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,920
Any delay and His Majesty's life
could have been in grave danger.

30
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,130
The heavens protected him.

31
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,717
It is greatly fortunate
that it was not any worse, Your Majesty.

32
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,886
If the bleeding had not been stopped,

33
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,221
my life could have been in danger?

34
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,389
<i>What's your problem?</i>

35
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,308
<i>Don't you see</i>
<i>that I stopped the bleeding for you?</i>

36
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,143
I saved your life!

37
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,273
Very well. You may all leave.

38
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,566
Yes, Your Majesty.

39
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:19,991
You must forget every detail
of what you saw and heard in here today.

40
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,784
Yes, Your Grace.

41
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,592
It was truly a close call, Your Majesty.

42
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:41,262
May I ask who stopped
the bleeding from the wound?

43
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,306
It was the <i>gwinyeo.</i>

44
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,682
The <i>gwinyeo</i>?

45
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,435
Did you bring her here
because she saved your life,

46
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,729
not because she committed a crime?

47
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,397
That is partially why.

48
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,900
However, no one in all of Joseon

49
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,570
wants to kill her as much as I do.

50
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,365
It has been a while
since I last saw you look that amused.

51
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,659
Are you perhaps bothered about that?

52
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,495
Is the great Consort Kang bothered?

53
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:09,415
Oh, please. Why would I be?

54
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,003
Earlier, you said you prepared
a special residence for her.

55
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,422
It is not a <i>byeolgung</i>, is it?

56
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,966
BYEOLGUNG: SPECIAL RESIDENCE
FOR THE KING'S FUTURE BRIDE OR CONCUBINE

57
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:18,883
<i>Byeolgung</i>?

58
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:22,262
Or did you prepare a special residence
outside the palace?

59
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,514
Are you jealous?

60
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,392
Stop teasing me

61
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,936
and tell me what is happening.

62
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,563
Go on.

63
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,484
Do not worry.

64
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,237
Her residence

65
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,657
is much more special than a <i>byeolgung</i>.

66
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,086
You know,

67
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,338
I didn't expect a five-star hotel,

68
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,882
but this is what he meant
by "special residence"?

69
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,761
He meant a tiny prison
in the corner of the palace.

70
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,472
He even has a prison in the palace.

71
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,058
What an amazing guy, huh?

72
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,893
These may be mourning clothes,

73
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,480
but at least they gave us clean clothes
and let us bathe.

74
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,650
We survived the ordeal,
so let us be satisfied with that.

75
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,360
You're right.

76
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,529
We did survive.

77
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,490
So far, that is.

78
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:32,206
COURSE N° 3 HAUTE CUISINE

79
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,584
The prison?

80
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:39,213
He acts extremely strangely
for someone who wants to kill her.

81
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:42,508
I am certain His Majesty
took an interest in that wench.

82
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,344
It is nothing but a fleeting curiosity,
Your Grace.

83
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,180
It is also odd how he calls her a <i>gwinyeo.</i>

84
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:50,349
She surely did not just fall from the sky.
Where on earth did she come from?

85
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,644
Find out all you can about that wench,
and spare no detail.

86
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,146
How they met,

87
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,440
and how she caught His Majesty's eye
at the Gyeonggi Governor's Office.

88
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:01,611
Would it not be faster
to inquire of the Chief Royal Secretary?

89
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,280
You are right. I forgot about Im Song-jae.

90
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,324
Shall I send word, Your Grace?

91
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,618
Yes. Let him know I wish to see him.

92
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:10,745
Also…

93
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,542
Send this to Grand Prince Jesan.

94
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:17,710
Yes, Your Grace.

95
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:27,053
ROYAL KITCHEN:
THE PLACE WHERE ROYAL MEALS ARE PREPARED

96
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,811
The medicinal herbs we got today
are nice and fresh.

97
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:41,067
EOM BONG-SIK
SEVENTH-RANK SENIOR COOK

98
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,862
Can you not pound that harder?

99
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,656
Do not waste a single grain of rice.

100
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,368
Watch the blade
so you do not cut yourself.

101
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,369
Yes, sir.

102
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:52,870
Cook Sim.

103
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:57,875
The batter needs more water.

104
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,876
Yes, sir.

105
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,630
- Cook Min.
- Yes?

106
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:05,424
This is not the color you want
your <i>buchimgae </i>to have.

107
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:08,678
Pan-fry them until they turn golden yellow
so they look appetizing.

108
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,596
- Yes, sir.
- Goodness me.

109
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:13,891
Let me have a look.

110
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,770
Look all you want.

111
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:24,110
By the way, have you all heard the news?

112
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:27,738
His Majesty returned to the palace
with some <i>gwinyeo</i>.

113
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,323
A <i>ginyeo</i>?

114
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,452
What courtesan house is she from
that His Majesty fancied her?

115
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,872
Gosh, you fool.
He said "<i>gwinyeo</i>," not "<i>ginyeo</i>."

116
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:40,042
It is a ghost
who took the form of a woman.

117
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,753
Yes, Cook Sim is right.

118
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,923
His Majesty brought back a ghostly woman.

119
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:51,137
Is it not time that you stopped caring
about palace rumors?

120
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,305
Do you not have work to do?

121
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,641
It would be strange and wrong not to know

122
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,977
about a rumor on everyone's mind
at the palace.

123
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,688
Is it because you came from the kitchen
in Waegwan, a Japanese village?

124
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,983
You have a closed and narrow mind.

125
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:09,155
I see now. It is because you are
a third-generation cook

126
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:12,200
that you are so sensitive
about palace rumors.

127
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,744
Did you not know, Cook Maeng?

128
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,662
The Grand Royal Queen Dowager's
Senior Court Lady Kim

129
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,998
and Cook Eom
are more than just acquainted.

130
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:22,084
That is how he is the first to know
what is going on in the palace.

131
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,712
That is why the Grand Royal Queen Dowager

132
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,006
will support him as the next chief royal--

133
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:30,635
You fool. Will you shut your mouth?

134
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,512
What if someone were to hear?

135
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,433
There is no one here to hear but us.

136
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,727
Did you drink again last night?

137
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,312
Stop drinking so much!

138
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:46,484
Anyway, I believe you will be
the next chief royal cook.

139
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:50,821
We never know.

140
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:54,158
It could be Cook Maeng for all you know.

141
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,911
It has not been long since the former
chief royal cook passed away,

142
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:59,997
and you are already discussing
his replacement?

143
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,667
Watch what you say
if you wish to at least stay

144
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,252
and eat His Majesty's leftovers.

145
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,880
What is wrong with talking about
something that came up already?

146
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,591
Are you disgruntled that you will not be
the next chief royal cook?

147
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,510
That is enough, Cook Sim.

148
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:15,429
Why would you taunt Cook Maeng like that?

149
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,014
So what if he is upset?

150
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,391
It is the truth.

151
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,476
He can try all he wants,

152
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,437
but you, Cook Eom,
should head the royal kitchen next.

153
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,231
You never know.

154
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,694
Greetings, Eunuch Yoon.

155
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,821
Her Grace Consort Kang

156
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,907
believes Cook Maeng is the best cook.

157
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,158
Speaking of,

158
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,745
the former chief royal cook
passed over a fortnight ago.

159
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,248
It is time His Majesty
appointed a replacement.

160
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,584
Yes, that is true.

161
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:45,668
Greetings, all.

162
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,798
My lady.

163
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:54,010
Please speak, Head Senior Court Lady Kim.

164
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,015
The Grand Royal Queen Dowager

165
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,100
would like <i>hangwa, </i>rice confections,
as a snack.

166
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,476
Consort Kang requested <i>samhapjuk,</i>

167
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,146
porridge with three ingredients,
for her late-night refreshment.

168
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,316
- Yes, my lady.
- Yes, my lady.

169
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,032
Do not waste the ingredients.

170
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,492
- Yes, of course not.
- We will not.

171
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,411
<i>He brought back a </i>gwinyeo<i>?</i>

172
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,329
<i>On top of that,</i>

173
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:24,915
he punished Gyeonggi Governor
Hong Gyeong-dal for high treason?

174
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,921
I have a bad feeling about this.

175
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,423
Governor Hong?

176
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,884
He is the one who compared Consort Kang

177
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,011
to Yang Guifei, Tang Dynasty Emperor
Xuanzong's consort, is he not?

178
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,804
Yes, that is him.

179
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,686
<i>Is His Majesty</i>

180
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:50,775
<i>truly acting out of personal vengeance?</i>

181
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,987
Where is Consort Kang?

182
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,495
It is her. <i>Gwinyeo.</i>

183
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:06,040
<i>I have prepared</i>
<i>a special residence for you.</i>

184
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,542
<i>A </i>gwinyeo?

185
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,169
<i>There is no way His Majesty</i>

186
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:13,339
<i>would bring someone like her</i>
<i>unless she has connections.</i>

187
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,757
<i>Who could it be?</i>

188
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,135
Your Grace,
the Chief Royal Secretary is here.

189
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,220
Let him enter.

190
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:31,857
Your Grace,
I hope you have been in good health.

191
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,568
I have. Thank you for your concern.

192
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:39,031
I heard you failed to bring Mi-hyang
for the <i>chaehong</i> in the end.

193
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,074
I did.

194
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,452
However, her grandfather Governor Hong
has been exiled, as you wished,

195
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,913
and his family has become
government-owned slaves.

196
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:46,997
Then,

197
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:50,167
why did you return with that <i>gwinyeo</i>?

198
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,045
Oh, that girl?

199
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,714
That was His Majesty's decision.

200
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,466
I know nothing about it,

201
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,844
so I am afraid
I have no explanation for you, Your Grace.

202
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,058
<i>I see. So it was you.</i>

203
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,605
His Majesty made a decision
that even you were not privy to.

204
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:12,940
That is shocking.

205
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,360
I heard she is a good cook.

206
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,404
However, she is nothing but a cook.

207
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:21,198
I believe this is not worthy
of your concern, Your Grace.

208
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,159
Is that so?

209
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:25,911
What did you bring me?

210
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,664
This is jewelry confiscated
from Governor Hong's residence.

211
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,088
Is this all you collected
on this round of the <i>chaehong</i>?

212
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,134
Of course not.

213
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:43,596
Once we finish organizing
the slaves and property deeds--

214
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,139
Locate Governor Hong's family

215
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,725
that have become slaves
and send them all to Jahongwon.

216
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:51,187
If you go that far,
the officials will oppose.

217
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,647
There are already talks
about Governor Hong's exile.

218
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,608
That is exactly why.

219
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:58,652
You should be smart and quick
to act before I instruct you

220
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,489
if you do not want
any issues in the future.

221
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,828
Are you certain
that would not pose a problem?

222
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,079
I am certain indeed.

223
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:12,833
How dare you question me
after neglecting your duties?

224
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,044
If that is what you wish,

225
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,087
I will do as you say.

226
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:20,007
This is what you have always done.

227
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,051
Yes, Your Grace.

228
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,261
I will obey.

229
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:26,931
<i>Father.</i>

230
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,558
It seems to be time
to come up with a new plan.

231
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,268
What do you mean by that?

232
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,813
Consort Kang
has abused His Majesty's favor

233
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,858
to treat us
like her personal servants for years.

234
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,860
How dare she order me,
a third-rank senior official, around

235
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,779
when she is merely
a fourth-rank junior consort?

236
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,531
Watch your mouth!

237
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,785
Have you forgotten
that we are in the palace?

238
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,287
If living in this luxury
were a servant's life,

239
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,082
I would willingly be one
for hundreds of decades.

240
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,000
If you insist on being a servant,

241
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,503
how about we switch masters this time?

242
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,338
You do not mean that <i>gwinyeo</i>, do you?

243
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:00,756
Do not be ridiculous!

244
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,761
His Majesty does not care for any woman
other than Consort Kang.

245
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,304
Even that sly nine-tailed fox

246
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,974
is of low birth if you think about it.

247
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:13,018
Who is to say a <i>gwinyeo</i>
cannot become like Consort Kang?

248
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,229
How will you handle the consequences?

249
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,607
I have arranged a new playground
for His Majesty.

250
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,693
You will soon see for yourself

251
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:23,320
who His Majesty's heart is leaning toward.

252
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,890
Who are you?

253
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,641
If we get caught, we all die.

254
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,270
Do not make a sound.

255
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,315
The keys?

256
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,488
Come on.

257
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,544
The criminals escaped.
Search the palace thoroughly!

258
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,545
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

259
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,017
The criminals escaped. Find the <i>gwinyeo</i>!

260
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,145
Let's go.

261
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,276
What are we doing
in the middle of the night?

262
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,159
Look at the sky.

263
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:53,285
My gosh.

264
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,371
It is so beautiful.

265
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,627
They reported
that the <i>gwinyeo </i>has escaped.

266
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,755
It seems that His Majesty
is making his way to that place.

267
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,264
Let us go!

268
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,686
<i>Here it goes!</i>

269
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,232
<i>This is fun!</i>

270
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,277
<i>Come and play!</i>

271
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,782
<i>This is great!</i>

272
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,036
<i>Come on!</i>

273
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:41,583
<i>This is fun!</i>

274
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,711
<i>Come on!</i>

275
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,423
<i>This is great fun!</i>

276
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,059
Gil-geum, who are all these people?

277
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,602
I have no idea.

278
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,689
They look like performers,
but why are they here?

279
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,567
And where did that man go?

280
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,152
Everyone is wearing the same mask,

281
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,154
- so I can't tell who's who.
- I think this is the man.

282
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,077
My gosh!

283
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,499
So,

284
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,710
did you enjoy the moonlit stroll?

285
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,298
What are you doing?

286
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,884
- You said you'd help us escape!
- Exactly!

287
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,302
Will you let us go now?

288
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:35,804
Let you go?

289
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,732
Your Majesty.

290
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,150
Your Majesty…

291
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:56,200
I prepared this performance
especially for you.

292
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,577
I wonder if you enjoyed it.

293
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,663
Wait, then who was the masked guy
from earlier?

294
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,248
You there, Gong-gil.

295
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,628
Everyone, stop!

296
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,218
Do you mean him?

297
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,887
What? You were in on it together?

298
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,597
You did well today, as usual.

299
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,766
It is my pleasure, Your Majesty.

300
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:29,733
GONG-GIL
YEONHUIGUN'S JESTER WITH MANY SECRETS

301
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,906
Oh my, look at that scoundrel.

302
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:39,576
He is very tall and handsome.

303
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,954
That's not the point, Gil-geum.

304
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,580
He tricked us.

305
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:47,167
I would willingly
be deceived by him again.

306
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,044
- What got into you?
- This man

307
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,589
is an actor I cherish greatly.

308
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,007
His name is Gong-gil.

309
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,175
He's an actor?

310
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:58,971
Yes. His mask dance, Cheoyongmu,
is simply exquisite, is it not?

311
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,348
Yes, it is.

312
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,267
You may go now.

313
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,937
Were you entertained, Your Majesty?

314
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,357
I was much more entertained tonight
than usual.

315
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:14,987
Here you go!

316
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:24,121
Thank you for your generosity,
Your Majesty!

317
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:31,170
Tonight, we shall drink
until we cannot see straight!

318
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,423
Let us go and drink!

319
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,638
Let us go!

320
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,599
- My word.
- Wait.

321
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,851
Where did I hear
the name "Gong-gil" before?

322
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,688
The court jester, Gong-gil.
The movie <i>The King and the Clown</i>!

323
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,858
I have heard rumors about him,

324
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:55,777
but he certainly brings joy to the eye.

325
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,823
Get a grip, Gil-geum.

326
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,575
We are eating meat today!

327
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:04,745
- Come along!
- Let us play some more!

328
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,455
Have some fun!

329
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,592
<i>I was struck by an assassin's arrow</i>
<i>in Salgoji Forest.</i>

330
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,469
<i>Discreetly find out who was behind it.</i>

331
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,100
Why are you going this far?

332
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,310
For fun.

333
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,395
Why do you ask?

334
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,439
Did you not enjoy it?

335
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:35,817
You put way too much effort
into simply having fun,

336
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,611
that I didn't even have the chance
to be entertained.

337
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:39,488
If you try to run away again,

338
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,742
I will not let you off with a smile.

339
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:49,248
All will be well as long as you don't send
that masked fool.

340
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,415
How dare you.

341
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,501
Must you always have the final word?

342
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:55,587
Do you truly not wish to live anymore?

343
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,216
Guards! Is the iron nice and hot?

344
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,509
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

345
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,147
You said this was just for fun.

346
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,858
I told you to control your temper.

347
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,278
That wouldn't have made any difference.

348
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:22,906
I knew it would get us in trouble one day.

349
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,616
Start with her.

350
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,493
- Me?
- What?

351
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,288
- Miss!
- Wait.

352
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,872
Gil-geum!

353
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,208
Miss!

354
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,127
Gil-geum!

355
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,087
Miss!

356
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,841
- Miss!
- Oh no.

357
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,137
Miss.

358
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,305
Your Majesty.

359
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,975
Please hear us out.

360
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:52,561
You were so insolent just a moment ago.

361
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,187
Did you change your mind?

362
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,106
Insolent? Who, me?

363
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:59,651
I will never run away again.

364
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,445
Will that do?

365
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,447
You will not?

366
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,700
That is good to hear.

367
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:10,245
It would have been a shame
to let you go like this.

368
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,040
Release the girl.

369
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:14,458
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

370
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,971
Your Majesty.

371
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:31,683
Will you send us back to prison now?

372
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,477
Of course not.

373
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:37,481
I am extremely famished right now.

374
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,233
Prepare me something to eat.

375
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:42,569
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

376
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,572
<i>So he still wants my food, huh?</i>

377
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:50,744
Miss, hurry up and answer him.

378
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:53,747
Okay.

379
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,832
I'll get to it right away.

380
00:22:56,958 --> 00:23:00,045
But I must make a request first.

381
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:01,797
A request, you say?

382
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:07,260
Let Gil-geum be my assistant cook.

383
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,887
I cannot manage on my own.

384
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,311
Very well.

385
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:17,896
In return,

386
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:21,525
I expect you to cook with all your heart
and do your absolute best.

387
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,318
It will take much more
than the boiled beef you made

388
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,987
back at the Gyeonggi Governor's Office
to satisfy me.

389
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:33,662
Is there a particular dish you'd like,
Your Majesty?

390
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,164
A dish I would like?

391
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:41,795
"Those who seek to live will die,
and those who seek to die shall live."

392
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:45,423
If you serve what you did before
to save your life,

393
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,092
you will die.

394
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,010
If you cook something new
with your life on the line,

395
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,096
you will live.

396
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:55,142
Only if the food satisfies me, that is.

397
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,413
Miss.

398
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:20,542
I am pleased
to finally enter the royal kitchen,

399
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,002
but will we be all right?

400
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:23,795
No.

401
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:25,797
Gil-geum.

402
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,551
I'm going to do whatever it takes
to survive and go home.

403
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,722
I'm going to reunite with my dad,

404
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,101
and I'm going to eat with him…

405
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,687
You must stay strong,
especially at times like this.

406
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,107
I will also do whatever it takes
to survive

407
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,319
and become the senior court lady
of the royal kitchen.

408
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:51,072
Okay, Gil-geum.

409
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,700
I will try to stay strong.

410
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:57,621
Oh dear, miss.

411
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,206
I can't believe this.

412
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,667
Oh my, miss, what is the matter?

413
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,629
Why are you crying? Are you all right?

414
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,716
Stop crying.

415
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,635
Thank you, Gil-geum.

416
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,391
I aced a cooking competition, you know.

417
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:19,976
You faced it?

418
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,686
I mean, I got the highest score.

419
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,856
The harder the mission, the better I do.

420
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,941
So don't worry.

421
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,734
You are so amazing.

422
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,028
Let's do this.

423
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,154
Yes, we can do this.

424
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:34,950
Pardon? Let a woman prepare
the royal meal?

425
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,327
You are taking your joke too far,
Chief Eunuch.

426
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,453
CHANG-SEON
CHIEF EUNUCH OF ROYAL FOOD

427
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:41,498
CHIEF EUNUCH OF ROYAL FOOD:
THE HEAD OF THE ROYAL KITCHEN EUNUCHS

428
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:43,375
What can I say?

429
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,502
It was His Majesty's command.

430
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,797
Is the Grand Royal Queen Dowager
aware of this?

431
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,090
Silence.

432
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:52,509
The Chief Eunuch came in person.

433
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,928
Do you not understand
the gravity of the situation?

434
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:58,056
But a woman can work as a maid
in the royal kitchen

435
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:00,225
or a court lady on palace grounds.

436
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,018
I can tell at a glance

437
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:05,480
that your roots differ
from those of the cooks here.

438
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:07,065
Where did you learn to cook?

439
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:08,775
At an entertainment house
like Myeongwolgwan?

440
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:16,616
Well, the place I worked at

441
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,537
is quite far away from here,
so you wouldn't know even if I told you.

442
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,039
Are you from Sichuan in Ming? Or Waegwan?

443
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,374
Where?

444
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,668
Did you learn to cook
in some barbarian country?

445
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:30,046
No. Well, I was--

446
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,798
You are all so harsh.

447
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:35,844
Why are you questioning things
when it is His Majesty's command?

448
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:48,356
Hey, wait.

449
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,733
- Excuse me?
- Wait up.

450
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:54,321
My gosh. You people are so unfriendly.

451
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:57,657
You know what?
This is how things should be in a kitchen.

452
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,326
All right then.

453
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,828
How about we get warmed up?

454
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:12,422
Chief Eunuch,
allow me to apologize on behalf of them.

455
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:14,716
His Majesty has specifically asked
for that cook,

456
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,469
so be sure
to let the other cooks know of this.

457
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:18,845
Yes, Chief Eunuch.

458
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,474
Goodbye.

459
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,159
They have a great fire going.

460
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:44,913
There are so many of them.

461
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:52,504
Wait. This is it?

462
00:27:57,675 --> 00:28:00,512
I'll substitute cassia bark for cinnamon

463
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:03,473
and <i>myoga</i> for onions.

464
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:06,393
Cassia bark for cinnamon

465
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,686
and <i>myoga</i> for onions?

466
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:09,646
Yeah.

467
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:10,730
They don't have them here,

468
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,899
but those are popular ingredients
used in the future.

469
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,067
Oh, the future?

470
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,860
Okay. Let's do this.

471
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:16,778
Let us do this.

472
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,116
Miss.

473
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:24,577
I smell raw meat somewhere.

474
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:25,703
Raw meat?

475
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,706
I don't smell anything.

476
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,717
You really have the nose of a dog.

477
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,351
Why would you taste that
without knowing what it is?

478
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,105
- It's not beef.
- What?

479
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:53,648
Deer?

480
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,066
Is it deer meat?

481
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,486
Mister, was there deer meat here?

482
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,821
Deer?

483
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,114
Oh, right.

484
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:04,325
The deer His Majesty hunted yesterday
was cleaned and sent

485
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,869
to Saongwon, Office of Royal Meals.

486
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,749
Deer meat…

487
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:13,543
What is it, miss?

488
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,672
- Gil-geum.
- Yes?

489
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,841
Deer steak is my specialty.

490
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,885
Deer stack?

491
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,052
Take note of the recipe.

492
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,555
First of all…

493
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,488
Is this how you will serve the food?

494
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:26,115
- Yes.
- This is a disaster.

495
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,868
Quickly set two tables,
one for His Majesty and one for tasting.

496
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:29,953
- Yes, sir.
<i>- So?</i>

497
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:33,498
Are you saying the woman His Majesty
brought back took over the royal kitchen?

498
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:36,417
Yes, exactly.
Do you think this is acceptable?

499
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,336
This is so unfair.

500
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,295
My goodness!

501
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,799
What did you just say?

502
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:45,134
His Majesty brought back a <i>gwinyeo</i>

503
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,470
and sent her to the royal kitchen?

504
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,388
Yes.

505
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:52,308
She is preparing a meal with the meat
from the deer His Majesty caught.

506
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:53,268
What?

507
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,061
Deer meat?

508
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,195
The <i>gwinyeo</i> was appointed
as a special cook?

509
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,490
Are you saying she really cooks?

510
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:08,908
Yes, Your Grace.

511
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:12,579
Do you know
what His Majesty made her cook?

512
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,163
I do not.

513
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:17,709
But how could a woman possibly prepare
a decent royal meal?

514
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:20,378
The result is as clear as day.

515
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:23,798
He is extremely picky and sensitive
when it comes to food.

516
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,593
I cannot believe it.

517
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:28,386
From what I heard,

518
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,638
the <i>gwinyeo</i> cooked
at the Gyeonggi Governor's Office,

519
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,515
and His Majesty enjoyed it.

520
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,559
At the Gyeonggi Governor's Office?

521
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,603
She cooked there?

522
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:37,520
Yes, Your Grace.

523
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:41,107
However, it is highly unlikely
that a woman has properly learned to cook.

524
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,902
She will not last long just by knowing
how to make a few decent side dishes.

525
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,279
After the <i>gwinyeo</i> finishes cooking,

526
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:48,114
you must see for yourself.

527
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:50,658
Find whatever fault or flaw you can.

528
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,702
Yes, Your Grace.

529
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:59,042
- Chu-wol.
- Yes, Your Grace.

530
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,172
Is His Majesty in his chambers?

531
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,423
Yes, Your Grace.

532
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:08,509
I must see him immediately.
Let us get ready.

533
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,928
Yes, Your Grace.

534
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,730
<i>Change into this.</i>

535
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:22,023
GANGNYEONGJEON

536
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,358
<i>What? Into these clothes?</i>

537
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,526
Hurry up. Walk faster.

538
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,197
Hurry up.

539
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,281
Now stand here.

540
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,367
The food is getting cold.

541
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,868
- Right.
- Let me see.

542
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:37,914
You are ready.

543
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:38,998
Stand over there.

544
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:41,960
Your Majesty.

545
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,253
Your <i>seoksura</i>, evening meal, is ready.

546
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,130
Bring it in.

547
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:04,649
<i>Why is a grown man not dressed properly?</i>

548
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,110
<i>Relax.</i>

549
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:17,745
CHOI MAL-IM
KING'S SENIOR COURT LADY

550
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,125
Oh, right.

551
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:36,014
I see you brought the food.

552
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:43,980
<i>Stay alert.</i>

553
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,940
<i>He might be Joseon's worst tyrant,</i>

554
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,900
<i>but I know history.</i>

555
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,569
<i>It's okay. Don't be nervous.</i>

556
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:50,945
What are you doing?

557
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,613
Explain the <i>eoseon</i>.

558
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:53,698
EOSEON: MEAL PREPARED FOR THE KING

559
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:01,539
Your Majesty.

560
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:05,460
This is a meal rooted in the royal cuisine
of the Palace of Versailles,

561
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:08,087
known as haute cuisine,
or traditional French cooking.

562
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:10,882
FRENCH GOURMET COURSE MEAL

563
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,843
"Trench"? "Oat sheen"?

564
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:18,222
It's pronounced "haute cuisine."

565
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:34,363
First, I prepared an hors d'oeuvre
to boost your appetite.

566
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:37,617
<i>It's steak tartare topped</i>
<i>with various vegetables and raw egg yolk</i>

567
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,702
<i>served with kelp chips.</i>

568
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,746
"Older"?

569
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,248
"Taro taro"?

570
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,586
<i>I have never seen raw meat</i>
<i>shaped this way.</i>

571
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,838
Steak tartare

572
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,715
is truly an older dish.

573
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,052
Are you mocking me?

574
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:57,553
Would I dare?

575
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:04,060
Do you suggest I eat this first?

576
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:06,646
You should eat that with this.

577
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:09,982
This tastes best
when mixed right before you eat it.

578
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,886
This is what we call "tableside service."

579
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,722
Watching and enjoying
the food being prepared before your eyes

580
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,349
stimulates the appetite.

581
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:51,357
Please try it.

582
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:54,902
Taste the food.

583
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:55,820
Yes, Your Majesty.

584
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:14,839
Please try it.

585
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,356
<i>Wait.</i>

586
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,317
<i>What is this taste?</i>

587
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,891
<i>It is the same raw meat I have had,</i>

588
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:09,268
<i>but this tastes richer and sweeter.</i>

589
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,231
How interesting.

590
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:16,442
How should I describe it?

591
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:18,945
It is powerful but shy,

592
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,989
and it leaves a lingering taste
on my tongue.

593
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,953
Next is the potage.

594
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:31,624
I made a thick milk porridge with peas.

595
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,337
"Botage"?

596
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,971
It has a peculiar color and aroma.

597
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:48,349
What is more important
when it comes to food, Your Majesty?

598
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,643
The taste or the aroma?

599
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:51,811
Would it not be the taste?

600
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:53,729
I believe the aroma is more important.

601
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:55,856
Why is that?

602
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,233
When it comes to taste,

603
00:37:57,316 --> 00:38:00,152
you can only sense the five basic types,
which are bitter, sour, sweet,

604
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:01,362
spicy, and salty.

605
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,489
But aromas are countless and diverse.

606
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,826
You have a point.

607
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,537
Yes, Your Majesty.

608
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:11,956
Allow me.

609
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:05,968
This aroma is not extravagant,

610
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:09,096
but it is subtle and fresh

611
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:11,599
and has a clean taste.

612
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:15,561
Like peas glistening in the morning sun

613
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,980
<i>and bursting out of the pods one by one.</i>

614
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:19,857
Right?

615
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:21,692
That was very well said.

616
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:23,569
That is truly astute.

617
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:27,114
Now, it is time for the main dish.

618
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:32,370
The highlight of haute cuisine, <i>viande</i>.

619
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:35,206
THE MAIN COURSE, A MEAT DISH

620
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,920
The behind of oat sheen?

621
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,880
For goodness' sake.

622
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,423
What should I do with you?

623
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,473
It feels like you are mocking me again.

624
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,642
This is also just raw meat.

625
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:58,938
This is deer tongue.

626
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:00,815
It's not meant to be eaten raw.

627
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,067
I'll grill it for you here.

628
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:11,075
Slightly grilling both sides
on a charcoal fire

629
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:15,287
enhances the texture
as well as the flavor and aroma.

630
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:19,417
<i>I have eaten deer</i>
<i>prepared in various ways,</i>

631
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,628
<i>but this is a method</i>
<i>I have never seen before.</i>

632
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:26,048
Historically speaking,
deer represented the king,

633
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:29,218
and its tongue was considered
one of the eight delicacies,

634
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:31,011
a very rare ingredient to come by.

635
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,471
I am surprised
that you know of such a thing.

636
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:35,641
That's why the fight for royal power
is called <i>chukrok</i>, no?

637
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:36,934
CHUKROK: CHASING THE DEER

638
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,352
You are quite intelligent.

639
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:48,946
<i>Her skill is beyond anything of this time.</i>

640
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:52,241
<i>Where in the world</i>
<i>did this woman come from?</i>

641
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:58,414
<i>An unquenchable desire for power,</i>
<i>extreme narcissism,</i>

642
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,499
<i>and an acute sense of taste.</i>

643
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:03,752
<i>This is the best meal to satisfy</i>

644
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,546
<i>all of Yeonhuigun's desires.</i>

645
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,757
Where did you learn to make all this?

646
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,969
I know it's hard to believe,

647
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,847
but as I told you before,
I'm from the future.

648
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:16,640
I'm serious.

649
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:24,482
It is truly a shame
that you are still not in your right mind.

650
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,442
I would believe you
if you said you were from

651
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:29,111
a distant barbarian land or an island.

652
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:31,906
Nonetheless,

653
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,283
I am pleased…

654
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,454
with the first royal meal you served.

655
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:43,209
I'm glad you at least like my food.

656
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:48,297
Your Majesty, I will taste the food.

657
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,423
No.

658
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,344
You taste it this time.

659
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:55,262
Pardon? Me?

660
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:02,603
Okay, sure.

661
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,087
DEPOSED QUEEN YEON
YI HEON'S BIRTH MOTHER

662
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,130
Now, you have a bite, Crown Prince.

663
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,222
<i>It is delicious, Mother.</i>

664
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:45,729
Now,

665
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,774
give me a piece.

666
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:50,109
Pardon?

667
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:56,782
Are you asking me to feed you?

668
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:58,367
Do you not want to?

669
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,495
No, it's not that.

670
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,967
How did you see into my heart?

671
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,094
Sorry?

672
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,804
How did you know

673
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,349
I would like this dish?

674
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,476
Actually…

675
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:09,188
I studied Yeonhuigun,

676
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:11,315
and I won a cooking competition
with this dish.

677
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:14,777
I never imagined
I'd get to serve it to you in person.

678
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,196
How fascinating.

679
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:18,947
Yeonhuigun?

680
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,700
You mentioned that name before.

681
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,452
Who in the world is this Yeonhuigun?

682
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:26,914
<i>Wait, telling him the story</i>
<i>would be too risky.</i>

683
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,418
Well, you see…

684
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,671
I can't quite remember right now.

685
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:41,387
Let me rephrase my question.

686
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:45,349
Why did you decide to serve this meal?

687
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:46,517
Oh, well…

688
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,728
I thought about your meals

689
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:53,857
and thought it'd be nice to serve
what kings in other countries eat.

690
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:57,236
In Europe, kings eat
course meals like this all the time.

691
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:58,904
"Yuleop"?

692
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,116
Is that another name
for the Nanman people?

693
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,617
The Nanman people?

694
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:09,331
Is "Nanman" the Joseon term for Europe?

695
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:16,255
Announce my arrival.

696
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:18,048
You cannot enter right now.

697
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:19,091
What did you say?

698
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:20,717
How dare you stop her?

699
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:21,969
Step aside.

700
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:25,848
Your Grace,
His Majesty is currently tasting

701
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:27,724
the new cook's food.

702
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:29,351
No one is allowed to enter.

703
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:43,407
You cannot, Your Grace.

704
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:44,700
How dare you!

705
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:46,577
Do you not fear the consequences?

706
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:49,705
- You cannot, Your Grace.
- Step aside!

707
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:51,290
What is this commotion outside?

708
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:53,208
I made it clear not to let anyone in.

709
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:58,922
Your Majesty, it is I, Consort Kang.

710
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:02,259
I brought you
a precious painting from Ming,

711
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:06,138
but I seem to have come at a bad time,
so I shall take my leave.

712
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:10,934
That would be best.
Return to your chambers.

713
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,950
I think it'd be best if I leave.

714
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:41,924
You are…

715
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,595
no ordinary woman.

716
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:54,603
<i>Okay, but there's no need</i>
<i>to come this close to my face.</i>

717
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,025
I have…

718
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:03,570
chosen you.

719
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:05,531
<i>For what?</i>

720
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:07,866
<i>Why would he choose me? What for?</i>

721
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:27,469
<i>Does choosing me mean…</i>

722
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,972
<i>No way. He didn't mean</i>
<i>granting a royal favor, did he?</i>

723
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:32,266
<i>No, that can't happen.</i>

724
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:36,436
<i>History will change</i>
<i>if I become the king's concubine.</i>

725
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,938
<i>This is driving me crazy.</i>

726
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,773
Why are you so deep in thought?

727
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:52,661
I summoned you
because I have an order for you.

728
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:54,871
<i>Of course, this is the palace cliché.</i>

729
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:56,081
<i>The king gives commands,</i>

730
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:57,874
<i>and the chief royal secretary</i>
<i>gives secret commands.</i>

731
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:02,004
- An order?
- Whenever you serve His Majesty,

732
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:04,673
tell me everything you learn from him.

733
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:07,426
<i>You want me to spy for you for free?</i>

734
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,972
I apologize, but realistically speaking,
that'd be difficult.

735
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,724
You know what His Majesty is like.

736
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:15,934
He'll kill everyone
if he were to find out,

737
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,185
and you see,

738
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,854
I'm chicken-hearted.

739
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:22,816
Don't take it to heart. It's not personal.

740
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:25,068
Do you not think you need an ally here?

741
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:27,070
Well, the more allies, the better.

742
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:29,698
When you were serving His Majesty
moments ago,

743
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,950
Consort Kang came by, did she not?

744
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,201
She did.

745
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:36,455
This was the first time
His Majesty sent her away

746
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:38,081
over a royal meal.

747
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,917
Naturally, Consort Kang
will keep a watch on you from now on.

748
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:42,002
<i>Just you.</i>

749
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,171
And then she will try to kill you.

750
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:46,465
That means, without help,

751
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:49,051
it will be extremely hard
for you to survive here.

752
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:52,471
<i>That's true.</i>
<i>It'd be hard for me to survive.</i>

753
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:54,389
<i>He does have great insight.</i>

754
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,642
<i>This sure is a deal befitting</i>
<i>a top-tier treacherous subject.</i>

755
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:59,186
I will support you in secret.

756
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,605
I will shield you and help you survive.

757
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:05,067
<i>But I don't need anyone</i>
<i>to support me in secret.</i>

758
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:06,735
<i>What I need is…</i>

759
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:15,160
In that case, I have a condition.

760
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:16,495
- A condition?
- Yes.

761
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:18,997
I need you to find something for me.

762
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:23,585
If you can promise me that you will,
I'll consider your offer.

763
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:26,213
Are you trying to negotiate with me?

764
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:28,590
Very well.
What is it that you are looking for?

765
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:31,051
- My handbag.
- "Handybag"?

766
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,803
- Yes, my handbag.
- "Handybag."

767
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,388
You know…

768
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:38,308
It's the thing you hang on your shoulder
and put things inside.

769
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,852
What do they call it in this era?

770
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:42,771
My handbag is shaped like this.

771
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:45,273
- It's called a handbag.
- A handbag.

772
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:46,692
A handbag that looks like this.

773
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:47,943
A bundle!

774
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:50,278
Yes, a bundle.

775
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:51,738
You mean your bundle.

776
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,782
Please find my bundle for me.

777
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:58,620
It went over the cliff in Salgoji Forest
the day I met His Majesty.

778
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:02,290
I need the bundle as it is

779
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:04,543
with everything inside.

780
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:08,797
Your bundle is all you want?

781
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:16,805
MANGUNROK

782
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:23,311
That will do. You can stop.

783
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:25,397
Yes, Your Grace.

784
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,941
How could His Majesty do this to me?

785
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:29,359
Shall I tell Cook Maeng

786
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,695
to chase the <i>gwinyeo</i>
from the royal kitchen?

787
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:33,321
If the cooks act coldly toward her,

788
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:35,949
she will not last a day.

789
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:39,661
That is a good idea.

790
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,373
Can you ensure
I will never have to see her again?

791
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:46,251
Yes, Your Grace. Leave it to Cook Maeng.

792
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,183
Dear heavens!

793
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:03,310
I have never tasted
anything like this before.

794
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,061
I cannot believe it.

795
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,855
<i>Gwinyeo!</i>

796
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:13,528
We cannot live under the same sky.

797
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:22,537
What's going on? Is the firewood damp?

798
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:25,999
This must be the territorial bullying
I have only heard of.

799
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,126
What is all this smoke?

800
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:32,297
Who is making such a mess in the kitchen?

801
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:33,298
My gosh.

802
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:36,510
What's his problem?

803
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:41,139
A snake! It's a snake!

804
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:43,809
- Gil-geum!
- What is it? What is the matter?

805
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:48,522
You sneaky little thing. I got you.

806
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:49,981
Just look at that snake!

807
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:54,069
All sorts of things are happening
with a woman in the royal kitchen.

808
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:57,197
Gosh, I'm so tired.

809
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:01,660
What are those?

810
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:06,623
No! Cockroaches!

811
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:08,792
Stay calm and let me handle this.

812
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,837
Where are they coming from?

813
00:52:15,131 --> 00:52:16,049
What are you looking at?

814
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:18,802
Oh my gosh, these people are crazy!

815
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:23,348
I see you had another long day.

816
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:24,808
- Indeed.
- Indeed.

817
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:40,699
Gil-geum.

818
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:45,829
I feel more at ease in here.

819
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:47,247
It feels like home.

820
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,124
I wish His Majesty

821
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:53,295
would just keep us here all day long.

822
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:55,839
Things will be better tomorrow.

823
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,091
To be honest,

824
00:52:58,174 --> 00:53:00,802
I wish tomorrow would not come.

825
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:04,681
The cooks are nastier than I expected.

826
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:06,182
Their bullying is on a whole other level.

827
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:09,060
Should I just tell on them to His Majesty?

828
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:11,229
They might all end up dead.

829
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,566
Your Majesty!

830
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:24,284
You're right.

831
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:25,869
It'd be disastrous.

832
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:28,580
That'd be wrong.

833
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:35,545
GANGNYEONGJEON

834
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:51,019
Your Majesty.

835
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:54,230
The Chief Royal Secretary is here.

836
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,281
What is all that?

837
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:05,075
I am reluctant to inform you,
Your Majesty,

838
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:06,493
that they are letters of resignation
from the ministers.

839
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:07,702
What?

840
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:11,039
What are their reasons?

841
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:13,708
They are expressing regret
about your absence

842
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:17,420
at the <i>gusikrye</i>, salvation ritual,
and the exile of Gyeonggi Governor Hong.

843
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:20,590
Is it a problem to punish a traitor
who committed a crime

844
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,051
against the king?

845
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:24,010
It is not that.

846
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,304
Since Governor Hong
has been exiled for high treason,

847
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:28,473
they are petitioning
for the execution of the<i> gwinyeo</i>

848
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:30,934
who was captured for the same crime.

849
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:36,272
It is only right that I decide
when a criminal is punished.

850
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:46,825
I will go to the hall of governance.

851
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:48,702
Chief Eunuch.

852
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,248
Bring Yeon Ji-young
to the hall of governance.

853
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:54,708
Yes, Your Majesty.

854
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:58,753
<i>- Your Majesty.</i>
<i>- Your Majesty.</i>

855
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:02,590
- We beg for your understanding.
- We beg for your understanding.

856
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:04,259
Your Majesty.

857
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:09,139
If Gyeonggi Governor Hong Gyeong-dal
was exiled for insulting you,

858
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:11,266
then it is only right that the <i>gwinyeo,</i>

859
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:14,853
who was captured for treason,
is sentenced to capital punishment.

860
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:19,607
Instead, the criminal was sent
to the royal kitchen to cook

861
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:21,693
when she should have been
punished severely.

862
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:24,029
That is outrageously unfair.

863
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:25,697
Enough.

864
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,868
I will not listen to any more of this.

865
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:32,579
The cunning woman has stayed alive

866
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:35,248
by deceiving both Your Majesty
and Hong Gyeong-dal,

867
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:38,752
thus causing all these events.

868
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:41,755
You all are going too far.

869
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:44,132
Do you think His Majesty

870
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:47,427
exiled Hong Gyeong-dal
just because of a mere <i>gwinyeo</i>?

871
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:52,057
Do you all truly not understand
His Majesty's intent?

872
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:55,518
The fact that you petition about
and speak of a treacherous subject

873
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:59,272
who insulted His Majesty
is truly a disgrace.

874
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:01,608
Second Minister of Works
and Chief Royal Secretary,

875
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:06,321
you two seem to speak as though you deeply
understand His Majesty's mind.

876
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:12,285
Your antics are an entertaining sight.

877
00:56:12,368 --> 00:56:13,661
Your Majesty.

878
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:16,873
We ask that you execute the <i>gwinyeo</i>
who was brought in for humiliating you

879
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:19,667
and rescind the penalty of exile
that you commanded

880
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:20,919
upon Governor Hong Gyeong-dal.

881
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:24,130
- Please consider our request.
- Please consider our request.

882
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:27,467
Do you desire a puppet

883
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:29,511
for a king?

884
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:35,475
Answer me!

885
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:38,561
Should I have let the man

886
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:41,981
who insulted and humiliated me be?

887
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:57,413
Yes.

888
00:56:58,331 --> 00:56:59,207
Very well.

889
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:02,043
I will gladly give a command.

890
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:08,216
Your Majesty.

891
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:12,053
We have brought Yeon Ji-young
of the royal kitchen.

892
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:19,727
<i>Well done.</i>

893
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:20,645
Thank you.

894
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:22,147
I did as you said, Your Grace,

895
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:24,941
and started the rumor
that Governor Hong Gyeong-dal's exile

896
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:26,401
was also the <i>gwinyeo</i>'s fault.

897
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:30,238
It spread like wildfire
throughout the palace.

898
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:31,489
Well done.

899
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:35,577
The<i> gwinyeo </i>will soon lose her life.

900
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,120
<i>Your Majesty,</i>

901
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:40,081
you must sentence the<i> gwinyeo</i>
to capital punishment

902
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:41,958
and restore order to the throne.

903
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:45,378
- Please restore order to the throne.
- Please restore order to the throne.

904
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,219
Heed my words.

905
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:55,722
Last night,

906
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:58,266
this woman served me a strange dish

907
00:57:58,349 --> 00:57:59,934
and confused my senses.

908
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:09,527
Therefore,

909
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:11,696
I command that she be immediately…

910
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:23,291
appointed as the chief royal cook!

911
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,001
What?

912
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:28,671
- What? The chief royal cook?
- The chief royal cook?

913
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:30,798
What?

914
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:34,511
Starting today,

915
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,888
you are to cook for me
every day without fail.

916
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:38,348
However,

917
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:40,475
if you ever serve the same dish
more than once,

918
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,061
or if it is not to my liking,

919
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,563
you will be sentenced to death.

920
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:53,112
As if that sly Consort Kang
was not enough,

921
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:55,114
he now favors a <i>gwinyeo</i>
from goodness knows where.

922
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:57,534
Not to mention how he coddles the woman.

923
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:59,744
We must get rid of her when we can.

924
00:59:01,412 --> 00:59:05,583
The Grand Royal Queen Dowager
will not just stand by and watch.

925
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:10,964
It was our chance to eliminate

926
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,049
the Grand Royal Queen Dowager's
Han family,

927
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:16,553
and His Majesty brought in another woman
whose roots we know nothing of.

928
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:19,764
We must drive her out at all costs.

929
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:21,849
His Majesty will soon see

930
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:24,018
just how troubled a nation becomes

931
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:26,354
when its king loses himself in women.

932
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,403
Please forgive me, Your Grace.

933
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:35,029
I did not expect things
to turn out this way.

934
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:38,116
His Majesty appointed her
as the chief royal cook himself,

935
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:40,159
so I cannot get involved right now.

936
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:47,834
It looks like

937
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:50,837
I will need someone else's help.

938
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:53,423
JAGYEONGJEON

939
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:56,259
To think that you came to visit,
Consort Kang.

940
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:58,219
A long life lets you witness wonders.

941
00:59:58,303 --> 00:59:59,887
I apologize, Your Royal Highness.

942
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:02,849
I will visit you more often.

943
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:04,684
You must have a reason

944
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,145
for coming all the way here.

945
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:08,646
What is it?

946
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:10,398
The truth is,

947
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:13,109
I am here to discuss the matter
regarding the <i>gwinyeo</i>.

948
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:14,861
<i>Gwinyeo?</i>

949
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:16,613
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

950
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:20,241
The cunning wench who is clouding
His Majesty's mind with her cooking skills

951
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:23,286
was appointed as the chief royal cook.

952
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,455
Like she is not cunning.

953
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:30,126
What is it that you wish to say?

954
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:32,462
She appeared on the day of the eclipse.

955
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:34,255
Also, the day she appeared,

956
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:37,967
His Majesty was shot
by an assassin's arrow.

957
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:38,885
What?

958
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:41,387
His Majesty was shot?

959
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:45,058
Why did you not inform me sooner?

960
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,727
His Majesty commanded my silence,

961
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:50,063
so I could not inform you.

962
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:51,314
However,

963
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:54,692
seeing that His Majesty went so far
as to make her the chief royal cook,

964
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:56,611
I could not simply stand by and watch,

965
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:59,280
which is why I came to see you,
Your Royal Highness.

966
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:03,826
No one knows of her roots or her past.

967
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:07,705
I am also bothered by her presence,

968
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:11,000
but I have no authority to interfere
with those in the royal kitchen.

969
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:12,960
I understand you do not.

970
01:01:14,712 --> 01:01:16,673
Then how about

971
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:20,343
you test the <i>gwinyeo</i>'s skills yourself,
Your Royal Highness?

972
01:01:20,968 --> 01:01:21,886
Test her?

973
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:24,847
That is a great idea.

974
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:29,060
If you test the <i>gwinyeo</i> and she proves
to be as good as she is rumored to be,

975
01:01:29,143 --> 01:01:31,396
that should quell
the ministers' opposition.

976
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:35,108
If she does not, we have the opportunity
to expel her from the palace.

977
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:40,071
I had heard a great deal

978
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:43,700
about the <i>gwinyeo</i>'s cooking skills

979
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:46,452
and was wondering
just how impressive it could be.

980
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:51,582
I await your command, Your Royal Highness.

981
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:57,422
I will prepare all that is necessary.

982
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,139
You can stay here now.

983
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:18,359
Miss.

984
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:20,361
There are walls.

985
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:22,780
My gosh. These are actual walls.

986
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:27,660
Gil-geum, the floor is heated.

987
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:32,832
Are those things over there the bedding?

988
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:34,083
Oh my!

989
01:02:35,376 --> 01:02:36,669
- Let me see.
- Oh dear.

990
01:02:38,379 --> 01:02:39,839
It is our bedding!

991
01:02:41,048 --> 01:02:43,259
Gil-geum, you've been through so much.

992
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:47,638
Things happened, but you became
the chief royal cook in the end.

993
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:49,140
It feels like a dream.

994
01:02:49,223 --> 01:02:52,477
Whatever the case,
they gave us a proper place to stay.

995
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,061
This is just great!

996
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:58,483
Who knew we would be treated
to such privilege?

997
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:01,402
Miss!

998
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:07,909
To be honest,
it was getting a bit tough for me.

999
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:10,745
I felt the same.

1000
01:03:10,828 --> 01:03:13,539
How did we end up
meeting that damned tyrant?

1001
01:03:14,415 --> 01:03:15,541
Miss.

1002
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:18,336
You promised to watch your mouth!

1003
01:03:18,419 --> 01:03:20,046
It's fine.

1004
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:22,632
There are walls. No one can hear us.

1005
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:23,883
They can't hear.

1006
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:26,761
You are right. There are walls.

1007
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:31,307
- My goodness.
- Cook Yeon.

1008
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:32,642
Come on out.

1009
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:39,565
Hello.

1010
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:42,276
Greetings.

1011
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:45,863
I congratulate you
on becoming the chief royal cook.

1012
01:03:47,406 --> 01:03:51,244
Wear those clothes and come
to the royal kitchen starting tomorrow.

1013
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:52,411
Clothes?

1014
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:54,247
Let me have a look.

1015
01:03:58,543 --> 01:04:00,545
Oh my, this is silk.

1016
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:03,714
It is incredibly pretty and fancy.

1017
01:04:04,715 --> 01:04:06,968
This is a female cook's uniform, right?

1018
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:09,053
When did you have this made?

1019
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:11,514
I will see you tomorrow then.

1020
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:13,975
Thank you, sir.

1021
01:04:14,058 --> 01:04:15,226
You too, Mister Eunuch Yoon.

1022
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:17,562
Thank you.

1023
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:19,772
Miss, let me carry that.

1024
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,691
- Let us go.
- It suits you so well.

1025
01:04:21,774 --> 01:04:23,776
- Is this how you wear it?
- Yes.

1026
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,365
She does not seem sane.

1027
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:30,825
Will it be all right?

1028
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:32,285
Watch what you say.

1029
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:34,453
How long have you been a eunuch?

1030
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:37,164
- Do not speak so freely.
- Yes, Chief Eunuch.

1031
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:42,086
There are court ladies and maids
in the royal kitchen.

1032
01:04:42,169 --> 01:04:45,089
- But a female chief royal cook?
- That is enough.

1033
01:04:45,172 --> 01:04:47,717
Did you not hear it was His Majesty

1034
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,802
who made a woman the chief royal cook?

1035
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:51,220
That may be the case,

1036
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:55,641
but I cannot allow the order
in our kitchen to hit rock bottom.

1037
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:57,560
What will you do then?

1038
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:01,063
If we cannot chase her away…

1039
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:05,484
we must make her leave voluntarily.

1040
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:26,088
I get to work at the royal kitchen
as a maid thanks to you.

1041
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:28,007
My wish came true.

1042
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:31,093
Yes. The first day at work
is always exciting.

1043
01:05:31,802 --> 01:05:35,473
I get to work at a palace kitchen,
so I guess it's not all that bad.

1044
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:37,725
Will it be all right, miss?

1045
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:40,937
What if the nasty cooks bully you
or act all territorial again?

1046
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:42,772
How will we handle that?

1047
01:05:42,855 --> 01:05:45,191
It wasn't <i>my</i> kitchen then.

1048
01:05:46,692 --> 01:05:48,069
Don't worry.

1049
01:05:48,152 --> 01:05:50,279
I won't let them walk over me now.

1050
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:58,204
Did you mix the salt and flour?

1051
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,957
That is what I am doing right now.

1052
01:06:04,418 --> 01:06:06,671
Cook Maeng, how are the knives looking?

1053
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:09,131
I completely dulled them all
on a whetstone.

1054
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:11,592
They will not even cut through tofu.

1055
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:13,219
Well done.

1056
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:16,389
Hide all the older sauces
and fermented pastes in the back.

1057
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:17,431
Yes, Cook Eom!

1058
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:21,435
Set aside the best cuts of meat!

1059
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:22,937
- Yes, Cook Eom!
- Yes, Cook Eom!

1060
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:35,533
Greetings, Chief Eunuch and Eunuch Yoon.

1061
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:38,661
You will have heard by now.

1062
01:06:38,744 --> 01:06:41,455
This is the new chief royal cook

1063
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:43,958
appointed by His Majesty the King.

1064
01:06:46,627 --> 01:06:47,920
Hello.

1065
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:51,048
We've met before, but I'd like to
formally introduce myself.

1066
01:06:51,716 --> 01:06:52,758
I'm Yeon Ji-young.

1067
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:58,806
And this is Seo Gil-geum,
who will assist me.

1068
01:06:58,889 --> 01:07:01,392
Nice to meet you all.

1069
01:07:04,645 --> 01:07:06,188
I will leave you to your work.

1070
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:08,607
Be sure to cook
and serve the meals without fail.

1071
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,192
Yes, Chief Eunuch.

1072
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:13,487
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1073
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:28,502
I do not know with what skill or talent

1074
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:31,589
a woman like you secured the position
of chief royal cook,

1075
01:07:31,672 --> 01:07:34,592
but do you know how much responsibility
that position carries?

1076
01:07:34,675 --> 01:07:36,677
The number of people who work
in this royal kitchen per shift is 195,

1077
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:39,889
and since there are two shifts,
that makes a total of 390 people.

1078
01:07:39,972 --> 01:07:43,059
You must lead them
without problem or fail,

1079
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:45,936
and that role belongs to
the sixth-rank junior cook.

1080
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:49,273
In other words,
that is what the chief royal cook does.

1081
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:53,402
He's so eloquent. I didn't miss a word.

1082
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:57,573
Anyway, 390 people?

1083
01:07:57,656 --> 01:08:01,660
You have more kitchen staff
than any of the top hotels.

1084
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:03,746
That's really impressive.

1085
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:05,748
"Hot tail"?

1086
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:06,791
What is that?

1087
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:10,836
Anyway, a novice like you

1088
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,047
cannot handle the responsibility.

1089
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:16,175
Before you get into huge trouble
and are humiliated,

1090
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:18,219
- you should just leave--
- Just a moment.

1091
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:24,558
Who is the highest-ranking person here?

1092
01:08:25,476 --> 01:08:26,310
Who might that be?

1093
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:32,066
Other than me, the chief royal cook.

1094
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:35,694
That would be me.

1095
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:38,572
I am Eom, the senior cook.

1096
01:08:39,156 --> 01:08:42,701
I cooked His Majesty's food
until you came along.

1097
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:45,329
Oh, I see. Cook Eom.

1098
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:48,999
Then…

1099
01:08:50,334 --> 01:08:53,420
I am Cook Maeng,
and I am mainly in charge of side dishes.

1100
01:08:57,341 --> 01:08:58,676
I am Cook Sim.

1101
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:01,887
I manage the fires and the seasonings.

1102
01:09:04,723 --> 01:09:05,766
I prepare

1103
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:07,017
- the rice--
- All right!

1104
01:09:07,601 --> 01:09:08,853
Now that the introductions are over,

1105
01:09:08,936 --> 01:09:11,647
let's get started on the royal meal.

1106
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:16,694
What is she saying?

1107
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:22,449
His Majesty will be furious
if you don't serve him on time.

1108
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:23,826
You know what he's like, right?

1109
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,745
What?

1110
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:28,664
Then what will you do?

1111
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:33,294
You are the chief royal cook.
Do your duty and instruct us!

1112
01:09:33,377 --> 01:09:35,546
How many side dishes and of what kind?

1113
01:09:35,629 --> 01:09:37,047
What meat goes in the soup

1114
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:39,758
- and what cardinal-colored ingredients--
- Oh, come on.

1115
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:41,886
What do I know about the royal kitchen?

1116
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:43,220
I'm just here

1117
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:47,057
because His Majesty plopped me here.

1118
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:48,475
What in the world is she saying?

1119
01:09:48,559 --> 01:09:49,685
Do your usual thing.

1120
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:53,564
Cook Eom and Cook Maeng
can take care of everything.

1121
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:59,195
Of course,
you two will take full responsibility too.

1122
01:09:59,278 --> 01:10:00,279
I'll stay out of it.

1123
01:10:01,655 --> 01:10:03,199
What utter nonsense is this?

1124
01:10:03,282 --> 01:10:06,493
Why should we be responsible
when we are not the chief royal cook?

1125
01:10:07,828 --> 01:10:10,456
I already told His Majesty

1126
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:12,666
that I won't be doing anything
for the time being

1127
01:10:14,251 --> 01:10:15,502
and will just observe.

1128
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:28,724
<i>If what she said is true,</i>

1129
01:10:28,807 --> 01:10:30,392
<i>this will be the day I die.</i>

1130
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:32,978
<i>There is no way</i>
<i>His Majesty would allow that.</i>

1131
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:35,439
<i>But she does not seem to be lying.</i>

1132
01:10:40,027 --> 01:10:43,280
- Cook Min, sharpen the knives!
- Yes, coming!

1133
01:10:43,364 --> 01:10:45,074
Get the meat for the soup!

1134
01:10:45,157 --> 01:10:47,576
- The best quality meat!
- I am on it!

1135
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:48,494
Hurry.

1136
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:52,998
Hurry! Where are the sauces
and pastes we hid?

1137
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:55,417
Miss, that was amazing. Good!

1138
01:10:57,169 --> 01:10:58,087
Well done.

1139
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:01,674
I've been through these kinds of things
countless times.

1140
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:03,050
It won't work on me.

1141
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:06,762
What brings you here, Lady Kim?

1142
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:11,225
- Will you move it?
- Okay.

1143
01:11:12,726 --> 01:11:13,811
Cook Yeon.

1144
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:17,982
Yes?

1145
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:20,442
The Grand Royal Queen Dowager
wishes to see you.

1146
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:22,528
The Grand Royal Queen Dowager?

1147
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:26,156
Why would she want to see me?

1148
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:38,377
<i>What's with this suffocating atmosphere?</i>

1149
01:11:39,753 --> 01:11:43,424
Are you the <i>gwinyeo</i>
that His Majesty brought to the palace

1150
01:11:43,507 --> 01:11:44,967
and appointed as the chief royal cook?

1151
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:52,266
I'm not a <i>gwinyeo</i>.

1152
01:11:52,349 --> 01:11:54,977
I just come from a faraway place.

1153
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:56,687
I will get straight to the point.

1154
01:11:56,770 --> 01:11:58,647
As His Majesty's grandmother,

1155
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:01,984
I summoned you to check
if your skills are genuine.

1156
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:04,278
Check my skills?

1157
01:12:04,361 --> 01:12:07,948
If you captivated His Majesty's tongue
with some shallow tricks,

1158
01:12:09,074 --> 01:12:10,659
you must pay the price.

1159
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:14,872
<i>Jeez, what price</i>
<i>do I have to pay this time?</i>

1160
01:12:15,956 --> 01:12:17,124
Ma'am.

1161
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:21,170
I mean…

1162
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:23,172
Your Royal Highness.

1163
01:12:23,255 --> 01:12:25,674
What exactly is the price to pay?

1164
01:12:26,258 --> 01:12:29,595
If you deceive a king with your tongue,
then you must lose your tongue.

1165
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:31,597
If you deceive a king with your food,

1166
01:12:32,222 --> 01:12:33,057
you must lose an arm.

1167
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:34,725
What?

1168
01:12:35,809 --> 01:12:37,811
Well…

1169
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:39,813
How do you plan to check my skills?

1170
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:44,568
I will have you compete
against the senior cooks,

1171
01:12:44,651 --> 01:12:45,486
so prepare yourself.

1172
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:50,032
Are you saying that I have to risk my arm,
which is everything to a cook…

1173
01:12:51,241 --> 01:12:53,160
for this competition?

1174
01:12:54,953 --> 01:12:56,288
I see you understood.

1175
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:58,624
If you wish to keep your arm,

1176
01:12:58,707 --> 01:13:00,918
convince me with your cooking.

1177
01:13:01,585 --> 01:13:03,629
Yes. That is exactly what you will do.

1178
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:07,383
<i>Why on earth do I have to do such a thing?</i>

1179
01:13:07,466 --> 01:13:09,343
<i>Why?</i>

1180
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:15,224
<i>Get out of this if you can.</i>

1181
01:13:16,183 --> 01:13:17,559
<i>It was you.</i>

1182
01:13:17,643 --> 01:13:19,269
<i>You set this up, didn't you?</i>

1183
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:21,688
<i>Cutting off an arm of mine</i>
<i>is nothing to you, huh?</i>

1184
01:13:21,772 --> 01:13:24,358
<i>It will not end with just one arm.</i>

1185
01:13:25,859 --> 01:13:27,528
<i>Kang Mok-ju.</i>

1186
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:30,447
<i>I'm in big trouble.</i>

1187
01:13:32,449 --> 01:13:34,410
You received a message
from Principal Drafter Yi Jang-gyun

1188
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:35,744
of Hongmungwan, Office of Royal Decrees?

1189
01:13:35,828 --> 01:13:37,162
Yes, Your Majesty.

1190
01:13:43,877 --> 01:13:45,379
<i>I have obtained a draft</i>
<i>of the historical record.</i>

1191
01:13:45,462 --> 01:13:47,131
<i>I will meet you tonight</i>
<i>at the twenty-second hour.</i>

1192
01:13:48,132 --> 01:13:49,758
<i>He found the draft.</i>

1193
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:53,720
<i>I will finally be able to find out</i>
<i>the secret behind my mother's death.</i>

1194
01:13:55,013 --> 01:13:57,808
Your Majesty,
it is I, the Chief Royal Secretary.

1195
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:03,272
You may enter.

1196
01:14:14,241 --> 01:14:15,242
What is it?

1197
01:14:15,325 --> 01:14:17,995
The Grand Royal Queen Dowager
has summoned Cook Yeon.

1198
01:14:18,078 --> 01:14:18,954
What for?

1199
01:14:19,037 --> 01:14:23,500
Her Royal Highness
wants to taste the <i>gwinyeo</i>'s food.

1200
01:14:23,584 --> 01:14:27,254
She is a picky eater
with almost no appetite.

1201
01:14:27,337 --> 01:14:30,674
But she wants to taste her food?

1202
01:14:30,757 --> 01:14:32,759
She is to compete against
the senior cooks,

1203
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:35,137
and Her Royal Highness
demanded that she lose an arm

1204
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:37,431
for deceiving the king
should she lose the competition.

1205
01:14:37,514 --> 01:14:38,599
What? Lose an arm?

1206
01:14:41,602 --> 01:14:43,520
What in the world is happening?

1207
01:14:43,604 --> 01:14:46,106
I believe Her Grace Consort Kang
was also present.

1208
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:48,233
Consort Kang?

1209
01:15:06,835 --> 01:15:09,296
- Everything seems to be ready.
- Yes.

1210
01:15:19,723 --> 01:15:22,309
<i>You may try your best,</i>
<i>but it will be to no avail.</i>

1211
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:26,355
<i>Her Royal Highness</i>
<i>does not care for food at all.</i>

1212
01:15:27,147 --> 01:15:29,441
<i>The only thing she enjoys is…</i>

1213
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:39,409
His Majesty the King has arrived!

1214
01:16:33,547 --> 01:16:35,424
I hope you have been well, Grandmother.

1215
01:16:35,507 --> 01:16:36,883
Your Majesty.

1216
01:16:38,051 --> 01:16:40,095
I have not seen you in a long time.

1217
01:16:40,178 --> 01:16:42,472
I heard the <i>gwinyeo</i>
became the chief royal cook,

1218
01:16:42,556 --> 01:16:44,558
so I prepared a competition.

1219
01:16:45,058 --> 01:16:46,435
Would you like to watch together?

1220
01:16:46,518 --> 01:16:47,644
Yes.

1221
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:50,480
I heard you are holding this competition

1222
01:16:50,564 --> 01:16:52,608
for the arm of the <i>gwinyeo</i>
I have appointed.

1223
01:16:52,691 --> 01:16:57,404
You seem to care a great deal about her,

1224
01:16:58,905 --> 01:17:03,118
seeing that you came
all the way here to face--

1225
01:17:03,201 --> 01:17:05,912
You are the one
who crossed the line first.

1226
01:17:06,496 --> 01:17:07,831
She is my chief royal cook,

1227
01:17:07,914 --> 01:17:09,374
which means she is my person.

1228
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:13,128
All she has to do is win the competition.

1229
01:17:13,211 --> 01:17:15,964
Then all will be well and settled.

1230
01:17:16,048 --> 01:17:19,176
I heard the ministers objected

1231
01:17:19,259 --> 01:17:21,887
to your appointing her
as the chief royal cook.

1232
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:25,891
You must know
their dismay will not die down

1233
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:28,018
unless something is done.

1234
01:17:28,602 --> 01:17:29,811
In that case,

1235
01:17:29,895 --> 01:17:33,273
will the other cooks
also lose their arms if they lose?

1236
01:17:34,608 --> 01:17:38,070
The other cooks have already
been recognized by the palace.

1237
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:40,030
They are not the same.

1238
01:17:40,113 --> 01:17:43,450
Where is the fun in that, Grandmother?

1239
01:17:44,034 --> 01:17:46,912
As you said, all they have to do is win.

1240
01:17:47,537 --> 01:17:49,956
It is only right to keep the rules fair.

1241
01:17:53,418 --> 01:17:54,753
Listen carefully.

1242
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:58,006
Other than the one cook who wins today,

1243
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:00,008
the rest will give up an arm.

1244
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:03,845
Do you understand?

1245
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:05,138
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

1246
01:18:09,142 --> 01:18:10,268
Bring in the straw cutters.

1247
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:35,585
<i>I really want to go home.</i>

1248
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:37,212
<i>Dad.</i>

1249
01:18:37,295 --> 01:18:39,589
<i>I want to go back!</i>

1250
01:18:40,632 --> 01:18:41,675
Very well.

1251
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:44,761
Let the competition begin.

1252
01:18:57,065 --> 01:18:58,775
<i>I have no choice.</i>

1253
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:01,069
<i>All I can do now is prove myself.</i>

1254
01:19:02,779 --> 01:19:04,030
Gwinyeo.

1255
01:19:04,114 --> 01:19:06,366
<i>If it is true</i>
<i>that you came from the future,</i>

1256
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:08,285
<i>show them</i>

1257
01:19:09,619 --> 01:19:12,330
<i>a new dish that only you can make.</i>

1258
01:19:35,854 --> 01:19:38,774
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

1259
01:19:39,566 --> 01:19:41,943
<i>The theme of the competition is…</i>

1260
01:19:42,736 --> 01:19:43,737
<i>That's cursive.</i>

1261
01:19:44,863 --> 01:19:45,906
<i>Filial piety?</i>

1262
01:19:47,407 --> 01:19:48,992
<i>There's no way I'll lose.</i>

1263
01:19:49,075 --> 01:19:50,035
Let go!

1264
01:19:52,537 --> 01:19:54,664
I heard you were the one
who organized the competition.

1265
01:19:54,748 --> 01:19:55,957
Just let me get something really quick!

1266
01:19:56,041 --> 01:19:59,377
This is not the time
for you to coddle the <i>gwinyeo</i>.

1267
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:01,505
Shut your mouth!

1268
01:20:01,588 --> 01:20:04,132
There's no flirting or anything going on
between His Majesty and me.

1269
01:20:04,216 --> 01:20:07,010
- Open your mouth.
- I hope that His Majesty enjoys

1270
01:20:07,093 --> 01:20:08,011
your blurting.

1271
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:16,812
