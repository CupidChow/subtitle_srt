1
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:49,966
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

2
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,386
Be my companion.

3
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,306
Every morning,

4
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,808
I will make you bibinbap.

5
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,117
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

6
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,373
Do you…

7
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,459
dislike me that much?

8
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,753
It's not that I don't like you.

9
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:28,713
Then what is it?

10
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,216
Why do you keep turning away?

11
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,477
Look into my eyes.

12
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,150
I…

13
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:52,695
I have to leave--

14
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,364
You can choose not to leave.

15
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:01,371
I'm not from this time.

16
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,499
It's not that simple.

17
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:15,301
So you do not like me.

18
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,846
No, Your Majesty. It's not that.

19
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,514
But…

20
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,475
I must go back.

21
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,644
Back where I come from…

22
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,523
I left my dad on his own,

23
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,108
and I have a career

24
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,944
I've worked toward my whole life.

25
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,740
Leaving that behind to start a new life…

26
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,371
I'm not sure I can do that.

27
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,960
I also don't know
if it's right to go so far…

28
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:52,797
to stay here.

29
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,050
Very well.

30
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,386
I understand what you mean.

31
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,805
If you insist on returning,

32
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,390
give me your word.

33
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:07,604
Just as you came here
out of the blue one day,

34
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:09,772
promise me…

35
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,568
that you will come back to me.

36
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,448
What if…

37
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,994
I want to come back but can't?

38
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:28,499
If you wish to come back but cannot…

39
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:33,713
In that case,

40
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,507
I will find you…

41
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,304
by any means.

42
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,184
Your Majesty.

43
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,020
I'll just come back to you.

44
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:50,855
In return,

45
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,398
promise me something.

46
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,443
Promise me

47
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,820
that you won't be a tyrant.

48
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,117
Am I still a tyrant to you?

49
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:08,331
Please don't smile at me like that.

50
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,043
Let me forget you and go home.

51
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:17,632
Let this wind stirring my heart die down.

52
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:19,842
Please.

53
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,019
I will wait.

54
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,023
I believe that you

55
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,402
will be able to come back.

56
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:57,839
LETTUCE

57
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,594
TWO SPOONFULS OF GOCHOJANG
ONE SPOONFUL OF BATTER

58
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,021
What was this dish called?

59
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,857
Gochojang batter…

60
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,816
No.

61
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,401
Fiery bibinbap?

62
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,320
Chang-seon.

63
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

64
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,783
Look at this.

65
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:26,993
CHANG-SEON
CHIEF EUNUCH OF ROYAL FOOD

66
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,244
Is it a hwajodo?

67
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,579
HWAJODO: A DRAWING OF FLOWERS AND BIRDS

68
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,331
It is a dish made with seasonal vegetables

69
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,916
mixed with the chief royal cook's
gochojang and batter,

70
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,336
topped with wild flowers called bibinbap.

71
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,131
It was the first dish Cook Yeon made me.

72
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:43,384
It sounds immensely appetizing.

73
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,594
It does, does it not?

74
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:50,767
I drew all the food Cook Yeon made for me.

75
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,602
BEEF BURGY YAWN
BRAISED IN WILD GRAPE RICE WINE

76
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:55,354
The bibinbap on the last page

77
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,816
is something
I would like to make for her one day.

78
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:04,572
But I cannot seem to remember the name
she gave it when she made it.

79
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:07,241
The dish seems to carry a special meaning.

80
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:14,207
What would you name this dish?

81
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:18,419
The chief royal cook
greatly misses the hometown

82
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,089
she left behind.

83
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,758
So how about a name that reflects that?

84
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:26,636
How does "hwanseban," meaning
"food that brings one home," sound?

85
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,055
"Hwanseban"?

86
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,852
Are you saying
she will leave if she eats this?

87
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,564
Forgive my misspoken words, Your Majesty.

88
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,526
Please do not take it to heart.

89
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,622
I will wait.

90
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,707
I believe that you

91
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,919
will be able to come back.

92
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:06,259
Oh my, miss.

93
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,553
Why are you out here so late at night?

94
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,138
-Gil-geum.
-Yes?

95
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:15,017
Did you have a drink with His Majesty?

96
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:16,936
No.

97
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,607
The thought of going back
just weighs on me.

98
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:22,567
Going back?

99
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,569
SEO GIL-GEUM
AN ASPIRING ROYAL KITCHEN COURT LADY

100
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:25,611
To the future?

101
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,738
Did you finally find Mangunrok?

102
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:29,991
I think I will soon.

103
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,994
Oh no, already?

104
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:39,876
Is that why you are here, unable to sleep?

105
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,838
Gil-geum.

106
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,047
Yes?

107
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,717
Are you really going to come with me?

108
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,052
You mean, to the future?

109
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,181
I should go. Yes.

110
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,392
But you're settled
in the royal kitchen now.

111
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,560
Are you sure?

112
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,771
Well, to be honest,

113
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,441
I am not entirely sure.

114
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:06,569
I am afraid to go to a new place,

115
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,738
and I am worried too.

116
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,824
I thought you said I was all you needed.

117
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:15,244
Of course I cannot do
anything without you.

118
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,621
That is also true.

119
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,500
So what? Are you coming with me or not?

120
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,544
Since you have not found Mangunrok yet…

121
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,464
That's true.

122
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:31,469
We can talk about it again once I find it.

123
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,056
My word!

124
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,558
Miss, what is that?

125
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,019
-A shooting star! I've never seen one!
-A hooting star?

126
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,396
There's no air pollution here,
so you can see it so clearly.

127
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,689
There is no air what?

128
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,650
-We have to make a wish.
-A wish?

129
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:54,575
COURSE N° 11
SOY MEAT GUJEOLPAN & EGGPLANT PIE

130
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,618
GRAND ROYAL QUEEN DOWAGER'S BANQUET

131
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,286
-To your stations!
-Yes, sir!

132
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,727
So you're saying

133
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,522
the Grand Royal Queen Dowager
can't eat meat?

134
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,190
That is so.

135
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:29,944
She has not eaten meat at all for a while.

136
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,696
But it would not be right

137
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,073
not to serve meat
at a grand event for royals.

138
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,742
But then we cannot serve
what Her Royal Highness does not eat.

139
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,745
Then we won't serve any meat.

140
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,163
What?

141
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,916
Do you even know what a jinchan is?

142
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,626
It is a banquet to celebrate
Her Royal Highness' seventieth year

143
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,169
and to wish her a long and healthy life.

144
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,798
And you are saying you will not serve meat
for such an occasion?

145
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,175
You and your nasty temper.

146
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:57,179
This is her first banquet.
It is only natural she does not know much.

147
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,181
In that case,

148
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:04,020
is there something that is not meat
but is like meat?

149
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,105
Do you truly think
there would be such a thing?

150
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:14,113
Something that isn't meat
but is like meat?

151
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,747
Yes. There is such a thing.

152
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,960
Something that isn't meat
but is like meat.

153
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,796
-There is something.
-Is there really?

154
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,423
Soy meat.

155
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,050
-Soy?
-Soy?

156
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,843
Yes, soybeans.

157
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,096
All right, shall we get started then?

158
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,557
The killer dish of the banquet.

159
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,184
Soy meat gujeolpan and

160
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,269
eggplant pie.

161
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,438
Eggplant…

162
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,401
GRAND ROYAL QUEEN DOWAGER INJU
YI HEON'S GRANDMOTHER

163
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,905
I wish you a long and healthy life,
Your Royal Highness.

164
00:10:56,822 --> 00:11:00,242
Thank you. I shall live for many years.

165
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:04,038
I will live to see you get wed,
Grand Prince Jinmyeong.

166
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:07,625
Yes. I hope you remain well and strong
until I have a son.

167
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,211
I shall do just that.
You may sit down now.

168
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:12,421
Step aside.

169
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,839
You may not enter.

170
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:14,840
Your Grace!

171
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,386
How dare you force yourself in here?

172
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,595
Your Royal Highness.

173
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:22,056
Her Grace Consort Kang has arrived.

174
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,809
What is this ungraceful behavior?

175
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,018
I apologize.

176
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:29,730
I came to pay my respects
on your banquet day,

177
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:33,109
but I had to intrude as Court Lady Kim
would not permit me to enter.

178
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,485
Please do forgive me, Your Royal Highness.

179
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:35,403
You wench!

180
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,364
It has come to light for all to see
that your court lady

181
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:41,283
colluded with the female physician
who tried to harm Grand Prince Jinmyeong.

182
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,910
How dare you set foot here?

183
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,703
You are utterly shameless!

184
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:45,955
I swear, Your Royal Highness,

185
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,792
I have never done anything
to anger the heavens.

186
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,086
I only wish to pay my respects

187
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,171
to Her Royal Highness
for reaching her seventieth year.

188
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,424
I humbly ask for your permission.

189
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,550
How dare you still--

190
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:58,592
That is enough.

191
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:03,305
You cannot hide the truth forever.

192
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:07,101
It is only right
that you remain in your chambers

193
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,562
until the entire truth is revealed.

194
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,274
However, as today is a joyous occasion,

195
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:15,067
you may stay
as long as you cause no trouble.

196
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,861
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

197
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,822
I did not do anything to be ashamed of,

198
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,867
but I will do as you say.

199
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,119
I truly wish you a long and healthy life.

200
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,505
Everything is ready, Your Highness.

201
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,965
GRAND PRINCE JESAN
SUPERINTENDENT OF SAONGWON

202
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,216
And the Inner Palace Guards?

203
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,302
We have replaced half of them
with rebel forces

204
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:44,346
under the pretext of training
for the rainy season.

205
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,598
REBEL FORCES: THOSE SEEKING TO DETHRONE
THE CURRENT KING FOR A NEW KING

206
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,641
What about Yi Jang-gyun's family?

207
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,102
His spouse and children
are held at our base in the mountains,

208
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,438
and they are being watched by armed men.

209
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:55,941
If Yi Jang-gyun were to betray us,

210
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,152
can his family
be eliminated without a trace?

211
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,361
Yes, Your Highness.

212
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,572
I gave the order to eliminate all of them

213
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,116
if things go wrong.

214
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,453
And Salgoji Forest?

215
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,623
All preparations there are also complete,
Your Highness.

216
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:15,920
Today marks the beginning

217
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,380
of a new Joseon.

218
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,425
Let us make our way

219
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,761
to the banquet.

220
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,554
Your Royal Highness.

221
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,806
Grand Prince Jesan has arrived.

222
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,235
Oh dear.

223
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:46,825
I appreciate you making
the long journey here.

224
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:52,831
I am truly honored and moved
to hear you welcome me so.

225
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:57,127
To wish you a long life and good health,

226
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,756
I brought a sipjangsaengdo.

227
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,174
SIPJANGSAENGDO: PAINTING OF TEN
NATURAL ELEMENTS SYMBOLIZING LONGEVITY

228
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:05,094
I feel an ethereal aura come off it,

229
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,930
as though the painting
is alive and breathing.

230
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,223
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

231
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,517
Well,

232
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:15,354
I made a small mistake
during the cooking competition

233
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,273
against the Ming cooks.

234
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,568
Please forgive and forget my shortcomings,

235
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:24,905
and just like this painting I have brought
to wish you a long and healthy life,

236
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,783
I sincerely hope you stay with us

237
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:33,247
for many years to come,
Your Royal Highness.

238
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,293
I appreciate your precious painting.

239
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,502
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

240
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:42,882
However, the mistake made
during the competition

241
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,259
was far too shameful to let slide.

242
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:50,514
We almost lost the right
to harvest our ginseng, did we not?

243
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,725
Therefore, you should be held responsible.

244
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,687
I believe it is right that you step down

245
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,939
as Superintendent of Saongwon,
Office of Royal Meals.

246
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,984
Show His Majesty and the court officials

247
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,320
that you express remorse for your actions.

248
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,490
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

249
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,492
I will do as you say
and keep your words in mind.

250
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,758
Your Majesty, please send everyone away.

251
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:28,594
All of you, leave us for a while.

252
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:29,887
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

253
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,478
What is it?

254
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:40,105
The inspector court lady of Jahongwon,
who was apprehended,

255
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,191
took her own life.

256
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,359
She took her own life?

257
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:48,072
She was already dead
when the prison guards found her.

258
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,531
A knife shaped like a binyeo, hairpin,

259
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,368
was found stuck in her neck.

260
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,173
This matter is to be regarded as gimu.

261
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,549
GIMU: AN IMPORTANT MATTER
THAT MUST BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL

262
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,259
Inform the chief prison guard
and the other guards

263
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,845
to ensure that word of this
does not leak for the time being.

264
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,182
And inform the Chief Royal Secretary

265
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,393
to find out more about the court lady
who took her own life

266
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,853
and to investigate
everyone she was acquainted with.

267
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,397
Yes, Your Majesty.

268
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,150
Do you not believe me?

269
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,236
Why did you do it?

270
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,862
If you wish to punish me,

271
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,864
bring forth the evidence.

272
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,033
Consort Kang.

273
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,036
Just how far will you go?

274
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:46,880
What do you think?

275
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,341
Soy meat gujeolpan?

276
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,135
I am seeing it,
but I still cannot believe it.

277
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,720
My gosh.

278
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:55,264
Who would think of making meat with beans?

279
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,516
Did you call this eggplant pile?

280
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,436
It's a pie. Soy meat and eggplant pie.

281
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,772
-Oh, a bye.
-That's vegan too. It's plant-based.

282
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:07,568
I am truly satisfied and pleased
with these dishes.

283
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,945
What did you say this was? "Pea gone"?

284
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,905
Come on, Mak-jin.

285
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,866
It is called "begone."

286
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,909
As in, animal ingredients be gone.

287
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,662
Anyway, it means you can cook food
that is tasty and nutritious

288
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,497
even without meat from animals.

289
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,584
Look at you, Cook Min. I'm impressed.

290
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:24,710
You remember exactly what I said.

291
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,713
-Let's go down now.
-Yes.

292
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:33,177
Miss, you dropped something.

293
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,387
It smells sweet.

294
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,098
I smell licorice and a hint of jakseol.

295
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,349
What is this?

296
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:40,934
It's nothing.

297
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,729
-Gil-geum.
-Yes, Cook Eom.

298
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,281
It's chocolate I made for His Majesty.

299
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,283
My gosh, that keen nose of hers

300
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,827
even smelled the licorice and green tea
in this chocolate.

301
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,665
Your Royal Highness.

302
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:08,337
We wish you good health and happiness
on this blessed day,

303
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,797
and offer this ceremony to you.

304
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,800
-Your Royal Highness.
-Your Royal Highness.

305
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,886
-May you live a long and healthy life.
-May you live a long and healthy life.

306
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,514
Thank you, all.

307
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,058
You may all be seated

308
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,727
-and enjoy the banquet.
-Let us all sit.

309
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,490
Your Royal Highness.

310
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,742
To wish you a long and healthy life,

311
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,161
the Jahongwon dancers
have prepared a performance for you.

312
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,289
Very well.

313
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:46,500
I shall watch.

314
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:23,954
Your Majesty,
the jester Gong-gil has arrived.

315
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,708
Everything is ready, Your Majesty.

316
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:31,879
Let us go.

317
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,736
Cook Yeon, come here for a moment.

318
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:08,957
This gujeolpan is unlike
what I used to eat.

319
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,169
What meat is this?

320
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,213
It's meat made with soybeans.

321
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:19,134
I was told you haven't been
able to eat meat lately,

322
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,260
so instead of meat,

323
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:24,640
I used plant-based meat
to make the gujeolpan and eggplant pie.

324
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,934
Meat made with soybeans?

325
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:29,853
Soybeans?

326
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:30,896
Yes.

327
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:31,980
And "pile"?

328
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,484
How truly marvelous.

329
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,529
This definitely smells of meat.

330
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,783
I cannot believe it is made with soybeans.

331
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:47,621
You are not playing tricks
with real meat, are you?

332
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,624
Look at her picking on me again.

333
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,376
What do you take me for?

334
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:56,964
I'll take that as a compliment
for how well it's made.

335
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,884
I see the cooks
have put in a great effort.

336
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:04,846
I could wish for nothing more,
seeing everyone enjoy the food we made.

337
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,390
Your Royal Highness.

338
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,935
I wish you eternal peace and good health.

339
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,522
Your words are like medicine to me.

340
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:17,234
May you also remain safe and sound
for a long time.

341
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:24,616
Meat made with soybeans…

342
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:32,291
But it tastes just like meat.

343
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,464
Go ahead and enjoy the food.

344
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,108
Your days of showing off your cooking

345
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,110
will end today, you wench.

346
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:04,114
It is a shame
His Majesty is not here to try this food.

347
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,866
Do you not agree?

348
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:06,950
You are right.

349
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,660
He would certainly enjoy it greatly.

350
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:18,587
To commemorate such a joyous occasion
of wishing Her Royal Highness

351
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,297
a long and healthy life,

352
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,799
His Majesty has personally
summoned a group of jesters

353
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,302
to perform a dance.

354
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,012
The following performance

355
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:29,264
is a lion dance by a troupe,

356
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,974
said to ward off evil
and bring in great fortune,

357
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,435
after which comes the Cheoyongmu.

358
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,270
His Majesty, you say?

359
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:40,192
Then let us watch if you can summon
that blessed energy.

360
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:58,835
Play on!

361
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,290
Gods of heaven and earth!

362
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,960
It is the Imsul day of the Month of Sinsa
in the Year of the Blue Monkey.

363
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:42,754
Today, we celebrate
Her Royal Highness' day of birth.

364
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,923
The entire court
and her family have gathered here

365
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:47,676
to offer their best regards!

366
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:50,554
Please enjoy our performance.

367
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:56,726
You must be Gong-gil,
the jester favored by His Majesty.

368
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,562
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

369
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,897
I wish you a long and healthy life.

370
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,343
It's His Majesty.

371
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,032
Is that…

372
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,034
His Majesty?

373
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:55,952
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

374
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,080
His Majesty has prepared this dance

375
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,458
with utmost sincerity and respect

376
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:03,793
solely for Your Royal Highness.

377
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,631
His Majesty has prepared this dance

378
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,299
for me, you say?

379
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:12,844
His Majesty's filial devotion
is truly profound.

380
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:17,015
His Majesty's movements
are not at all different

381
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:19,726
from those of a performer.

382
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:22,729
Is that really His Majesty?

383
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,690
How could he perform such a dance
at a place like this?

384
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:30,153
I have not seen His Majesty
dance the Cheoyongmu in over ten years.

385
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,573
It truly is an amazing sight.

386
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,367
Is that truly His Majesty?

387
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:43,416
Your Majesty.

388
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,046
You'll go down in history as a sage king.

389
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:48,964
SAGE KING: A WISE AND VIRTUOUS KING

390
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:50,882
Your Majesty.

391
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,760
Express your filial piety
while you still can.

392
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:58,390
Soon, you will become the depraved tyrant,
bringing ruin to your own kin.

393
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,917
Please spare us.

394
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,753
How dare you! Do you not fear the heavens?

395
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:32,716
Do you wish to save your wife?

396
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:34,718
I have no choice.

397
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,013
Your Highness!
For what reason are you doing this?

398
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,598
I am a special royal inspector,
carrying out His Majesty's secret orders.

399
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:41,599
What you are doing is…

400
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:43,059
Yes.

401
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,145
It is treason.

402
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:48,023
-Your Highness.
-Under the guise

403
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:51,735
of avenging his dead mother,
the king caused the Muin Literati Purge.

404
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:54,779
He had no qualms
about shedding the blood of many,

405
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,032
and you led the charge.

406
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,242
I will commit treason to punish you both.

407
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,088
It is not too late to do as I say.

408
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,550
And if you do,
I will spare your wife and children.

409
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:41,826
The Grand Royal Queen Dowager is smiling.

410
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,205
Does this mean
there will be peace in the palace?

411
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,290
Grandmother.

412
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:50,418
Flowers may wither,
yet spring always comes.

413
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,003
I wish you live a healthy life

414
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,005
for many more years to come.

415
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:58,093
Thank you, Your Majesty.

416
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:01,388
I wish you always shine bright
like the sun

417
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:05,725
and bring light to the nation
and its people for many years.

418
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:08,895
Principal Drafter Yi,
what brings you here?

419
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,563
Now is not the time.

420
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:12,273
I said no!

421
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,316
Commander!

422
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,110
Have you forgotten?

423
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:18,947
I am Special Royal Inspector Yi Jang-gyun,
who received His Majesty's royal command.

424
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,574
The Grand Royal Queen Dowager's banquet
is currently taking place.

425
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,326
Come to His Majesty's quarters
in the evening.

426
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:25,412
Yi Jang-gyun?

427
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:28,623
Let him through!

428
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:30,750
SHIN SU-HYEOK
COMMANDER OF URIMWI

429
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,426
His Majesty must never see

430
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:42,762
the draft of the historical record!

431
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:44,556
And did preventing that

432
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,434
cease his madness?

433
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:50,520
Did it bring a reign of peace?

434
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:57,736
Your Majesty,

435
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,155
I am Principal Drafter Yi Jang-gyun,
of Hongmungwan, Office of Royal Decrees.

436
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,742
I brought the case
I found upon your command.

437
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,578
Yi Jang-gyun found the case?

438
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:08,204
-Case?
-What case?

439
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,123
-What did he find?
-What was he sent to find?

440
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,249
Yi Jang-gyun?

441
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:19,674
What is this?

442
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,427
It is the draft of the historical record

443
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,637
you commanded me to find, Your Majesty.

444
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:27,015
It is not the draft
kept in Sago, History Archive.

445
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,350
It is a private draft, bearing the truth
with the scribe's commentaries.

446
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,186
A draft?

447
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,645
What's happening?

448
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:33,938
It can't be.

449
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:39,986
Open the case.

450
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:55,585
Something's not right.

451
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:58,379
Don't look at it, Your Majesty.

452
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:03,885
Is this truly…

453
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:05,553
Yes, Your Majesty.

454
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,680
This draft holds the truth

455
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,350
concerning the deposed queen,
who was poisoned to death.

456
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,155
It's the Gapshin Literati Purge.

457
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:27,325
No. I must stop this, no matter what!

458
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:31,371
Miss, what is the matter?

459
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:32,956
-Gil-geum.
-Yes?

460
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:44,133
I crossed paths with her
while I was searching for the draft.

461
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,053
She is your maternal grandmother,
Your Majesty.

462
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:49,556
What?

463
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,225
My maternal grandmother?

464
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,111
Oh dear.

465
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,116
INTERNAL PRINCESS CONSORT SIM
YI HEON'S MATERNAL GRANDMOTHER

466
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,871
Is that woman truly…

467
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:17,542
Yes. She is Internal Princess Consort Sim,
your maternal grandmother.

468
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:19,961
How…

469
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,715
How could this be?

470
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:28,303
After your mother was poisoned to death,

471
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,430
the Lady Consort lost control of herself.

472
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:45,862
Answer me.

473
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:50,158
Are you Internal Princess Consort Sim?

474
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,910
I do not know.

475
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,369
I do not know anything.

476
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,664
Her Majesty is innocent.

477
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,045
Please spare her.

478
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,172
Please spare her.

479
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:06,883
Please spare her life.

480
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,470
Please spare her.

481
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:16,351
Grandmother, do you recognize me?

482
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,355
Your Majesty?

483
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,705
I smell something tasty.

484
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,182
-Court Lady Kim.
-Your Royal Highness.

485
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,574
Sit back down, all of you!

486
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:23,334
I do not think I should stay any longer.

487
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,420
I will return to my chambers.

488
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:27,755
Your Majesty.

489
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,259
Her Royal Highness does not feel well.

490
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,468
Your Majesty.

491
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:35,471
Allow Her Royal Highness
to retire to her quarters--

492
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,890
I told you all to sit back down!

493
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:54,866
Chief Royal Secretary!

494
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:00,496
Yes, Your Majesty.

495
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,790
Read the draft for all to hear.

496
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:06,836
-However, Your Majesty--
-Read it!

497
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,723
"The twentieth day of the second month
in the Year of the White Rooster."

498
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:21,642
"Consorts Yang and Sung have taken turns
in submitting petitions to the king,

499
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,562
stating that the queen's spiteful jealousy
is extreme."

500
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,106
"They constantly submitted petitions,

501
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,818
stating that the queen
lacks refinement and virtue,

502
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,361
and thus is unfit for her position."

503
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:39,619
-Your Royal Highness.
-Your Royal Highness.

504
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:40,787
Your Royal Highness.

505
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:45,541
Your Majesty.

506
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:49,045
Must you do this?

507
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,506
Read on.

508
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:58,888
"The seventh day of the ninth month
in the Year of the Black Dog."

509
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,724
"The queen scratched the king's face,

510
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:05,019
which enraged both the king himself
and his mother Queen Dowager Inju,

511
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,647
and despite the opposition
of many subjects,

512
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,858
several officials,
including Han Min-seong,

513
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,485
agreed to have her deposed…

514
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:13,861
DEPOSED: A CRIMINAL WHO LOSES THEIR TITLE
AND IS DEMOTED TO A COMMONER

515
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,321
…and banished to her hometown."

516
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:22,370
Your Majesty.

517
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,038
How dare you.

518
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:27,792
Your Majesty!

519
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,836
Please stop!

520
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,212
Keep reading.

521
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,886
"The fourteenth day of the fourth month
in the Year of the Black Pig."

522
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,139
"The Queen Dowager made the request

523
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,057
to execute the deposed queen by poison…

524
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,810
THE KING GIVES POISON TO THE CRIMINAL,
MAKING THEM TAKE THEIR OWN LIFE

525
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,565
…to the late King Seonjong."

526
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,782
Let me see His Majesty!

527
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,242
Let me see His Majesty!

528
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,348
Your Majesty!

529
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,809
Your Majesty!

530
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:44,952
Your Majesty!

531
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,288
Your Majesty!

532
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,456
You can't do this.

533
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:50,541
Please.

534
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:51,584
Step aside.

535
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:53,920
No.

536
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,464
Don't do this.

537
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:58,299
You can't do this.

538
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,676
Please don't. Please.

539
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:02,094
Your Majesty!

540
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:04,722
Grandmother.

541
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,017
Did you truly command

542
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,019
that my mother be executed?

543
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,940
I asked you a question!

544
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,692
Answer me.

545
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:18,611
Your Majesty.

546
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:21,614
You can't do this. Please.

547
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:22,782
Step aside.

548
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:24,533
You can't.

549
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,702
Don't do this, Your Majesty.

550
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:30,373
It is true.

551
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,044
I requested it.

552
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:37,505
Your Majesty!

553
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:39,882
Your Majesty.

554
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:42,760
Yi Jang-gyun is a traitor.

555
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,512
Do not listen to him.

556
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:46,347
A traitor?

557
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,016
The draft may tell the truth,

558
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,686
but when you ascended the throne,

559
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:56,023
the late king had issued a royal command
to keep this matter a secret forever.

560
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:59,485
And Yi Jang-gyun disobeyed
the late king's will.

561
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:02,154
If that is not treason, what is?

562
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:07,118
What?

563
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:08,953
The late king

564
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:12,665
commanded that this matter
be kept a secret forever?

565
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:14,375
A secret?

566
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,045
Look at this.

567
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,298
A secret.

568
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,102
What is that?

569
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:41,694
I asked what that bloodstained
piece of jeogori is!

570
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:43,237
That is…

571
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:50,328
My lord. Please spare my life.

572
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:58,878
Your Majesty, that is the garment
your mother was wearing when she passed.

573
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:03,132
The draft contains her last words,

574
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:05,301
wishing for her injustice to be righted.

575
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,095
Is that true?

576
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,309
I asked if that is true!

577
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:19,357
Yes, Your Majesty.

578
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:41,212
The bloodstained garment…

579
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:45,257
my mother wore.

580
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:51,555
My daughter wore that.

581
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:54,683
She died a wrongful death.

582
00:39:57,311 --> 00:40:00,022
Lady Consort Sim! How could you?

583
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,649
How could you do this?

584
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,401
Please spare me!

585
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,236
Please spare me!

586
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:06,320
Please spare me!

587
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,699
Please spare my life.

588
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,494
Please spare my life.

589
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:14,870
Please spare me.

590
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:15,871
Please…

591
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,258
What do I do?

592
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:29,718
What do I do?

593
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,563
Today!

594
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,067
I will set everything right.

595
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:50,739
No!

596
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,867
No, you must hold back.

597
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,327
If you take revenge now,

598
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:56,996
you'll regret it forever.

599
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:58,956
Do you wish to die yourself?

600
00:40:59,039 --> 00:40:59,999
Your Majesty!

601
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,589
-Your Majesty!
-No!

602
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:07,965
Please spare her life!

603
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:10,092
-Please show your mercy.
-Your Majesty!

604
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:11,844
Your Majesty.

605
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,599
This does not concern you.

606
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,100
Step aside.

607
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:20,060
No.

608
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:21,896
It does concern me.

609
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:26,484
Because…

610
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:30,362
I love you.

611
00:41:58,599 --> 00:41:59,642
Your Majesty.

612
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:02,061
Please stop, Your Majesty.

613
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:05,064
You promised me.

614
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:12,154
You said you would make me bibimbap.

615
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,449
You said you'd wait.

616
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,454
You promised

617
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:24,250
to be a good king, not a tyrant.

618
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:28,879
Your Majesty!

619
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,340
I also implore you!

620
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:33,551
Please sheathe your sword!

621
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,845
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

622
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:42,351
-Please sheathe your sword!
-Please sheathe your sword!

623
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:50,693
Your Majesty, please put away your sword.

624
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:01,078
I am sorry,

625
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:02,997
Cook Yeon.

626
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,210
This tragedy was caused by

627
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,463
neither my mother nor myself.

628
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:18,304
It was my grandmother

629
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,889
and the late king's concubines.

630
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:24,310
-Commander!
-Yes, Your Majesty!

631
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:27,563
Block all directions
so no one can get out!

632
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:28,606
Yes, Your Majesty.

633
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:45,289
Your Majesty!

634
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:46,248
Your Majesty, no!

635
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:52,671
That's it. His grandmother.

636
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,590
My chocolate.

637
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:57,384
It might bring her to her senses
if she eats the chocolate.

638
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:03,349
Ma'am.

639
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:08,312
This is chocolate
made with licorice and green tea.

640
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:09,730
Try it.

641
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:13,859
Think from a mother's perspective.

642
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:18,405
Please fathom the heart
of His Majesty's mother,

643
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,032
and please

644
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:22,076
tell us the truth.

645
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:45,349
Those responsible…

646
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:50,104
for my mother's death

647
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,691
will not leave this place alive.

648
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:22,469
That is only right, is it not,

649
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:24,638
Grandmother?

650
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:28,559
Your Royal Highness.

651
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:35,774
Your Majesty.

652
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:37,526
Your Majesty.

653
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:39,736
Is this

654
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:42,448
truly your choice?

655
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:45,909
Is there really

656
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,495
no way to stop this?

657
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,923
It's all over.

658
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,226
Her Majesty…

659
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,855
took the poison,

660
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:17,566
and as she coughed up blood,

661
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:20,694
she cried out toward the sky.

662
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:26,116
-"May my son…"
-…right my injustice.

663
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:28,869
May he become

664
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:32,039
a sage king…

665
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,332
SAGE KING: A WISE AND VIRTUOUS KING

666
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:36,668
-…and right his mother's…
-"…and right his mother's injustice."

667
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:40,297
Those were the words she cried out

668
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,675
before taking her last breath.

669
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:01,693
A sage king…

670
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,488
A sage king?

671
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:07,282
It is too late for that!

672
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:10,410
No. It's not too late.

673
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:14,331
Your Majesty, as your grandmother said,

674
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:18,585
your mother wouldn't want you
to shed blood.

675
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,003
Your Majesty!

676
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:23,507
Please have mercy!

677
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:26,552
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

678
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:30,305
-Please have mercy!
-Please have mercy!

679
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:32,724
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

680
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:35,894
-Please have mercy!
-Please have mercy!

681
00:47:36,853 --> 00:47:39,982
-Please have mercy!
-Please have mercy!

682
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:53,745
Father!

683
00:47:57,499 --> 00:48:00,460
How could you leave me with such pain?

684
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,016
Why…

685
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:16,393
did you kill my mother

686
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:19,438
and put me on the throne?

687
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:24,985
Why did you make me king?

688
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:27,529
Why?

689
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:57,726
Your Majesty.

690
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,671
Do not follow me!

691
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,427
I wish to be alone.

692
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:41,246
Mother!

693
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:45,917
Hurry.

694
00:50:50,046 --> 00:50:51,047
Yes, Crown Prince.

695
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:00,766
Look how much you have grown,
Crown Prince.

696
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:40,806
Mother…

697
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:47,062
Your Majesty…

698
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:07,040
All that I did to avenge my mother

699
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:12,587
turned out to be
directly against her wishes.

700
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:15,924
Everything was in vain.

701
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:18,385
Your mother

702
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:22,639
didn't want you to be remembered
as a tyrant.

703
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:24,432
Have you ever

704
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:28,562
wished for the death of a family member?

705
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:31,565
There was a time

706
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:35,610
when I wished for my father's death.

707
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:42,450
He had deposed my mother and executed her.

708
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:45,579
All through my life since then,
I was unable to forgive

709
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:47,956
or understand him.

710
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,209
Just like how they drove

711
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,462
my mother to her death,

712
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:57,757
I wanted to kill my father's subjects

713
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:01,469
and all who were involved

714
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,681
in deposing and banishing my mother.

715
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:12,772
But what then?

716
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,192
That won't do you any good.

717
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:18,945
That wouldn't help your mother

718
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:21,323
or anyone else.

719
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:25,410
Promise me.

720
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:29,748
Promise me that you'll never
think like that ever again.

721
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:35,337
Are you that worried about me?

722
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,507
Of course.

723
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:42,594
Because your pain…

724
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,014
brings pain to me as well.

725
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:58,276
It's true.

726
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:00,946
I heard you.

727
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:03,615
You don't believe me, do you?

728
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:06,409
I said I heard you.

729
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:10,747
Our plan ended in failure, Your Highness.

730
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:14,292
The sly chief royal cook
ruined everything.

731
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:17,629
We should not have let her live.

732
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:20,006
What do you say we do now, Your Highness?

733
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:21,841
We now have no choice

734
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:24,678
but to get blood on our own hands.

735
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:27,597
Tonight,

736
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:31,393
we will set the second plan in motion.

737
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:41,653
Grand Prince Jesan.

738
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:43,113
I suspected as much,

739
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:46,199
and it indeed was you
who devised what happened today.

740
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:01,589
I see you came in search of death.

741
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:03,633
What shall I do, Your Highness?

742
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,970
We cannot shed blood here.

743
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:10,807
You will not get away with this.

744
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:21,526
It is a shock

745
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:24,529
that His Majesty was searching
for the draft of the historical record.

746
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:26,948
I could never have foreseen this.

747
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:29,617
Should we not devise a plan of our own?

748
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:32,037
It is our fault for putting
His Majesty on the throne

749
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:34,956
despite what happened to his mother.

750
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:39,419
However, we cannot sit back
and watch anymore.

751
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:41,379
Inform everyone

752
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:43,965
to gather at my residence tonight.

753
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,967
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

754
00:56:00,356 --> 00:56:03,068
Did you truly command

755
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:04,694
that my mother be executed?

756
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:07,197
I asked you a question!

757
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,366
If His Majesty is looking for the draft

758
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:13,870
with the knowledge that we were
involved in her death,

759
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:18,750
would it not be
so that he can oust our Han family?

760
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,545
What…

761
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:28,259
shall I do about this?

762
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:32,806
Your Royal Highness,
what should we do now?

763
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:37,143
You saw His Majesty's madness earlier.

764
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:39,145
I am so afraid.

765
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:42,774
However, His Majesty
put down the sword in the end.

766
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:46,444
What will happen
the day he takes it up again?

767
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,905
Must we sit and wait for him to kill us?

768
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:53,701
To be honest, I am also afraid.

769
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:55,954
However,

770
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:58,540
did you not notice
when Jinmyeong lost consciousness,

771
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,833
and even earlier today?

772
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,960
His Majesty heeds Cook Yeon,

773
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:04,212
even in situations
where he loses his temper.

774
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:07,632
Perhaps we should put our hopes in her.

775
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:10,844
Then should we take this chance
to get rid of Consort Kang

776
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:13,388
and make Cook Yeon the queen instead?

777
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:14,973
That is a good idea.

778
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:17,642
His Majesty listens to everything
Cook Yeon says.

779
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:19,769
It is merely my opinion.

780
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:23,815
You are not to say a word or do anything

781
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:26,234
until the Grand Royal Queen Dowager
summons us.

782
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,361
-Understood.
-Understood.

783
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:33,324
GANGNYEONGJEON

784
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:34,284
Your Majesty.

785
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,996
Didn't you think
what happened earlier today was odd?

786
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:41,082
What do you mean?

787
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:44,085
That man, Yi Jang-gyun.

788
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:47,714
Why did he interrupt the banquet
the way he did?

789
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:53,470
Everything from what happened
to Grand Prince Jinmyeong

790
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:56,514
to Yi Jang-gyun showing up today
just feels strange.

791
00:57:58,099 --> 00:57:59,100
It's as if

792
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:02,437
someone wants you to lose control.

793
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:04,564
It cannot be.

794
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:07,358
Whoever is behind this,

795
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:11,196
it's obvious that
they don't want you to be a sage king.

796
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:15,074
But you should remember
what your mother wanted

797
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:17,327
and be a sage king.

798
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:23,791
I lived my whole life to get revenge.

799
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:25,835
Now that I have given that up,

800
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:28,755
I do not know where to start.

801
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:31,549
I am lost.

802
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:36,304
No matter how much I think about it,

803
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:39,474
there's only one solution.

804
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:42,185
Do you have a good plan?

805
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:47,106
There must be a great deal

806
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:49,275
the Grand Royal Queen Dowager
couldn't say.

807
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,903
Why don't you give her a chance?

808
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:54,405
How, exactly?

809
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:56,783
I have a feeling

810
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:01,913
that I was sent to this time period
to become a chief royal cook

811
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:03,373
to do exactly this.

812
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:08,753
How about…

813
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:12,131
Are you telling me…

814
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:16,636
to dine with my grandmother?

815
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:20,598
Yes. Before you drift further apart.

816
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,686
It's best to talk about things
you normally wouldn't over a meal.

817
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,610
You should make peace with her.

818
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:34,696
I am not sure…

819
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:38,992
if I could eat anything in her presence.

820
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:42,620
However,

821
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:45,415
I shall try.

822
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:46,874
Really?

823
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:49,335
You said it yourself, okay?
You can't take it back.

824
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:54,382
Then I'll serve today's seoksura,
evening meal,

825
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:56,217
to Her Royal Highness' quarters.

826
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:01,889
Oh, right.

827
01:00:03,808 --> 01:00:04,976
Your Majesty.

828
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:08,521
So much has happened lately
that I forgot to tell you this.

829
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:13,359
The Ming cook Tang Bailong
asked me to relay a message to you.

830
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:14,527
Tang Bailong?

831
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,279
Yes.

832
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:20,199
-"The edges of objects…"
-…are always harder to see,

833
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:25,413
and when you sleep,
be sure to lock the latch securely.

834
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:26,581
That was the message.

835
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:31,085
What does that mean?

836
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:35,798
It sounds like a riddle,
but I'm not sure what it means.

837
01:00:38,926 --> 01:00:42,513
Anyway, I'll see you later
at Her Royal Highness' quarters.

838
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,202
I'm late, aren't I?

839
01:01:04,285 --> 01:01:07,372
-Miss, are you all right?
-Chief Royal Cook.

840
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:10,041
Sorry for making you worry.

841
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:12,710
Goodness, how could you be so fearless?

842
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:15,421
Our chief royal cook is as brave as a man.

843
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,215
So is everything sorted out?

844
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:19,676
Come on. Can you not see she is back?

845
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,595
Everything must be settled.

846
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:24,889
It'll be hard to believe,

847
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:26,557
but everything went well.

848
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:29,352
All right.

849
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:31,187
We have to start preparing the seoksura.

850
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:32,939
We'll be serving the meal

851
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:35,274
to Her Royal Highness' quarters tonight.

852
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:38,361
Are His Majesty and Her Royal Highness
dining together?

853
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:40,530
What? Is that true?

854
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:41,447
Yes.

855
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:44,534
Tonight's seoksura

856
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,619
is reconciliation rice noodles.

857
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:49,914
Very well. Cook Min, get the rice.

858
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:53,126
-Yes. I will go right away.
-Then I shall make the broth.

859
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:54,377
-Cook Sim.
-Wait for me.

860
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:56,170
I will get the hakdok.

861
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:57,588
HAKDOK: A TOOL USED TO GRIND GRAIN

862
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:04,512
A massacre of any kind right now
will lead to a revolt,

863
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:06,556
and His Majesty will be dethroned.

864
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:13,980
But if His Majesty
reconciles with his grandmother,

865
01:02:15,022 --> 01:02:16,733
history will change.

866
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:18,818
Let's start with that.

867
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:25,158
Why does Grand Prince Jesan

868
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:28,327
summon me and my son at this hour?

869
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:32,623
I wonder if Song-jae is here already.

870
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:35,835
What about the Chief State Councilor?

871
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:38,629
His faction is meeting this evening.

872
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:41,924
I am certain they are planning
to overthrow His Majesty.

873
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:44,177
He did see His Majesty
run rampant with fury.

874
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:46,888
There is no way he would ignore that.

875
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:48,639
We should execute our plan without delay.

876
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:52,226
Is Salgoji Forest set up?

877
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:57,023
The Chief Royal Secretary
is there as bait, as you instructed.

878
01:02:57,106 --> 01:03:00,109
Was the secret letter
delivered to the Commander of Urimwi?

879
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:03,821
Yes. The Chief Palace Guard
delivered it to him.

880
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:06,574
We just have to capture
the chief royal cook

881
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:09,744
before going to His Majesty.

882
01:03:10,828 --> 01:03:13,039
He will be helpless by then,

883
01:03:14,373 --> 01:03:16,459
like a mouse in a trap.

884
01:03:17,418 --> 01:03:20,296
Tonight, His Majesty's hunting ground

885
01:03:20,379 --> 01:03:23,758
will become his own grave.

886
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:26,886
Let us commence

887
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:29,847
the heavenly decree given to us
to change the world.

888
01:03:42,443 --> 01:03:45,238
He has arrived sooner than expected.

889
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:46,739
Let the greatest traitor of our time,

890
01:03:47,573 --> 01:03:49,242
Im Seo-hong, meet death first.

891
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:51,202
Yes, Your Highness.

892
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:54,789
Your Majesty! Treason is underway!

893
01:03:54,872 --> 01:03:57,166
Your Majesty!

894
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,167
Treason--

895
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:02,004
Oh dear. Who is this?

896
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:05,132
How did you enter the palace
without your official attire?

897
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:09,178
Well, I shall be on my way.

898
01:04:12,431 --> 01:04:15,017
Who is this now?

899
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:24,861
Song-jae.

900
01:04:26,237 --> 01:04:29,824
Please be safe.

901
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:34,245
Do you have the chief royal cook?

902
01:04:34,328 --> 01:04:36,080
I have already sent some men.

903
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:40,334
Oh my goodness!

904
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:42,962
-Are you okay, Gil-geum? Are you hurt?
-I am fine.

905
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:45,298
-Oh dear, what a waste.
-Leave it! You'll cut yourself.

906
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:48,009
-But…
-Leave it and step aside.

907
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:51,596
-I am sorry.
-They say breaking a plate is bad luck.

908
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:55,975
-How clumsy you are.
-Did you hurt yourself?

909
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:57,143
I apologize.

910
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:58,728
It's fine.

911
01:04:58,811 --> 01:05:00,521
Is everything else ready?

912
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:01,439
It is ready.

913
01:05:01,522 --> 01:05:03,065
We are finished as well.

914
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:05,192
Chief Royal Cook, come on outside.

915
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:08,571
Why would a palace guard
come here for you?

916
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:11,198
A palace guard?

917
01:05:17,371 --> 01:05:18,414
What is this about?

918
01:05:43,147 --> 01:05:43,981
Your Majesty.

919
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:46,692
If I dare comment on the matter,

920
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:49,487
your request
to dine with Her Royal Highness

921
01:05:50,404 --> 01:05:52,114
was a wise decision.

922
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:54,325
Is that right?

923
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:56,410
Yes, Your Majesty.

924
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,039
Your Majesty.

925
01:06:01,415 --> 01:06:04,502
It is an urgent message
from the Chief Royal Secretary.

926
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:06,504
An urgent message?

927
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:09,382
The assassins who attacked us
at Jang Chun-saeng's residence

928
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:11,300
were former military officers
from the border,

929
01:06:11,884 --> 01:06:13,844
and he found their base in Salgoji Forest.

930
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:17,348
He is asking for troops to be sent
to subdue them immediately.

931
01:06:17,431 --> 01:06:18,474
What?

932
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:20,434
The rebels are military officers?

933
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:23,729
Is Song-jae in Salgoji Forest right now?

934
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:26,023
Yes, he is, Your Majesty.

935
01:06:30,194 --> 01:06:31,737
These despicable traitors…

936
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:33,155
Your Majesty!

937
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:35,616
Your Majesty!

938
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:38,828
Right State Councilor,
what brings you here?

939
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:40,413
I bring bad news, Your Majesty.

940
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:42,665
The chief royal cook
was taken by a band of rebels

941
01:06:42,748 --> 01:06:45,835
to their base in Salgoji Forest.

942
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:48,212
What? They took the chief royal cook?

943
01:06:48,796 --> 01:06:50,840
-Are you certain of that?
-Yes, Your Majesty.

944
01:06:50,923 --> 01:06:53,634
She was abducted
in the backyard of the royal kitchen,

945
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:55,803
and this hat was found there.

946
01:07:01,058 --> 01:07:01,976
How…

947
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:04,437
How could this happen?

948
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:10,359
"The edges of objects
are always harder to see,

949
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:14,822
and when you sleep,
be sure to lock the latch securely."

950
01:07:14,905 --> 01:07:15,948
That was the message.

951
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:18,242
Commander.

952
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:21,120
Let us head to Salgoji Forest.

953
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,247
Make preparations immediately.

954
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:24,165
Yes, Your Majesty.

955
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:40,598
I will save the chief royal cook

956
01:07:40,681 --> 01:07:43,809
and subdue the band of rebels myself.

957
01:07:52,234 --> 01:07:55,529
Do you find it strange
that I am adorning myself at this hour?

958
01:07:56,697 --> 01:07:57,990
No, Your Grace.

959
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:02,536
A special guest will be coming tonight.

960
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:05,164
I must prepare to welcome them.

961
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:19,345
Who goes there?

962
01:08:22,056 --> 01:08:23,057
His Majesty…

963
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:24,642
His Majesty has lost his mind!

964
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:56,715
Your Majesty?

965
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:05,558
In the end,

966
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:09,019
have you chosen the sword?

967
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:12,898
Are you truly resolved

968
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:16,277
to slay your own grandmother?

969
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:19,905
Your Royal Highness.

970
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:22,032
Who…

971
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:24,618
Who are you?

972
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:27,496
If you deposed the queen,

973
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:31,584
you should not have put her son
on the throne.

974
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:34,879
That is precisely
what brought forth this disaster.

975
01:09:35,462 --> 01:09:37,256
Grand Prince Jesan?

976
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:47,433
Have you caught on at last?

977
01:09:56,984 --> 01:09:58,152
So in the end…

978
01:10:03,782 --> 01:10:06,327
you have stirred up trouble.

979
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:12,082
I should have seen through your mask
when you pretended to be

980
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:14,752
an utter fool who knew nothing.

981
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:20,132
Why would you cause such madness?

982
01:10:20,799 --> 01:10:22,426
Do you ask because you truly do not know?

983
01:10:23,177 --> 01:10:26,639
I am restoring this nation
to its rightful place.

984
01:10:27,681 --> 01:10:29,141
It deserves to be ruled

985
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:32,853
by a sage king who will bring peace,
and not by a tyrant.

986
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:34,438
A sage king?

987
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:38,067
Who do you mean?

988
01:10:40,444 --> 01:10:42,821
You are the one wielding the sword!

989
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:46,367
Are you not the tyrant now?

990
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:49,912
Your Royal Highness.

991
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:52,790
It is time for you

992
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:56,877
to take responsibility for your actions.

993
01:11:14,979 --> 01:11:16,647
This is for putting

994
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:21,068
the deposed queen's son on the throne!

995
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:42,881
His Majesty…

996
01:11:44,091 --> 01:11:45,301
will see to it…

997
01:11:47,177 --> 01:11:49,888
that you pay for your actions.

998
01:12:29,803 --> 01:12:31,430
It is His Majesty!

999
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:33,474
His Majesty is crazy!

1000
01:12:33,557 --> 01:12:35,225
His Majesty has lost his mind!

1001
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:47,905
Where is Lord Sung?

1002
01:12:47,988 --> 01:12:51,450
He awaits your command
at the king's quarters.

1003
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:55,662
Let us begin.

1004
01:13:03,587 --> 01:13:05,798
It is a beautiful night!

1005
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:40,666
Who are you?

1006
01:13:44,628 --> 01:13:45,671
Who goes there?

1007
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:51,385
Fire!

1008
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:01,311
Court Lady Choi!

1009
01:14:07,901 --> 01:14:09,069
Your Majesty…

1010
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:19,204
GANGNYEONGJEON

1011
01:14:29,089 --> 01:14:30,424
BONGDEOKGUNG FALLS

1012
01:14:30,507 --> 01:14:32,843
TWO HOURS AFTER REVOLT

1013
01:15:02,289 --> 01:15:03,916
What is that?

1014
01:15:04,958 --> 01:15:05,959
It looks suspicious.

1015
01:15:06,835 --> 01:15:08,378
I will inspect it first, Your Majesty.

1016
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:15,135
-It is the Chief Royal Secretary.
-Your Majesty!

1017
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:20,724
Stand guard.

1018
01:15:20,807 --> 01:15:21,642
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

1019
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:29,691
Your Majesty.

1020
01:15:30,734 --> 01:15:31,693
Your Majesty.

1021
01:15:31,777 --> 01:15:32,945
No, Your Majesty.

1022
01:15:33,612 --> 01:15:34,738
You must get away from here.

1023
01:15:38,408 --> 01:15:39,826
Your Majesty, you must go!

1024
01:15:40,994 --> 01:15:42,120
No!

1025
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:46,708
-Your Majesty!
-Keep still.

1026
01:15:48,752 --> 01:15:50,837
It is a trap set up by Grand Prince Jesan!

1027
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:57,553
Your Majesty!

1028
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:07,604
Your Majesty, you must take cover.

1029
01:16:09,147 --> 01:16:11,692
It is a trap! Protect His Majesty!

1030
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:21,076
Kill them all!

1031
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:24,204
Song-jae…

1032
01:16:24,288 --> 01:16:26,498
-Song-jae!
-Your Majesty!

1033
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:29,251
-This most treacherous subject of yours…
-No, Song-jae!

1034
01:16:32,504 --> 01:16:35,591
-strived to be loyal to you.
-Song-jae!

1035
01:16:35,674 --> 01:16:37,551
And in so doing, meets his end.

1036
01:16:37,634 --> 01:16:39,094
-No, Your Majesty!
-Song-jae!

1037
01:16:39,177 --> 01:16:41,847
-No! Song-jae!
-We must go, Your Majesty!

1038
01:16:44,516 --> 01:16:47,352
-No, Song-jae!
-You must get out of here, Your Majesty!

1039
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:51,398
-Song-jae!
-We must go, Your Majesty!

1040
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:54,026
-Im Song-jae!
-Your Majesty!

1041
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:56,153
We must go, Your Majesty!

1042
01:16:58,822 --> 01:16:59,781
You must get away.

1043
01:17:03,744 --> 01:17:06,622
Your Majesty,
you must get out of here immediately!

1044
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:08,540
Your Majesty!

1045
01:17:11,501 --> 01:17:14,171
Your Majesty, I will clear the way.

1046
01:17:14,254 --> 01:17:16,340
Please hurry and take cover!

1047
01:17:22,888 --> 01:17:23,930
What's going on?

1048
01:17:25,057 --> 01:17:25,974
Jeez, my head hurts.

1049
01:17:27,934 --> 01:17:28,769
Gong-gil?

1050
01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:31,647
What in the world is going on?

1051
01:17:32,230 --> 01:17:35,567
The red headbands on them tell me
they have taken over this place as well.

1052
01:17:36,151 --> 01:17:37,653
Let us get out of here first.

1053
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:39,988
What on earth is happening?

1054
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:42,282
And why did you bring me here?

1055
01:17:42,866 --> 01:17:44,451
If you do not get away now,

1056
01:17:44,951 --> 01:17:46,662
His Majesty will fall into greater danger.

1057
01:17:46,745 --> 01:17:47,579
What?

1058
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:50,540
I won't go until you tell me
what's going on.

1059
01:17:50,624 --> 01:17:52,084
Wait. Gong-gil!

1060
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:53,043
Gong-gil!

1061
01:17:53,126 --> 01:17:54,252
Who goes there?

1062
01:17:57,089 --> 01:17:58,590
Hurry! Follow me!

1063
01:18:00,467 --> 01:18:01,426
You've got to be kidding me.

1064
01:18:04,554 --> 01:18:06,139
Cook Yeon, hurry!

1065
01:18:09,184 --> 01:18:10,268
Who goes there?

1066
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:26,451
Cook Yeon!

1067
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:34,000
Red headbands.

1068
01:18:35,919 --> 01:18:36,878
Swords.

1069
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:38,839
Is this

1070
01:18:39,673 --> 01:18:40,716
a revolt?

1071
01:18:41,883 --> 01:18:43,301
What about His Majesty?

1072
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:45,053
What happened to him?

1073
01:18:55,105 --> 01:18:56,231
Cook Yeon.

1074
01:18:56,314 --> 01:18:57,482
You, above all,

1075
01:18:58,483 --> 01:19:00,026
must be safe.

1076
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:23,508
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

1077
01:19:24,342 --> 01:19:25,927
So that is what this was all about?

1078
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:30,974
I see you wanted to be king, Uncle.

1079
01:19:31,057 --> 01:19:32,726
Congratulations.

1080
01:19:33,351 --> 01:19:34,936
We must save His Majesty, no matter what.

1081
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:36,313
Will you please help me?

1082
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:39,566
Heon!

1083
01:19:39,649 --> 01:19:40,650
Cook Yeon.

1084
01:19:40,734 --> 01:19:41,860
If you do not come alone,

1085
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:44,070
the chief royal cook will die.

1086
01:19:45,113 --> 01:19:47,115
I wanted to settle things with you
