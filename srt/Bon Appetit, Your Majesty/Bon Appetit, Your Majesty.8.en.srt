1
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:49,966
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

2
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,658
YI HEON
KING OF JOSEON

3
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,952
I apologize for the delay.

4
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:22,290
We shall finally begin the competition.

5
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,793
The theme of the first dish is…

6
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:25,752
MAENG MAN-SU, EOM BONG-SIK

7
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:26,669
TANG BAILONG, YA FEIXIU, KONG WENLI

8
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,090
<i>Mu</i> for "nonexistent," <i>yuk </i>for "meat."

9
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,636
It is a meat dish
that has never been seen before.

10
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,313
You may begin cooking now.

11
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:03,873
Let's start making our first dish,
spicy <i>galbijjim</i>, braised short ribs.

12
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:04,916
- Yes.
- Yes.

13
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,585
- Let us begin cooking the diced chicken.
- Okay.

14
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,518
- Gil-geum.
- Yes.

15
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:24,936
- Cook Sim.
- Okay.

16
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,167
What? It's two against one?

17
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,252
Are two people cooking the main dish?

18
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,587
What are they doing?

19
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,380
So this is their plan?

20
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,784
Cook Eom.

21
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,832
- Ya Feixiu.
- Yes.

22
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:35,048
<i>What? The cook for the first round</i>
<i>is Ya Feixiu?</i>

23
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:36,758
<i>What are they thinking?</i>

24
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,602
<i>She's soaking the chicken</i>
<i>in salt, vinegar, and honey.</i>

25
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:50,521
<i>She's tenderizing the meat.</i>

26
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:51,981
<i>What is she making?</i>

27
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,066
<i>Stir-fried chicken?</i>

28
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:58,238
Let's focus.

29
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,031
Let's boil the meat.

30
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,621
<i>A mere braised short rib dish?</i>

31
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:11,209
Did I expect too much of her?

32
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,295
I will start cooking
when the meat is seasoned.

33
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,505
When will that be?

34
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,714
In half an hour.

35
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,132
Very well.

36
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,019
- Cook Maeng?
- I was done long ago.

37
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,772
The griddle is heated and ready too.

38
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:33,690
Good.

39
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,277
- Give me the <i>gochugaru, </i>chili powder.
- Cook Sim, where is the <i>gochogaru</i>?

40
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,029
Well, you see…

41
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,282
Cook Min is looking for it at Saongwon,
Office of Royal Meals.

42
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,285
- What?
- He should be here by now.

43
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,327
What…

44
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:50,540
Here he is.

45
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,042
I have bad news.

46
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,335
Why are you empty-handed?

47
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,796
The <i>gochogaru</i> is gone.

48
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,423
- What?
- What?

49
00:04:58,506 --> 00:04:59,966
What are you talking about?

50
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:02,760
We safely stored it in Saongwon.
Where could it have gone?

51
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,012
Did you look everywhere?

52
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,514
Yes. I searched every corner.

53
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,766
The gochojang and <i>gochogaru </i>are all gone.

54
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,186
What on earth is happening?
The competition has barely started!

55
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,896
Did you not check beforehand?

56
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,523
It was there just last night.

57
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,068
<i>This can't be.</i>

58
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,403
<i>I'm screwed.</i>

59
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,698
Cook Min, are you sure?

60
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:24,866
Yes.

61
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,034
There's no time for this.

62
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,410
If we don't have <i>gochugaru</i>,

63
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,037
- we have to change the dish.
- What?

64
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,622
How are we to change the dish now?

65
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,375
Let us just braise the short ribs
in soy sauce.

66
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,253
That is not a meat dish new to the world.

67
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,802
<i>I must prepare a meat dish</i>
<i>they've never seen before.</i>

68
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,263
<i>With short ribs.</i>

69
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,142
<i>A taste that doesn't exist in this era.</i>

70
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:57,774
<i>Yeah.</i>

71
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,108
<i>That's it.</i>

72
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,903
Everyone, please do as I say.

73
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,197
There's wild grape wine made with rice
at Saongwon, right?

74
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,074
- Yes, there is.
- Shall I go get it now?

75
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,700
- Yes. Hurry.
- Sure.

76
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:09,827
- And then…
- Why do we need that?

77
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,080
<i>I need more than just wild grape rice wine</i>

78
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,831
<i>to create the true flavors</i>
<i>of beef bourguignon.</i>

79
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,583
<i>It needs the flavor of bacon.</i>

80
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,752
Cook Eom, please get some pig fat

81
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:20,129
- and coat the griddle with it.
- Okay.

82
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,380
And then…

83
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,382
<i>I also need the aroma of mirepoix too.</i>

84
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,135
<i>Instead of onions, carrots, and celery…</i>

85
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:30,348
Cook Maeng, please chop
the Pyogo mushrooms, radish, and pumpkin.

86
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,307
Okay.

87
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,725
Gil-geum, drain the meat.

88
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:33,726
Okay.

89
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,786
- Gil-geum, get me a bowl of water.
- Okay.

90
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,872
- And drain the water from the pot.
- Okay.

91
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,625
<i>This is the best I can do right now.</i>

92
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,739
- Here is the wine.
- Good.

93
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,163
- Let's see.
- Check it first.

94
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:38,541
Great.

95
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,259
GRAND PRINCE JESAN
SUPERINTENDENT OF SAONGWON

96
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,552
That much?

97
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,971
Pour it all in there.

98
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,764
- All of it?
- All of it.

99
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:56,684
WILD GRAPE RICE WINE

100
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,565
This aroma.

101
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,610
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

102
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,528
This is definitely the aroma of wine.

103
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,491
A mixture of rice and wine.

104
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,952
She is cooking meat in wine.
What could she be making?

105
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,704
That is very strange.

106
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,207
Instead of adding a dash of wine
to get rid of the meat smell,

107
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,460
she is soaking all the meat in it.

108
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,631
- There is still more left?
- Yes.

109
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,633
They look anxious.

110
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:29,967
Whatever it is,

111
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:34,013
it surely is a meat dish
the world has never seen before.

112
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:37,892
No matter how hard they try,
they cannot win.

113
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,102
We will win

114
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:41,604
because…

115
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,109
I have this.

116
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,070
Here.

117
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,322
What did you just put in?

118
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,032
It's called bouquet garni.

119
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,660
It's a French herb bundle,
and I made the Joseon version.

120
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,787
<i>Oh, bucket garly.</i>

121
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,376
We're good. Now we let it simmer.

122
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,336
How long will it take?

123
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,091
An hour?

124
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,176
Half a <i>sijin</i>.

125
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,637
- We'll take turns watching the fire.
- Take turns, my foot.

126
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,347
Boiling is my specialty,

127
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,349
so I will make sure it does not burn.

128
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:19,308
Okay.

129
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,395
What should we call this dish?

130
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,480
It is braised, but…

131
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,566
Since it's a blend
of Joseon-style <i>galbijjim</i>

132
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,151
and western cooking techniques…

133
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:34,657
Maybe beef bourguignon <i>galbijjim</i>
braised in wild grape rice wine?

134
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,992
<i>What was that?</i>

135
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,369
<i>She said brabbling </i>galbijjim
<i>braised in wild grape rice wine.</i>

136
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:39,662
COURSE N° 8 RICE WINE BEEF BOURGUIGNON

137
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:46,752
<i>Cook Yeon,</i>
<i>what in the world are you making?</i>

138
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,672
Cooking meat in a pot of wine?

139
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:53,551
There is a great disparity in skill
compared to the Ming cooks.

140
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:58,431
It looks quite unlikely
that she will overpower them and win.

141
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,309
HAN MIN-SEONG
CHIEF STATE COUNCILOR

142
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:04,478
They are doubting the skills
of the Joseon cooks.

143
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,323
He says they were no match

144
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,241
for the best cooks of the Ming
to begin with.

145
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:19,952
However,

146
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,288
the true value of a dish
is not how it smells

147
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,707
but how it tastes.

148
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,960
Ultimately, it all comes down
to the excellence of the taste.

149
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:30,963
Our cooks

150
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:34,050
are known to possess the skills
of a <i>guksamussang</i> in Joseon.

151
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,135
GUKSAMUSSANG: INDIVIDUAL WHOSE TALENTS
ARE UNMATCHED THROUGHOUT THE NATION

152
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,138
I am sure it is as you say.

153
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,852
All the finest ingredients
would scarcely suffice,

154
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:47,897
yet she acts so recklessly.

155
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,858
Look at the Ming cooks.

156
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:53,361
Their knife skills are extraordinary.

157
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,196
We shall wait and see.

158
00:10:55,946 --> 00:11:00,618
Who knows? The wine-soaked meat
could have special qualities.

159
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,083
It's done.

160
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,834
Let's prepare the garnish.

161
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,796
<i>Cook Eom, please steam the pumpkin.</i>

162
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,632
<i>Cook Maeng,</i>
<i>please prepare some young greens.</i>

163
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,217
Here you go.

164
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,252
That is heavy.

165
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:03,597
Okay. We need 30 more minutes.

166
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,599
It'll be done in a quarter of a <i>sijin</i>.

167
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,561
Do we just have to wait now?

168
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:09,937
Yes, Cook Eom.

169
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,068
Will you check the plates and cutlery
in case they are blemished?

170
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,987
Let us start setting the tables.

171
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,113
- Okay.
- Okay.

172
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,423
Cook Maeng, can you pass me the milk?

173
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:38,841
Milk.

174
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,509
Is that pumpkin paste?

175
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,137
It's pumpkin purée.

176
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,930
Oh, hurray.

177
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:45,931
- Hurray.
- Purée.

178
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,834
What is this smell? It is so spicy.

179
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,838
It is a familiar smell
that stings the nose.

180
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,306
It can't be.

181
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,268
It does not smell like
the typical pepper used in the Ming.

182
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,441
No. There's no way.

183
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,698
- Uncle.
- Yes.

184
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,577
What is this oddly familiar spicy smell?

185
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,721
No.

186
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,390
It better not be.

187
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,935
I will go back to setting the tables.

188
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,437
Yes, let us do that.

189
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:23,112
That liquor looks special too.

190
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,154
What is that?

191
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:28,242
Is that not the legendary
Qufu Family Liquor?

192
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:31,495
You mean the liquor that is only
passed down in the Qufu family?

193
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:35,875
The Ming cooks in action
are truly an impressive sight.

194
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:40,087
However, I do not think that is
a meat dish the world has ever seen.

195
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:46,635
I do not know what Ya Feixiu is preparing,

196
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,638
but I am sure it is a dish
that the world has never seen before.

197
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,682
Not to mention the liquor
Kong Wenli has prepared,

198
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:54,351
which is also one of a kind.

199
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,562
Kong Wenli?

200
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,192
He says he is Confucius' descendant.

201
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,820
Kong Wenli will serve you liquor

202
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,866
you have never tasted before,
called Qufu Family Liquor,

203
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,534
to drink on the side.

204
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,578
<i>A one-of-a-kind liquor</i>

205
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,496
<i>served by Confucius' descendant</i>

206
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,582
<i>called Qufu Family Liquor?</i>

207
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,215
He says whatever food Ya Feixiu makes,

208
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:28,177
it will be a one-of-a-kind liquor
that suits a one-of-a-kind dish.

209
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,345
I very much look forward to it.

210
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,741
- Cook Yeon, let me do it.
- Oh, thank you.

211
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,493
Please put it on the griddle
so I can flambé it.

212
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:53,410
All right.

213
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,662
FLAMBÉ: ADDING ALCOHOL TO FOOD
AND BURNING IT OFF QUICKLY

214
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:58,332
Cook Maeng,
can you put some of the sauce in here?

215
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,668
- By "sauce," you mean the seasoning.
- Exactly.

216
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:37,746
How fascinating.

217
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,958
<i>A dish is completed</i>
<i>with the chef's final touch.</i>

218
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,589
<i>On top of the bourguignon</i>
<i>with a deep and rich flavor…</i>

219
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:35,345
<i>puffed rice is added</i>
<i>to give it a crunchy texture.</i>

220
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,350
<i>A flower is shaped from cucumbers.</i>

221
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,896
<i>Adding the pumpkin purée on top</i>
<i>will add a subtle sweetness.</i>

222
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,733
<i>Then the diced chicken</i>
<i>is carefully placed in the middle.</i>

223
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:58,619
<i>And that completes a meat dish</i>
<i>the world has never seen.</i>

224
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:02,247
<i>Lastly, topping it with fragrant</i>
<i>young greens completes the dish.</i>

225
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,337
The time is up.

226
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,840
The cooks are to step away
from the stations.

227
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:38,659
It is time for the tasting.

228
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,287
After you taste the food,

229
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:45,999
we will provide you
with paper, ink, and a brush.

230
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:49,086
Please rate the other nation's dish,
the highest score being ten.

231
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:55,175
First, you will taste the dish
made by the Joseon cooks.

232
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:35,275
The moment the meat touches my tongue,
it disappears as if it is melting away.

233
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,569
It is an incredibly tender dish
that I have never tasted before.

234
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,821
What is the name of this dish?

235
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:41,657
This dish is called

236
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,743
<i>beef bourguignon</i>
<i>braised in wild grape rice wine.</i>

237
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,120
It's a traditional French stew dish.

238
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:50,040
<i>We braised top-shelf short ribs</i>
<i>in wild grape rice wine for a long time</i>

239
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:54,294
to add deep flavor
and make it a Joseon-style <i>galbijjim</i>.

240
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,171
"Tough self" <i>galbi</i>?

241
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,384
Beef burgy yawn
braised in wild grape rice wine?

242
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,860
He says the meat
not only melts in his mouth,

243
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,071
but also has a sweet, fruity aroma.

244
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,323
It is truly delicious.

245
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,909
The deep flavor and aroma
of the wild grape rice wine

246
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:29,079
remain in my mouth,
yet I do not taste the wine.

247
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,039
Why is that?

248
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:36,128
The alcohol in the wine
evaporated as the meat simmered.

249
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,713
Not to mention the flambé.

250
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,755
Plum bay?

251
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,301
Oh, it's called "flambé."

252
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:45,345
You saw how the flames flared up
and died down earlier, right?

253
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,806
- That burned the remaining alcohol--
- "Our cool"?

254
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:51,727
No, so… It got rid of the wine taste.

255
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,188
Impressive indeed.

256
00:21:56,898 --> 00:22:00,694
It has a light and fresh aroma,

257
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:03,989
and the meat is so tender
that it melts in my mouth.

258
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:06,116
You are incredibly skilled.

259
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:11,747
I am certain not many cooks in the Ming
can make a dish like this.

260
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,419
He says that may be the case.

261
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,005
The natural flavor of the meat

262
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,882
goes well with the delicate aroma
of the wild grapes.

263
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:23,133
It is truly the finest of all delicacies.

264
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,760
Thank you.

265
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:36,605
He says it is still just <i>galbijjim</i>,

266
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,524
so it does not qualify as a dish
the world has never seen.

267
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,278
This is a dish

268
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,531
that doesn't exist in current times.

269
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:49,409
What does that mean?

270
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,119
It's a home-cooked meal
that will come about

271
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,955
a few hundred years from now
in the French countryside.

272
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:55,916
And also,

273
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,667
this is a personal story,

274
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,212
but this dish doesn't exist for me either.

275
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,174
This dish

276
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:08,553
is something that French mothers
prepare for their families.

277
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:12,349
Whenever I make this dish,

278
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:17,896
I imagine how it would taste
if my late mother

279
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,649
made it for me.

280
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,443
Therefore,

281
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:27,864
this dish doesn't exist in this era,

282
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:31,034
and it doesn't exist anywhere else
in the world for me as well.

283
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,889
Next, you will taste the dish
made by the Ming cooks.

284
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:05,986
What is this dish?

285
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:11,992
I made this
for the first time today, my lord.

286
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:23,003
It is made with chicken and nuts,
so she named it "<i>gyejeong</i>,"

287
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:25,130
and it is served with Qufu Family Liquor.

288
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,089
<i>"</i>Gyejeong<i>"?</i>

289
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,592
<i>That food was introduced later</i>
<i>in the Qing Dynasty.</i>

290
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:31,428
<i>What is Kung Pao chicken,</i>
<i>a Sichuan dish, doing here?</i>

291
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:35,265
<i>No way. Is she the creator of </i>gyejeong<i>?</i>

292
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:19,476
<i>It is pleasantly spicy yet sweet,</i>

293
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,061
<i>and even nutty.</i>

294
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,731
<i>It is very strong.</i>

295
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,650
<i>What is this?</i>

296
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,086
It is extremely moist.

297
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,755
How is that?

298
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,051
I cooked the chicken just enough

299
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:56,763
<i>that it was cooked all the way through</i>
<i>without losing its moisture.</i>

300
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:02,519
And she says peanuts were added
for the nutty flavor.

301
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:07,440
How did you create
this intense spicy flavor?

302
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:16,199
She said she added a secret sauce
to the chicken to make it spicy.

303
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,743
I wonder what that secret sauce is

304
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:24,082
that gave your dish
an intense yet captivating spiciness.

305
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:34,050
The clean yet rich taste
of the Qufu Family Liquor

306
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,011
balances out the spiciness.

307
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:39,139
I would expect no less of a liquor
passed down for generations.

308
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:48,398
However, in what way is your <i>gyejeong</i>
new to the world?

309
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,358
For a long time,

310
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,819
we have been eating a similar dish
in Joseon called chicken <i>gangjeong</i>.

311
00:26:57,324 --> 00:27:00,618
I have tasted that dish myself.

312
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,620
However, what I made is different.

313
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,921
She used a red oil called "<i>layu</i>"
that the world has never seen before.

314
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:14,424
A red oil called "<i>layu</i>"?

315
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,233
He says Ya Feixiu,
who created a new seasoning called <i>layu</i>,

316
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,110
is the pride of Ming.

317
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,787
He says the silky red
and fine-colored <i>layu</i>

318
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,122
is something no one has tasted before.

319
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,918
<i>I'm positive that she made that</i>
<i>with our </i>gochu<i>, chili peppers.</i>

320
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,212
<i>Even if she's a genius,</i>

321
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:54,214
<i>you can't make </i>layu<i> without </i>gochu<i>.</i>

322
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:55,757
<i>I have bad news.</i>

323
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,550
The <i>gochogaru</i> is all gone.

324
00:27:58,134 --> 00:27:59,135
<i>Did she…</i>

325
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:08,561
He is suggesting that you make
a decision now, Your Majesty.

326
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,146
Let us do that.

327
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:14,025
Which dish did you find more special?

328
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:20,448
I am sorry to say
I preferred Ya Feixiu's diced chicken

329
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,827
to Joseon's braised short ribs.

330
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:27,205
Joseon's dish was exceptionally good,

331
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:30,834
but it is hard to believe
that the dish does not exist in this era,

332
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:34,421
and the story behind it
was also too personal.

333
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:41,052
He says he cannot give a high score
to Joseon's <i>galbijjim</i>.

334
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:45,140
However, the beef burgy yawn
braised in wild grape rice wine

335
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:48,852
was definitely prepared in a way
that did not exist until now.

336
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:50,562
Therefore,

337
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:52,605
I cannot give a high score

338
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,358
to the Ming's version
of chicken <i>gangjeong</i>.

339
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,958
SEVEN

340
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,468
FOUR

341
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,913
I will announce the result
of the first round.

342
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,876
Wait, Your Majesty!

343
00:29:59,005 --> 00:29:59,923
What is it?

344
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,635
Before you announce the winner,

345
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:06,429
please allow me to taste Ming's dish.

346
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,733
He asks what your intention is
behind the request.

347
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,986
Ya Feixiu is certainly a great cook,

348
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,239
but I'd like to check something
before the final judgment.

349
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:26,991
How dare you? The judgment is to be made

350
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,827
- by His Majesty and the chief envoy.
- Wait.

351
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,163
I apologize, Director Yu.

352
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:37,085
What is it you wish to check?

353
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:40,672
- An ingredient, Your Majesty.
- An ingredient?

354
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:44,008
I won't know for sure
until I taste Ya Feixiu's dish.

355
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:48,555
Are you saying
she used a banned ingredient?

356
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,723
Please let me taste the food just once.

357
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,016
Please.

358
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,396
He will not allow it!

359
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:23,756
Uncle, why would you give that to her?

360
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:27,343
Bailong, what are you doing?

361
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,771
The result of any cooking competition

362
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:40,690
- comes down to the taste of the food.
- He is curious about the Joseon dish

363
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,483
and suggested
they taste each other's food.

364
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:45,153
Bailong, it is not for you to decide.
Step back!

365
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,155
Do you not mind that our cooks

366
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:51,659
may be subjected to mockery
by the cooks of this small nation?

367
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,121
Director Yu.

368
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,289
You should sit back down.

369
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:59,459
The pride of the Ming depends on this.

370
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:02,128
Please give your permission, my lord.

371
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:11,262
The cooks from both nations
wish to taste each other's food.

372
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:14,641
As the King of Joseon,
I give my permission.

373
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,358
He says he also gives his permission
as the chief envoy

374
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,193
of the great nation of Ming.

375
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,589
This taste…

376
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,218
<i>The aroma, color, and taste.</i>

377
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,553
<i>It lacks nothing at all.</i>

378
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,389
<i>This is truly</i>

379
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,684
<i>a perfectly balanced dish.</i>

380
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:07,318
<i>This is definitely </i>layu
<i>made with our </i>gochu.

381
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,990
Where did you get this red oil?

382
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,367
Is it an ingredient you brought?

383
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:21,791
Ya Feixiu.

384
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,714
- Yes?
- Where did you get the red powder?

385
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,886
She says she obtained the ingredient
through legitimate means in Joseon.

386
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,182
This is our <i>gochugaru</i>.

387
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:41,060
The cooks and I picked the <i>gochu</i>
and dried them in the sun.

388
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,729
We poured our hearts into making it.

389
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:47,608
It was a secret ingredient that had
a key role to play in the first round.

390
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,278
How did you get your hands on it?

391
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,783
<i>The </i>gochugaru<i> and gochujang</i>

392
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,828
are secret seasonings that will be
very important in the competition.

393
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,830
<i>Secret seasoning?</i>

394
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:03,124
<i>Then is she saying the red oil</i>

395
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,293
<i>was made using </i>gocho<i>?</i>

396
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,337
<i>How did the Ming cook obtain that?</i>

397
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,008
Your Excellency.

398
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,551
We can listen to
what the cooks have to say

399
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:16,262
after we decide on a winner.

400
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:19,348
Let us make a judgment now.

401
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,018
Director Yu.

402
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:24,771
For cooks,

403
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:28,649
ingredients are like a scholar's brush
and a warrior's sword.

404
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:31,486
If this happened to you,

405
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,237
would you let it slide?

406
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:40,703
Ya Feixiu.

407
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,247
Explain what happened.

408
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:47,001
Did you steal their ingredient?

409
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,879
Uncle, I did not steal it.

410
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:57,011
She says she obtained it fairly
by exchanging it with <i>huajiao</i>.

411
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,346
Were you aware

412
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:02,517
that Joseon's chief royal cook
was going to use it in the competition?

413
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,770
- Well…
- Ya Feixiu!

414
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:11,192
You did something a cook should never do.

415
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,986
You stole someone else's ingredient,

416
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:18,074
and you did not tell me about it.

417
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:21,619
Your conniving trickery

418
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:24,288
insulted the name of our great nation,
as well as this competition.

419
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:27,083
As a cook, I cannot forgive you for this.

420
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,043
Uncle…

421
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,088
Ya Feixiu did something

422
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:34,465
a cook should never do.

423
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:45,184
He says he will admit to the Ming's defeat
in the first round of the competition.

424
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,605
Tang Bailong!

425
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,859
Maintain your dignity, Director Yu.

426
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,653
It seems we have a winner.

427
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:02,994
The cooks you brought

428
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:06,873
certainly possess unmatched skill.

429
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:10,501
However, no matter how highly skilled
a cook may be,

430
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,336
one must learn

431
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:15,339
basic human decency first.

432
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,217
Do you not agree?

433
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,808
I appreciate what you said,

434
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,394
but what I want to know
is where you got this from.

435
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:34,317
The outcome of the first round is decided.

436
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,902
You won.

437
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:39,197
- No, that's not--
- Wait!

438
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:42,450
I did not lose.

439
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,410
Uncle.

440
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:46,412
I will prove

441
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:49,707
that I got the red powder
through legitimate means.

442
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,335
Admit your defeat, Ya Feixiu.

443
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:55,880
- You stole their ingredient.
- I did not!

444
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:10,102
She says she got the <i>gochogaru</i>
from Saongwon.

445
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,730
Saongwon?

446
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,566
That's impossible.

447
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:22,907
The person who gave it to her was…

448
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,750
It is him.

449
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,752
What? Who?

450
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,798
<i>Grand Prince Jesan?</i>

451
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:53,271
Uncle.

452
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,232
What is she talking about?

453
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,067
The Ming cook says you gave her

454
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,569
the chief royal cook's ingredient
without my permission.

455
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:02,697
Is she telling the truth?

456
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:19,880
Your Majesty.

457
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,173
With all due respect,

458
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:24,427
I did not need your permission.

459
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,638
When ingredients are admitted
to be used in the royal kitchen,

460
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:31,309
they are checked,
and only the produce cleared by me,

461
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,519
the Superintendent of Saongwon,
can be stored.

462
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,396
What are you saying?

463
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,939
I had heard

464
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:42,111
the chief royal cook was using
some red powder and red paste

465
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:45,323
in the royal kitchen
without proper approval.

466
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:46,449
That is why

467
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:49,327
I had them all thrown away.

468
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:55,291
For the health and well-being
of the royal family is paramount.

469
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,337
So you did not give it to the Ming cook?

470
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,798
You could say I did. I let her take it.

471
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,258
I did.

472
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:08,054
She offered to exchange it
for some valuable Ming <i>huajiao</i>.

473
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,723
I thought the trade was in our favor,

474
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:13,476
so I allowed her to take
as much as she needed.

475
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:18,064
Chief Royal Cook,
if you had told me in advance,

476
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:20,524
I would not have thrown it away.

477
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,193
What a shame.

478
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:34,789
Your Excellency, it seems
Grand Prince Jesan has made a mistake.

479
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:45,091
He says since Ya Feixiu is not at fault,
the scores should be announced.

480
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,512
Ya Feixiu.

481
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,556
Do you still not know what you did wrong?

482
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,058
Uncle.

483
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:55,643
I am innocent!

484
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:58,354
Even if you obtained the ingredient
in a legitimate manner,

485
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:00,564
you took it knowing the red powder

486
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:03,067
was Joseon's chief royal cook's
secret weapon.

487
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,693
As a result,

488
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:08,489
she had her ingredient stolen
without knowing it.

489
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:12,243
You do not deserve to be a master cook.

490
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:14,870
You are unqualified to be one.

491
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:18,707
This is your last chance.

492
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,043
If you have any pride left as a cook,

493
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:24,296
admit defeat.

494
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,008
Uncle.

495
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,386
He told her to admit defeat.

496
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,221
Excuse me.

497
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,642
I'm also responsible.

498
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,107
He says he refuses your pity.

499
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,066
No.

500
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,360
I'm at fault too.

501
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:50,573
I felt wronged that I lost the <i>gochugaru</i>
that I'd worked hard to make.

502
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,577
But I'm partly at fault for failing
to keep a valuable ingredient safe,

503
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,663
as I lacked the understanding
of how things work here.

504
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:59,373
So please stop.

505
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:12,303
He thanks you for your considerate words,
but claims that the Ming has still lost.

506
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:19,768
Do you not think

507
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:22,980
both cooks make a valid point?

508
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:26,609
The Ming cook received the ingredient
from the Superintendent of Saongwon,

509
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:27,818
so she is not to blame.

510
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:30,029
Joseon's chief royal cook

511
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,406
had the ingredient she prepared
stolen from her,

512
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,158
so she has the right to feel wronged.

513
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:38,370
That is right. Moreover,
the Ming's Chief Royal Cook Tang Bailong

514
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:42,291
has expressed that they have lost
regardless of the outcome.

515
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:43,375
That is right.

516
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:46,879
Even if you announce the Ming's victory,

517
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:50,591
the Ming cooks
will not accept that result.

518
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:52,343
Even if you rule in Joseon's favor,

519
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:56,096
it will do nothing
to console their hurt feelings.

520
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,139
However,

521
00:41:57,223 --> 00:42:00,309
we cannot annul the result
right from the first round.

522
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:02,853
The cooks' pride and the scores
are separate matters.

523
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:05,231
Therefore, the scores should be revealed.

524
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:06,774
Yes, that is right.

525
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:12,071
I can make no excuse for what happened.

526
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,407
Your Majesty.

527
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:18,494
I suggest you make the judgment.

528
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,456
In that case,

529
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,375
I shall annul the result

530
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,169
and call it a tie.

531
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:28,921
Your Excellency.

532
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:31,507
You cannot call it a tie when we won.

533
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,053
What do you mean you won?

534
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:38,264
The scores were not yet revealed.

535
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:43,769
He says he is sure the Ming won.

536
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:52,069
Let us do this.

537
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,655
In return for annulling today's result…

538
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,494
I will suggest something in Ming's favor.

539
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:04,456
Very well.

540
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:17,261
As this round proves too close
to determine the winner,

541
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:19,680
it is a tie.

542
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:26,812
However,

543
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:32,192
it is true that the Ming
came slightly ahead in this round,

544
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,737
as the cook developed
a new sauce called<i> layu.</i>

545
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:38,365
Nevertheless, since it was made
with an ingredient from Joseon,

546
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,367
this round will be considered a tie

547
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:43,078
with the grace of the King of Joseon.

548
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,415
In the upcoming rounds,

549
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:49,376
both sides must ensure nothing disgraceful
happens again due to ingredients.

550
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,920
And if all three rounds end in a tie…

551
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,966
it will be considered the Ming's victory.

552
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,220
<i>The Ming gets an advantage?</i>

553
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,598
<i>Does that mean I just lost?</i>

554
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:04,433
<i>There's no way.</i>

555
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:06,018
The second round

556
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:08,479
will be held here tomorrow
at the same time.

557
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:10,648
Be well prepared.

558
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:12,900
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Excellency.

559
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:49,645
- Wait.
- Goodness, that scared me.

560
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:50,729
Do you have more to say?

561
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:52,356
What is it?

562
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:59,154
She says she wants to apologize
to the chief royal cook.

563
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:01,698
What's this? She's really apologizing?

564
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:05,536
Not everyone admits to their mistakes.

565
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:07,830
Now you are acting like a cook
of a great nation.

566
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:09,706
Through this round,

567
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:14,294
I learned the attitude and mindset
a cook should have

568
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,296
toward their ingredients.

569
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,383
Thank you.

570
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:21,468
She thanks you for the lesson.

571
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:24,096
I also

572
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,683
learned that I should take better care…

573
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,812
of my ingredients, thanks to you.

574
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:42,406
She says you will learn even more tomorrow
since you will be up against her uncle.

575
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,992
I have nothing more to learn,

576
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,452
because I'll win tomorrow.

577
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:53,292
See you tomorrow, Chief Royal Cook.

578
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,847
This is driving me nuts.

579
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:10,434
I spoke confidently earlier,
but what am I going to do about tomorrow?

580
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:13,520
How could the Superintendent do that?

581
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:14,980
Where did all the <i>gochogaru</i> go?

582
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:19,276
We picked them until our fingers bled
and dried them until we wept,

583
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:20,444
and he just gave them all away.

584
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:21,904
We cannot lose tomorrow.

585
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:24,156
Even if it is a tie until the last round,
that is still our defeat.

586
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:25,532
My goodness.

587
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:28,869
What is important
is that we did not lose today.

588
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:30,120
That's enough, everyone.

589
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:32,080
Tomorrow's round is important,

590
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:34,291
and we don't have any <i>gochugaru.</i>

591
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:35,375
Goodness me.

592
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:39,880
All right.

593
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:42,090
First,

594
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,968
I'll explain tomorrow's dish.

595
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:46,887
- Gil-geum.
- Yes.

596
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:50,349
Do you all remember this <i>laziji </i>dish?

597
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:52,226
Yes. Spicy stir-fried duck.

598
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:55,270
Will we still manage
without the <i>gochogaru</i>?

599
00:46:56,688 --> 00:47:00,526
Would not <i>dongpo</i> pork be a better choice
if we want to trample on their pride?

600
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:01,777
What about clam and lotus root soup?

601
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,863
That is one of the Ming's
three great dishes.

602
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:08,033
No. We'll stick to what we prepared.

603
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:11,078
But instead of spicy duck <i>laziji</i>,

604
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,163
we're going to make Peking duck.

605
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,581
<i>Peking duck.</i>

606
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:18,126
<i>During a diplomatic conference</i>
<i>between the US and China in the 1970s,</i>

607
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:23,632
<i>this iconic dish is said to have</i>
<i>broken the tension in an instant.</i>

608
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:25,676
- What?
- Peking?

609
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:28,470
- Peking?
- Is that also a Ming dish?

610
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:29,846
I have never heard of it.

611
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,848
It's an imperial dish
that has been enjoyed

612
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,560
by the Ming imperial court for many years.

613
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:36,728
Is that not just a plain roasted duck?

614
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:37,771
Yes, it's a roast dish.

615
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:41,108
But it's not just any roasted duck.

616
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:44,987
The key is to blow in air
to separate the skin from the meat,

617
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:48,240
and it really isn't easy
to get the crispy texture on the skin.

618
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:52,578
Do you really think
that dish will captivate the chief envoy?

619
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:56,999
The chief envoy is someone
closely related to the imperial court.

620
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,627
He'll focus on how much care
and effort went into utilizing

621
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,754
traditional cooking techniques
and the harmony of flavors.

622
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:06,800
That's why the Peking duck,
an imperial dish, is the best choice.

623
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:13,932
<i>The only way to salvage the dried duck</i>
<i>without </i>gochugaru

624
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:16,226
<i>is to make Peking duck.</i>

625
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:20,230
First, you must learn about the hanging
roasting method we'll be using.

626
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:22,190
<i>The Joseon cooks</i>

627
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:24,735
<i>- were much more impressive</i>
- The duck…

628
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:26,862
<i>- than I thought.</i>
- Look.

629
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:30,490
Especially the chief royal cook.

630
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:33,327
A warrior's sword takes lives,

631
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:36,246
and a cook's knife gives life.

632
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,833
She is a true master.

633
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:44,129
It seems we have
greatly underestimated them.

634
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,256
We must win tomorrow.

635
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:52,512
Are all the ingredients prepared?

636
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,348
Yes, Brother Tang.

637
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:07,110
The Ming cooks were great,

638
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:11,948
but the <i>galbijjim </i>was truly remarkable.

639
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:13,408
I agree.

640
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:16,203
The talents of the cooks
were truly tempting.

641
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:22,959
It was a full day of good food
and good entertainment.

642
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:24,503
My goodness.

643
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:29,007
The moon is especially bright tonight.

644
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,677
It is bright indeed.

645
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,886
- Oh goodness.
- What?

646
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:34,304
Your Highness.

647
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:36,014
Please come with me.

648
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:37,849
His Majesty wishes to see you.

649
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,435
Me?

650
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:42,229
Uncle!

651
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:50,070
What were you thinking?

652
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:52,531
You knew of the competition with the Ming,

653
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:55,242
yet you discarded the chief royal cook's
ingredient at your own discretion?

654
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:57,285
Your Majesty.

655
00:49:57,369 --> 00:50:02,082
I sincerely apologize for my usual
carelessness and incompetence.

656
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:05,043
However, as I explained earlier,

657
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:08,171
I did what I did
for the sake of the royal family.

658
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:11,717
I never imagined that it would

659
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,261
affect the outcome of the competition.

660
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,221
Tell me.

661
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:20,142
Did you truly dispose of all the<i> gocho</i>?

662
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:23,395
I gave some to the Ming cook,

663
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:26,440
and the rest are in the storage.

664
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:27,441
Chief Royal Secretary!

665
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:36,199
Retrieve the <i>gochogaru</i> from his residence
and return it to the chief royal cook.

666
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:39,578
Yes, Your Majesty.
I will do as you command.

667
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:47,711
<i>A tie?</i>

668
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:50,088
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

669
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:52,424
In the event that the remaining rounds
also end in a tie,

670
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:54,509
the Ming will be ruled the victor.

671
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:57,846
Is that not a disadvantage to us?

672
00:50:57,929 --> 00:51:01,433
If His Majesty suggested
such a disadvantageous condition…

673
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:04,936
The chief royal cook
must have lost the first round.

674
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,688
However,
the first round concluded this way

675
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:11,276
because Grand Prince Jesan
gave the chief royal cook's ingredient

676
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,195
to a Ming cook by mistake.

677
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:14,112
What?

678
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:16,740
Grand Prince Jesan
took the chief royal cook's ingredient?

679
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:20,994
How could that be called a mistake?

680
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:23,872
As he is the Superintendent of Saongwon,

681
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:25,916
he must be related to this matter
in some way.

682
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:30,837
What could he stand to gain by discarding
the chief royal cook's ingredient?

683
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:42,682
So I hear today's round ended in a tie.

684
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:44,518
Yes, Your Grace.

685
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:48,146
I summoned you to confirm our agreement.

686
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:51,775
I am sure you remember.

687
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:53,819
We must lose at all costs tomorrow.

688
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:55,695
However, Your Grace,

689
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:59,115
I heard winning this competition
could bring Joseon a great profit.

690
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:02,494
Since when have you concerned yourself
with the matters of the state?

691
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:04,830
I apologize, Your Grace.

692
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:09,543
Your mother resides in Jecheon County,
does she not?

693
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:13,046
Your Grace, how did you…

694
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,139
HUIJEONGDANG
SECOND ROUND OF THE COMPETITION

695
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:24,683
<i>It is time to begin</i>

696
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:27,018
the second round of the competition
between Joseon and the Ming.

697
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:28,979
Today's theme is

698
00:52:30,146 --> 00:52:32,023
<i>ji </i>for "know,"<i> yeok</i> for "change<i>."</i>

699
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:34,860
You must cook a dish
from each other's country.

700
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:42,993
You may begin cooking now.

701
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:53,920
Let's start making our second dish,
Peking duck.

702
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,338
- Yes.
- Okay.

703
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:58,425
Use this and this. Let us begin.

704
00:52:58,508 --> 00:52:59,384
- Yes.
- Yes.

705
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:23,950
What's that smell?

706
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:47,933
My gosh. It smells lovely.

707
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:51,019
This is not the time
to be marveling at that.

708
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:55,023
Where did they get
such a massive lotus flower?

709
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:56,775
It is overwhelmingly big.

710
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:58,902
If my guess is right,

711
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:01,363
that big a lotus flower…

712
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:04,658
That is a golden lotus.

713
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:06,534
A golden lotus?

714
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:11,873
He asks if you have not seen one before.

715
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:15,543
It is surprising that a lotus flower
that big and yellow exists.

716
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:20,548
It is also known as the Emperor's lotus
due to its golden color.

717
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:48,034
Okay. We'll start
by hanging the ducks to roast.

718
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,035
- Okay.
- Okay.

719
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,705
- Cook Maeng, please bring this over too.
- Very well.

720
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:13,852
Duck?

721
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:21,818
Is that the Northern Capital roast duck?

722
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:24,195
Is that the fare of the Northern Capital?

723
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:27,991
It is a dish even the best Ming cooks
would not dare to make.

724
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:30,326
I wonder if it will even taste right.

725
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:36,583
He is doubting
the chief royal cook's skill.

726
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,668
Since my chief royal cook prepared it,

727
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:41,337
it will not be any ordinary roasted duck.

728
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,428
Roasting by hanging.

729
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:51,264
Must we do this
when it is not even a whole pig?

730
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:56,019
What if the meat overcooks
and becomes tough?

731
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:59,272
The strong heat will cook it slowly,
so the fat will get completely drained,

732
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:01,691
making the skin crispy
and the meat tender.

733
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,402
I hope that is the case.

734
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:06,738
Cook Maeng, please chop the vegetables.

735
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:08,740
Cook Eom, please cook the glutinous rice.

736
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:09,991
- Okay.
- Okay.

737
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,623
- Cook Sim, pass me the glutinous rice.
- Cook Min.

738
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,333
- Gil-geum.
- Yes?

739
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:20,376
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

740
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,328
Here we go.

741
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,248
Okay.

742
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:47,755
The skin is unbelievably shiny and golden.

743
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:51,468
Pouring oil over it like this
hardens the skin

744
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:53,219
- and makes it what again?
- Crispy.

745
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,554
That's right.

746
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:03,021
Let me try. Give it to me.

747
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:05,982
Thank you.

748
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:20,997
<i>The knife work is important.</i>

749
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,875
It's a stir-fried dish,
but before the meat meets the sauce,

750
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:26,586
the skin and meat
must be thin and evenly sliced

751
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:27,754
for maximum flavor.

752
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:28,963
Cook Eom, have a go.

753
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:30,423
My gosh.

754
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:32,842
I even cut the bones.

755
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:34,802
You are crushing the whole thing.

756
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:37,472
- I forgot how to start.
- Cook Maeng.

757
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:40,850
Can you do it yourself, Chief Royal Cook?

758
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:45,104
Is this not good enough?

759
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:49,609
Gil-geum, you're good at this.

760
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:01,829
We must lose at all costs tomorrow.

761
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:04,123
If you disobey me again this time,

762
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:07,544
<i>I cannot guarantee your mother's safety.</i>

763
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:19,889
<i>Do you understand?</i>

764
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,433
This is the last chance I am giving you.

765
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:25,979
Oh my!

766
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:27,480
- Oh no.
- Blood!

767
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:28,690
- Stop the bleeding first!
- Oh dear.

768
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:30,233
- Gil-geum!
- Yes.

769
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:32,318
You should have been careful!

770
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:34,487
- Press on it.
- This is not like you.

771
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,072
- My goodness, how did this happen?
- What happened?

772
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:37,824
You rarely make a mistake.

773
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:39,826
You must have been too nervous.

774
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:41,911
Goodness me. Stop the bleeding.

775
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:43,037
- Okay.
- Press it.

776
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:48,084
There's no time. I'll do it.

777
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:00,513
What an outrageous sight.

778
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:03,141
They cannot even handle a knife.

779
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:08,980
He says that the Joseon cooks
lack basic skills.

780
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:12,525
Basic skills?

781
01:00:15,194 --> 01:00:17,739
You get ink on your hands
when you first learn to write,

782
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:20,158
and you are bound to hurt yourself
when cooking.

783
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,453
Since we saw blood,

784
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:26,664
it seems that the duck dish
will turn out very well.

785
01:00:28,082 --> 01:00:29,083
Of course.

786
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:32,670
If that is what Your Excellency thinks,
who am I to object?

787
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:35,798
I will do it.

788
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:40,762
- Goodness, give it to me.
- I will just do it.

789
01:00:40,845 --> 01:00:42,680
- Just give it to me.
- Let go!

790
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:44,599
How can you do it when I cannot do it?

791
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:46,809
- We have no choice. I'll just do it.
- There is no time.

792
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:49,604
Be careful.

793
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:56,819
Can you manage with your sore hand?

794
01:00:58,112 --> 01:01:00,156
My goodness, miss.

795
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:02,825
You cannot cut anything with that hand.

796
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:04,744
This will not do.

797
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:07,205
I will try it.

798
01:01:07,288 --> 01:01:09,123
What are you talking about?

799
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:10,792
- Not even we--
- Wait.

800
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:14,337
Are you sure, Gil-geum?

801
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:16,798
Trust me this once.

802
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:20,677
If I try and fail, you can do it then.

803
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:29,644
Okay. You do it, Gil-geum.

804
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,561
Okay.

805
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:37,193
It looks like
they have given up on this round.

806
01:01:46,327 --> 01:01:48,996
<i>Maid Seo, take over the knife work</i>
<i>in the competition.</i>

807
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,748
What do you mean?

808
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,166
You have talent.

809
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:55,336
I will teach you,
so learn how to use a knife.

810
01:01:57,004 --> 01:01:58,965
<i>We will remove the skin from the meat.</i>

811
01:02:05,012 --> 01:02:06,889
<i>Hold the end gently.</i>

812
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:09,642
<i>Do not use too much force.</i>

813
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:12,395
<i>Remove the skin only. Just the skin.</i>

814
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:15,022
<i>That is it.</i>

815
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:17,400
<i>Do not let it tear.</i>

816
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:24,073
<i>Next, the scraping.</i>

817
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:28,286
<i>Stay calm. You are almost there.</i>

818
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:32,290
<i>Yes. That is exactly it.</i>

819
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:35,710
<i>Stay calm and focus until the end.</i>

820
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:45,178
Well done, Gil-geum.

821
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:47,930
My legs were shaking so much.

822
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:50,266
I do not know how I managed.

823
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:52,143
No, it's fine. You did really well.

824
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:57,607
<i>Well done, Maid Seo.</i>

825
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:59,901
<i>And thank you.</i>

826
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:05,531
You should have stepped up sooner.

827
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:07,283
Indeed. That was great.

828
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:14,582
Cook Maeng, I saw that Gil-geum's hand
became a mess.

829
01:03:14,665 --> 01:03:16,083
What happened yesterday?

830
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:17,919
I am sorry.

831
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:19,462
For what?

832
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:20,797
You will lose this competition

833
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:23,257
because of me.

834
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:24,926
What?

835
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:28,346
Will you explain so that I can understand?

836
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:32,725
I must withdraw from the competition,
but I cannot do so.

837
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:36,354
Are you being threatened?

838
01:03:36,437 --> 01:03:37,480
Is it the Ming?

839
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:40,066
You are.

840
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:42,068
It's that sleazy envoy, isn't it?

841
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:44,403
Do not ask any further.

842
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:49,033
Is it Kang Mok-ju?

843
01:03:53,538 --> 01:03:55,206
No, it is not her.

844
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,961
<i>Peking duck tastes best when sliced well,</i>

845
01:04:00,044 --> 01:04:02,839
<i>and a competition is more entertaining</i>
<i>when there's a twist.</i>

846
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:09,804
<i>A layer of chewy glutinous rice</i>

847
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:12,348
<i>is placed on top of the flattened</i>
<i>and scraped duck skin.</i>

848
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:18,020
<i>Mixed grains rice,</i>
<i>ginkgo nuts, and pumpkin</i>

849
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:20,106
<i>are placed on the lotus leaf.</i>

850
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:23,693
<i>Onto that goes the sliced cucumber</i>
<i>and green onion for a refreshing taste.</i>

851
01:04:24,485 --> 01:04:27,822
<i>It is then wrapped to trap the aroma.</i>

852
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:36,539
<i>That's rolled up</i>
<i>and cut into bite-sized pieces.</i>

853
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:43,045
<i>Thus becomes a golden lotus leaf wrap.</i>

854
01:04:44,505 --> 01:04:46,382
<i>It's garnished with taro mousse</i>

855
01:04:47,758 --> 01:04:50,428
<i>and served with </i>majiang<i> sauce.</i>

856
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:05,151
<i>To complete the dish,</i>

857
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:08,696
<i>it is served with five-colored</i>
<i>lotus roots and refreshing radish.</i>

858
01:05:08,779 --> 01:05:10,865
<i>And that completes the Peking duck rolls.</i>

859
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:18,998
The dishes from both sides are complete.

860
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:21,751
The cooks are to step away
from the stations.

861
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:43,230
First, we will taste the dish
made by the Ming cook, Tang Bailong.

862
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:44,917
<i>It is truly impressive that he captured</i>
<i>the deep flavors of Joseon in such a way.</i>

863
01:06:46,627 --> 01:06:48,963
<i>The subtle but elegant aroma.</i>

864
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:04,645
<i>The deep and elegant flavor</i>

865
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:08,649
<i>subtly yet consistently draws me in.</i>

866
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,486
<i>Is this truly the taste of Joseon?</i>

867
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:15,364
<i>One mouthful</i>

868
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:18,451
<i>makes me feel as if</i>
<i>I am being covered by a lotus flower.</i>

869
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:30,296
How did you create

870
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:32,256
the five colors in the braised lotus root?

871
01:07:35,426 --> 01:07:38,054
This is a temple dish

872
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:40,598
<i>in which various vegetables of Joseon</i>
<i>are wrapped</i>

873
01:07:40,681 --> 01:07:43,100
<i>and cooked in golden lotus leaves.</i>

874
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:44,977
As for the five colors,

875
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:49,106
the red comes from <i>omija,</i>
and it represents benevolence.

876
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:53,652
<i>The yellow comes from gardenia,</i>
<i>and it represents righteousness.</i>

877
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:58,574
<i>The green comes from mulberry leaves,</i>
<i>and it represents propriety.</i>

878
01:07:58,657 --> 01:08:02,953
<i>The black comes from soy sauce,</i>
<i>and it represents wisdom.</i>

879
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:04,497
VINEGAR

880
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:11,837
Lastly, the white, representing sincerity,

881
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:13,839
is the natural color of the lotus root
pickled in vinegar.

882
01:08:14,548 --> 01:08:15,633
I see.

883
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:17,384
Bailong.

884
01:08:17,468 --> 01:08:21,931
When did you learn
how to cook Joseon temple fare?

885
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:30,022
There was a time…

886
01:08:32,024 --> 01:08:36,695
when I wandered the lands
in search of the ultimate taste.

887
01:08:37,446 --> 01:08:40,533
However, I could not find such a taste

888
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:43,536
and was plagued by torment.

889
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:45,788
Back then…

890
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:50,126
10 YEARS AGO

891
01:09:02,596 --> 01:09:06,225
This cannot be the pulse of a living man.

892
01:09:06,308 --> 01:09:08,727
Homage to the Amitabha Buddha.

893
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:19,905
You should eat.

894
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:22,992
At least have some mallow soup.

895
01:09:23,075 --> 01:09:24,785
It is light enough to just drink.

896
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:31,333
<i>This is the most delicious soup</i>

897
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:34,336
<i>I have ever tasted in my life.</i>

898
01:09:36,213 --> 01:09:39,800
What is used to make this soup?

899
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:41,844
You are not from Joseon.

900
01:09:42,553 --> 01:09:44,513
Please teach me,

901
01:09:45,097 --> 01:09:46,390
Venerable.

902
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:52,771
In order to find the ultimate taste,

903
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:56,150
I traveled to many temples
all around Joseon.

904
01:09:57,484 --> 01:09:59,320
The meal served before you

905
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:06,452
consists of the dishes I learned
from the venerable monk who saved my life.

906
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:09,830
Are you saying
you learned how to cook in Joseon?

907
01:10:09,914 --> 01:10:11,123
Yes.

908
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:15,294
I spent around five years in Joseon.

909
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:22,760
Why did you hide the fact that
you could speak the Joseon language?

910
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:28,182
He says he never hid it,
and that the Director simply never asked.

911
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:37,691
The rice wrapped in the lotus leaf
shows great wisdom

912
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:39,902
as well as depth.

913
01:10:51,038 --> 01:10:52,915
He says the rice is soft and sticky,

914
01:10:52,998 --> 01:10:55,334
and the root is crunchy,
yet chewy and tender.

915
01:11:02,633 --> 01:11:04,760
He says he appreciates
the harmony of the taste and aroma

916
01:11:04,843 --> 01:11:06,345
sealed into each lotus root.

917
01:11:07,012 --> 01:11:10,015
I am in awe of this food.

918
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:13,894
The result is as clear as day.

919
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:14,853
That is right.

920
01:11:19,066 --> 01:11:21,610
<i>What a touching story.</i>

921
01:11:22,152 --> 01:11:24,154
<i>This round won't be easy.</i>

922
01:11:24,738 --> 01:11:26,782
<i>Although what happened</i>
<i>with the </i>gochugaru<i> was made right</i>

923
01:11:26,865 --> 01:11:28,701
<i>thanks to his great character,</i>

924
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:30,286
<i>I don't want to lose either.</i>

925
01:11:34,331 --> 01:11:37,126
Now, it is the Joseon cooks' turn.

926
01:11:37,209 --> 01:11:39,712
Those from the royal kitchen,
step forward.

927
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:47,344
Now, we will taste the dish
made by the Joseon cooks.

928
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:51,557
What is this dish called?

929
01:11:52,182 --> 01:11:54,852
This is Peking duck.

930
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:57,730
<i>It's an ancient dish</i>
<i>from the Central Plains,</i>

931
01:11:57,813 --> 01:11:59,565
<i>often enjoyed by the imperial court.</i>

932
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:03,027
You can eat the pieces of skin
sprinkled with sugar as is,

933
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:06,030
<i>and the rolls are to be dipped</i>
<i>in the </i>majiang<i>, a sesame-based sauce.</i>

934
01:12:06,113 --> 01:12:08,198
Northern Capital roast duck, you say?

935
01:12:23,797 --> 01:12:25,382
He is mocking you,

936
01:12:25,466 --> 01:12:28,010
saying it might be easy to make,
but it is hard to make it taste right.

937
01:13:57,099 --> 01:14:00,602
A crispy and clean taste
with just the right amount of greasiness.

938
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:03,897
And what is this sweet flavor
that comes through?

939
01:14:13,657 --> 01:14:16,618
No. It is not just sugar.

940
01:14:21,165 --> 01:14:23,208
There is more to it.

941
01:14:24,918 --> 01:14:28,046
This is not the roast duck I had
in the imperial court.

942
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:29,673
It is a completely new taste.

943
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:34,094
What is more surprising

944
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:38,098
is that the duck does not at all
smell gamey or earthy.

945
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:48,692
The <i>majiang</i> sauce

946
01:14:48,775 --> 01:14:50,444
enhances the nutty and sweet flavor,

947
01:14:51,195 --> 01:14:53,489
and it goes well with the unique,
clean taste of the roast duck

948
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:57,576
that it feels as if all three flavors
flood my mouth at once.

949
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:02,289
The skin is crispy, the meat is moist,

950
01:15:02,372 --> 01:15:06,835
and together with the shredded
green onion and cucumber,

951
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:10,339
they create a perfect harmony.

952
01:15:10,422 --> 01:15:11,507
This dish…

953
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:12,591
It is…

954
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:15,177
- The greatest taste on the land.
- The greatest taste on the land.

955
01:15:21,433 --> 01:15:23,977
What is the sweetness
infused into the skin

956
01:15:24,061 --> 01:15:25,562
of the roast duck you made?

957
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:28,607
It's pumpkin.

958
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:34,905
It is a cooking method
I have never heard of before.

959
01:15:34,988 --> 01:15:39,576
To think that you managed to infuse
the flavor of pumpkin into the skin,

960
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:43,163
as expected,
you surely are no ordinary cook.

961
01:15:43,747 --> 01:15:47,292
How can duck meat
be so unbelievably juicy?

962
01:15:48,168 --> 01:15:51,630
You indeed have the skill
befitting a <i>gwinyeo</i>.

963
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:58,428
This concludes
the tasting of the second round,

964
01:15:58,512 --> 01:16:00,430
and the evaluation will follow.

965
01:16:57,321 --> 01:16:59,656
I will announce
the scores for the second round.

966
01:17:37,694 --> 01:17:40,614
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

967
01:17:41,281 --> 01:17:42,699
<i>It was my mistake</i>

968
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:45,160
<i>to risk the future of the nation</i>
<i>on a cooking competition.</i>

969
01:17:45,243 --> 01:17:46,161
No.

970
01:17:46,745 --> 01:17:49,456
<i>Even if we lose, we should do our best</i>
<i>until the very end.</i>

971
01:17:49,539 --> 01:17:52,209
<i>What if the lid does not arrive in time?</i>

972
01:17:52,292 --> 01:17:53,502
<i>We'll go with Plan B.</i>

973
01:17:54,419 --> 01:17:55,462
<i>This is our opportunity.</i>

974
01:17:55,545 --> 01:17:57,589
<i>If it means we can eliminate</i>
<i>the chief royal cook</i>

975
01:17:57,673 --> 01:18:00,300
and make His Majesty explode with fury.

976
01:18:00,384 --> 01:18:02,344
<i>What I say is of the utmost secrecy.</i>

977
01:18:02,427 --> 01:18:03,970
<i>Treachery.</i>

978
01:18:04,054 --> 01:18:04,930
It cannot be.

979
01:18:06,723 --> 01:18:08,600
<i>You want the chief royal cook</i>
<i>as a tribute woman?</i>

980
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:17,109
