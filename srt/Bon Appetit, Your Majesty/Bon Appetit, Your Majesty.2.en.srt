BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

2
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:51,968
Hey, there are people.

3
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,722
Over here! We're over here!

4
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,015
Who is down there?

5
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,516
- We're over--
- Miss!

6
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,684
What--

7
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,480
Why are you stopping me, Gil-geum?

8
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,439
<i>Chaehong.</i>

9
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,316
What?

10
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,109
<i>Chaehong!</i>

11
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,611
CHAEHONG: THE SELECTION OF BEAUTIFUL WOMEN
AND HORSES DURING YEONHUIGUN'S REIGN

12
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:16,451
Wait, that's actually the <i>chaehong</i>
happening right now?

13
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:17,452
Yes.

14
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:19,704
We might also get dragged away,

15
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,206
so follow me.

16
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,000
This is unbelievable.

17
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,461
After all I have been through
to hide from them,

18
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:28,505
there is no way
I am getting taken away like this.

19
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,715
Where do you think
you are sneaking off to?

20
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:35,887

<i>This is kidnapping!</i>

22
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,352
This is a crime! Let us out right now!

23
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,062
- Miss!
- Be quiet!

24
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:48,066
- Mister!
- Please stop. Screaming will not help.

25
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,235
Are you telling me to just keep quiet?

26
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,445
What is this place anyway?

27
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,947
A prison in the governor's office.

28
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,199
We are here for the <i>chaehong.</i>

29
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,661
This is just ridiculous!

30
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,955
You girls. Keep quiet.

31
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:04,916
Can you not tell where we are
by the looks of it?

32
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:07,752
None of us wants or deserves to be here.

33
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,295
- That is right.
- Yes.

34
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,755
If you keep shouting,

35
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,174
I will sew your lips shut.

36
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,635
You are here for the <i>chaehong</i>,
for goodness' sake.

37
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,264
This can't be real.

38
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,392
This is just unbelievable.

39
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:23,977
Truly unbelievable.

40
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,272
Why do you keep saying
that it is unbelievable?

41
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:34,320
<i>This prison looks like</i>

43
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,078
This is so weird.

44
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,539
Everything's so weird.

45
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,916
What the…

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,628
<i>Did I really land in Joseon?</i>

Miss.

49
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:57,552
Even if the sky falls in,
there is always a way out.

50
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:00,555
We should try to stay strong.

51
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,308
So this place…

52
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,561
is Joseon, right?

53
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,813
How many times must I tell you so?

54
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,319
- Open this door!

Oh my! What are you doing to her?

00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:25,872
What do I do? Help!

00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,626
Let me go! No!

WHY ON EARTH?

Oh, that's hot! "<i>Mangunrok</i>"?

77
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:24,472
<i>What?</i>

00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,809

<i>I see you finally get it.</i>

84
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,154
I am the king of this country.

85
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,239
Is this a dragon?

86
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,365
Fine.

87
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,034
Once we return to the palace,

88
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,037
I will grant you a royal favor.

89
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,082
Grant a royal favor?

90
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,042
<i>He actually is the king?</i>

91
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,377
Everything on this land belongs to me.

92
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,837
There is no member of the royal family
I do not know of.

93
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,755
Who on earth is this Yeonhuigun?

94
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,258
<i>Is he Yeonhuigun?</i>

95
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,562
<i>First, I have to get out of here.</i>

96
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,064
<i>I'll get out and find a way back somehow.</i>

97
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,733
What is happening?

98
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,484
Step outside.

99
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,694
- Pardon?
- Sorry?

100
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,282
Where are we going?

101
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,993
Where are we going?

102
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,370
What do you think, my lord?

103
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,123
- Left.
- Go to the left.

104
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:33,958
Come here. Stand in front of us.

105
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,296
- Look up. How old are you?
- I am 20.

106
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:41,674
- Gil-geum, what are they doing?
- Left.

107
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:46,345
It looks like they are
dividing the women into two groups.

108
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,639
The <i>chaehong</i> inspector must be coming.

109
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,266
<i>Chaehong </i>inspector?

110
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,727
Are you saying
I could become the king's woman?

111
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,187
You never know.

112
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,690
That does not happen to just anyone
who is picked.

113
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,568
This is driving me insane.

114
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,487
What a disaster.

115
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,990
Miss, it is a disaster for everyone here.

116
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,992
That's not what I mean.

117
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,620
I'm not from here!

118
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,247
You think you can avoid the <i>chaehong</i>
if you are not from here?

119
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,707
That's not the point.

120
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,666
Next.

121
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,588
Why are you standing there? Step forward.

122
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,256
Come on over.

123
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:24,884
How old are you?

124
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,220
I'm 27.

125
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:31,682
Left.

126
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,977
- You are too old.
- What?

127
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,397
- He said you are too old.
- Next.

128
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,067
Step forward.

129
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,155
Why are you standing and gawping?

130
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,700
I am 30 years old.

131
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,081
How insolent! You should not lie.

132
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,834
You look to be about 17.

133
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:02,213
Then what about 28?

134
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,214
Left.

135
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:05,925
Next.

136
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,009
Go to the left.

137
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,137
Come on.

138
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,267
Gil-geum.

139
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,686
This is a relief, but for some reason…

140
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,313
I am a little insulted.

141
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:24,610
Women on the right,
go to the annex and dress up.

142
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,987
Women on the left,

143
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,573
go to the <i>chanbang</i>
and help prepare the <i>jeopbingaek</i>.

144
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:29,657
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

145
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,200
<i>"</i>Chanbang<i>"?</i>

146
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,422
Your Majesty,
this was found by the stream.

147
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,387
<i>Oh my gosh, I'm aching all over.</i>

148
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,183
<i>What a weird day this has been.</i>

149
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,434
YI HEON
KING OF JOSEON

150
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:57,685
Was there anything else?

151
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:58,978
Judging by the footprints of the guards,

152
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,730
it seems they were taken
to the governor's office.

153
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,442
So it seems she walked right into it.

154
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,359
Let us go.

155
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,819
Yes, Your Majesty.

156
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,446
To the Gyeonggi Governor's Office!

157
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:09,989
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

158
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:17,413
COURSE Nº 2 SOUS VIDE CUISINE

159
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,165
Get moving.

160
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:26,797
This place really looks just like
what I saw in the dramas.

161
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,094
This is real brassware.

162
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,973
- It's soy sauce.
- "Soy sauce"?

163
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:38,392
It's rich.

164
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,769
Is this vinegar?

165
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,063
- I think it's vinegar.
- Gosh, it is sour.

166
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,400
This is called "<i>dunggumi</i>."

167
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,528
It is a basket used for storing grain
or vegetables.

168
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:49,862
"<i>Dunggumi.</i>"

169
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,450
A cast-iron brazier.

170
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,078
They use this to cook meat or fish.

171
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,496
This is quite rare.

172
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,039
There's a gridiron too.

173
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:02,542
- We call that "<i>jeokcheol</i>."
- "<i>Jeokcheol</i>."

174
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,459
JEOKCHEOL: TOOL USED TO COOK MEAT AND FISH

175
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:05,586
That's a <i>beoseon</i>-tip knife.

176
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,712
BEOSEON-TIP KNIFE:
A KNIFE SHAPED LIKE A POINTED SOCK

177
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,340
The tip really points up and is sharp.

178
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:12,677
Goodness me, how can you cook
when you do not know anything?

179
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:16,138
What are you two brats doing?

180
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,265
Are you lolling about here?

181
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,892
- "Lolling"?
- Hurry up and get to work!

182
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,144
Okay. Sorry.

183
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,813
Miss, we should hurry up and get to work.

184
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,483
- What can we--
- Gil-geum.

185
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:31,237
Working fast won't get us anywhere.

186
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,239
What does that mean?

187
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,664
What are you cooking?

188
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,708
Can you not tell?

189
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,627
Look at this slippery thing.
I am cooking seaweed soup.

190
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,136
Why are you cutting the radish?

191
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:57,054
- To make radish soup.
- What?

192
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,599
But she's cooking seaweed soup over there.

193
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,268
- What?
- This has got to be a joke.

194
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:06,939
Everyone, who told you to do
whatever you're doing?

195
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,358
Would we be doing this if we knew?

196
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,278
The kitchen maids ran away last night.

197
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,405
Why did they leave?

198
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,324
I have no idea.

199
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,701
Why does that matter?

200
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,370
Are you going to stand there
and slack off?

201
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:25,583
We should at least know
who we're cooking for.

202
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,002
Does anyone know anything?

203
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:29,795
Do you know?

204
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:30,963
Do you?

205
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,173
No.

206
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,354
- The shoot tips are fresh.
- They are.

207
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,230
Miss.

208
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,359
There are not many ingredients,

209
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,654
but the ones remaining are pretty fresh.

210
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,532
You're right.
It's not that they weren't prepared.

211
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:01,410
The ingredients disappeared,

212
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,704
almost as if someone ran off with them.

213
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:04,622
What?

214
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,211
Gather round, everyone.

215
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,841
I see you are all hard at work.

216
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:19,053
Someone high up is visiting from Hanyang.

217
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:22,723
If you do not serve them a meal
with nine side dishes,

218
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:23,933
it will be an absolute disaster.

219
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,936
So use every last bit of strength you have
to prepare the meal.

220
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,439
This is pure madness.

221
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,525
All I ever made was soybean paste soup,

222
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,318
and now you want a meal
with nine side dishes?

223
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,362
Wait, mister.

224
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:37,863
What?

225
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:41,742
I'm sorry to ask this,
but why should we prepare that?

226
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,536
You were not taken for the <i>chaehong</i>.

227
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:46,330
Then you should send us all home.

228
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,250
You were brought here,

229
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,335
and you cannot leave without permission.

230
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,170
But we didn't commit any crime.

231
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,922
How dare you talk back to me?

232
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,966
Do you need a good flogging
to come to your senses?

233
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,970
Miss, you really need to stop.

234
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:06,684
If we do this well,

235
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,436
will you let us go?

236
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,063
If you were to prepare a great meal,
then I guess so.

237
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:12,982
All right then.

238
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,276
How old are the visitors?

239
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,820
What? You mean their age?

240
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,823
What food do they like? Meat? Seafood?

241
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:21,782
Are they allergic…

242
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,827
- I mean, is there anything they can't eat?
- How would I know?

243
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,413
Stop yapping and get to work. Now!

244
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,415
Wait.

245
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:33,335
Cooking food
isn't the same as making an object.

246
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,087
It's not something
you can just throw together.

247
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,799
Are you saying
you want me to find out all those details?

248
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,384
You said they were important people.

249
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,719
Do you just want me to do as I please?

250
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,347
Cooking is about
putting your heart into the dish.

251
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,725
My goodness.

252
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,226
Who are you?

253
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:58,027
Well, I'm not from here.

254
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,195
I'm a chef…

255
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,780
I mean, I'm a cook.

256
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,116
I can't cook a good meal

257
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,160
without knowing anything about the guests.

258
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,828
You are quite the brazen one.

259
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,456
How dare you make up such an excuse?

260
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:11,624
It's not an excuse.

261
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,628
Everyone here is new to this kitchen,

262
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,505
and there are almost no ingredients.

263
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,465
What would happen
if we chose to cook the wrong dish?

264
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,759
You don't want that, do you?

265
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,350
What you said…

266
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,186
is correct.

267
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,939
- My word.
- Oh, save me.

268
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,649
What do you suggest we do?

269
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,901
I need to know basic details
like the guests' tastes,

270
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,694
their age, and their occupation.

271
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:41,820
And once you know that,

272
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,239
will you be able to complete a dish

273
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,783
that will satisfy them
within the given time?

274
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,702
It'll be the guests who decide
whether they like the food or not,

275
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,079
but I'm confident.

276
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,540
Even though
the ingredients are insufficient?

277
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:55,668
Even so, there's still a shot
if the food is to the guests' taste

278
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,003
and it's made with care.

279
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,548
Using the best ingredients

280
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:03,926
doesn't always mean
you make the best dish.

281
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,388
Oh my, miss.

282
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,350
Very well.

283
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:15,020
However, you must take responsibility
for what you said.

284
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:18,023
One wrong move,
and you could lose your life.

285
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,401
My life?

286
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:24,196
Then I have a condition too.

287
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,614
A condition?

288
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,909
If the guests are satisfied with my food,

289
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,411
I want you

290
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,247
to release us all tonight.

291
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:34,915
Very well.

292
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,001
Follow me.

293
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,465
Listen carefully.

294
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,050
Today's guests

295
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,178
are the father and son from the powerful
and influential Im family.

296
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,848
<i>The father is Im Seo-hong,</i>
<i>the Second Minister of Works,</i>

297
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,850
<i>a seasoned official</i>
<i>who has held various key positions</i>

298
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,560
<i>since the late king's reign.</i>

299
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,520
<i>His son,</i>
<i>Chief Royal Secretary Im Song-jae,</i>

300
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:59,565
<i>is an </i>uibin<i> married to Princess Hwisuk,</i>
<i>the king's half-sister.</i>

301
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,109
UIBIN: HUSBAND OF A PRINCESS

302
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,235
Block this!

303
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,778
<i>Im Song-jae was the Crown Prince's cohort,</i>

304
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:08,157
<i>and he and the king are close friends</i>
<i>who grew up together.</i>

305
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,241
Stop right there, Song-jae!

306
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,492
Come forth!

307
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:12,912
Out of the way, fool.

308
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,914
<i>They ruined countless families</i>

309
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,166
<i>by using the </i>chaehong<i> as an excuse.</i>

310
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,421
<i>Be gentle!</i>

311
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:25,090
<i>They are especially picky</i>
<i>about the </i>jeopbingaek<i>,</i>

312
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,092
<i>which is the hospitality meal.</i>

313
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:30,220
<i>You may serve the best food you can,</i>

314
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,431
<i>and yet they always find fault with it.</i>

315
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,599
What is this?

316
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,145
<i>Once you get on their wrong side,</i>

317
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,022
<i>you must offer a great bribe.</i>

318
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,316
<i>If you cannot afford that,</i>

319
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,443
<i>you are likely to be tortured.</i>

320
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,406
Does that answer your questions?

321
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,785
What? They nitpick about the food
served to them?

322
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,912
They're the absolute worst, aren't they?

323
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,749
I should teach them

324
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:01,835
that they shouldn't mess around with food.

325
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,629
You need to prepare a table for four.

326
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,172
Get to it.

327
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,173
Okay.

328
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,051
Don't forget our promise.

329
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,112
Okay. Gather round, everyone.

330
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,072
- What?
- What now?

331
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,449
Thanks for speaking up for us.

332
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,702
- That was something.
- You were great.

333
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:37,496
Not at all. We all have to get out alive.

334
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:41,875
We're cooking for very picky guests,

335
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,419
and we need to make four portions.

336
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,172
We don't have much time,
so we must decide what to do first.

337
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,174
Will you all follow my lead?

338
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:52,469
Of course. It is all or nothing.

339
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,763
Do not even worry.

340
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,974
While waiting for you to get back,

341
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:59,393
we gathered
all the ingredients we could find.

342
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,145
Did you? Where are they?

343
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,647
- Right here.
- They are all here.

344
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,024
This is great.

345
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:20,289
<i>Everyone has different tastes.</i>

346
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,499
<i>But the guests today are noblemen,</i>

347
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,334
<i>and influential ones at that.</i>

348
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:27,129
<i>They won't be satisfied</i>
<i>with just any dish.</i>

349
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,299
<i>There's nothing.</i>

350
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:33,886
<i>There's nothing to serve as a main dish.</i>

351
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,477
It's meat.

352
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,315
- Gosh.
- That is big.

353
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,903
It's fresh.

354
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:54,490
I found it hidden away in a pot.

355
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,326
You certainly do have the nose of a dog.
Good job.

356
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,495
Well done.

357
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,081
<i>All right. I'll use this to take my shot.</i>

358
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,958
<i>A French-style steak.</i>

359
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,376
The dish we're going to make…

360
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,129
is a steak!

361
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,506
"Stack"?

362
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,550
- "Stack"? What is that?
- "Stack."

363
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:17,137
Can you not tell? It is a meat dish.

364
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,056
Let us hurry up and get moving!

365
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,265
Just do as she says.

366
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,059
- Bring that here.
- All right.

367
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,936
- This way.
- Go over there.

368
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,063
My lord, will this be all right?

369
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:28,690
She did not seem to be lying.

370
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,026
I could tell
how sincere she was about food.

371
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,196
I am still not too sure about this.

372
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,823
It does not matter.

373
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,783
If anything goes wrong,

374
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,119
they will pay the price.

375
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,162
Oh, that is right.

376
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,414
What happened to Mi-hyang?

377
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,208
Oh, right.

378
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:50,963
<i>She left the village with her nanny</i>
<i>moments ago.</i>

379
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:55,342
<i>It would have been nice</i>
<i>if you could have said goodbye.</i>

380
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,178
She is dead to me now.

381
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,140
Yes, my lord.

382
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:09,815
<i>It has a strong aroma.</i>

383
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:10,899
Of course.

384
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:14,319
It is from Mount Nogo in our village.

385
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,237
I like it.

386
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,410
No, wait. You have to roast them first
to get rid of the fishy smell.

387
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,830
These anchovies are from Deokjeok Island
on the west coast, and--

388
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:25,998
No.

389
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,167
You need to roast them
to get rid of the fishy smell.

390
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,335
Make a loop,

391
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:34,590
- put it through, and tighten it.
- Like this.

392
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,549
There.

393
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,009
Will this do?

394
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,181
Rich, right?

395
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,558
These are fermented shrimp from Mapo Port.

396
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:45,893
They taste great.

397
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,353
Please stir-fry them
until they turn into powder.

398
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,870
It's way too tough.

399
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:08,999
It has too much silver skin
and almost no marbled fat, so it's tough.

400
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,676
Oh my, what kind of meat is this
that not even a knife can cut through?

401
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,888
This thing is as tough as rope.

402
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:26,183
Is it because it was a bull
that was used for farming?

403
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,352
What should I do?

404
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,772
<i>No. Think, Yeon Ji-young.</i>

405
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,320
<i>Yeah. That's it.</i>

406
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,657
Sangajapbang,
<i>the old cookbook my father showed me.</i>

407
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,911
<i>To cook beef that's too tough to even cut,</i>

408
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,580
<i>I can use the </i>jeonchisu<i> method.</i>

409
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,001
RARE

410
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:53,919
COOK AT 55°C FOR 30 MINS

411
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,003
<i>That's it!</i>

412
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,838
<i>There's a corresponding</i>
<i>French cooking method.</i>

413
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,967
<i>The sous vide method</i>
<i>used to tenderize meat.</i>

414
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,885
<i>Low-temperature cooking.</i>

415
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:08,016
Okay, there's oil.

416
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,435
- Gil-geum, get me some <i>hanji</i>.
- Yes?

417
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,271
As in paper?
Why do you need expensive <i>hanji</i>--

418
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,480
It's urgent. Hurry.

419
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:16,441
- You have to get it.
- I will be quick.

420
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,028
Okay.

421
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:20,946
JAHONGWON

422
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,115
<i>Is there still no news from His Majesty?</i>

423
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,533
No, Your Grace.

424
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:29,037
The Urimwi accompanied him,
so I am sure he is safe.

425
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,789
If you hear any urgent news,
inform me first.

426
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,165
KANG MOK-JU
FOURTH JUNIOR CONSORT, YI HEON'S CONCUBINE

427
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:35,794
Yes, Your Grace. Do not worry too much.

428
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:38,839
Did the Im father and son
head to the Gyeonggi Governor's Office?

429
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,216
They should have arrived by now.

430
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,426
I am rather curious

431
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:46,805
to see how the expression on the proud
Hong Gyeong-dal's face will change

432
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:50,392
when he sees his granddaughter
get taken away for the <i>chaehong</i>.

433
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,858
Come forth!

434
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:01,862
I, Hong Eon-uk, extend my greetings

435
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:04,114
to the Second Minister of Works
and Chief Royal Secretary.

436
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,785
Very well. Is your father in good health?

437
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:12,456
He is well, thanks to your concern.

438
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,957
Please follow me.

439
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,771
But miss,

440
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:21,858
why did you wrap the meat in kelp?

441
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,443
The meat is too tough,

442
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,612
and maturing it with kelp makes it tender.

443
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,364
How fascinating.

444
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,789
Gil-geum, we have to add
cold water to this.

445
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,791
But we went through
all that trouble to boil it,

446
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:39,167
and now you want to add cold…

447
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,128
Okay.

448
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,091
I will pour it in now.

449
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,811
But miss,

450
00:23:57,894 --> 00:24:02,482
can you not grill the meat over a fire
or boil it in water?

451
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,733
- Yes.
- Right.

452
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:08,155
This is the only way
to tenderize tough meat.

453
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:17,038
- Oh my, miss! What are you doing?
- Oh my goodness.

454
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,790
It is still hot!

455
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,750
Are you checking how hot it is?

456
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:25,130
The best temperature to make tender meat
is between 49 and 55°C.

457
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:26,840
But…

458
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,217
One more scoop.

459
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:37,642
Stop. That's enough.

460
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,528
<i>If heated for a long time</i>
<i>in lukewarm water,</i>

461
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:51,448
<i>a protein in the meat</i>
<i>called myosin reacts,</i>

462
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:53,450
<i>making the meat tender.</i>

463
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,785
<i>This is the sous vide method.</i>

464
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,414
- One more scoop.
- Okay.

465
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,501
<i>The temperature of boiling water</i>
<i>is 100 degrees,</i>

466
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,962
<i>and room-temperature water</i>
<i>is around 20 degrees.</i>

467
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,422
<i>If you mix the two waters,</i>

468
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:09,216
<i>the temperature levels out</i>
<i>at around 55 degrees,</i>

469
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,551
<i>making sous vide cooking possible.</i>

470
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:16,598
Miss, are you sure your hand--

471
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,185
I don't have a thermometer,

472
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:22,020
so I have to trust the senses
in my fingertips.

473
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:25,148
But your hand has turned red.

474
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:26,691
Don't worry.

475
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,945
I've done sous vide cooking
countless times before.

476
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:36,534
Let me see.

477
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:42,374
Let me take a good look at your face.

478
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,626
You are too shy.

479
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:45,919
Are you angry?

480
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:47,337
Very well.

481
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:49,172
Why…

482
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,173
Hey!

483
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,385
That is big. Your mole is too big.

484
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,720
Your eyes are too big.

485
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:56,972
Your mouth is too big.

486
00:25:58,723 --> 00:25:59,557
You are too tall.

487
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,060
Were you in such a hurry
that you left your neck at home?

488
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,145
Oh goodness!

489
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,897
Escort this old lady out!

490
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:11,403
How will we ever face His Majesty?

491
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,280
I agree, Father.

492
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:16,908
Everyone talks about
the village's great beauty,

493
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:20,495
and I expected you to bring her
out of loyalty to your king.

494
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:28,628
I have no idea who you speak of.

495
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,090
Who was it again?

496
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,466
Was it…

497
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,802
Governor Hong's

498
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:37,929
granddaughter?

499
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:41,683
My lord.

500
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,978
What are you saying?

501
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,063
Mi-hyang is but a young girl.

502
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:49,357
As you are aware,

503
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,068
this is a <i>chaehong </i>for His Majesty.

504
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,631
- Oh my.
- My word.

505
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:16,885
- It looks delicious.
- Goodness.

506
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,055
My goodness.

507
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,309
Thank goodness it worked.

508
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:28,813
It smells amazing!

509
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,523
Can I have a look too?

510
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:32,859
It does not look cooked.

511
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,194
I should taste it.

512
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,657
It is delicious!

513
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:42,535
That is amazing!

514
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,954
What is this, miss?

515
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:49,334
This is called
the sous vide cooking method.

516
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:55,048
I see, cooking meat in water like that
is called "sous vido."

517
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:57,425
It's not done yet. We have to sear it now.

518
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,426
- "Cheer"?
- What?

519
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,095
Please get me some rice straw.

520
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:03,515
- I guess she needs it for cheering.
- Let us get it then.

521
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,308
So,

522
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,477
how old are you now?

523
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:11,523
My lord. The feast is ready.

524
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,401
The <i>seokban</i> is ready.

525
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,778
They say public duty
comes before private matters,

526
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,655
so how about we dine first?

527
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,534
Dinner, you say?

528
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,622
Let us do that.

529
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,959
<i>Welcome.</i>

530
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:34,212
The trip must have been long and arduous.

531
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,257
So,

532
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,843
is His Majesty well?

533
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:43,346
Do you ask because you do not know,
Governor Hong?

534
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,681
Your letters of appeal

535
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:48,810
requesting that His Majesty
depose Fourth Junior Consort Kang

536
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:52,021
caused quite an uproar in the palace.

537
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:54,232
Oh, come on, Father.

538
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:57,318
Why would you bring that up here?

539
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,695
You are embarrassing him.

540
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:01,406
It is fine. You can speak freely.

541
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:06,119
Well, it is a fact
that the letters displeased His Majesty.

542
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,537
Is that why

543
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,915
he sent his <i>chaehong </i>inspectors
all the way here?

544
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,792
You are mistaken.

545
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,628
That is a separate matter.

546
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:19,966
Goodness, I am famished after a long trip,

547
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,803
and all you serve us are tea and snacks?

548
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,473
I apologize, my lord.

549
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,183
We will get the meal--

550
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,352
How direct you both are.

551
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,938
Come on now. Serve the food.

552
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,732
Yes, my lord.

553
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:38,151
We will serve the prepared feast.

554
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,544
My goodness.

555
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,297
Well, this is just…

556
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,842
It seems this region
was the only one to suffer a famine.

557
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,433
I am afraid we cannot accept this dinner.

558
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,519
The <i>jeopbingaek</i>
a governor serves to his guests

559
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,230
should reflect the region's
landscapes and customs,

560
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,190
such that one can discern the geography,
the people's sentiment,

561
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:19,901
and even the success of the harvest
from the meal alone.

562
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:24,864
However, all I see on this table
are a few pieces of meat.

563
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:28,535
This is not at all different
from a barbarian's fare.

564
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,954
What a disappointment.

565
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:35,750
You do not deserve the title of a governor
who is expected to watch over the people.

566
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,002
It seems you do not think much of us

567
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:41,381
when we are here
carrying out a royal command.

568
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,801
How do you explain this?

569
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:49,681
The truth is, we had a problem
with the kitchen maids last night.

570
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:52,392
It seems that this was a mistake
made by the newly appointed cook.

571
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:54,143
I ask that you forgive the discourtesy.

572
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,605
I was unaware of what went on
in my own household

573
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,440
and committed such a grave discourtesy.

574
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,025
I sincerely apologize.

575
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,694
This will not do!

576
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:06,072
How could you insult us so blatantly?

577
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:10,702
In that case,

578
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,830
will you offer something else?

579
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:17,417
Something else? What exactly do you mean?

580
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:22,130
Whatever it may be,
it would not make a difference.

581
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,382
I will call forth the cook
who prepared this

582
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:26,718
and punish them myself.

583
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,469
So please do not be so angry.

584
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:32,682
Official Hong, what do you mean?

585
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:36,561
Bring all the cooks from the kitchen!

586
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,271
Yes, my lord.

587
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:51,409
<i>Let's think of what to do when I get out.</i>

588
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,120
<i>I don't know how I got here,</i>

589
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:57,624
<i>but I can't waste my time doing nothing.</i>

590
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:03,755
What are you doing, Gil-geum?

591
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:09,510
Whenever you find free food,
you must take whatever you can.

592
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,763
There.

593
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,724
- Drag them all out!
- Yes, sir!

594
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:17,477
- Oh no!
- Not again!

595
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,811
What now?

596
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,689
What is going on?

597
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,650
- No!
- Let go of me!

598
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,985
What is this about? Miss! Oh my!

599
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,158
- Oh my gosh.
- Spare us, please!

600
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:34,452
Food served to a noble

601
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:37,914
should be made with all the
natural ingredients from the region!

602
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:41,250
However, the food on these tables
is nothing but a few slices of meat!

603
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,503
- How is this a proper <i>jeopbingaek</i>?
<i>- What the heck is going on?</i>

604
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:46,297
I will punish you severely for your crime.

605
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,717
Please forgive us!

606
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,678
<i>They didn't even eat it yet.</i>

607
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:53,721
<i>Are they trying to nitpick?</i>

608
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:58,101
I'm sorry, but did you even try the food
before criticizing it?

609
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,145
If you didn't, this is quite unfair.

610
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:04,607
The meal on those tables
holds the essence of nature itself.

611
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,401
You are a bold wench.

612
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:10,238
Did you say this meal
holds the nature of this region?

613
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,782
Yes, I did.

614
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,450
Tell me how that is.

615
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:17,662
If you speak nonsense,
you will have to pay the price.

616
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:22,000
<i>It won't taste good if it gets cold,</i>
<i>so let's get them to eat it first.</i>

617
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,378
My lord.

618
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:28,506
You must taste food to appreciate it.

619
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:31,092
I'll explain after you try it.

620
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:34,345
How dare you, you insolent thing!

621
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,889
My goodness.

622
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:41,436
You have prepared
quite an amusing show, Governor.

623
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,523
Perhaps I shall show you
what I have prepared.

624
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,734
Bring her in!

625
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:48,860
- Yes, my lord.
- Yes, my lord.

626
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,821
My lady!

627
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,698
Oh dear. My lady!

628
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,242
Mi-hyang!

629
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:57,702
- Father…
- My lady.

630
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,038
Mi-hyang.

631
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,290
Mi-hyang.

632
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,667
Mi-hyang…

633
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,254
How dare you!

634
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,298
What do you think, Governor Hong?

635
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,842
Is my surprise to your liking?

636
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,305
If what she said is true,

637
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:20,767
we will consider this a proper <i>jeopbingaek</i>
and leave in peace.

638
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:21,809
If not…

639
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,481
I will take your granddaughter with me.

640
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,818
HONG

641
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,070
This is a <i>chaehong</i> plaque.

642
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,614
It is a royal command.

643
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,950
<i>So that punk</i>
<i>is the </i>chaehong <i>inspector, huh?</i>

644
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:40,328
<i>Im Song-jae, the most treacherous subject.</i>

645
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:45,333
You are unbelievably impertinent.

646
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:49,170
You may be the Chief Royal Secretary
favored by His Majesty,

647
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,297
but you cannot threaten me

648
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:54,550
or demand to take my granddaughter
for the <i>chaehong</i>!

649
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:58,805
You are a human being,
and you should be ashamed!

650
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:01,015
Please calm down, Governor,

651
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,268
or your family line may end here.

652
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:07,814
You are the much respected
and honored Governor Hong Gyeong-dal,

653
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:12,235
and you should know better
than to lash out like this.

654
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,153
<i>Hong Gyeong-dal?</i>

655
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,239
I will pretend I did not hear that.

656
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:18,074
As I said before,

657
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,285
if the food that wench made moves me,

658
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,871
then I will pretend
that none of this happened.

659
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,040
So please calm yourself, Governor.

660
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:37,093
Now, please taste the food.

661
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,637
Oh, before we do that,

662
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:44,892
I must put the wench who made this
in her place.

663
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,144
<i>No way.</i>

664
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,312
<i>All I did was cook!</i>

665
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,772
Tell me.

666
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:52,567
If this meal
does not hold the essence of nature,

667
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,693
what then?

668
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,904
Will you give up your life?

669
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:00,366
<i>I don't know how to go back anyway,</i>
<i>so what do I have to lose?</i>

670
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,578
<i>The sous vide was perfectly done.</i>

671
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,747
Yes, I will.

672
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,332
So try the food.

673
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:09,709
Very well.

674
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,794
Miss!

675
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,662
What is this?

676
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:54,670
<i>This texture.</i>

677
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:55,922
<i>This taste.</i>

678
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,299
<i>It is a flavor I have never tasted before.</i>

679
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:02,511
<i>I can barely chew the meat.</i>

680
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,013
<i>It melts away.</i>

681
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:06,015
<i>The juices fill my mouth.</i>

682
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,226
<i>And this sauce.</i>

683
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,810
<i>What in the world is this?</i>

684
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,029
<i>Guanylic acid in Pyogo mushrooms,</i>

685
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,282
<i>inosinic acid in anchovies,</i>

686
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:26,077
<i>and glutamic acid in fermented shrimp.</i>

687
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:47,139
<i>When amino acids from different groups</i>
<i>are combined in specific ratios,</i>

688
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:49,225
<i>you get a major boost of umami flavor.</i>

689
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,353
<i>The so-called umami bomb that we call</i>

690
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:53,938
<i>MSG.</i>

691
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:57,316
<i>It's no different from the modern-day</i>
<i>synthetic seasoning we use.</i>

692
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:13,624
This is just

693
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,252
a plate of common boiled beef.

694
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:36,605
What now?

695
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:39,942
I could not feel
the nature you spoke of in this dish.

696
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:45,156
<i>They say it's impossible</i>
<i>to stop a human from lying.</i>

697
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,699
Do you have anything to say?

698
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,535
It may look like

699
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:52,038
<i>I served you nothing but meat,</i>

700
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:55,958
<i>but I actually used ingredients</i>
<i>from all over this region.</i>

701
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,045
- Is that so?
- The salt you dipped the meat in.

702
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:01,714
<i>That contains fermented shrimp</i>
<i>from Mapo Port,</i>

703
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:03,299
<i>anchovies from the west coast,</i>

704
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:05,968
<i>and Pyogo mushrooms from Mount Nogo.</i>

705
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,596
If that doesn't contain nature,

706
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,057
then what food possibly could?

707
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,516
That is quite strange.

708
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,935
Your words evoke a sense of nature,

709
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,480
but I did not feel or taste it
in your food.

710
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,899
You are lying!

711
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:22,860
What do you mean, Governor?

712
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:26,530
I have never tasted
anything like this in my life.

713
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:31,535
However, you are lying just so you can
take away my granddaughter!

714
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:35,581
Your treachery will anger
the people and the heavens!

715
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:41,796
<i>I knew it.</i>

716
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:44,382
<i>He was never going to tell the truth</i>
<i>because of the </i>chaehong<i>.</i>

717
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,008
A treacherous subject like you

718
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,177
will die by my hand!

719
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,428
Father!

720
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:51,972
Father!

721
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,892
This is all due to my incompetence.

722
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,560
Please calm down.

723
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:58,270
Let go of me.

724
00:39:58,354 --> 00:39:59,647
Father!

725
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,899
You must not do this.

726
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,695
My gosh.

727
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,240
This is truly a sight
that brings forth tears.

728
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:11,700
"Father."

729
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:23,462
Do not just stand there.

730
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:26,507
Strike that criminal at once!

731
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:29,552
- I am sorry. Forgive us.
- What? Me?

732
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,097
<i>Am I really going to die</i>
<i>an unjust death here?</i>

733
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,598
<i>In Joseon?</i>

734
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:38,352
<i>God, Buddha, someone! Help me, please.</i>

735
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,729
No!

736
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,566
No, please! Wait!

737
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:45,067
Blame your cooking.

738
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:47,319
Nothing was wrong with my cooking!

739
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,280
It's your tongue that's lying!

740
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,408
What are you doing? No, stop it.

741
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:58,414
No! Save me! Let me go, please!

742
00:40:58,497 --> 00:40:59,540
Father.

743
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:08,215
No!

744
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,303
Spare me, please.

745
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:13,471
Halt!

746
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:33,532
His Majesty the King has arrived!

747
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:39,497
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

748
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:43,250
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

749
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,020
If what you say is true…

750
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:05,189
<i>Wait. This voice…</i>

751
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:08,108
I will try it myself.

752
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,527
<i>No way.</i>

753
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,612
<i>It can't be that fool.</i>

754
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:21,372
<i>No way!</i>

755
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:23,332
<i>"Your Majesty"?</i>

756
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:32,424
Rise, <i>gwinyeo</i>.

757
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:34,385
<i>I'm screwed.</i>

758
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:36,762
<i>He really was Yeonhuigun.</i>

759
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,014
<i>Who are you?</i>

760
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:41,016
Who in the world are you?

761
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:42,851
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

762
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:44,728
<i>You crazy fool!</i>

763
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,230
Hey. Do you not
get the situation right now?

764
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:47,565
I command you as the King of Joseon!

765
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,149
I am the king of this country.

766
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:52,361
I am the king of this country.

767
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:57,533
Why are you still on the ground?

768
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:58,659
<i>Dad.</i>

769
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:01,870
<i>I'm sorry for leaving you behind.</i>

770
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:06,166
<i>I wish…</i>

771
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:10,421
<i>You will wish</i>

772
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:14,300
<i>you were beaten to death</i>
<i>with a wooden plank instead.</i>

773
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:43,912
<i>What a simple and humble spread.</i>

774
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,623
Come and taste it first.

775
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,374
What? Me?

776
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:50,252
Yes, you.

777
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:56,383
Sure.

778
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,163
<i>Right.</i>

779
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:29,041
<i>You're a famous gourmet</i>
<i>in the Joseon Dynasty</i>

780
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:30,459
<i>who has an absolute sense of taste.</i>

781
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:33,003
<i>Then surely he'll judge fairly, right?</i>

782
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:37,383
<i>Do not get your hopes up.</i>

783
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,718
<i>If it is not better than the bibinbap…</i>

784
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,327
<i>How can the meat be so tender?</i>

785
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:11,834
<i>The more I chew,</i>

786
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:13,961
<i>the more the juices flow and linger.</i>

787
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:16,422
The light and clean taste

788
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:19,842
reaches a peak, then melts away.

789
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,386
Wait.

790
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,388
This seasoning…

791
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:41,029
I truly cannot

792
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:43,365
believe this taste.

793
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,868
This is the very essence of savory flavor.

794
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:52,124
What on earth did you make it with?

795
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:55,919
<i>His taste buds sure are different.</i>

796
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:58,755
<i>To perceive MSG like that, truly amazing.</i>

797
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,215
<i>He's a gourmet, all right.</i>

798
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:04,511
Simply put,

799
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,806
it's an item I use
to enrich the flavor of food.

800
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:11,310
It enhances savoriness
and reduces saltiness.

801
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:12,978
"Item," you say?

802
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:16,273
I see.

803
00:46:16,773 --> 00:46:17,733
So that was it.

804
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,675
The pickled <i>omija</i>

805
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,969
and grilled green onions on the side
are incredibly appetizing,

806
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:48,055
and they pair perfectly with the meat.

807
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:50,641
This dish is truly…

808
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,560
the greatest taste on the land.

809
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:55,771
<i>I'm going to live.</i>

810
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:57,606
<i>I'm going to live!</i>

811
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:01,527
It tasted rather nostalgic,

812
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,028
and for the first time in a long while,

813
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,781
I was satisfied with the meal.

814
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:12,663
So why did you
criticize the food so dreadfully?

815
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:18,418
The meal befits you, Your Majesty,
who rules a nation.

816
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:19,878
It is only natural

817
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:22,798
that my insignificant tongue
could not appreciate the flavors.

818
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:25,717
<i>You're called treacherous for a reason.</i>

819
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,887
I thought you said
you couldn't taste anything earlier.

820
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:33,433
You surprised me twice today.

821
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:38,939
<i>I'm a chef!</i>

822
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,816
I'm Chef Yeon Ji-young!

823
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:43,318
A cook! I'm a cook!

824
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,445
Now that I think about it,

825
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:48,657
you said you were a cook from Chef,
is that right?

826
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:51,451
I'm a chef. It's the same thing as a cook.

827
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:55,122
Judging by your skills,
you were not lying.

828
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:57,624
- You really are a skilled cook.
- Yes.

829
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:02,588
Being a cook is traditionally
a man's occupation.

830
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:05,507
So how did you, a woman, become one?

831
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:06,633
<i>What's going on?</i>

832
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,136
<i>Is this an interview?</i>

833
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,807
My dad loves to cook,

834
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:17,436
so tasting food and making it

835
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:18,854
became a calling.

836
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:20,772
A calling, you say?

837
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:24,693
Did you ever regret becoming a cook?

838
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:29,406
Well, you see,
a calling comes with tribulations.

839
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:35,370
It's just like how being a king
comes with perks,

840
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:37,998
but also challenges and hardships.

841
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,085
I see.

842
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:44,504
Anyway,

843
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:45,756
I feel most rewarded as a cook

844
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:48,508
when people with exceptional palates
like you, Your Majesty,

845
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:51,678
acknowledge my cooking.

846
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,352
What is your name?

847
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:00,270
It's Yeon Ji-young.

848
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:02,439
The Yeon family, I see. And your age?

849
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:03,482
I'm 27.

850
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:04,399
What?

851
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,443
You are 27 years old?

852
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,571
You are older than you look.

853
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:11,239
Do you have a <i>jiabi</i>?

854
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,533
<i>Jiabi</i>…

855
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,118
Oh, a husband.

856
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:16,995
I haven't married yet.

857
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:20,040
Oh dear. You are unwed at that age?

858
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:21,625
What a pity.

859
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:24,753
Oh, no, don't get me wrong.

860
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:26,296
I'm not from around here,

861
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,341
so it's not like what you think,
Your Majesty.

862
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,970
Then where are you from?

863
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:36,723
<i>Should I tell the truth?</i>

864
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:37,808
<i>Or not?</i>

865
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:42,229
<i>I don't think he'll believe me.</i>

866
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:44,648
I know this may be hard to believe,

867
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:46,942
but I'm from…

868
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:54,866
500 years in the future.

869
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:03,041
I see.

870
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:05,293
<i>Does he really believe me?</i>

871
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:09,256
I will not take your life today.

872
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,633
Do you believe me?

873
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:14,469
It is a shame
you are not right in your mind,

874
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:17,723
but your talent saved you today.

875
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,018
<i>So he thinks I'm crazy, huh?</i>

876
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:24,813
<i>Yeah. Well, I don't believe it myself.</i>

877
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:28,066
I know it's hard to believe,

878
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,026
but I'm…

879
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:33,280
I'm from another era that we call Korea.

880
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,991
What is this impertinence
in front of His Majesty? That is enough!

881
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:38,702
Okay.

882
00:50:40,036 --> 00:50:41,955
Of course you don't believe me.

883
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,833
<i>I'm not crazy.</i>

884
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:47,419
<i>This is the truth, and I can't help it.</i>

885
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:54,342
That is enough. Come to the side.

886
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:06,354
<i>Think what you will.</i>

887
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:08,106
<i>Just let me go.</i>

888
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,066
<i>You said it was</i>
<i>the greatest taste on the land.</i>

889
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,281
You're going to let me go, right?

890
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:22,329
<i>Is he letting me go or not?</i>

891
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:23,914
<i>This is driving me crazy.</i>

892
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:25,290
Chief Royal Secretary.

893
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:26,958
Yes, Your Majesty.

894
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:29,044
<i>You're letting me go, right?</i>

895
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:30,337
<i>Please.</i>

896
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,422
<i>Please…</i>

897
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:34,299
That cook…

898
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:38,678
is to be locked up
and taken to the palace with me tomorrow.

899
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,097
Yes, Your Majesty.

900
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,225
<i>You've got to be kidding me.</i>

901
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:45,393
<i>So he's not letting me go.</i>

902
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:49,272
What shall we do
about Governor Hong's granddaughter?

903
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:55,779
Right, I will also take her
to the palace with me, so prepare her.

904
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:58,698
Yes, Your Majesty.

905
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,659
Understood.

906
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:05,705
<i>He's taking that young girl?</i>

907
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,999
<i>Jeez, that's just not right.</i>

908
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:13,255
<i>Wait. Hong Gyeong-dal's granddaughter?</i>

909
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:15,632
<i>Isn't this what sparks</i>

910
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:18,009
<i>the Gapshin Literati Purge?</i>

911
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:19,636
RETALIATION WHERE YEONHUIGUN EXECUTED
OFFICIALS INVOLVED IN HIS MOTHER'S DEATH

912
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,222
You may all leave.

913
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:24,140
I am tired.

914
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:26,309
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

915
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:39,781
Hurry and leave.

916
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:41,741
I said leave!

917
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:47,414
Hurry.

918
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:49,958
<i>They say you reap what you sow.</i>

919
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:51,793
<i>Old adages are never wrong.</i>

920
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:54,629
<i>Judging by the things he does,</i>
<i>it's no wonder a literati purge occurred.</i>

921
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:56,631
<i>He's just the absolute worst.</i>

922
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:58,133
You wench!

923
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:00,051
Follow me.

924
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:12,355
Why are you still here?

925
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:17,527
Are you not ashamed before the late king?

926
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:22,991
Sheathe your sword.

927
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:27,621
You neglect state affairs
while wrapped up in a woman's embrace,

928
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:30,373
do not value the lives of court officials,

929
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:32,626
and look down on the lives of your people!

930
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:34,878
Do you truly not see
that those are the very reasons

931
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:40,592
why your officials do not respect you
and your subjects no longer serve you?

932
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:43,219
Say that again.

933
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:46,556
Your Majesty.

934
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:51,728
Please regain your senses and wisdom.

935
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:55,857
You must punish the treacherous subjects

936
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:59,694
and women who thrive on your power.

937
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:02,572
Only then will this nation stand strong!

938
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:12,832
Say that again.

939
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,000
Your Majesty.

940
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:17,545
Your Majesty.

941
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:20,173
Now that your granddaughter's life
hangs in the balance,

942
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,509
are you worried
about the affairs of the state?

943
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,596
What do you know about how I feel?

944
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,014
Your Majesty.

945
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:34,104
Please just take my life instead!

946
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:39,985
Do you now feel the pain of knowing
there is nothing you can do

947
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:42,570
to save your family?

948
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:46,116
Your Majesty.

949
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:51,121
<i>You must live</i>
<i>and suffer in agony for years.</i>

950
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:55,000
<i>That is the punishment I give you</i>

951
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:58,670
<i>for driving my mother to her death.</i>

952
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:02,674
Guards!

953
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:04,175
Drag out the criminal

954
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:06,803
who has committed blasphemy
against his king!

955
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:10,098
Your Majesty.

956
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:11,891
Your Majesty.

957
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:14,436
Exile him to the furthest end

958
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:17,522
of North Hamgyong Province
tomorrow morning.

959
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:18,815
Yes, Your Majesty.

960
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:21,359
Your Majesty.

961
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:22,402
Your Majesty!

962
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:23,820
Your Majesty!

963
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:26,031
Your Majesty!

964
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:35,832
What is all this?

965
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:41,838
Miss, are you sure
His Majesty enjoyed the food?

966
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:46,051
I swear I heard him say
it was the greatest taste on the land.

967
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:50,722
Then why did they let all the others go
but lock us up?

968
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:51,723
How would I know?

969
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:56,686
I'd love to look into the fool's head
to see what the hell he's thinking!

970
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:57,854
My gosh.

971
00:55:57,937 --> 00:56:01,483
Anyway, they said
we're going to the palace tomorrow.

972
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:03,443
This is bad.

973
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:05,320
Things are just getting worse.

974
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:06,696
What did you say?

975
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:07,989
The palace?

976
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:10,700
I need to go back before we get there.

977
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:13,078
This is driving me crazy.

978
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:15,080
Where do you need to go?

979
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,793
To where I came from. Where else?

980
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:22,629
Right. And where is that?

981
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:25,465
Gil-geum.

982
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:27,926
I know you won't believe me,

983
00:56:28,009 --> 00:56:31,971
but I came from far off in the future.

984
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:36,017
Man, what am I even doing?

985
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:37,352
Forget it.

986
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:42,232
No, miss. I believe you.

987
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:45,276
When I first saw you,

988
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,737
I smelled something
I had never smelled before.

989
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:50,365
And you cooked things I had never seen.

990
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:51,991
So I believe you.

991
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:54,327
- Do you really, Gil-geum?
- Yes.

992
00:56:56,121 --> 00:57:00,208
Actually, I was in Paris,
and I was on a plane back to Korea.

993
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:01,251
On a flame?

994
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:05,380
Just listen to me.
I took a plane from France to Korea,

995
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:06,422
and someone spilled coffee on me,

996
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:08,967
so I went to the bathroom
and opened a book…

997
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:11,886
<i>Right. </i>Mangunrok.

998
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:16,683
<i>I read the first page,</i>
<i>and like a magic book…</i>

999
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,144
<i>Where did that book go?</i>

1000
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:21,729
Right, my handbag!

1001
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:28,486
My handbag.

1002
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:30,196
- Gil-geum.
- Yes?

1003
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,366
I just realized something important.

1004
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,160
What is that?

1005
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:38,496
There's an important book
called <i>Mangunrok</i>.

1006
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:40,790
And I lost it.

1007
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:43,042
<i>Mangunrok</i>?

1008
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:45,378
I have to find the handbag the book is in.

1009
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:46,588
That's the only way I can go back.

1010
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:51,009
Remember the cliff I asked you
to take me to when I was at your house?

1011
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:51,926
Yes.

1012
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,344
I lost it there.

1013
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:55,388
What am I going to do?

1014
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:58,933
How are we going to get out of here?

1015
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:13,448
Oh goodness!

1016
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:15,074
I apologize, Your Majesty.

1017
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:17,911
Why are you sneaking up on me like that?

1018
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:19,329
It is cold out here.

1019
00:58:20,121 --> 00:58:21,414
You should go inside.

1020
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:22,582
Song-jae.

1021
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,375
Yes, Your Majesty.

1022
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:26,544
It is just us here, so speak freely.

1023
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:29,297
- No, Your Majesty.
- What now?

1024
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:32,258
You are too slow.

1025
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:40,016
I see you are still nimble.

1026
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:12,090
Look at you.

1027
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:28,565
Song-jae.

1028
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:29,691
Yes, Your Majesty.

1029
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:34,112
Other than the cook named Yeon Ji-young
and the girl she was with,

1030
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:39,158
release all the women
you captured here today for the <i>chaehong</i>.

1031
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:40,118
Pardon?

1032
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:44,122
Are you not taking
Governor Hong's granddaughter either?

1033
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:46,291
No.

1034
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:50,712
She will become a government slave

1035
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:52,630
once Hong Gyeong-dal
is sent into exile anyway.

1036
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:53,840
Your Majesty.

1037
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,884
Did the <i>chaehong</i> upset you?

1038
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,138
No.

1039
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:03,641
You're insane.
That heir nonsense is just an excuse.

1040
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:06,060
He was just crazy about women.
What an excuse.

1041
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:11,649
The <i>chaehong</i> was just an excuse
to avenge my mother.

1042
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:13,192
You know that.

1043
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:17,697
The girl gave me a reason
to exile her grandfather.

1044
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:19,824
That is good enough.

1045
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:22,577
However, Your Majesty,
if you call off the <i>chaehong</i> now,

1046
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:24,662
you will incur the suspicion

1047
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:27,040
of the Grand Royal Queen Dowager
that you are avenging your mother.

1048
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:29,917
This is too minor an incident
for her to grow suspicious.

1049
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:32,211
And for some reason…

1050
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:37,258
I feel rather drained today.

1051
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:41,971
Then how about…

1052
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:45,141
I enter the chamber in your stead tonight?

1053
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:51,147
You have gone too far with your joke.

1054
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:57,612
Who are you?

1055
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:05,328
Do not fear. I came to keep my promise.

1056
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:07,455
You're that guy from earlier…

1057
01:01:07,538 --> 01:01:09,290
I mean, the lord, right?

1058
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:12,293
You successfully finished the<i> jeopbingaek</i>,
so I shall let you go.

1059
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:16,172
Are you sure about that?

1060
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:18,341
Take this.

1061
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:20,343
And this too.

1062
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:23,638
If you go that way,

1063
01:01:23,721 --> 01:01:25,473
you will find the back gate of the office.

1064
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:27,183
Hurry and go.

1065
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:29,769
- Well, then…
- Okay.

1066
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:32,647
- Let us go.
- Yes, my lord.

1067
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:33,940
Excuse me.

1068
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:38,194
I don't know how this may sound,

1069
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:40,905
but that tyrant will be punished one day.

1070
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:42,365
Thank you.

1071
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:44,033
Thank you so much.

1072
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:46,744
Let's go.

1073
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:06,013
Your Majesty, it is I,
the Chief Royal Secretary.

1074
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:09,976
What is it?

1075
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:13,896
The cooks who served you
have escaped from the prison.

1076
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:15,898
What?

1077
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:20,611
By the way, where's your family?

1078
01:02:22,029 --> 01:02:23,740
I am alone.

1079
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:25,658
What?

1080
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:30,747
My father was a military officer
at the Left Jeolla Naval Base,

1081
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:34,459
but he was framed and taken away,
so I do not know if he is dead or alive.

1082
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:35,376
As for my mother,

1083
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:38,921
she and I were on our way to Hanyang
to look for my father,

1084
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:41,758
but we were attacked by
a group of bandits, and she passed away.

1085
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:43,593
I'm sorry for asking.

1086
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:46,846
- I had no idea. I shouldn't have asked.
- Do not worry.

1087
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:48,890
How could you have known?

1088
01:02:48,973 --> 01:02:50,516
It is fine, really.

1089
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:53,978
- Gil-geum.
- Yes?

1090
01:02:55,062 --> 01:02:57,356
Do you want to come with me?

1091
01:02:58,566 --> 01:02:59,567
Where to?

1092
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,444
To 500 years in the future.

1093
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:03,821
Let's go back to the time I was living in.

1094
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:07,200
Can I?

1095
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:09,243
Can I really go with you?

1096
01:03:09,827 --> 01:03:11,496
What's your dream?

1097
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:13,498
My dream?

1098
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:14,582
What do you want to be?

1099
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:17,418
As long as you work hard,
you can be anything there.

1100
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:20,046
If I can be anything,

1101
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:23,758
I want to be the senior court lady
of the royal kitchen.

1102
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:26,052
Okay.

1103
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:28,513
While I'm here,

1104
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:30,473
I'll teach you how to cook.

1105
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:34,143
Really? You cannot take that back.

1106
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:37,814
Were you the senior court lady
of the royal kitchen where you live?

1107
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:41,067
No, I was a three-star Michelin chef.

1108
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:50,368
Miss, this is the only cliff in this area.

1109
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:53,079
My gosh. That was a tough climb.

1110
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:56,749
It has been such a long day.

1111
01:03:56,833 --> 01:04:00,670
It is so dark. I cannot see a thing.

1112
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:01,838
- Gil-geum.
- Yes?

1113
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:03,130
- This is the place.
- It is?

1114
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:04,090
Yeah.

1115
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:06,050
My gosh.

1116
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:07,343
Miss!

1117
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:12,098
Did I not lose it here?

1118
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:13,933
- Shine the light over here.
- Here?

1119
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:15,726
I do not see anything.

1120
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:19,772
- You can't see, can you?
- No. My gosh.

1121
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,607
I can't see in the dark.

1122
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:23,776
- It's not this side.
- No?

1123
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:26,028
Then…

1124
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:27,446
I think it went that way.

1125
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:30,199
- It flew that way.
- Okay.

1126
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:33,119
I think it landed somewhere here.

1127
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:34,036
Miss.

1128
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,747
- Shine the light here.
- Okay.

1129
01:04:37,498 --> 01:04:39,166
Where did it go?

1130
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:40,710
It is not here either.

1131
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:42,753
I do not see anything.

1132
01:04:42,837 --> 01:04:45,756
Why isn't it here?
I swear it went this way.

1133
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:49,093
Miss, look over there.

1134
01:04:49,176 --> 01:04:50,219
Do you see anything?

1135
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:51,554
Yes.

1136
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:05,860
Your Majesty.

1137
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:11,532
Well, you see…

1138
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:25,713
No, wait! I'll explain everything!

1139
01:05:25,796 --> 01:05:29,425
Please, let me explain.

1140
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:31,761
Please…

1141
01:05:44,398 --> 01:05:46,192
Now explain.

1142
01:05:47,693 --> 01:05:49,153
I'm sorry.

1143
01:05:49,236 --> 01:05:51,989
I came to find the handbag I lost.

1144
01:05:52,573 --> 01:05:54,325
- "Handbag"?
- Yes.

1145
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:58,120
The handbag that flew away
when you shot it with the arrow.

1146
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:01,248
Oh, that?

1147
01:06:01,832 --> 01:06:04,919
There's a book
called <i>Mangunrok</i> in the handbag.

1148
01:06:05,002 --> 01:06:09,840
I think that's the book
that brought me to the Joseon Dynasty.

1149
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:12,510
"<i>Mangunrok</i>"?

1150
01:06:16,055 --> 01:06:17,139
What an excuse.

1151
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:22,228
I know it's hard to believe,
but it's not an excuse.

1152
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:25,022
I really need that book, Your Majesty.

1153
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:27,650
Is it important enough

1154
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:31,696
to commit yet another treason
by escaping prison at night?

1155
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:34,156
Yes. That book is as important as my life.

1156
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:12,111
What a relief.

1157
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,531
Is this it?

1158
01:07:15,614 --> 01:07:18,409
Yes, this is it! Thank you!

1159
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:23,873
You crazy bastard!

1160
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:28,210
Now you have no reason to run away.

1161
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:30,337
What the hell are you doing?

1162
01:07:30,421 --> 01:07:33,340
Look at you.

1163
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:35,384
You are taking
that insolent tone with me again.

1164
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:39,013
Your Majesty.

1165
01:07:39,972 --> 01:07:42,433
I'm sorry for being insolent.

1166
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:45,144
I'll do anything you say,

1167
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:47,605
so please get that handbag back for me.

1168
01:07:48,564 --> 01:07:49,940
You will do…

1169
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:53,402
anything I say?

1170
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:54,487
Yes.

1171
01:07:55,821 --> 01:07:56,655
What?

1172
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:07,583
Don't you think this is just wrong?

1173
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:12,546
Why is he going so far to torment us?

1174
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:14,799
If I ever had to go to the palace,

1175
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:17,468
I hoped it would be
as a maid in the royal kitchen.

1176
01:08:18,135 --> 01:08:23,265
What are we going to do
now that we are on His Majesty's bad side?

1177
01:08:25,309 --> 01:08:28,562
I'll protect you, no matter what,
so don't worry.

1178
01:08:28,646 --> 01:08:30,689
Brace yourself and be strong, okay?

1179
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:35,444
Okay. I will also protect you,
no matter what.

1180
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:37,530
We should both stay strong.

1181
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:38,572
- Okay.
- Yes.

1182
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:44,245
I'm going to find that <i>Mangunrok</i>
at all costs and go back,

1183
01:08:44,328 --> 01:08:45,454
no matter what.

1184
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:51,210
Your Majesty, what is the reason
you are taking that woman with you?

1185
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:54,088
Because

1186
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:56,715
I do not want her to die a peaceful death.

1187
01:09:05,766 --> 01:09:11,063
If only I had a gun,
I'd just shoot him dead at once.

1188
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:40,342
I have received word.

1189
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:45,890
Something dreadful
has happened to His Majesty.

1190
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:48,893
Was it an assassin?

1191
01:09:48,976 --> 01:09:52,646
Fortunately, he was not harmed.

1192
01:09:53,397 --> 01:09:54,815
Whose doing was it?

1193
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:58,402
Probably one of us.

1194
01:09:58,485 --> 01:10:01,947
Do you mean
someone took action on their own?

1195
01:10:07,661 --> 01:10:09,663
They probably could not wait.

1196
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:12,958
I told them time and time again
to wait until the right moment.

1197
01:10:13,792 --> 01:10:17,713
If they put us all at risk
before we execute the plan,

1198
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:20,799
they must be eliminated.

1199
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:23,636
Shall I look into it discreetly?

1200
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:26,680
There is no need.

1201
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:29,808
I have an idea who it was,
and they are being followed.

1202
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:34,813
You should be extra careful.

1203
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:37,024
Yes, Your Highness.

1204
01:10:37,107 --> 01:10:40,611
Just greet the king as you usually do,

1205
01:10:40,694 --> 01:10:42,655
so that he can forget
the burdens of state affairs

1206
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:45,157
and his anger toward the court officials,

1207
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:49,119
and be driven mad
with curiosity about his mother.

1208
01:10:49,703 --> 01:10:52,957
Captivate him so he loses himself.

1209
01:10:55,376 --> 01:10:56,460
I understand.

1210
01:11:02,883 --> 01:11:04,551
By the way, Mok-ju.

1211
01:11:06,178 --> 01:11:07,054
Yes, Your Highness.

1212
01:11:07,888 --> 01:11:09,598
I hear

1213
01:11:10,349 --> 01:11:14,561
that His Majesty is bringing a woman
back from the Gyeonggi Governor's Office.

1214
01:11:14,645 --> 01:11:16,480
It must be
Hong Gyeong-dal's granddaughter.

1215
01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:22,653
I wonder.

1216
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:56,103
You may all leave.

1217
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:57,771
- Yes, Your Grace.
- Yes, Your Grace.

1218
01:12:03,277 --> 01:12:04,361
Chu-wol, are you there?

1219
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:05,779
Yes, Your Grace.

1220
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:12,328
How much longer until His Majesty arrives?

1221
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:14,997
He just left
the Gyeonggi Governor's Office,

1222
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:18,417
so he will arrive sometime between
the fifteenth and seventeenth hour.

1223
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:21,086
He will bring
Hong Gyeong-dal's granddaughter.

1224
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:23,422
I hear she is a great beauty.

1225
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:26,258
No one can compare to you, Your Grace.

1226
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:30,596
I will make it clear to her
that I am the only woman for His Majesty.

1227
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:31,805
Just wait and see

1228
01:12:31,889 --> 01:12:35,351
how I torment that young thing
until she withers away.

1229
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:38,228
- Get lost, <i>gwinyeo</i>!
- Go away!

1230
01:12:39,396 --> 01:12:40,898
- Go away!
- Go away!

1231
01:12:40,981 --> 01:12:43,192
Hey! What are you doing?

1232
01:12:43,901 --> 01:12:47,279
What? Do you want to see
what a <i>gwinyeo</i> can do?

1233
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:51,200
- You little brats!
- You fools!

1234
01:12:51,283 --> 01:12:54,912
- I will remember your faces!
- Those tiny little punks.

1235
01:12:54,995 --> 01:12:57,831
- Are you all right, miss?
- Stop right here!

1236
01:12:58,749 --> 01:12:59,583
Forget it.

1237
01:12:59,666 --> 01:13:02,753
You kids must be
at least 500 years older than me.

1238
01:13:02,836 --> 01:13:03,921
Yeah, let's just forget it.

1239
01:13:09,134 --> 01:13:11,553
<i>No matter how many times I look around,</i>

1240
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:13,180
<i>this is Joseon for sure.</i>

1241
01:13:13,263 --> 01:13:14,598
<i>I have to control myself.</i>

1242
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:21,897
Oh my gosh!

1243
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:24,358
How dare they harm something
that belongs to me?

1244
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:27,152
They should be taught a lesson.

1245
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:28,612
Your Majesty.

1246
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:31,448
That "something" you just mentioned.

1247
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:33,617
Are you referring to me?

1248
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:34,993
That is right.

1249
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:37,538
From now on, you cannot see anyone,

1250
01:13:37,621 --> 01:13:40,749
go anywhere, or speak with anyone
without my permission.

1251
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:44,086
So there's nothing I can do.

1252
01:13:44,169 --> 01:13:46,547
From being a rebel to a <i>gwinyeo</i>,

1253
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:48,340
now I'm someone's possession.

1254
01:13:49,216 --> 01:13:51,009
I'm at a loss for words.

1255
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:52,261
Yes.

1256
01:13:52,344 --> 01:13:54,763
They say act mute for three years,
deaf for three years,

1257
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:56,181
and blind for another three.

1258
01:13:57,266 --> 01:14:00,352
Think of it as a basic rule
to survive in the palace.

1259
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:02,980
I will prepare
a special residence for you.

1260
01:14:07,985 --> 01:14:08,819
What…

1261
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:16,994
His Majesty the King has arrived!

1262
01:14:23,959 --> 01:14:25,627
<i>I'm really going to Bongdeokgung.</i>

1263
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:27,421
<i>I'm at the actual palace.</i>

1264
01:14:28,338 --> 01:14:31,508
<i>I'll be sacrificed instead of</i>
<i>Hong Gyeong-dal's granddaughter.</i>

1265
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:34,136
<i>Does that mean</i>
<i>I prevented the Gapshin Literati Purge?</i>

1266
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:36,638
<i>What do I do now?</i>

1267
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:40,934
<i>This truly is Hell Joseon.</i>

1268
01:15:02,789 --> 01:15:05,250
Consort Kang, did I keep you waiting?

1269
01:15:06,543 --> 01:15:11,715
Your Majesty, I almost turned to dust
and blew away, awaiting your return.

1270
01:15:14,259 --> 01:15:15,219
I am glad you are here.

1271
01:15:15,802 --> 01:15:17,346
I wish to show you something.

1272
01:15:18,013 --> 01:15:19,223
Come with me.

1273
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:23,227
<i>What is he doing?</i>

1274
01:15:23,977 --> 01:15:25,687
<i>Don't come any closer.</i>

1275
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:28,273
<i>Stay away!</i>

1276
01:15:32,236 --> 01:15:33,153
It is her.

1277
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:34,488
<i>Gwinyeo.</i>

1278
01:15:34,571 --> 01:15:35,531
Pardon?

1279
01:15:36,448 --> 01:15:37,282
<i>Gwinyeo</i>?

1280
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:43,497
Was she brought here as a criminal?

1281
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:45,707
Yes, she is indeed a criminal.

1282
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:50,963
However, she has a talent
I do not wish to waste by killing her.

1283
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:58,470
I am surprised that you brought a woman
to the palace yourself, Your Majesty.

1284
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:01,306
This is the first time this has happened
since I, Kang Mok-ju, was brought here.

1285
01:16:02,474 --> 01:16:03,600
"Woman"?

1286
01:16:04,476 --> 01:16:05,435
She is a ghost.

1287
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:09,064
<i>Kang Mok-ju?</i>

1288
01:16:09,147 --> 01:16:11,608
<i>The most villainous woman</i>
<i>in all of Joseon,</i>

1289
01:16:11,692 --> 01:16:15,696
<i>who wrapped Yeonhuigun around her finger</i>
<i>and caused all sorts of tyranny?</i>

1290
01:16:18,115 --> 01:16:19,491
<i>This is just crazy.</i>

1291
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:26,081
<i>She is not Governor Hong's granddaughter.</i>

1292
01:16:26,164 --> 01:16:27,416
<i>Who is she?</i>

1293
01:16:27,499 --> 01:16:28,625
<i>My goodness.</i>

1294
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:30,294
<i>Look at those cat eyes,</i>

1295
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:32,212
<i>shooting out laser beams.</i>

1296
01:16:32,296 --> 01:16:34,673
<i>She could easily burn a hole in my face.</i>

1297
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:39,428
<i>She has a pretty face.</i>

1298
01:16:40,012 --> 01:16:42,556
<i>His Majesty must be fond of her.</i>

1299
01:16:46,018 --> 01:16:49,229
She will look pretty decent
if groomed properly.

1300
01:16:49,313 --> 01:16:52,733
Shall I take her to Jahongwon
and teach her what she must know?

1301
01:16:53,984 --> 01:16:56,361
- You cannot do that.
- Pardon?

1302
01:16:57,529 --> 01:16:59,615
She is not that kind of woman.

1303
01:17:00,407 --> 01:17:02,117
She is not meant for Jahongwon.

1304
01:17:03,243 --> 01:17:05,579
Then what will you do with her?

1305
01:17:08,373 --> 01:17:09,458
<i>Jeez, that stings!</i>

1306
01:17:09,541 --> 01:17:10,834
<i>That look almost killed me.</i>

1307
01:17:12,753 --> 01:17:14,630
You will find out in due time.

1308
01:17:25,432 --> 01:17:27,517
<i>No. Don't do this.</i>

1309
01:17:29,561 --> 01:17:32,064
<i>No, you can't do this here.</i>

1310
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:34,524
<i>She's watching!</i>

1311
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:37,694
You will cling to me then…

1312
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:41,865
and beg for your life.

1313
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:48,205
<i>Oh, I have the chills.</i>
<i>Is he going to torture me or something?</i>

1314
01:17:49,122 --> 01:17:51,792
<i>I'm getting chills all over.</i>

1315
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:28,620
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

1316
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:31,832
<i>I am certain His Majesty took an interest</i>
<i>in that wench.</i>

1317
01:18:33,458 --> 01:18:34,876
Starting today,

1318
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,462
<i>you are to cook for me</i>
<i>every day without fail.</i>

1319
01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:40,048
<i>If the food is not to my liking,</i>

1320
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:41,925
<i>you will be sentenced to death.</i>

1321
01:18:42,008 --> 01:18:45,011
Before you get into huge trouble
and are humiliated…

1322
01:18:45,095 --> 01:18:48,432
<i>- I must set a trap in the royal kitchen.</i>
- A snake!

1323
01:18:48,515 --> 01:18:50,267
<i>You set this up, didn't you?</i>

1324
01:18:51,518 --> 01:18:52,686
<i>I have…</i>

1325
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:55,355
<i>- You cannot, Your Grace.</i>
<i>- Step aside!</i>

1326
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:56,940
<i>…chosen you.</i>

1327
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:58,442
<i>For what?</i>

1328
01:19:01,653 --> 01:19:06,658
