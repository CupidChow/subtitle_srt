00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:49,966
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

2
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:51,468
ROYAL KITCHEN

3
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:54,471
<i>I have never seen</i>
<i>anything like this before.</i>

4
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,264
What is this called?

5
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,559
For the third round,
where we need to make a soup dish,

6
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,728
we'll use this.

7
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,315
This cast-iron pot

8
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,108
is made to be heated from the bottom,

9
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,652
and it traps the steam,

10
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:12,822
which allows the pressure to increase.

11
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:16,201
But we have not
even started the first round,

12
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:19,370
so why are we
already discussing the third round?

13
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,372
What I learned from cooking competitions

14
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:24,834
is that you have to be
well-prepared for the last round to win.

15
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,045
Everyone does well
in the first two rounds.

16
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:30,799
The third round is when you become
exhausted and run out of ideas,

17
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,676
and that's the round
that separates the winner from the loser.

18
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,514
So the key to our strategy
is to plan in reverse order.

19
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:41,935
For the third round, we are expected
to make soup with ginseng, are we not?

20
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:45,563
Ginseng eel soup, ginseng loach soup,
ginseng short rib soup.

21
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,607
The only choice is to make
one of those nourishing dishes,

22
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:51,110
so why do we need a pot like this
when we already have cauldrons?

23
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,156
The most appropriate ginseng soup
that comes to my mind

24
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,575
is <i>ogolgye samgyetang,</i>
Silkie ginseng chicken soup.

25
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,245
<i>- "Ogolgye samgyetang"</i>?
<i>- "Ogolgye samgyetongue"</i>?

26
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:02,122
What is "<i>samgyetongue</i>"?

27
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,749
Are you saying you will make soup
with a chicken's tongue?

28
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:05,959
Oh, "<i>san ge</i>," as in "live crabs."

29
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:08,753
Maybe the soup includes crabs,
so it is a seafood soup of some sort.

30
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:11,840
<i>I see.</i>

31
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,717
<i>So</i> samgyetang<i> didn't exist in this era.</i>

32
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:20,431
<i>Samgyetang </i>is a soup dish where a chicken,
stuffed with ginseng and medicinal herbs,

33
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,559
is simmered until tender.

34
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,561
Not only do you want this ridiculous pot,

35
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,855
but you also want to cut open
and stuff an <i>ogolgye</i>, Silkie,

36
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,273
and make it into a soup?

37
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:31,442
If you stuff a chicken,
the stuffing will turn to mash

38
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,820
while the chicken cooks.

39
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,238
You do not know your soups, do you?

40
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,531
Of course I do.

41
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:39,075
Ingredients cook at different intervals,

42
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,870
and that's why this soup must be cooked

43
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,956
with effort and the help of science.

44
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,000
- Effort?
- Signs?

45
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:51,296
First, we must obtain a pressure cooker
to cook the <i>ogolgye</i> in.

46
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:55,550
Then this is the first effort
we put into this dish.

47
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:58,928
We'll then wash the <i>ogolgye</i>
in water filtered through loess soil

48
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,305
to get rid of the gamey smell.

49
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,765
That would be the second effort.

50
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,728
And lastly, we'll use red ginseng
that is at least six years old,

51
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,938
jujube, milkvetch root, dendropanax,

52
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,899
bellflower root,
lady bell, dried deer antler, and more.

53
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,984
We'll use ten medicinal herbs

54
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,778
to make a broth to cook the chicken in.

55
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,947
Exactly how much effort does it need?

56
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,867
Cook Yeon,
is that the last effort we put in?

57
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,203
Once we put our heart into the dish,

58
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,204
it's complete.

59
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,625
It sounds like we could use our cauldron.

60
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,710
To tenderize
the tough meat of wild <i>ogolgye</i>

61
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,754
at the same speed as the other ingredients

62
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:35,798
and achieve the effect of boiling
for ten hours within just one hour…

63
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:36,841
PRESSURE COOKER

64
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,801
…this is absolutely necessary.

65
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,678
I have never seen or heard of it.

66
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,680
What if we cannot get this?

67
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:46,643
Come to your senses, Cook Min.
Where are we to find that thing?

68
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,602
I'll have it made.

69
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:51,105
Cook Yeon! You are not making any sense!

70
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,691
Who in the world could ever make this?

71
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,985
I understand we must trust her
on this matter,

72
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,320
so forget everything else.

73
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,614
But you are saying
you want to have a pot made.

74
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:00,865
This is not a forge.

75
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,533
It won't be easy,

76
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,702
but if we have this pot,

77
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,038
we can cook something
with an incomparable depth of flavor.

78
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,958
Are you sure it can be done?

79
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,459
Yes.

80
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,504
If my memory serves me correctly,

81
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:18,549
there is one man in Joseon

82
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,636
who can make this.

83
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:29,143
COURSE N° 7 DONGNAE PAJEON ON A RAINY DAY

84
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:32,897
FIRST ROUND DISH

85
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,030
CHICKEN

86
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,282
We're done for.

87
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,745
What is this strange-looking thing?

88
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,963
PUMPKIN RICE SYRUP

89
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,007
VINEGAR

90
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,602
- Ya Feixiu.
- Okay.

91
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,203
- This is <i>gochugaru</i>, chili powder.
- <i>Gochogaru</i>?

92
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,707
My gosh, it is spicy.

93
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,084
This is gochujang.

94
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,794
We'll mix these two

95
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,589
to make a sauce for the <i>galbijjim,</i>
braised short ribs.

96
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,600
THIRD ROUND DISH

97
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:54,062
<i>Ogolgye</i> meat is tough
and takes a long time to cook.

98
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,022
But if you cook for too long,
it tastes bad.

99
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,398
It is not a suitable ingredient
for a competition.

100
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,524
That is exactly why

101
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,903
we need to use this pressure cooker.

102
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,489
Water boils at 100°C,
but at 2 atmospheric pressures,

103
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:05,907
it boils at 120°C.

104
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,410
In other words,
it's possible to cook the chicken

105
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,579
until it's so soft
you could even eat the bones.

106
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:14,749
- So how is this thing made?
- Well…

107
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,292
Hang on.

108
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,798
What is it?

109
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,049
That's weird.

110
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:24,509
It's nothing.

111
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,304
That was close.

112
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,308
GANGNYEONGJEON

113

PRESSURE COOKER, PACKING,
COMPRESS, CAST-IRON POT

114
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:38,731
What on earth do you plan to do
with something like this?

115
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,442
I'll use it to cook the soup
in the third round.

116
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,861
It's a very important pot
that will determine the taste of our dish.

117
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:47,281
It's where cooking meets science.

118
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:51,911
Your Majesty, I need this to create a dish
that doesn't exist in this era.

119
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,079
Are you asking me

120
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:56,124
to find someone who will make this?

121
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,250
That's right.

122
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,168
Isn't there someone

123
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,420
called Jang Yeong-sil here?

124
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,631
I think he could make it.

125
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,677
The grand military protector
who invented the hemispherical sundial

126
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,095
and water clock?

127
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,472
That man…

128
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:17,145
The late king thought highly of him.

129
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,438
The late king?

130
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,857
Then are you saying he's not here anymore?

131
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,777
There might be someone at Gungisi,
Government Arsenal, who can help.

132
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,028
Gungisi?

133
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,030
It is where weapons are made for the army.

134
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,658
They make cannons, swords, and spears.

135
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:33,244
The people there can't make this.

136
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,705
I need an inventor.

137
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:38,875
Your Majesty.

138
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,626
CHANG-SEON
CHIEF EUNUCH OF ROYAL FOOD

139
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,128
There is Jang Chun-saeng.

140
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,052
<i>He is the descendant of the</i>
<i>grand military protector Jang Yeong-sil.</i>

141
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,846
Jang Yeong-sil's descendant?

142
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,556
Tell us more about him.

143
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,768
He was well-known within Gungisi
for making bizarre things.

144
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,896
He was dismissed last summer

145
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,899
for causing an explosion on the grounds.

146
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,609
An explosion?

147
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,320
Where is he now?

148
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,697
I heard he returned to his hometown.

149
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,493
We should be able to get more information
if we inquire at Gungisi.

150
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,913
Your Majesty,
please let me see him immediately.

151
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:17,955
There's no time.

152
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,415
There is no need to make a fuss.

153
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,709
Rushing never works--

154
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,127
Without the pressure cooker,

155
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,296
it'll be hard to beat the Ming cooks
with soup.

156
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,548
I really need this
to tenderize the meat of the <i>ogolgye</i>

157
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,676
and make the ginseng seep into the broth.

158
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,721
We barely have enough time
to prepare for the first two rounds.

159
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,598
I have to get the other ingredients too.

160
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,100
There are plenty of ingredients
within the palace, are there not?

161
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,101
The thing is,

162
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:43,356
what I want are fresh ingredients
from the wild outdoors.

163
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,274
Freshly-plucked ingredients

164
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,068
determine how a dish turns out.

165
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,364
Then I should accompany you.

166
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:54,158
You cannot, Your Majesty.

167
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:57,328
The envoys are at Taepyeonggwan,
Official Reception Hall.

168
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,454
That is not all.

169
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,665
Cook Yeon needs to set off to prepare

170
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,959
for a competition
that our nation's future depends on.

171
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:03,876
It would not be right

172
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,212
for you to leave the palace
at such a time, Your Majesty.

173
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,008
Very well then.

174
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,593
I will permit your departure.

175
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:14,512
Thank you, Your Majesty.

176
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:15,596
However,

177
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,099
I cannot allow you to travel alone.

178
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:19,642
Pardon?

179
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,144
Travel safely.

180
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,229
I will.

181
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:24,730
I'll be back soon.

182
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,819
Use it if you need men or horses.

183
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:30,736
Yes, Your Majesty.

184
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,823
We shall leave now, Your Majesty.

185
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,076
Go on.

186
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,506
Su-hyeok.

187
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:55,469
Do you not think
people would find those two strange?

188
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,930
I am not certain I understand,
Your Majesty.

189
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:01,142
Do they not look like they are married?

190
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,311
Oh, I see what you mean, Your Majesty.

191
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,939
Cook Yeon is too fair a lady
to be thought of as his brother,

192
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,025
but they do not look like
a married couple.

193
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,192
I cannot let this be.

194
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,445
Yes, Your Majesty.

195
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,074
Will I really get <i>Mangunrok</i> back?

196
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,244
You talk about that book
whenever you see me.

197
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:23,664
His Majesty said he would find it,
so stop asking about it.

198
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,250
It's because it's an important book to me.

199
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:30,129
I'm really going to return
as soon as this competition's over.

200
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,214
Do you still want to return that badly?

201
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,008
What do you mean?

202
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:37,136
His Majesty seems to have grown
quite fond of you.

203
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,472
What do you mean he grew fond of me?

204
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:43,225
Watching you interact with him
makes me wonder

205
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:47,688
if one day I will have to speak to you
in polite speech reserved for royals.

206
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,231
"Your Grace."

207
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,317
"Your Grace Yeon Ji-young."

208
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,694
I don't believe this.

209
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,738
Stop talking nonsense.

210
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,199
I'm going to go back, so don't worry.

211
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:01,160
You should just take this chance
to win His Majesty's heart.

212
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,870
Let me ask you something.

213
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:05,247
What do you gain
from breathing down my neck about it?

214
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,041
"Breathe down your neck"? How ridiculous.

215
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,417
I have never gone near your neck.

216
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:09,960
What does that mean anyway?

217
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,504
Don't ask!

218
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:13,422
My goodness!

219
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,050
Oh dear.

220
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,552
What are you doing here?

221
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,763
GONG-GIL
YEONHUIGUN'S JESTER WITH MANY SECRETS

222
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,353
Your Majesty.

223
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,397
What brings you here, Your Majesty?

224
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,277
Men and women over the age of seven
must be watched closely.

225
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,238
If we were to accompany Cook Yeon,

226
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,949
she would not attract any attention
or misunderstanding.

227
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:43,160
Your Majesty, Cook Yeon is dressed
as a man, so you need not--

228
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,412
Enough.

229
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,957
Anyone can tell she is a woman.

230
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:51,877
Your Majesty.

231
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,046
The envoys are at Taepyeonggwan.

232
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,256
They are indeed.

233
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,342
That is why you should return.

234
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:05,516
Your duty to guard the palace
is just as important.

235
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,727
With all due respect, Your Majesty,
you cannot do this.

236
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,396
You must walk a great distance too.

237
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,398
This journey

238
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,859
is to prepare for a competition
that the nation's future depends on.

239
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,404
Do you not think it is only right
that I walk the distance myself?

240
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,325
We should hurry.

241
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,077
We do not want to be late.

242
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,955
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

243
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,082
Your Majesty…

244
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,167
Su-hyeok.

245
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,044
- Wait for me!
- Cook Yeon.

246
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:35,796
Gong-gil!

247
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,344
Where is His Majesty?

248
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,762
He has left the palace.

249
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,140
You should have stopped him.

250
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,391
You know this is not the time for--

251
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,602
How was I to stop him
when he had made up his mind

252
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,061
and came in a disguise?

253
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,231
I will guard the hall of governance.

254
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,318
You take care of His Majesty's chambers.

255
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,535
His Majesty is of ill health,

256
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,829
so no morning assembly
will be held for a while.

257
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:14,001
Do focus on hosting the envoys
and preparing for the cooking competition.

258
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,795
For anything else,
you may submit a written report.

259
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,006
His Majesty has fallen ill
all of a sudden?

260
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:20,716
What is going on?

261
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,344
He was fine and well just yesterday,
was he not?

262
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,889
That is all you need to know.

263
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,475
Excuse us then.

264
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:30,476
Let us go.

265
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,530
Gong-gil.

266
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:44,907
Where is this place?

267
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,535
My legs are killing me.

268
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,620
We are almost there, Your Majesty.

269
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,080
Hang in there a bit longer.

270
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,374
Your Majesty, when we get there,

271
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:57,253
you can't say things like,
"I am the king of this country," okay?

272
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,839
Why must I hide what is a fact?

273
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,091
What if you say that

274
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:03,926
and he says something like,

275
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,512
"I am sorry,
but I cannot make what you wish."

276
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,222
What will you do then?

277
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,807
Then I will torture him.

278
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,433
Your Majesty.

279
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,102
All right.

280
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,562
Do you promise?

281
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,232
Jeez.

282
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,483
We should get going.

283
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,235
Let's go.

284
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:27,116
<i>His Majesty has left the palace again?</i>

285
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,534
Yes, Your Highness.

286
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:31,495
I heard he left with the chief royal cook.

287
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,538
Why?

288
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,708
The competition is just days away.

289
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,002
Why did he leave at this important time?

290
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,170
According to the maids
at the royal kitchen,

291
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,882
they are looking for a bizarre object
to use in the competition.

292
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,758
A bizarre object?

293
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,429
It might be a good idea

294
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:53,017
to use this as an opportunity
to cancel the competition completely.

295
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,227
Would you not agree?

296
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,478
Your Highness.

297
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,273
Should we not wait
until the envoys return to Ming?

298
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,274
Lord Sung!

299
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,027
Do you not understand
the importance of this competition?

300
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,695
The outcome of this competition

301
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,614
will ignite the flames for our revolt.

302
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,698
You are right, Your Highness.

303
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,910
Do not forget we have well-trained men.

304
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:15,539
Are you referring to the men
who are training at the Mount Guwol base?

305
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:17,917
Tell them

306
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,879
I would like to see
the skills they have honed.

307
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,674
The target…

308
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,930
is the chief royal cook.

309
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,688
Are we at the right place?

310
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:41,732
I am sure of it.

311
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:44,234
Those at Gungisi said to go
to the end of Naesan Valley.

312
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,154
What does that sign say?

313
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:50,616
"Anyone who opens the gate
without permission

314
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,035
will hasten their demise."

315
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,829
- "Jang Chun-saeng."
- "Jang…"

316
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,540
This is unbelievable.

317
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,668
This is why they say
eccentrics have no manners.

318
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,920
How dare he say we need his permission?

319
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,131
Your Majesty, please!

320
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:13,847
Jang Chun-saeng!

321
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,891
Come forth
and show respect to your visitors.

322
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,309
What a pain.

323
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,444
It's… It's a cannon.

324
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,905
You opened the gate so abruptly,

325
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,699
and it lit the cannon's fuse!

326
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:35,577
- Get out of here!
- Get out of here!

327
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,497
What on earth was that?

328
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:23,208
That is what I would like to ask.

329
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,794
What is all this?

330
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,213
It does not seem to be a weapon.

331
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:29,882
Jang Chun-saeng.

332
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,676
- I ought to--
- I ought to show you this!

333
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,596
Look at how strong this tree looks.

334
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,639
- My gosh, it worked!
- Mister Jang Chun-saeng?

335
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,557
It worked!

336
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,064
Are these rice puffs?

337
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,608
"Rice puff"?

338
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,488
They are rice puffs.

339
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,740
We came to the right place.

340
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,868
Why would you say that
about a piece of <i>hangwa, </i>rice confection?

341
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:00,079
This isn't just a simple snack.

342
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,997
It's a fusion of cooking and science.

343
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,791
It's molecular gastronomy.

344
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,000
"Molecular gastronomy"?

345
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,509
The quantity increased,
but it tastes too bland.

346
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:17,262
So you are the insolent Jang Chun-saeng?

347
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,724
- Do you know who I am? How dare you.
- No, wait.

348
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,351
Who are you?

349
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,644
I doubt you are the king.

350
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:26,230
Who are you to just barge into my house?

351
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,397
What did you say?

352
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,316
I am the--

353
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:32,152
Goodness, Lord Im Song-jae.

354
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:35,072
Please do not be so angry.

355
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:37,282
Oh, the <i>chaehong</i> inspector?

356
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:40,202
That is who you are.
No wonder you were so haughty.

357
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,623
Yes. He is the Chief Royal Secretary.

358
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:48,085
You knew that and still threatened us
with a fake cannon?

359
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,254
- How dare you--
- If

360
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,923
I had known you were from the palace,

361
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:57,636
you would have been showered
with iron balls, not rice.

362
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,138
How dare you speak so insolently?

363
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,598
Why do I hear dogs barking here?

364
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,392
Oh, I see there are two dogs.

365
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,478
- You insolent--
- Wait.

366
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:15,237
You have a very keen eye, sir.

367
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,864
I am no sir.

368
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:24,538
<i>A puffing machine</i>
<i>that uses heat and pressure.</i>

369
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,790
<i>Maybe this man could…</i>

370
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:30,794
Greetings.

371
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:34,965
I am Chief Royal Cook Yeon Ji-young
of the royal kitchen.

372
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,384
This truly is strange.

373
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,386
The Chief Royal Secretary
came all the way here

374
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:41,763
with a female chief royal cook
disguised as a man?

375
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:45,058
Is it that obvious?

376
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,021
You won't believe me,

377
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,480
but it's all true.

378
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:54,985
We've come a long way
to ask you for a favor.

379
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:58,864
It's an important matter
that concerns the nation's future.

380
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,365
The nation's future?

381
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,534
Let the king take care of that.

382
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,161
Why did you come to me?

383
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:07,748
Must I threaten to take your life
to make you see reason?

384
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,044
So the intruder threatens the homeowner.

385
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,672
You had better leave now.

386
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,219
I can no longer guarantee your safety.

387
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,554
You are truly helpless.

388
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:24,806
- Su-hyeok.
- Yes!

389
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,017
No, please. Come on.

390
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,354
You promised not to be like this.

391
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,566
Sir.

392
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,568
It's not related to national affairs.

393
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,196
It's a personal favor
I need to ask of you.

394
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,822
I warned you.

395
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:41,823
Wait!

396
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:42,950
Wait.

397
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:48,705
Gosh, you are so impatient.

398
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:52,542
Why not hear what she has to say first?

399
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,557
You know what? Let's forget it.

400
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,476
Let's get out of here.

401
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,436
- Come on, hurry!
- Is he out of his mind?

402
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,021
- You…
- Let's go.

403
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,399
- I will teach you--
- Hurry!

404
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:17,985
My goodness.

405
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,449
It's a shame.

406
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:27,786
I was going to tell you
how to make the rice puffs taste good.

407
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:28,912
"Rice puffs"?

408
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,498
You mean the rice I popped?

409
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,418
What about them?

410
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:36,628
<i>It worked.</i>

411
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:38,880
Hang on.

412
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:42,342
Do you really know
how to make this bland thing taste good?

413
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,971
Let's see.

414
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,854
It's sugar.

415
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,939
Add some to your next batch of rice.

416
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:56,857
Goodbye then.

417
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:10,579
What do we do
now that we have been thrown out?

418
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:13,582
We should torture him if we must,
so he will make your pot.

419
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,085
Who was it that said
eccentrics had no manners?

420
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,172
What if he really pulled that handle?

421
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,631
I am sure it was a bluff.

422
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:22,674
Your Majesty.

423
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:26,762
I have never seen a man like that bluff.

424
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,056
How dare you take that tone
in the presence of His Majesty?

425
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,474
Presence, my foot.

426
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:33,226
We were close to not being present here.

427
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,312
This isn't the time to argue.

428
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:38,565
If you want to fight,
you can do so on our way back.

429
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:39,691
I won't stop you then.

430
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,777
My goodness.

431
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,403
I feel utterly humiliated.

432
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,359
You added the sugar, didn't you?

433
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:29,032
- You are still there?
- I can't leave empty-handed.

434
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,743
How is it? Doesn't it taste better?

435
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:34,412
The sugar does make it sweeter.

436
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,790
- But it is a bad idea.
- How so?

437
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:40,919
I made this machine to double
the rice volume to feed the people.

438
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,005
But what is the point
if it requires sugar?

439
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,424
Sugar is too expensive.

440
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:49,469
That's all the more reason to help me.

441
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,680
If I win this competition,

442
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,891
Joseon can import much more sugarcane
at a much cheaper price.

443
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:58,687
Then won't everyone
be able to enjoy your rice puffs?

444
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:02,649
Is what you said
about the sugarcane really true?

445
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,235
I'm with the king right--

446
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:07,195
I mean…

447
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,865
I came with someone really high up,

448
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,908
so why would I lie to you?

449
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,702
Are you actually the chief royal cook?

450
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,374
Here. Take a look.

451
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,170
CHIEF ROYAL COOK

452
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:27,883
Then is he really
the Chief Royal Secretary?

453
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,719
Yes, he is.

454
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,722
Why would you travel
with that treacherous man?

455
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:37,517
Well, it's a long story.

456
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,688
What do you need my help with?

457
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,273
One second.

458
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,901
Look at this.

459
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,069
This pressure cooker.

460
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:56,703
Thank you.

461
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:01,583
What are those two
planning to do alone in there?

462
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,127
- I ought to--
- No, Your Majesty!

463
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,254
Please calm down.

464
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,549
We must get what we came for first.

465
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,844
There seems to be some progress.

466
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:13,970
We should wait, Your Majesty.

467
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,184
I am already getting frustrated

468
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,311
when the competition has not even begun.

469
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,235
This is a pot that traps the steam
from the boiling water.

470
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,402
Yes, that's right.

471
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:33,031
And you can use the weight valve
to release the steam

472
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:34,658
when the pressure reaches a certain level.

473
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:35,659
That's right.

474
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:37,285
Water boils at 100°C at standard pressure,

475
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,412
but at twice the atmospheric pressure,
it boils at 120°C.

476
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,122
In other words,

477
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,375
it makes it possible
to cook meat so thoroughly

478
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,293
that you can even eat the bone.

479
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:48,630
I have no clue what you mean,

480
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:53,051
but the pot will explode
if the seams weaken in the slightest.

481
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,595
So I must use malleable iron.

482
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:59,724
Why am I even giving this any thought?

483
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,227
Get right to the point.

484
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,020
Why must I make this?

485
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,147
A few days from now, a cooking competition

486
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,525
between the Ming and Joseon
will take place at Huijeongdang.

487
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:09,985
And in order to win,

488
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:11,820
I need this.

489
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,281
A cook from the Ming, you say?

490
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:15,824
They will be tough to beat.

491
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:17,659
Can you win?

492
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,452
With your help, I can.

493
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:22,831
We have a better chance
if we have the pot.

494
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,085
I will not do it.

495
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:29,587
I do not want to help those high-ups
who discard people

496
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:31,881
when they have done their use.

497
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,510
Wait, Mister Chun-saeng.

498
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,223
Joseon will have a lot to lose
if we lose this competition.

499
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:41,891
The people will suffer too.

500
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:45,312
So will you please help me?

501
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:47,772
That will not change the world.

502
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:50,984
Would Master Jang Yeong-sil

503
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,486
have agreed with that?

504
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:57,907
Do you know my uncle?

505
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,953
Yes. My uncle might have helped you.

506
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,123
Only to be used and discarded again.

507
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,209
That is why I will not help.

508
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:11,629
You should leave.

509
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,555
This really isn't easy.

510
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:36,363
What did I tell you?

511
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,573
You cannot reason with him.

512
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,369
Let us take him to the government office.

513
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,287
We are short on time as it is.

514
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,331
Your Majesty.

515
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:49,000
Men like him have nothing
but malice left in them.

516
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,543
You must appeal to his heart.

517
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:54,547
If you use force, the thing he makes
may look fine on the outside,

518
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,591
but it will most likely be…

519
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:00,345
It will most likely be a mess
if you actually try to use it.

520
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,097
Yes.

521
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,640
Gong-gil's right.

522
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:06,476
When Your Majesty forced me to cook,

523
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,019
I only thought of running away.

524
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,104
What?

525
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:12,774
But you have been doing just fine so far,
have you not?

526
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:16,069
What if the pressure cooker
is not made right?

527
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:17,195
What will you do then?

528
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:19,155
Then I will cut off his hands

529
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,615
and annihilate
three generations of his family.

530
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:25,161
Your Majesty,
we must persuade him to make a good pot,

531
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,454
not threaten him.

532
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,164
What do you suggest we do then?

533
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:30,417
I need to appeal to his heart,

534
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,545
but I can't think of a good idea.

535
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:38,258
All of you,
come up with some good ideas by tonight.

536
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:39,592
Yes, Your Majesty.

537
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,344
Yes, Your Majesty.

538
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,723
JAHONGWON

539
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,809
He left the palace
with the chief royal cook?

540
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,062
How could he do such a thing?

541
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,647
Please remain calm, Your Grace.

542
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:53,857
CHU-WOL
INSPECTOR COURT LADY

543
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,151
It seems to be for the competition.

544
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:59,946
More importantly, I have something
to report regarding the jester Gong-gil

545
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:01,865
that you told me to look into.

546
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,450
I learned something

547
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,910
from the leader of a group
he used to perform with.

548
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,412
What is it?

549
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:10,373
Do you, perhaps, remember Ok-dan?

550
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:14,836
Do you mean the girl
who once stayed at Jahongwon?

551
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:18,840
Yes, Your Grace.
That Ok-dan was Gong-gil's older sister.

552
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:24,846
Then

553
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,932
the reason he is lurking about the palace…

554
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:31,060
It must be related to her death.

555
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:35,607
Send someone to find out more about him.

556
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:36,775
Yes, Your Grace.

557
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:47,952
His Majesty
left the palace with Cook Yeon?

558
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,120
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

559
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:53,166
I do not know what this excursion
could possibly mean,

560
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,585
but it is a fact that he has left.

561
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:58,880
He was never secretive
about his excursions.

562
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,423
Would there be any meaning to it?

563
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:05,220
He would not leave the palace
knowing the Ming envoy is here.

564
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,387
That is right.

565
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:10,141
His Majesty may be young and immature,
therefore impulsive,

566
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:12,811
but he is not that senseless.

567
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:15,855
Could it be because of the competition
with the Ming cooks?

568
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:18,983
Do you believe he left the palace
to prepare for that?

569
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,278
It cannot be
that His Majesty has developed feelings

570
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:24,572
for the chief royal cook, could it?

571
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,325
Watch what you say.

572
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,363
ROYAL KITCHEN

573
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:24,132
It tastes good, but it is nothing special.

574
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,634
I guess our chief royal cook is right.

575
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,053
It seems cooking the <i>ogolgye</i>
with our usual cauldron will not do.

576
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,889
When will she be back?

577
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:35,226
I cut and cleaned the short ribs
or whatever they are.

578
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,270
It would seem we are ready
for the first round, would it not?

579
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:40,106
Did you store the <i>gochogaru</i> and gochojang?

580
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,399
Of course.

581
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:42,692
Cook Min stored them safely

582
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:45,445
in the grain storage in Saongwon,
Office of Royal Meals.

583
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:47,530
What about the duck she asked to get?

584
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:48,948
Bong-sik!

585
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,409
Bong-sik.

586
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,453
You need to come with me quickly.

587
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,039
What is this about?

588
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:58,791
Cook Maeng is acting strangely.

589
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,753
How so? Is his anxiety flaring up?

590
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:03,588
Again! Do it again!

591
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:04,923
Goodness, that scared me.

592
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:13,806
Stop.

593
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,645
If you chop them like this,

594
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:21,856
are you telling me to use them
or throw them out?

595
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:23,483
I am sorry.

596
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,526
I will do it again.

597
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,320
Chop according to my pace.

598
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,951
How can you still be so bad at chopping?

599
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,203
Go and sharpen the knife again!

600
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,163
Move.

601
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,464
Goodness, what is with Cook Maeng?

602
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,549
He used to be so nice to her.

603
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,717
What got into him?

604
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,427
He is being quite strange.

605
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,805
He is much stricter
than when he taught me.

606
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:57,684
He is sensitive
because his life is on the line.

607
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:02,355
Why is he teaching Maid Seo anyway?

608
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,444
KONG WENLI
MASTER OF KUNG FU CUISINE

609
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:13,449
TANG BAILONG
MASTER OF SICHUAN CUISINE

610
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:16,828
Good.

611
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:22,083
I have not seen you this passionate
in a long time.

612
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:26,045
Our pride as cooks
depends on this competition.

613
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,047
Though there is nothing for us to gain
from winning,

614
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,591
losing would be
an indescribable humiliation.

615
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,970
We shall not look down on a small nation
for its modest size,

616
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,472
nor be arrogant merely because
we come from a great nation.

617
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,391
There is an idiom that goes,

618
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:40,727
"One cannot be a good cook

619
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,063
if their skill comes before their virtue."

620
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,940
I always remember your teaching.

621
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,192
Always remain humble

622
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,986
as we show them

623
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:53,114
what the greatest cooks of Ming can do.

624
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,574
Yes, Brother Tang.

625
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,744
Anyway,

626
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,956
where is Ya Feixiu?

627
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,459
Well, look who is here.

628
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,878
You are one of the Ming cooks,
are you not?

629
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,671
What brings you here?

630
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:13,676
Before I explain, please accept this.

631
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:23,811
These are <i>chopi</i>, Sichuan pepper.

632
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,898
HUAJIAO: NUMBING, SPICY SEASONING
MADE FROM THE FRUIT OF PRICKLY ASH

633
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:30,818
These are not just any <i>chopi,</i>
but Sichuan's best, <i>huajiao</i>.

634
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:36,449
Why did you bring me
something so valuable?

635
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:42,622
There is something
I wish to exchange with this.

636
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:49,253
The weather is not on our side either.

637
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:54,175
It would be dreadful
if His Majesty were to catch a cold.

638
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,844
I am drenched already.

639
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,307
Commander,

640
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:04,268
do not just stand there and join us here.

641
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,520
You are getting soaked in the rain.

642
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:08,022
Do not mind me.

643
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,650
You are wet
because you are standing there.

644
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:14,529
Why go overbroad
when you can stand guard under the roof?

645
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,409
On a rainy day like this,

646
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:23,579
some <i>pajeon</i>, scallion pancakes,
with <i>makgeolli</i>, rice wine,

647
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:26,499
would raise my spirits.

648
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,460
Do you not agree, Your Majesty?

649
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,003
<i>Pajeon, </i>you say?

650
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,174
The thought alone pleases me.

651
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,222
Yes, <i>pajeon</i>.

652
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:44,142
Your Majesty, where was
Master Jang Yeong-sil's hometown again?

653
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:45,977
How would I know that?

654
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,816
Based on Jang Chun-saeng's accent,

655
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:55,444
I would say he is from Dongnae,
Busan Port.

656
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,697
So he's from Busan, right?

657
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,614
Yes.

658
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,700
That's what I thought as well.

659
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:09,584
What is it?

660
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:14,255
There might be a way
to persuade Mister Chun-saeng.

661
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,301
Let's go buy some ingredients first.

662
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,136
There's no point if the rain stops,

663
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:23,514
- so we must hurry.
- What? My goodness.

664
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,688
They left at last.

665
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:33,858
I made more rice puffs,

666
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:35,568
but it does not taste good
without the sugar.

667
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,696
It does not fill me at all.

668
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:41,365
Darn it.

669
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,835
This needs to be cleaned too.

670
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,810
What are you waiting for?

671
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,896
You have no idea how to cook this.

672
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:15,524
Dongnae <i>pajeon</i> batter has to be thick.

673
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,568
- Otherwise, it's a no-go.
- What is not going where?

674
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,154
You have to lay out
the scallions like this

675
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,864
and cook them thoroughly first.

676
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:24,367
It's time to start fanning.

677
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,953
Send the smell far away.

678
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,087
It smells absolutely amazing.

679
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,256
It is driving me crazy, Your Majesty.

680
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:49,183
You're doing a really great job
with the fan.

681
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,851
You're doing great, Su-hyeok and Gong-gil.

682
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:51,769
Good.

683
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,690
You're doing so well!
That's it. Fan harder now.

684
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,275
- Harder?
- Yes.

685
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,819
- Get out of the way.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

686
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:01,737
- No, Your Majesty.
- Move.

687
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,533
I apologize, Your Majesty.

688
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,081
My gosh, Your Majesty.

689
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:15,751
It feels like the mountain breeze.

690
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,587
- Do not speak.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

691
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:42,695
What is this smell?

692
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:44,155
My word.

693
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:45,865
Something smells amazing.

694
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,868
What is it?

695
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,084
He's here.

696
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,557
Wait, Mister Chun-saeng.

697
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,142
What?

698
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:15,102
Well, His Majesty…

699
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:18,898
I mean, the Chief Royal Secretary

700
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:21,817
wanted <i>pajeon</i> and <i>makgeolli</i>
as it was raining,

701
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:24,737
so we made a lot of <i>pajeon.</i>

702
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,531
Would you like some?

703
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:31,494
<i>Pajeon</i> is your hometown food, isn't it?

704
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:32,745
Yes, my hometown…

705
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:35,831
Forget it.

706
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,416
Let him be.

707
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,543
He need not eat if he does not want to.

708
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,337
Go on and cut the <i>pajeon</i>.

709
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:46,759
Let me just…

710
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:50,471
Hey, mister.

711
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:52,807
Do not be like that.

712
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,393
Come over and have some with us.

713
00:39:56,227 --> 00:40:00,815
Will you look at the golden-brown <i>pajeon</i>?

714
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,358
Is it not beautiful?

715
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:04,777
Come closer.

716
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,778
Darn it.

717
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:08,531
- Come on.
- Goodness me.

718
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:10,032
Try some.

719
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,806
Look at him just stuffing away.

720
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:36,725
- Do not mind me and eat.
- Yes.

721
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:06,964
<i>This taste!</i>

722
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:20,728
You might get an upset stomach.

723
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:21,729
Here.

724
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:24,273
There's a lot, so eat slowly.

725
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,444
I feel much better now.

726
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:31,530
My gosh.
This is the taste of my childhood.

727
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:34,867
It tastes like what I had
at a village feast as a child.

728
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:35,993
How did you make this?

729
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:38,329
My father is also from Busan.

730
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:39,497
Busan Port?

731
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,749
Yes, that's right. Busan Port.

732
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,543
- No wonder.
- Have some more.

733
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:53,761
You told me yesterday

734
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:58,682
that Master Jang Yeong-sil
was used and then discarded.

735
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:02,853
But just like how you remember
the taste of your childhood,

736
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:07,399
people will never forget him.

737
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,070
<i>Thanks to him,</i>

738
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:14,156
<i>people can tell the exact time…</i>

739
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:19,453
and they can observe
and read the stars too.

740
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:23,832
Mister Chun-saeng.

741
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,545
This might sound strange,

742
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:28,754
but to be honest,

743
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,715
I'm not from this time period.

744
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:35,302
It's a complicated story, but it's true.

745
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:40,808
Anyway, the reason
I'm so involved in this…

746
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:45,980
is because I love to cook.

747
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:51,402
It makes me really happy when I see
the satisfied look on the faces of people

748
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:52,736
who enjoy my food.

749
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:55,447
So through this competition,

750
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:59,159
I want to show the Ming cooks
my food as well as Korea's…

751
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:03,080
I mean, I want to show them
the taste of Joseon.

752
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:08,002
So could you help us by doing
what you love, Mister Chun-saeng?

753
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,504
Let's win this cooking competition

754
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:14,508
and get the Ming sugarcane
so everyone can enjoy

755
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,136
your delicious rice puffs at any time.

756
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:20,306
I'm sure that'll make you happy too.

757
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,433
For everyone's sake,

758
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,226
I beg of you.

759
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,185
Please?

760
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:27,187
Please.

761
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,576
I will make it.

762
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:41,577
You will?

763
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,164
Do you truly mean that?

764
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:47,207
I am not doing it for you,
so do not get excited.

765
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,753
- How dare you--
- Just stop saying that already.

766
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,130
Thank you.

767
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:54,840
Thank you so much!

768
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:56,467
Thank you too.

769
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,804
I never thought I would taste this again,

770
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,432
but you made it for me.

771
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:07,061
I missed the taste of my home…

772
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:10,314
my whole life.

773
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:13,609
Next time,

774
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,195
I'll tell you how to make
caramel rice puffs.

775
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,405
"Kernel" rice puffs?

776
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:28,040
So are you headed to Danyang?

777
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:30,584
Yes. I need some ingredients from there.

778
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:34,171
Assist him well
so the pot is ready upon our return.

779
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:35,172
Yes, Your…

780
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,218
My lord.

781
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:41,303
Do not slack off

782
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:42,429
and work hard.

783
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,015
We'll be late. Let's go.

784
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,101
I wish you well, my lord.

785
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:50,187
Here.

786
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:53,982
Let's go.

787
00:44:57,611 --> 00:45:00,322
Here is the mold.

788
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:01,448
Shall we begin?

789
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,076
Here goes.

790
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:23,929
What is this?

791
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:26,056
It looks like ginseng.

792
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:27,516
What?

793
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,812
This is wild ginseng, Your Majesty!

794
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,610
What are you doing?

795
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:39,736
Have you forgotten?

796
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,905
Everything on this land belongs to me.

797
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,867
This is even more so because I found it.

798
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,422
It should be done by tomorrow.

799
00:45:58,505 --> 00:45:59,923
That is good to hear.

800
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:02,176
The Chief Royal Secretary and cook
will be back by then.

801
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:03,177
It is perfect.

802
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:05,387
Let us hurry!

803
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:17,941
What is that?

804
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:20,277
I have not seen this oil before.

805
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:25,073
It is a secret weapon
with which we will win the first round.

806
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:29,077
Where did you get this from?

807
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,204
Trust me.

808
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:34,166
You have put me in charge
of the dish for the first round.

809
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:36,251
I will not let you down.

810
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:38,504
Do not take risks
with unfamiliar ingredients.

811
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:39,630
Once before--

812
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:44,551
Ya Feixiu.

813
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:47,179
I trust you.

814
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:52,434
The day of the competition is approaching.

815
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:53,477
Indeed.

816
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:02,027
I am looking forward
to the skills of the Ming cooks.

817
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:03,862
You will see for yourself in due time.

818
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:12,204
Let us speak in your language.

819
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,459
Yes, we can do that.

820
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:21,421
We have boarded the same ship already.

821
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,632
Let us be clear

822
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:26,093
about what we are giving and receiving.

823
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,886
Of course we will.

824
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:32,558
Your cooks will most definitely win
the competition.

825
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:38,564
It is possible the competition
might not happen at all.

826
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:40,732
What do you mean by that?

827
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:42,484
The chief royal cook

828
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:46,572
left the palace to obtain something
for the competition.

829
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:47,614
But you see,

830
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:53,412
a lot of dangerous things
happen outside the palace.

831
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,875
I wonder if we will all just end up

832
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:02,838
indulging in the delicacies
of the Ming that day.

833
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:05,632
Get a good night's rest,

834
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:08,594
and take your time coming to Huijeongdang
by the thirteenth hour tomorrow.

835
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:13,265
It seems my cooks might be
a little disappointed.

836
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:22,357
Make sure to thoroughly prepare
the ingredients for tomorrow.

837
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:23,525
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

838
00:48:24,901 --> 00:48:26,403
Oh dear.

839
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:30,616
The competition, at last, begins tomorrow.

840
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,785
Will the chief royal cook return on time?

841
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:35,579
I am sure she will.

842
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:37,414
Let us go and get a good night's sleep.

843
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:43,712
I feel a bit uneasy leaving only Cook Min
and Cook Sim behind.

844
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:47,424
Why worry when we even prepared
the late-night snacks with them?

845
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:49,551
By the way,

846
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:52,721
why are you giving Maid Seo
such a hard time?

847
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:55,057
The chief royal cook is not even here.

848
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,351
Do not be too hard on her.

849
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:00,896
I saw that you gave her
a lot of work again today.

850
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:12,783
If she is of no help here,
she should leave voluntarily.

851
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,496
How could he be so heartless?

852
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,539
And why is he so fast? Wait, Cook Maeng.

853
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:21,708
Cook Maeng. My goodness.

854
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,502
Do you not hear me?

855
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:25,879
Why are you following me
when we are going different ways anyway?

856
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:27,714
I called you so many…

857
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:38,600
What is that?

858
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,065
Who are you?

859
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:49,277
Give this to your king immediately.

860
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:55,325
The chief royal cook is in danger.

861
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,119
Hurry.

862
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:02,624
That grey hair.

863
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:06,002
The long grey hair.
He is with the Ming envoy, is he not?

864
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:08,588
That is impossible. He spoke our language.

865
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:11,842
Did you see that?

866
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:15,220
He was hiding a dagger underneath.

867
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:19,599
What does it say on the paper?

868
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:25,522
There is nothing on it.

869
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:32,028
- Greetings, Chief Eunuch.
- Greetings.

870
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:35,741
Why are you here at this hour?

871
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:38,285
We met a mysterious man
on our way out of the palace.

872
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:40,746
He told me to give this to His Majesty.

873
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:44,958
His face was covered by a black mask,
and he bore a terrifying presence.

874
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:46,668
He did not seem like an ordinary man.

875
00:50:48,044 --> 00:50:48,962
Very well.

876
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:50,464
You may go now.

877
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:51,840
- Yes, Chief Eunuch.
- Yes, Chief Eunuch.

878
00:50:58,221 --> 00:50:59,389
What is this?

879
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:24,289
<i>There are those who are targeting</i>
<i>the chief royal cook.</i>

880
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:27,667
<i>She might not last another day,</i>
<i>so you must hurry.</i>

881
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:28,794
Chief Eunuch.

882
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:32,130
Do you know how far away
Jang Chun-saeng lives?

883
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:35,801
If you take a fast horse,
you will arrive by dawn tomorrow.

884
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:37,719
Tell them to ready the horses.

885
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:39,179
- Hurry.
- Of course.

886
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:53,902
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

887
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:56,738
<i>Please stay safe until I reach you.</i>

888
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:05,080
DAY OF THE COMPETITION
MYOSI (BETWEEN 5 AND 7 A.M.)

889
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,597
It works. We did it, sir.

890
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,226
Come forth!

891
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:31,064
Welcome back, Your Majesty.

892
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:47,205
Only kill the girl.

893
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:55,422
You are greatly skilled indeed.

894
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,760
We stayed up all night to make it.

895
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:04,347
I made it strong enough

896
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:05,974
so that it withstands
high heat and pressure.

897
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:10,061
Cook Yeon, take this chance
to show them what you are capable of.

898
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:12,105
Thank you.

899
00:53:12,188 --> 00:53:13,857
Thank you so much, Mister Chun-saeng.

900
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:15,984
It's perfect!

901
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:19,696
I will reward you again at a later time.

902
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,281
Good work.

903
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:24,200
Now, let us return to the palace.

904
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:25,869
- Yes. We shall go.
- Oh, right.

905
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:28,330
I wish I could cook you a meal.

906
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,165
Do not worry.

907
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:31,541
Do visit again.

908
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:56,232
We are in trouble. Assassins are coming!

909
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:58,026
What? Assassins?

910
00:53:58,109 --> 00:53:59,194
What do you mean?

911
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:07,452
I hung a bell for every ten steps.
Seeing that they are coming at this speed…

912
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:10,288
They are well-trained men.
You must get away, Your Majesty.

913
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:11,247
"Your Majesty"?

914
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:15,126
I'm sorry. We were just…

915
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,922
You can explain later.

916
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:20,674
You must get away.

917
00:54:21,257 --> 00:54:22,717
Who on earth are they?

918
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:24,928
What do we do, Your Majesty?

919
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:26,054
Hide behind me.

920
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:31,601
Open the gate on my signal.

921
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:33,770
- Okay.
- We should be locking up.

922
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:35,063
Why open the gate?

923
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:36,356
Trust me, Your Majesty.

924
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:56,376
Now!

925
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:25,030
- Cook Yeon, run! Hurry!
- Okay!

926
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:27,073
- Your Majesty, let's go.
- Follow me.

927
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:09,574
No!

928
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:12,619
- No!
- What are you doing? We must go.

929
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:25,131
Gong-gil!
Take Cook Yeon out the back door!

930
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,424
I cannot use the weapons now!

931
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:28,593
We went through so much
for the pressure cooker.

932
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:29,803
Hurry!

933
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:32,514
Cook Yeon, I will bring it to you
by the time you need it.

934
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:35,058
So go now, or we will all die!

935
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:36,643
Okay.

936
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:42,690
Come this way!

937
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:52,617
Let us all die together!

938
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,624
Go after the girl!

939
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:12,470
<i>Why, darn it.</i>

940
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:26,443
Your Majesty.

941
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:30,405
I will hold them off while you get away.

942
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:32,240
- Very well.
- Stay safe.

943
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,576
Ensure His Majesty's safety.

944
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:37,120
We must go.

945
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:13,531
Your Majesty,
it would be best to part ways here.

946
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:14,949
I will stall them.

947
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:16,034
Very well.

948
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:17,202
We will go this way.

949
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:18,870
Thank you, Gong-gil.

950
00:58:18,953 --> 00:58:20,246
- Go, now!
- Let us go.

951
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,460
Over here!

952
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:33,343
Come at me.

953
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:54,322
No.

954
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:00,411
Who sent you?

955
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:13,758
Your Majesty!

956
00:59:19,305 --> 00:59:20,807
Your Majesty…

957
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,767
Your shoulder is bleeding.

958
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:25,186
There is no need to make a fuss.

959
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:26,729
It will not kill me.

960
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:57,302
Who is it?

961
00:59:57,385 --> 00:59:58,469
Who sent you?

962
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:14,819
Cook Yeon!

963
01:00:14,902 --> 01:00:16,195
Are you all right?

964
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:17,905
Wake up.

965
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:25,747
Open your eyes.

966
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:27,540
Your Majesty.

967
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,507
She seems to have fainted.

968
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:39,802
Please forgive me for being so late,
Your Majesty.

969
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:42,388
Thank you, Song-jae.

970
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,817
Will you slow down?

971
01:00:56,527 --> 01:00:57,528
Are you well?

972
01:00:58,196 --> 01:00:59,822
Yes, Your Majesty. I am well.

973
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:03,618
He would have died if it were not for me.

974
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:06,287
Is that so?

975
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:09,123
Su-hyeok is the best swordsman
in all of Joseon.

976
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:13,795
Well, I guess he rolled down a slope then.

977
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:18,424
I guess even the best swordsman
cannot beat a slope.

978
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,931
Is the chief royal cook all right?

979
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:28,017
It seems the shock made her faint.

980
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:30,728
I am glad she was not badly hurt
right before the competition.

981
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:34,774
These assassins
were unlike the ones from before.

982
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:37,777
- Is that so?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

983
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:40,154
These men have received military training.

984
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:42,198
- Military training?
- Their movement was coordinated,

985
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:45,201
and when caught,
they took their own lives to stay silent.

986
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:49,455
That means this attack was not conducted
for a personal reason.

987
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:50,581
Your Majesty.

988
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:53,084
They must be troops
sent by those with treacherous intentions.

989
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:56,838
The pressure cooker.

990
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:03,636
Are you all right?

991
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:10,351
Is everyone all right?

992
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:12,478
I am just fine.

993
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:14,605
Do not worry.

994
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:16,023
Everyone is safe.

995
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:18,484
I'm so glad.

996
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:21,904
I was scared to death.

997
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:27,785
Your Majesty, it's still
the day of the competition, right?

998
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:29,078
Indeed.

999
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:31,706
But you cannot compete
with an injured hand.

1000
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,041
I'm fine.

1001
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:36,002
- We must hurry back.
- But…

1002
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:38,212
That pot is missing its lid.

1003
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:41,924
Mister Chun-saeng said he'd bring the lid.

1004
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:43,092
I believe in him.

1005
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:46,345
We must hurry back. Let's go. Come on.

1006
01:02:51,058 --> 01:02:52,518
Pathetic fools.

1007
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:55,188
How am I to trust them with anything
when they fail each time?

1008
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:10,661
In any case,

1009
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:14,582
the competition will not go your way,
Your Majesty.

1010
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:19,086
HUIJEONGDANG

1011
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:45,196
Where are you, miss?

1012
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:03,464
It is almost the thirteenth hour,

1013
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:06,175
but neither the king

1014
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:09,637
nor the chief royal cook is present.

1015
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,014
I do not know how to take this.

1016
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:16,060
He asked where the king
and the chief royal cook are.

1017
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:19,230
Chief Eunuch.

1018
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:23,860
Inform the chief envoy that His Majesty
will arrive a little late.

1019
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:25,820
Yes, my lord.

1020
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:51,053
Are you certain you are unharmed?

1021
01:04:53,764 --> 01:04:55,808
I feel weak and nauseous.

1022
01:04:57,059 --> 01:05:00,104
I must be feeling sick
from being on a horse.

1023
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:05,610
Is it that you want an apology from me
for giving you a hard time?

1024
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:08,571
Of course not.

1025
01:05:09,822 --> 01:05:13,200
I do want to thank you
for what you did earlier.

1026
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:16,579
You were really cool.

1027
01:05:19,957 --> 01:05:22,668
Well, yes. I am good with a sword.

1028
01:05:24,712 --> 01:05:26,839
I am putting all of you
through a great deal of trouble.

1029
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:30,176
If only I had not suggested a competition…

1030
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,805
Why are you acting out of character?

1031
01:05:35,973 --> 01:05:37,141
I'm fine.

1032
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:39,936
We should hurry.

1033
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:40,895
Come on.

1034
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:52,740
<i>I am sorry, Cook Yeon,</i>

1035
01:05:53,991 --> 01:05:55,242
<i>for giving you a hard time.</i>

1036
01:05:58,204 --> 01:05:59,538
We have reached the agreed-upon time.

1037
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:02,667
Joseon has long been known
as the eastern land of courtesy.

1038
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:06,170
However,
this is inappropriate beyond belief.

1039
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,515
The chief envoy wonders

1040
01:06:17,598 --> 01:06:20,434
if the king and the chief royal cook
ran away to avoid the competition.

1041
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:23,145
How rude of them to utter such words!

1042
01:06:25,564 --> 01:06:28,192
What do we do if His Majesty

1043
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:31,570
does not appear before the time is up?

1044
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:33,239
Let us wait.

1045
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:38,452
It is truly inappropriate
to keep the chief envoy waiting.

1046
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:42,540
How about we begin the competition?

1047
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:53,300
It is the thirteenth hour!

1048
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:55,553
It is exactly the thirteenth hour.

1049
01:06:55,636 --> 01:06:57,722
We shall begin the competition.

1050
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:01,892
The cooks from each nation,
please step forward.

1051
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:09,734
Cook Eom.

1052
01:07:11,485 --> 01:07:13,404
Oh no, Cook Eom.

1053
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:15,865
What do we do now?

1054
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:22,371
My lord.

1055
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:25,082
This cannot be allowed.

1056
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:27,293
What do you mean?

1057
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:29,211
We still have until the fifteenth hour.

1058
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:32,715
I will not begin until then.

1059
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:35,051
What do you mean?

1060
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:39,013
My lord, it is time to show
how merciful our great nation is.

1061
01:07:39,096 --> 01:07:41,766
What did you say?

1062
01:07:51,817 --> 01:07:55,029
All right, do as you wish. We shall wait.

1063
01:07:55,112 --> 01:07:56,947
Let us begin at the fifteenth hour.

1064
01:07:57,573 --> 01:07:59,158
At the Ming's request,

1065
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:01,619
the competition will begin
at the fifteenth hour.

1066
01:08:03,204 --> 01:08:05,748
- What a relief.
- My goodness.

1067
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:09,502
Why is Cook Yeon taking so long?

1068
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:10,586
I do not know.

1069
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:24,975
It is the fifteenth hour!

1070
01:08:35,152 --> 01:08:38,489
- It is over.
- What should we do, Cook Eom?

1071
01:08:40,407 --> 01:08:42,451
It might be better that she does not come.

1072
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:46,122
How can you say that?

1073
01:08:56,882 --> 01:08:57,967
They are here.

1074
01:09:21,866 --> 01:09:22,867
We are here.

1075
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:24,660
Now, should I show them what I can do?

1076
01:09:27,913 --> 01:09:29,248
Your Majesty.

1077
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:31,083
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

1078
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:33,294
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty.

1079
01:09:33,377 --> 01:09:34,920
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

1080
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:18,631
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

1081
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:20,716
<i>The theme of the first dish is…</i>

1082
01:10:20,799 --> 01:10:23,135
<i>I must prepare a meat dish</i>
<i>they've never seen before.</i>

1083
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:24,845
<i>A taste that doesn't exist in this era.</i>

1084
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:26,263
<i>I am sure you remember.</i>

1085
01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:27,640
We must lose at all costs.

1086
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:28,891
<i>I have bad news.</i>

1087
01:10:28,974 --> 01:10:30,476
<i>The </i>gochogaru<i> is gone.</i>

1088
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:31,977
Where did you get this red oil?

1089
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:34,146
<i>Is it an ingredient you brought?</i>

1090
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,440
<i>What were you thinking?</i>

1091
01:10:36,523 --> 01:10:38,150
<i>His Majesty and the chief royal cook</i>

1092
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:41,362
<i>will not be able to avoid</i>
<i>this arrow of fate.</i>

1093
01:10:41,445 --> 01:10:43,197
<i>I don't want to lose either.</i>

1094
01:10:44,698 --> 01:10:47,201
<i>I will announce the result</i>
<i>of the first round.</i>

1095
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:55,334
