1
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:49,966
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

2
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,426
<i>It is time to begin</i>

3
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:53,261
<i>the second round of the competition</i>
<i>between Joseon and the Ming.</i>

4
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,514
<i>Today's theme is</i>
ji<i> for "know," </i>yeok <i>for "change."</i>

5
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,933
<i>You must cook a dish</i>
<i>from each other's country.</i>

6
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:01,269
- Our second dish, Peking duck.
- Let us begin.

7
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:03,563
<i>Where did they get</i>
<i>such a massive lotus flower?</i>

8
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,273
<i>It is overwhelmingly big.</i>

9
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:06,232
A golden lotus?

10
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,111
Okay. We'll start
by hanging the ducks to roast.

11
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,947
<i>- Pouring oil over it makes it…</i>
<i>- Crispy.</i>

12
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,616
Is that the Northern Capital roast duck?

13
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:17,619
<i>The Ming cooks in action</i>
<i>are truly an impressive sight.</i>

14
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,579
<i>Trust me this once.</i>

15
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:22,707
<i>This is a temple dish.</i>

16
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,667
<i>This is Peking duck.</i>

17
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:29,130
<i>The dishes from both sides are complete.</i>

18
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,841
<i>This concludes</i>
<i>the tasting of the second round,</i>

19
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,093
<i>and the evaluation will follow.</i>

20
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,019
I will announce
the scores for the second round.

21
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,994
ONE

22
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,038
EIGHT

23
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,466
JOSEON: 1, MING: 8

24
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,010
- What?
- My goodness.

25
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,054
I do not believe this.

26
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:35,405
Tang Bailong, step forward.

27
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,161
TANG BAILONG
MASTER OF SICHUAN CUISINE

28
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,538
The skills you learned

29
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,832
from visiting temples all over Joseon

30
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:50,044
in order to create the ultimate taste
are truly remarkable.

31
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:53,339
Not only did your temple dish
take us by surprise,

32
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:58,303
but its flavor also offered
profound insight and serene resonance.

33
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:01,389
YU KUN
MING'S CHIEF ENVOY

34
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:02,307
However…

35
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:07,687
the scores of the second round

36
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,231
are invalid.

37
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,905
Your Excellency, I am not sure
I understand what you are saying.

38
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:18,823
Bailong's score--

39
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,495
It seems my words fell on closed ears.

40
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,830
What did you say?

41
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,005
Look carefully.

42
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,257
That is the score

43
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,927
the Ming chief envoy gave Joseon's dish.

44
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,764
Just so the Ming could win,

45
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,975
he gave Joseon's dish
a ridiculously low score.

46
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,857
However, Your Excellency,

47
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:56,027
the rule is that
we score each other's dishes.

48
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,905
What is the matter with that?

49
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,251
Director Yu, do you truly not see it?

50
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,002
We are the two judges of this competition.

51
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,546
If we do not score the dishes honestly,

52
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,174
what is the point of all this?

53
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,261
Your shallow trickery

54
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,513
is embarrassing your own cooks,

55
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,223
who did their best
to make outstanding dishes.

56
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,849
Do you truly not realize that?

57
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,227
However--

58
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,478
In the first round,

59
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,982
the very person who was most ashamed
of winning with a dishonest ingredient

60
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,069
was the Ming cook, Tang Bailong.

61
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:45,034
Yet you, the chief envoy,
decided to give such a dishonest score.

62
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,912
What you did not only disgraced
the honor of the Ming cooks,

63
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:51,416
but also that of the Joseon cooks.

64
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,387
He asks how you wish to decide the winner.

65
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,597
We will judge in a way

66
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,934
that eliminates all these problems.

67
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,063
I wonder how.

68
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:15,815
Listen carefully.

69
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:19,402
The cooks of each nation
will taste and score their own dish.

70
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:24,073
Humans tend to be blind
to their own shortcomings.

71
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,075
Score your food with that in mind,

72
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,410
and that very score

73
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,163
will decide the winner
of the second round.

74
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,832
<i>He wants us to score ourselves?</i>

75
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,044
<i>What on earth is he thinking?</i>

76
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,842
COURSE N° 9 PRESSURE-COOKED OGYETANG

77
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,380
<i>First,</i>

78
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,175
Joseon's Chief Royal Cook Yeon Ji-young.

79
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:27,929
You made a new adaptation

80
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:30,139
of the Northern Capital roast duck
with an exquisite balance of flavors

81
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:34,143
that adhered to the theme
of "know" and "change."

82
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,813
How do you score that dish?

83
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:45,279
Your Majesty, I'm sorry to say,
but it's impossible to score.

84
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,158
What? You cannot score your dish?

85
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,243
Why is that?

86
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:56,165
It'd be a stretch to say
our Peking duck was perfect.

87
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,418
But Cook Eom, Cook Maeng,

88
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,505
Cook Min, Cook Sim, and Gil-geum

89
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:06,592
poured their sweat, hard work,
dedication, and hearts into the dish.

90
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,262
We devoted ourselves to making this dish,

91
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:12,974
so how could we dare
evaluate it ourselves?

92
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,059
Your Majesty,

93
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:18,604
we can't evaluate and score our own dish.

94
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:19,564
I apologize.

95
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,154
I see.

96
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:30,992
Next.

97
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,369
Ming's Chief Royal Cook Tang Bailong.

98
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,959
You have captured profound enlightenment
in the lotus leaf wrap

99
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,170
and presented us
with Joseon's temple fare.

100
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,338
It was truly a refined dish

101
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,174
that showed the noble grace
and skill of a Ming cook.

102
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,179
How do you score your dish?

103
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:13,034
Tang Bailong also says
he is unable to score the temple dish

104
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,161
that he learned to make
from many Joseon monks.

105
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,120
The truth is,

106
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:19,165
both dishes were equally good
in every aspect,

107
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,709
including taste, elegance, and appearance.

108
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,795
Joseon's roast duck and Ming's temple dish

109
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,549
were clearly created by cooks who have
reached the highest level of skill.

110
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,219
To judge the dishes on taste alone

111
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,846
is close to impossible.

112
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,723
That is why

113
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:39,644
I had the two cooks score the dishes
to assess their mindset.

114
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,567
However,

115
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,277
it seems that both cooks

116
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,613
are evenly matched in that aspect as well.

117
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,286
I believe

118
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,289
that both dishes in this round
proved to be equal,

119
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:01,874
which means

120
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,793
it is another tie.

121
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,760
Do you have more to say?

122
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:19,559
<i>If the third round is also a tie,</i>
<i>we will win the competition.</i>

123
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,143
<i>This outcome is in our favor.</i>

124
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:26,107
Your Excellency, I believe that you made
the most appropriate decision.

125
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,071
He says he has nothing to add.

126
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,198
In that case, the third round

127
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,243
will be held here tomorrow
at the same time.

128
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,293
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Excellency.

129
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,278
I lost.

130
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,280
However,

131
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,199
it was a victory in its own way.

132
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:18,868
No, I won.

133
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,120
But it feels like

134
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,289
I kind of lost.

135
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:27,835
If our dishes were evaluated tomorrow,

136
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:30,630
the result would have been very different.

137
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:34,175
I'm guessing you're saying
the Ming would've won, right?

138
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,719
As the temple food would have lingered
on their minds until the next day?

139
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:40,306
I focused heavily on the depth
and meaning of my dish,

140
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:43,601
that I failed to captivate
their tongues at once.

141
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:47,104
That also is a shortcoming of mine.

142
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,815
I focused heavily
on captivating their tongues,

143
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,901
that I failed to add depth
and meaning to my dish.

144
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,861
That's my shortcoming.

145
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,199
You always have the last word.

146
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:59,492
Because you keep talking.

147
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:05,247
I look forward to your final dish.

148
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,585
Thank you.

149
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,593
All right, let's get going.

150
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,762
What was that just now?

151
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,681
He lost, but he won?

152
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,266
Oh, well…

153
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,228
In this second round,

154
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,980
Tang Bailong's dish touched the heart,

155
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,982
while ours captivated the taste buds.

156
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:35,653
If today's scoring had been done properly,
we would've won,

157
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:39,198
but his dish would've been the one
that remained on people's minds.

158
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,783
That's what we said.

159
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,788
Then did you praise yourselves
while standing face-to-face?

160
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:50,084
Well, we acknowledged each other

161
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,627
and praised ourselves too.

162
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,753
Whatever the result,

163
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,673
the best cook in the Ming
acknowledged our chief royal cook.

164
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:56,757
- Right?
- Right.

165
00:11:56,841 --> 00:12:00,177
- That alone is a great accomplishment.
- Yes.

166
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,805
It's not just me. It's us.

167
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,391
He acknowledged <i>us</i>.

168
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,936
- Goodness, miss.
- Oh gosh.

169
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,646
Stop it. Let's go.

170
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,109
- Greetings, Chief Eunuch.
- Greetings.

171
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,360
Well done, all of you.

172
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,738
Cook Yeon, His Majesty wishes to see you.

173
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,324
Right now?

174
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,163
Your Majesty.

175
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:30,207
Cook Yeon is here.

176
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,919
So you asked to see me.

177
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,214
Why do you look so upset?

178
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,591
You did so well today.

179
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,426
Keep it brief and to the point.

180
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,970
I don't have enough time
to prepare for tomorrow.

181
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,556
That is why I summoned you.

182
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,313
Here.

183
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,773
Are you personally offering me wine?

184
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,444
This is not wine.

185
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:01,989
It is tea.

186
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,991
I called you here
so you could have some rest.

187
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,785
Go on and try it.

188
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,880
A teacup holding the moon.

189
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:21,342
How fascinating.

190
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,220
That is what you call "moon tea."

191
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:29,225
If you sit there and look into the teacup,
the tea reflects the moon in the sky.

192
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:34,730
It's mandarin leaf tea.

193
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,242
How do you feel?
Does it ease your tension?

194
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:47,660
Yes.

195
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:52,790
It's almost like a warm consolation.

196
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,459
I was worried you looked too weak
to even hold the duck.

197
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,713
How will you manage the remaining round
with a wounded hand?

198
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:03,217
I just can't do any delicate cutting,
but I can cook just fine.

199
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:04,760
"Fine"?

200
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:06,470
Maid Seo had to do the cutting for you.

201
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,473
You are too fearless.

202
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,686
Why, of course I was afraid.

203
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:18,065
But I put my trust in the sweat
and hard work the cooks had put into it.

204
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,358
And that

205
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,986
came out to a tie, did it not?

206
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,488
That tie?

207
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,659
Since we're on the topic,

208
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:31,287
I assumed you changed the rule
in the middle of the competition

209
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,455
because you wanted a fair win.

210
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,373
But then you went,

211
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,458
"Score your dish yourself."

212
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,920
How were we to decide a winner like that?

213
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,884
So that is why you are upset.

214
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,096
We would've won
if only the scores were fair.

215
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,558
You are right.

216
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,563
You did incredibly well today.

217
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,317
The truth is,

218
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,069
I did not know
it would be this hard a competition.

219
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,530
Just like Yu Kun,

220
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,033
I wanted to give you full marks

221
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:11,327
and Ming's dish one point.

222
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:13,996
Your Majesty.

223
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,205
It was my mistake

224
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,335
to risk the future of the nation
on a cooking competition.

225
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,255
It is not yet too late.

226
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,257
Let us call off the third round.

227
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,802
All I need to do is just bow
and apologize to the chief envoy.

228
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:31,513
No.

229
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,765
I want to do the third round.

230
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,977
So don't bow to the Ming.

231
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,730
What do you mean?

232
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,068
I was angry at first

233
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,403
by how they looked down on Joseon.

234
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,322
But now,

235
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:52,117
seeing Gil-geum, Cook Eom, Cook Maeng,

236
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:55,579
<i>and the other cooks work so hard</i>
<i>and put in so much effort,</i>

237
00:15:56,205 --> 00:16:00,876
<i>and seeing how sincerely</i>
<i>the Ming cooks participated,</i>

238
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,837
I genuinely want to win.

239
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:06,298
No.

240
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,843
I'll do whatever it takes to win.

241
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:12,513
You mean it.

242
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,765
I do.

243
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,606
Has the pressure cooker lid arrived?

244
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,607
Not yet.

245
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,401
But Mister Chun-saeng will come.

246
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,069
I trust he will.

247
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,656
No one can criticize you.

248
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,701
You put in more than enough effort so far.

249
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,121
If things do not go well--

250
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,706
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

251
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,216
Oh, that's hot!

252
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,511
Are you all right? Are you scalded?

253
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,179
No, I'm fine.

254
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,765
This will not do.

255
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:58,851
Chief Eunuch!

256
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,020
Yes, Your Majesty.

257
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,480
Inform those at Naeuiwon, Royal Clinic,
to treat Cook Yeon's hand promptly.

258
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,898
Yes, Your Majesty.

259
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,818
I'm really okay.

260
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,788
Promise me…

261
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,127
that you will never
let yourself get hurt again.

262
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,380
Your pain…

263
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,593
brings greater pain to me.

264
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,563
Your Majesty.

265
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,864
How does it feel now?

266
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,075
It feels much better.

267
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,994
This ointment will help even more.

268
00:17:59,078 --> 00:17:59,953
Thank you.

269
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,331
Another tie?

270
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,294
It was just as you predicted,
Your Royal Highness.

271
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:11,340
How dare a mere chief envoy
do such a despicable thing?

272
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,260
There is a lot more <i>gochogaru</i>
than I thought, Your Highness.

273
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,345
GRAND PRINCE JESAN
SUPERINTENDENT OF SAONGWON

274
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,598
If there is too much,
you can always leave a sack with me.

275
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,100
IM SONG-JAE
CHIEF ROYAL SECRETARY

276
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,229
You are cooks representing the Great Ming!

277
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,564
You brought nothing but humiliation!

278
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:31,026
How could we let two ties happen in a row?

279
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,283
- Cook Maeng.
- Yes.

280
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,673
This is not just ordinary ginseng.

281
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,133
It is wild ginseng!

282
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,801
Wild ginseng?

283
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,553
- Wild ginseng?
- What? Wild ginseng?

284
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,096
- My gosh.
- This is a precious ingredient.

285
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,853
<i>It is time to begin</i>
<i>the third and final round</i>

286
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,063
of the competition
between Joseon and the Ming.

287
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:13,986
Today's theme is…

288
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,948
<i>tang</i> for "soup," <i>sam</i> for "ginseng."

289
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,908
You must make a soup containing ginseng.

290
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:28,083
You may begin cooking now.

291
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,305
We must win today.

292
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:44,224
Let us begin cooking <i>fo tiao qiang.</i>

293
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,350
- Yes.
- Yes.

294
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,227
It's time for our final dish.

295
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:50,063
Let's start making <i>ogolgye samgyetang,</i>
Silkie ginseng chicken soup.

296
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:53,108
Cook Min, please put the<i> ogolgye</i>
on the cutting board.

297
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,193
Yes, Chief Royal Cook.

298
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,152
- Cook Eom.
- Yes?

299
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,529
Please skin three of them
and make a broth.

300
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,114
Cook Sim, you be his sous-chef.

301
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,158
What? What was that?

302
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:04,244
Oh, "sous-chef." It means to assist you.

303
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,582
What if the lid does not arrive in time?

304
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,417
Right. What do we do then?

305
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,297
We'll go with Plan B.

306
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,965
"Plant Bee"?

307
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,091
I mean an alternative.

308
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,427
The cast iron cauldron.

309
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,638
Though it will be harder.

310
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,348
I see we have an alternative.

311
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,183
That is great to hear.

312
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,684
Yes, it is indeed.

313
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:28,644
Okay then.

314
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:32,105
Cook Maeng, please prepare
the green onions and garlic for the broth.

315
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,232
Gil-geum, you be his sous-chef.

316
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,067
- Very well.
- Okay.

317
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,944
All right then.

318
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:38,737
Let's get started.

319
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,098
Cook Eom, I need the skin
to be as wide as possible.

320
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:07,140
I understand.

321
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:30,789
Bring the <i>lu jin.</i>

322
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,958
LU JIN: DEER TENDON FREQUENTLY USED
TO MAKE NOURISHING DISHES

323
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,459
<i>Hou tou gu.</i>

324
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,004
HOU TOU GU: CHINESE NAME
FOR LION'S MANE MUSHROOM

325
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:38,964
<i>Hai shen.</i>

326
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:41,842
HAI SHEN: SEA CUCUMBER, A PREMIUM DELICACY
KNOWN AS THE WILD GINSENG OF THE SEA

327
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,635
That is…

328
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:49,891
Cook Sim.

329
00:21:57,232 --> 00:22:01,403
It looks like the Joseon cooks
are preparing an <i>ogolgye</i> soup.

330
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:05,282
The Ming cooks are using ingredients
so incredibly rare

331
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:08,243
that I cannot even fathom
what they are making.

332
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,079
The first ingredient
Kong Wenli is preparing

333
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,915
is deer tendon soaked in oil for days.

334
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,502
It is one of the Eight Treasures,
the most precious ingredients.

335
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,005
What Bailong is preparing

336
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,299
is called lion's mane.

337
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,843
Deer tendon and lion's mane?

338
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:29,306
That is the rare mushroom
that resembles a lion's mane, is it not?

339
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:34,770
You truly are a gourmet
who knows your ingredients.

340
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:37,397
There are also

341
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:40,901
sea cucumber, abalone,
bamboo shoots, dried scallops,

342
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:43,653
and even white ginseng,

343
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:46,323
which is said to be obtainable
only with ancestral blessing.

344
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,785
The soup your cooks are preparing…

345
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:51,912
It cannot be.

346
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,539
Yes.

347
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:57,834
A dish where precious, rare ingredients
are cooked together

348
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,837
for a long time with great care.

349
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:03,215
It is said that the deep aroma

350
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:07,344
even made a monk abandon his meditation
and jump over the wall to try it.

351
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,471
Thus, named <i>fo tiao qiang,</i>
or Buddha Jumps Over the Wall.

352
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,765
BULDOJANG:
A NOURISHING DISH WITH RARE DELICACIES

353
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:12,849
So it is<i> buldojang.</i>

354
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,976
<i>"Buldojang"?</i>

355
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,525
Let's prepare the ingredients
to stuff the chicken.

356
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:22,526
- Okay.
- Okay.

357
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:32,953
- Peel it thinner.
- Okay.

358
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,471
Tie the legs together tighter.

359
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:52,597
- Understood.
- Understood.

360
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:55,642
There.

361
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:09,906
LIQUOR

362
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,720
<i>Let's wait just a bit more.</i>

363
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,766
- Cook Eom.
- Yes?

364
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,102
- Keep an eye on the broth for me.
- Sure.

365
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,104
Cook Maeng,
please make some jujube rice cakes.

366
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,063
Leave them to me.

367
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:43,732
Gil-geum, get the morel for me.

368
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:44,941
Yes, miss.

369
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:05,795
<i>Mister Chun-saeng,</i>
<i>I really need you to come right now.</i>

370
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,940
Forget about that Chun-saeng
or whatever his name is

371
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,775
and go with your Plant Bee!

372
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,903
He is right. We might fail
to complete the dish and lose.

373
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,112
Let us go with Plant Bee!

374
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,371
I guess we have no choice.

375
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:42,874
Let's go with Plan B.

376
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:45,543
Cook Eom, we'll use the cauldron.

377
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:46,544
Very well.

378
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,421
Cook Min, the lid.

379
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,923
Right, Bong-sik.

380
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,007
Hurry.

381
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,220
There is a strange bird in the sky!

382
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:58,848
It is coming this way at great speed!

383
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:00,767
On guard!

384
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,078
Get out of my way!

385
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:22,414
I have no time to waste with you.

386
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:24,124
Oh goodness me.

387
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:25,500
- Jang Chun-saeng!
- Oh, you!

388
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:28,378
The palace must be treating you well.
You look so much better.

389
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:31,256
- Did you bring it?
- Would I have come empty-handed?

390
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:33,216
Thank you.
The chief royal cook is waiting.

391
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,551
You should head inside now.

392
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,095
- This way.
- Let us go.

393
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,610
Mister Chun-saeng!

394
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:57,699
Jang Chun-saeng.

395
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,202
Chief Royal Cook.

396
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,079
You made it!

397
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,541
Here you go.

398
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:14,090
What is that?

399
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,885
Who is that man?

400
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,137
He is a new palace attendant.

401
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,890
He brought a cooking tool I ordered.

402
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:26,686
Let's see.

403
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:32,734
I said I would bring it to you, did I not?

404
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,402
I was waiting for you.

405
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,779
Thank you so much.

406
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,405
- Was I right on time?
- Yes.

407
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,948
It was perfect timing.

408
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:42,452
But the lid has weakened a bit
due to the damage,

409
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:45,163
so you should keep the heat
as low as possible for safety.

410
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:48,375
What? But I need the heat
to be at maximum level.

411
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,419
Then go for it. What can you do?

412
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,922
Will it be very dangerous?

413
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,006
Well…

414
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,259
You will be in danger if you lose anyway.

415
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:02,389
I'll trust in your skill,
Mister Chun-saeng.

416
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:04,682
- I hope you win.
- I will.

417
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,142
- I should go now.
- Thank you.

418
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,438
My gosh.

419
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,400
It's here!

420
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:24,160
- I need more firewood.
- Sure.

421
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,286
No.

422
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,415
This dish needs to be cooked on low heat.

423
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,543
Relax, Ya Feixiu.

424
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,361
My goodness, miss.

425
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,864
How much more firewood do we need?

426
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:03,241
The flames are already so huge.

427
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:06,244
Water boils at 110°C
at 1.5 atmospheric pressures,

428
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,204
and that's enough to make it taste great.

429
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:11,458
But to ensure it tastes perfect,

430
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:14,127
I'll raise the internal temperature
to 120°C at 2 atmospheric pressures.

431
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:18,173
So you are saying we need more firewood.

432
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,675
Yes. Just throw in everything we have.

433
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:24,554
I might break my back carrying firewood.

434
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:26,639
She says it is
to create the perfect taste,

435
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:27,974
so go and get more firewood.

436
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:29,434
Yes, Man-su.

437
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:34,689
It seems you have changed a great deal
in the last few days.

438
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:37,567
Stop talking and bring more firewood.

439
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:38,985
Okay.

440
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:40,528
Cook Sim, wait for me.

441
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,449
<i>Please stay strong and hold on.</i>

442
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,620
IGAK, 30 MINUTES, LATER

443
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,980
He is concerned it will explode.

444
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,315
Do not worry.

445
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:19,192
My chief royal cook
knows what she is doing.

446
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:28,827
My goodness.

447
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:33,957
It did it!

448
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,667
It held up two atmospheric pressures.

449
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,086
I knew Mister Chun-saeng could do it.

450
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,306
Oh my, miss.

451
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,993
It looks like their dish is done already.

452
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,745
That is strange.

453
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,330
How could it be done so soon?

454
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:21,045
It looks like the Ming
is far from being done.

455
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,467
This is the power of science.

456
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,970
It's much faster, isn't it?
And it tastes better too.

457
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,180
It was worth the hard work.

458
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:32,640
All right.

459
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:35,059
Now for the last step.

460
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,190
<i>It's a new form of </i>samgyetang

461
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:44,485
<i>where you can enjoy</i>
<i>the nutritious </i>ogolgye <i>from skin to meat.</i>

462
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:47,947
<i>When it comes to</i>
<i>slowly cooked </i>fo tiao qiang<i>,</i>

463
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:51,784
<i>the last touch completes the taste.</i>

464
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,584
<i>Dumplings made with glutinous rice</i>
<i>and </i>ogolgye<i> skin</i>

465
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,419
<i>are lightly parboiled in the broth.</i>

466
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:06,841
<i>Liquor is poured on a plate</i>
<i>covered in salt.</i>

467
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,390
Maid Seo, we must hurry.

468
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:18,019
<i>The minced meat is piped into the morels.</i>

469
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:23,900
<i>A dragon carving,</i>
<i>symbolizing power, is added.</i>

470
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,366
<i>On top of a layer</i>
<i>made with seasoned </i>ogolgye<i> meat</i>

471
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,576
<i>go the dumpling, mushroom, and ginseng.</i>

472
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:38,164
<i>To complete the dish,</i>
<i>the salt is set aflame to warm the bowl.</i>

473
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:46,506
<i>To complete the dish,</i>
<i>wild ginseng broth is poured around it.</i>

474
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,803
<i>The crunchy, savory </i>nurungji
<i>is an extra touch.</i>

475
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:59,519
The dishes from both sides are complete.

476
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,772
The cooks are to step away
from the stations.

477
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,958
Today, we will taste the dish
made by the Joseon cooks first.

478
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,511
Oh, right.

479
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:37,890
You tap the <i>nurungji</i>
with your spoon to break it,

480
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:41,894
and eat it with the dumpling,
meat, and broth.

481
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:54,323
What is this dish called?

482
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,700
This dish is called

483
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:58,077
<i>wild ginseng-infused </i>ogolgye samgyetang.

484
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,791
<i>I stuffed the </i>ogolgye <i>with 100-year-old</i>
cheonjongsam<i>, premium wild ginseng,</i>

485
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,627
<i>and cooked them in a pressure cooker</i>
<i>with medicinal herb broth,</i>

486
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,797
which enhanced the texture of the meat
and the deep flavor of the broth.

487
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,925
<i>I also added a unique flavor to the dish</i>

488
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:15,678
with morel stuffed with minced <i>ogolgye</i>
and <i>nurungji</i>.

489
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:26,522
The aroma is of a herbal chicken soup,
but it is shaped like a dumpling.

490
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,654
He says it does not look refined.

491
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:39,368
This is "oat sheen,"
an invigorating dish favored

492
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:40,787
in palaces of the Western world.

493
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:46,000
I suppose you do not know much
about Western food.

494
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:54,217
"Oat sheen"?

495
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,804
This is oat sheen?

496
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:00,348
I know.

497
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,009
A phoenix!

498
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:58,281
I am an immortal riding a phoenix!

499
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,492
<i>The </i>ogolgye<i> meat is unbelievably tender,</i>

500
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:05,204
<i>and it is presented neatly</i>
<i>so there is no need to separate the bone.</i>

501
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,539
<i>Each time I taste the broth,</i>

502
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,542
<i>the aroma of the </i>cheonjongsam
<i>and green onions</i>

503
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,002
<i>spreads subtly throughout.</i>

504
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:15,006
<i>It almost feels as if</i>
<i>it warmly comforts my heart.</i>

505
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:20,094
<i>Is this truly a ginseng chicken soup</i>

506
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,096
<i>made with Silkie?</i>

507
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,224
<i>The meat melts away in my mouth,</i>

508
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:28,186
<i>and the broth is incredibly rich and deep.</i>

509
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:31,480
<i>I feel the warmth</i>
<i>and the energy build up inside of me,</i>

510
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:34,609
<i>which is definitely the effect of ginseng.</i>

511
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:38,362
<i>However, the taste is completely new.</i>

512
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:42,950
<i>This is truly a magnificent dish!</i>

513
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,797
It is delicious.

514
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,018
Now, we will taste the dish
made by the Ming cooks.

515
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:19,987
What is this dish called?

516
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:25,952
It is <i>buldojang</i>.

517
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,870
It is made with delicacies
from land and sea,

518
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,039
<i>including deer tendon,</i>
<i>lion's mane, white ginseng,</i>

519
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:32,833
<i>sea cucumber, pine mushrooms, and more.</i>

520
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:37,338
He says each bite will taste different,

521
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,840
as the ingredients will bring out
their flavors in your mouth.

522
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:45,054
This is a dish
truly worthy of the Great Ming!

523
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,405
<i>There is a reason</i>
<i>this is called a food of the gods.</i>

524
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,324
<i>There is no need for words.</i>

525
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,492
<i>This is truly a taste</i>

526
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,536
<i>beyond compare.</i>

527
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:21,567
This concludes
the tasting of the third and final round.

528
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,244
To ensure

529
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,413
the third round is scored fairly,

530
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,582
the cooks will taste each other's food

531
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:38,376
and score it.

532
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,920
Each cook can give up to ten points,

533
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:43,172
which would make the full score 30 points.

534
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,232
He says that he has accepted
His Excellency's scoring method

535
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:03,234
to apologize for the prior
unsavory scoring process,

536
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,528
and for the cooks
to score each other fairly.

537
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:15,955
Now, you may taste each other's food.

538
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,366
This <i>buldojang</i> is no joke.

539
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:55,202
We wouldn't have stood a chance
without the pressure cooker.

540
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,496
You are right.

541
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,582
Having a bite of this dish
I had only heard of

542
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:01,792
makes me feel energized already.

543
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:05,087
Our <i>ogolgye samgyetang</i>
is just as nourishing as this.

544
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,339
They did use rare ingredients,

545
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,175
but the taste is not that impressive.

546
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,600
Why won't he eat?

547
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,727
He can't score unless he tastes it.

548
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,896
I have been watching him,

549
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,148
and he does not seem to eat at all.

550
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,649
The maids say

551
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:28,194
he cooks without even tasting the food.

552
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,446
He doesn't taste the food?

553
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:32,490
It can't be.

554
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:35,701
Is he anorexic?

555
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:39,997
What is that?

556
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,124
It's an illness
that makes one unable to eat.

557
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,083
That makes no sense.

558
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,669
How could a cook have such an illness?

559
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:46,754
I've seen it before.

560
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,757
Once their cooking reached
a certain level,

561
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,467
they couldn't eat any food.

562
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,762
An anorexic cook.

563
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,306
If he cannot eat…

564
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:59,558
How will he score our food?

565
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:03,395
Why has that cook not tasted the food?

566
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:09,902
Ever since Kong Wenli reached
the highest level of cooking skill,

567
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:13,239
he has not been able to eat any food.

568
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:15,491
He has the ability
to create the best flavors

569
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:17,826
without ever tasting them.

570
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:18,953
What?

571
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,330
How will he score the food then?

572
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:24,917
He cannot score what he cannot taste.

573
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:30,381
I wonder how this will affect the scores.

574
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:37,012
Yesterday, you reprimanded me
for not scoring honestly.

575
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:44,645
He says you can have them score
as fairly as you wish, Your Majesty.

576
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:51,902
<i>He looks guilty for trying to eat.</i>

577
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:56,448
<i>He might eat</i>
<i>if the food isn't plated nicely.</i>

578
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,843
Cook Yeon, what are you doing?

579
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:17,678
What are you doing?

580
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,847
He has to taste it to score it.

581
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:22,975
My goodness.

582
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:33,694
He says the chief royal cook must be
perplexed after tasting Ming's dish.

583
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:40,909
Chief Royal Cook.

584
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,423
To make food is joy for the cook,

585
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:56,592
and to taste
is joy for the people who eat.

586
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,470
That's what makes cooking rewarding,
isn't it?

587
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:01,305
To be honest,

588
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:04,266
it tastes extra good when everything
is thrown together like this.

589
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,269
Regardless of the result,

590
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,188
as a cook,

591
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:13,233
I present you with this food
with the hope that you'll also be happy.

592
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:36,674
<i>Why do you care so much about taste?</i>

593
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:38,133
<i>Do not be complicated.</i>

594
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:41,804
<i>So what if you cannot cook well?</i>

595
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:45,641
<i>Nothing tastes better</i>

596
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:48,268
<i>than when you throw everything in</i>
<i>and cook it together.</i>

597
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,105
Try it.

598
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:53,899
Come on. Try it.

599
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,241
<i>It is delicious.</i>

600
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:03,534
<i>It is so good.</i>

601
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:04,511
This is…

602
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:08,348
the taste I had forgotten

603
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:12,019
and missed for so many years.

604
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:19,359
I once was left in shock
after tasting my grandmother's food

605
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:23,155
<i>that was made with all sorts of</i>
<i>ingredients thrown in together.</i>

606
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:25,616
For many years,

607
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:27,659
I tried to cook something
that tasted better,

608
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:31,455
but nothing I made ever tasted like it.

609
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:33,832
Since then,

610
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:37,169
I have gained the ability to cook
without tasting the food.

611
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:38,295
However…

612
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:42,591
the more I cooked,

613
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,261
the harder it became for me to eat.

614
00:46:58,649 --> 00:46:59,816
He says you recreated

615
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,778
the taste of his grandmother's food.

616
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:19,461
He says he cannot
call himself the best cook,

617
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:23,090
for he cannot surpass
his grandmother's cooking.

618
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:35,936
The most important virtue of a wise man
is said to be benevolence.

619
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:38,438
To care and be considerate of others.

620
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:42,901
I made this out of consideration for you,
Cook Kong Wenli.

621
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:46,530
The dish your grandmother made for you

622
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,324
was probably made with the same heart.

623
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:05,632
I see it now.

624
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:09,219
A cook who can bring joy
to both themselves and others

625
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:11,346
is a true wise man.

626
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:24,151
He says that he has lost
to the chief royal cook.

627
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,168
How is this possible?

628
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:04,274
I will announce
the result of the third round,

629
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:06,318
where the cooks scored each other's food.

630
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:17,412
First, we will reveal the score
given by the Joseon cooks for Ming's dish.

631
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,210
It is 27 points.

632
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:30,509
Next, we will reveal the score
given by the Ming cooks for Joseon's dish.

633
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:38,642
It is 28 points.

634
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:43,313
Miss!

635
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:46,108
Cook Eom! Oh my!

636
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:06,712
It was such a pleasure
to compete against such great cooks.

637
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:08,588
Thank you for the generous score.

638
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:10,549
Thank you.

639
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:13,593
I hope

640
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:17,764
to compete against you properly one day.

641
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,975
Just one cook against another.

642
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:21,059
Anytime.

643
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,442
What is this?

644
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:31,820
Where I'm from, this is a greeting.

645
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:33,196
We call it a handshake.

646
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,406
"Handshake"?

647
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:37,451
Handshake.

648
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:44,875
It was a great match.

649
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,501
I learned a lot.

650
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:50,881
I also realized
I have a lot more to learn.

651
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:56,386
- Thank you.
- I learned a lot.

652
00:50:57,554 --> 00:51:00,432
It looks like we have a final winner.

653
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:06,480
Yes, Your Excellency.

654
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:23,997
He says he will relinquish the right
to harvest Joseon ginseng as promised

655
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,374
and return to the Ming with just one
tribute item to show their appreciation.

656
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:28,418
And what is that?

657
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:49,314
He says he will offer the chief royal cook
to the Emperor as a tribute woman.

658
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:51,566
What?

659
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:54,861
You want the chief royal cook
as a tribute woman?

660
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:58,114
What is this utter nonsense?

661
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,282
You've got to be kidding me.

662
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:02,077
He's asking to take me as a tribute woman?

663
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:34,234
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

664
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:36,236
Your Majesty!

665
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:38,405
Your Majesty!

666
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:42,117
He is the chief envoy from the Ming…

667
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,743
He struck him with his head!

668
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:47,581
How could this happen?

669
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:58,466
Blood?

670
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:00,886
I am bleeding!

671
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:04,431
How dare the King of Joseon

672
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:08,351
behave this way
toward the envoy of the Emperor?

673
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:09,436
Oh dear.

674
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,773
I only meant to show you
the Joseon greeting.

675
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:17,569
Are you all right?

676
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:26,494
He says in any case, he will take
the chief royal cook with him.

677
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:29,497
Guards, take her.

678
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:32,208
- Oh no!
- No!

679
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:34,377
Miss.

680
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:38,673
Director Yu,

681
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:40,383
it seems

682
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:44,346
that you brought
far too few attendants with you

683
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:46,681
to take my chief royal cook
as a tribute woman.

684
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:50,852
What?

685
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:53,313
You should have brought

686
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:56,274
at least an army of a hundred thousand

687
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:58,234
to make it worth my time.

688
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:12,415
He asks if you will dare challenge
the envoy of the Emperor of the Ming.

689
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:14,834
Anytime.

690
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:28,056
The Grand Royal Queen Dowager has arrived.

691
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:06,678
What in the world

692
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:09,139
is happening in this place?

693
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:10,098
Grandmother.

694
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:12,517
I was bidding the Ming envoy farewell,

695
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,102
and there was a minor misunderstanding.

696
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:15,687
A misunderstanding, you say?

697
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:18,648
I do not know
what that misunderstanding could be,

698
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:21,026
but Your Majesty,

699
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:23,486
as the ruler of a nation,

700
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:27,323
you must never act recklessly.

701
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:29,325
Yes, Grandmother.

702
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,953
I have something to inquire
of Envoy Yu Kun.

703
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:35,248
You have come as an envoy
of a great nation.

704
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:36,916
Why is it that you have
set aside your official duties

705
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,754
and suggested
such an imprudent competition?

706
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:43,048
I have the Emperor's command to demand

707
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:47,385
the right to harvest Joseon ginseng
and take tribute women--

708
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:49,763
How dare you, Yu Kun!

709
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:57,896
"How dare you, Yu Kun"?

710
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,648
I now see

711
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:05,236
that your insolence knows no bounds.

712
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:08,948
Both the King of Joseon

713
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:13,745
and his grandmother have lost their minds.

714
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:18,875
An insult to me
is an insult to the Emperor himself.

715
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:23,588
Do you all wish to be punished at once?

716
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:27,175
Yu Kun.

717
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:35,767
Do you know what this is?

718
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:43,942
It is a letter from my aunt

719
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:46,611
and the late Emperor's second wife,

720
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:48,738
Consort Yeon.

721
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:52,450
Do you still dare insist your Emperor

722
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:56,412
requested the right to harvest our ginseng
and our women as tribute?

723
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:03,253
So the aunt of the
Grand Royal Queen Dowager of Joseon

724
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:07,090
is the late Emperor's second wife,

725
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:08,758
- Consort Yeon?
- Yes.

726
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:17,350
I have deceived the Emperor
and dishonored the Ming imperial family.

727
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:25,442
He begs for your forgiveness
and benevolent grace.

728
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,820
Then let us return
to the original matter at hand.

729
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:30,572
You should keep your promise.

730
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:40,373
He says he will supply
the requested items at any time.

731
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:41,833
Can I

732
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:44,419
trust your words?

733
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,684
He says he swears on the heavens
to keep his promise.

734
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:16,326
He thanks you for the hospitality
and says he will take his leave.

735
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:21,331
There is no need to hurry.

736
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:26,127
Be sure to take the tribute items
we prepared for you.

737
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:29,088
Yes, Your Excellency.

738
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:33,676
My lord.

739
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,470
I appreciate it.

740
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,305
Well done.

741
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:40,433
It was very delicious.

742
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:58,826
What brought you all the way here,
Grandmother?

743
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:00,328
Your Majesty.

744
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:03,373
Why did you act so rashly?

745
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:07,210
Matters could have gotten out of hand

746
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:10,838
if I had not requested
a letter from the Ming imperial family.

747
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:13,299
I apologize, Grandmother.

748
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:16,970
The nation does not belong to you alone.

749
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:19,514
Does it?

750
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:25,812
I will be more cautious.

751
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:26,896
Your Royal Highness.

752
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:30,483
I think it is best to leave it at this.

753
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:35,280
Your Majesty.

754
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:39,409
I have a request.

755
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:43,204
Please tell me what it is.

756
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:45,415
Grand Prince Jinmyeong

757
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:49,669
is quite curious
about the chief royal cook's food.

758
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:52,755
Would you allow him

759
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,883
the chance to taste her food?

760
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:57,885
Is that so?

761
00:59:58,595 --> 00:59:59,887
Grand Prince Jinmyeong?

762
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:03,725
Then I will arrange a meal tomorrow.

763
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:08,021
Thank you, Your Majesty.

764
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:12,108
Now, hurry and bring an end
to the competition.

765
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:13,860
Yes, Grandmother.

766
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:38,760
GRAND PRINCE JESAN'S RESIDENCE

767
01:00:43,389 --> 01:00:46,309
What on earth do you wish to do with this?

768
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:49,395
The plan has already been set in motion.

769
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:51,648
His Majesty will have his <i>natsura</i>,
midday meal,

770
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:53,232
with Grand Prince Jinmyeong tomorrow.

771
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:55,360
- Cook Yeon.
- Yes, Chief Royal Secretary.

772
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:58,780
His Majesty will have his <i>natsura</i>
with Grand Prince Jinmyeong tomorrow.

773
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:01,824
I'll prepare buttered and roasted
whole <i>ogolgye</i> with ginseng.

774
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:05,328
They will be having
roasted chicken with ginseng.

775
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:07,914
Grand Prince Jinmyeong?

776
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:12,752
Are you concerned because he will play
an important part in our plan?

777
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:17,632
Are you saying
you do not mind sacrificing him?

778
01:01:17,715 --> 01:01:19,967
If it means we can eliminate
the chief royal cook

779
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:23,012
and make His Majesty explode with fury.

780
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:25,640
However,

781
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:27,767
poison leaves a trace.

782
01:01:28,976 --> 01:01:31,604
Only when a poison is a poison.

783
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:34,732
However, this right here

784
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,485
is not originally a poison.

785
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:41,280
A poison that is not a poison?

786
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:51,582
What is the matter, Your Highness?

787
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:52,917
To be honest,

788
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,879
I expected you
to betray me at a certain point.

789
01:01:57,588 --> 01:01:59,674
The position of a young king's consort

790
01:01:59,757 --> 01:02:01,718
is quite an enviable one.

791
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:07,640
You are the reason
I was able to live decently.

792
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:11,185
That is enough for me.

793
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:13,646
When the time comes,

794
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:16,149
I will make you my official spouse

795
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:17,942
so you can live freely.

796
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:23,322
GANGNYEONGJEON

797
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:27,160
Thoroughly investigate the military camps
all around Joseon,

798
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:30,747
focusing especially on those
who have deserted or transferred units.

799
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:33,791
Identify them all.

800
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:37,837
Is it to find out
those who attacked you, Your Majesty?

801
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,214
No.

802
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:42,300
Treachery.

803
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:48,014
I must uncover who harbors such a heart.

804
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:50,683
Yes, Your Majesty.
I will do as you command.

805
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:56,481
This feels so good.

806
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,859
I wish I could just lie down forever.

807
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:02,236
- Don't you?
- I do.

808
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:05,114
I am tired,

809
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:07,825
but I really enjoyed the competition.

810
01:03:08,409 --> 01:03:11,704
I will never forget it
for the rest of my life.

811
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:14,415
I could never. I almost died.

812
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:17,126
I even almost got dragged away
to the Ming.

813
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:19,295
Oh my goodness.

814
01:03:19,378 --> 01:03:20,755
That would have been terrible.

815
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:24,717
Come to think of it,
did we save our country today?

816
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:27,178
We almost lost all our ginseng.

817
01:03:29,263 --> 01:03:31,057
Seeing that I'm worrying
about such things,

818
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:33,351
I guess I've really become
a Joseon person.

819
01:03:44,403 --> 01:03:45,863
This room.

820
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:51,410
Gil-geum, Cook Eom, Cook Maeng.

821
01:03:52,119 --> 01:03:53,120
His Majesty.

822
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:56,624
I guess you all grew on me.

823
01:04:00,044 --> 01:04:03,130
MANGUNROK

824
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:50,219
<i>Well done, Cook Yeon.</i>

825
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:17,079
How do you feel?

826
01:05:17,663 --> 01:05:20,833
Thanks to your concern,
I went back to Naeuiwon.

827
01:05:25,129 --> 01:05:28,299
They said
I don't have much longer to live.

828
01:05:28,382 --> 01:05:29,800
What?

829
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:32,178
That's what I thought they'd say.

830
01:05:32,803 --> 01:05:35,473
I'm just a bit overworked,
but nothing's wrong with me.

831
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:39,644
How could you joke about that?

832
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:41,145
Did I scare you?

833
01:05:41,228 --> 01:05:42,188
I'm sorry.

834
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:45,024
Then what about your hand?

835
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:47,902
Oh, I received acupuncture,

836
01:05:47,985 --> 01:05:49,946
and my condition got better.

837
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:50,947
"Condison"?

838
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:53,908
It's in a much better state.

839
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:56,535
Then are you in

840
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:58,496
a good enough condison to cook?

841
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,123
Of course. There's no problem.

842
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:02,667
I'll make sure

843
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:06,087
to prepare a really great meal.

844
01:06:11,258 --> 01:06:14,929
Is this where you'll dine
with Grand Prince Jinmyeong?

845
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:16,305
Yes.

846
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:20,851
The special meal for today is battered
roasted whole chicken, correct?

847
01:06:21,435 --> 01:06:24,355
Yes, it's buttered and roasted
whole<i> ogolgye</i> with ginseng.

848
01:06:24,438 --> 01:06:27,608
He is young, so prepare the…

849
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:30,736
What was it? Macrong? Serve those as well.

850
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:31,779
Okay.

851
01:06:32,863 --> 01:06:37,868
This is the perfect place
to have a <i>natsura</i> with a younger brother.

852
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:39,453
It would also be

853
01:06:40,579 --> 01:06:43,457
a good place for us to eat in private.

854
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:46,627
In private?

855
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:49,588
Would you not like that?

856
01:06:51,757 --> 01:06:54,010
If you are preparing a dish, Your Majesty,

857
01:06:54,093 --> 01:06:57,513
I will gladly taste it.

858
01:06:57,596 --> 01:06:58,556
What?

859
01:06:58,639 --> 01:06:59,974
Me? Cook?

860
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:03,227
You dare tell me to set foot in a kitchen?

861
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:05,521
It's a joke, Your Majesty.

862
01:07:05,604 --> 01:07:06,981
I won the competition,

863
01:07:07,064 --> 01:07:11,527
so please accept my humble jest
with grace, Your Majesty.

864
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:14,947
Fine.

865
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:17,533
I'll get going then.

866
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:19,285
Wait.

867
01:07:23,914 --> 01:07:25,332
I am not done yet.

868
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:28,127
What is it?

869
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:40,347
Open it.

870
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:49,565
This is…

871
01:07:50,816 --> 01:07:52,401
It is a new cook's attire.

872
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:02,536
It's beautiful. Look at the colors.

873
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,997
Well? Do you think
this is a flattering color for me?

874
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:07,625
"Flattening collar"?

875
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:10,252
I'm asking if the colors suit me.

876
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:15,299
But…

877
01:08:18,302 --> 01:08:21,430
I must leave once I find <i>Mangunrok</i>.

878
01:08:22,014 --> 01:08:23,099
So why are you giving me this?

879
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:28,312
Who says you can leave?

880
01:08:28,395 --> 01:08:29,480
Even if you do leave,

881
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:32,316
you will still need a cook's attire,
will you not?

882
01:08:35,402 --> 01:08:36,737
A cook's attire.

883
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:38,906
Right.

884
01:08:39,573 --> 01:08:41,158
Thank you for this.

885
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:43,577
One more thing.

886
01:08:44,161 --> 01:08:46,205
After my meal with Grand Prince Jinmyeong,

887
01:08:46,705 --> 01:08:48,124
meet me at Jangwonseo,
Office of Royal Horticulture.

888
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:52,211
Oh, but I have a prior engagement.

889
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:53,629
A prior engagement?

890
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:55,965
With whom?

891
01:08:56,674 --> 01:08:58,592
The Ming cooks asked to see me.

892
01:08:59,176 --> 01:09:01,011
Do you want to see them again
when you almost died?

893
01:09:01,595 --> 01:09:05,141
I want to give them a gift
and say my last goodbye.

894
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:06,100
I will not allow it.

895
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:08,269
But…

896
01:09:09,186 --> 01:09:10,521
Your Majesty.

897
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:18,821
Then make it brief

898
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:21,031
and come to Jangwonseo.

899
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:24,368
Okay, I will.

900
01:09:24,952 --> 01:09:26,162
Do not be late.

901
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:29,456
Yes, of course, Your Majesty.

902
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:39,425
Today's <i>natgeotsang</i>, daytime meal,

903
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:40,801
is roasted whole <i>ogolgye</i>.

904
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:44,305
We'll cook it the same way
as the Peking duck.

905
01:09:44,388 --> 01:09:46,515
You will serve chicken again?

906
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:48,893
There is no "again"
when it comes to His Majesty's meals.

907
01:09:48,976 --> 01:09:50,311
You are so silly.

908
01:09:50,394 --> 01:09:52,521
We should hurry up and get started.

909
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:55,441
I have never seen
a cook's attire in this color.

910
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:57,693
Of course you have not.

911
01:09:57,776 --> 01:10:00,613
His Majesty gifted it to her.

912
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:01,572
Does it suit me?

913
01:10:01,655 --> 01:10:03,949
- Of course it does.
- Good.

914
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:07,119
I will get the ingredients
to fill the chicken with.

915
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:09,872
- Okay.
- I will go get two <i>ogolgyes</i>.

916
01:10:09,955 --> 01:10:12,875
- Cook Min, please get some <i>suyu </i>for me.
- Yes, of course.

917
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:16,003
- Cook Sim, please get me some firewood.
- Sure.

918
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:23,052
Shall I clean the ginseng now?

919
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:27,640
Jinmyeong.

920
01:10:28,933 --> 01:10:31,727
This is the first time
we are dining together.

921
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:34,021
Yes, Your Majesty.

922
01:10:34,813 --> 01:10:36,023
It is an honor.

923
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:40,778
You can call me brother when we are alone.

924
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:42,738
Yes, Your Majesty.

925
01:10:45,282 --> 01:10:46,533
I mean, Brother.

926
01:10:48,702 --> 01:10:50,412
I see you feel uncomfortable around me.

927
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:56,043
We should do this more often from now on.

928
01:10:57,127 --> 01:10:59,255
Can we really? Do you mean that?

929
01:10:59,338 --> 01:11:00,381
I do.

930
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:02,424
Are you that pleased?

931
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:07,221
Yes. Everyone in the palace
is praising the chief royal cook.

932
01:11:07,304 --> 01:11:10,182
I wanted to taste everything
that was served

933
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:12,184
in the competition against the Ming.

934
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:15,104
I am pleased to see you are excited.

935
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:19,984
We shall make time to eat everything.

936
01:11:20,567 --> 01:11:21,694
Yes.

937
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:24,780
Your Majesty, the <i>natgeotsang</i> is ready.

938
01:11:51,265 --> 01:11:53,225
It smells light

939
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:54,852
but rich at the same time.

940
01:11:54,935 --> 01:11:57,313
Just looking at it makes my mouth water,
Your Majesty.

941
01:11:58,147 --> 01:11:59,440
This is roasted whole <i>ogolgye</i>

942
01:11:59,523 --> 01:12:01,066
made by stuffing the chicken
with glutinous rice,

943
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:03,235
jujube, chestnuts, and milkvetch root,

944
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:07,031
and roasting it by hanging
just as we did for the Peking duck.

945
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:10,159
Then this time,
did you roast the <i>ogolgye </i>whole?

946
01:12:10,826 --> 01:12:11,785
Yes.

947
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:14,997
But I coated the outside with butter…

948
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:21,253
I coated it with <i>suyu</i>
and stuffed it with ginseng.

949
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:28,510
Do you eat this too?

950
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:31,096
It is bitter, but it is a root vegetable
that is good for you,

951
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:32,431
so chew it carefully.

952
01:12:40,647 --> 01:12:43,776
This was made with ground mustard seeds,

953
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:46,236
<i>salt, vinegar, and honey.</i>

954
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,822
<i>It's a Joseon-style mustard sauce.</i>

955
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:51,742
"Mustache sauce"?

956
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:55,954
Take the chicken and dip it.

957
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:57,748
Oh, dip and eat.

958
01:12:57,831 --> 01:12:58,665
Exactly.

959
01:13:03,754 --> 01:13:04,797
Yes, Your Majesty.

960
01:13:29,113 --> 01:13:30,155
Dip and eat.

961
01:13:42,292 --> 01:13:44,086
<i>The skin is chewy</i>

962
01:13:44,169 --> 01:13:46,004
<i>and the meat is moist.</i>

963
01:13:57,015 --> 01:14:00,102
<i>I have never tasted</i>
<i>anything like this in my life.</i>

964
01:14:00,727 --> 01:14:03,230
It is chewy, light, and flavorful.

965
01:14:04,189 --> 01:14:07,151
This would have been a dish
worthy of presenting at the competition.

966
01:14:08,485 --> 01:14:11,280
You are as skilled as I heard.

967
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:17,995
Thank you, Your Highness.

968
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:20,706
Jinmyeong.

969
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:22,082
Try this.

970
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:23,584
Dip and eat.

971
01:14:23,667 --> 01:14:25,002
Dip and eat it.

972
01:14:27,671 --> 01:14:28,797
Is it good?

973
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:30,799
Yes, it is delicious.

974
01:14:33,051 --> 01:14:35,512
<i>I was worried for no reason.</i>

975
01:14:35,596 --> 01:14:37,431
<i>If His Majesty is the man</i>
<i>I believe him to be,</i>

976
01:14:38,015 --> 01:14:39,892
<i>the purge might not happen.</i>

977
01:14:41,351 --> 01:14:42,269
<i>Wait.</i>

978
01:14:43,103 --> 01:14:45,606
<i>Did I change the course of history?</i>

979
01:14:51,778 --> 01:14:52,946
Ginseng?

980
01:14:54,281 --> 01:14:56,783
When did you prepare this for us?

981
01:14:57,451 --> 01:15:01,830
I thought Ya Feixiu could use it
to create a new dish.

982
01:15:02,539 --> 01:15:03,540
Thank you.

983
01:15:05,375 --> 01:15:07,544
We, too, are grateful for these.

984
01:15:09,129 --> 01:15:12,841
Are you not traveling
with the chief envoy?

985
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:14,510
With his permission,

986
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:17,513
the three of us will go our separate ways

987
01:15:17,596 --> 01:15:20,182
to study and improve our cooking skills.

988
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:24,019
That's amazing.

989
01:15:24,102 --> 01:15:25,562
I'm envious.

990
01:15:26,146 --> 01:15:29,983
We should compete again someday.

991
01:15:30,067 --> 01:15:31,151
Properly.

992
01:15:32,236 --> 01:15:33,111
I'd love to,

993
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:35,197
if we have the chance.

994
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:37,157
You taught me a lot.

995
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:38,825
I wish you happiness.

996
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:42,037
Travel safely.

997
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:43,330
I wish you peace.

998
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:49,670
Chief Royal Cook.

999
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:53,757
I am not interested
in another nation's politics,

1000
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:56,009
but do relay this message to your king.

1001
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:02,683
The edges of objects
are always harder to see,

1002
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:05,185
and when you sleep,

1003
01:16:05,269 --> 01:16:08,397
be sure to lock the latch securely.

1004
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:12,818
Okay.

1005
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:15,696
Is that all you want me to tell him?

1006
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:19,825
Okay.

1007
01:16:20,450 --> 01:16:22,536
Then let us say our farewells.

1008
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:38,093
- Thank you.
- I learned a lot.

1009
01:16:38,176 --> 01:16:39,136
Thank you.

1010
01:16:48,687 --> 01:16:52,608
"The edges of objects
are always harder to see,

1011
01:16:52,691 --> 01:16:56,612
and when you sleep,
be sure to lock the latch securely"?

1012
01:16:56,695 --> 01:17:00,240
You should have asked him what he meant.

1013
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:02,326
Yes, you should have.

1014
01:17:02,409 --> 01:17:04,411
I have a bad feeling about it
for some reason.

1015
01:17:06,913 --> 01:17:08,373
- Your Royal Highness.
- Your Royal Highness.

1016
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:15,047
- Miss!
- Chief Royal Cook…

1017
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:16,757
Your Royal Highness.

1018
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:20,260
You will never cook for His Majesty again.

1019
01:17:20,344 --> 01:17:23,805
I'm not sure I understand what you mean.

1020
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:25,474
My son Jinmyeong

1021
01:17:25,557 --> 01:17:28,644
is at death's door
after he ate the chicken you made for him!

1022
01:17:33,231 --> 01:17:34,274
Your Royal Highness.

1023
01:17:34,941 --> 01:17:37,569
Are you saying Grand Prince Jinmyeong
is unconscious?

1024
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:39,404
Why would the food I made…

1025
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:41,740
You should know better than anyone.

1026
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:43,659
Take this wench away this instant!

1027
01:17:43,742 --> 01:17:45,494
I will interrogate her myself.

1028
01:17:45,577 --> 01:17:47,204
- Yes, Your Royal Highness.
- Yes, Your Royal Highness.

1029
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:50,332
- Chief Royal Cook.
- Wait. Your Royal Highness.

1030
01:17:50,415 --> 01:17:52,376
- Oh no, miss!
- Chief Royal Cook!

1031
01:17:52,459 --> 01:17:55,462
- Your Royal Highness, it can't be!
- Miss!

1032
01:17:55,545 --> 01:17:58,674
- There must be a misunderstanding!
- Chief Royal Cook!

1033
01:17:58,757 --> 01:17:59,800
Your Royal Highness…

1034
01:18:06,973 --> 01:18:09,935
<i>Chaos must be unfolding by now.</i>

1035
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:10,852
<i>Yes, Your Grace.</i>

1036
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,230
The Queen Dowager is furious,

1037
01:18:13,313 --> 01:18:15,232
and she will interrogate
the chief royal cook herself.

1038
01:18:15,315 --> 01:18:17,859
Very well.
What about the female physician?

1039
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:20,821
I brought her out in secret
and sent her to that place.

1040
01:18:20,904 --> 01:18:21,822
Well done.

1041
01:18:23,615 --> 01:18:26,326
I wish I could see the face

1042
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:29,121
of the chief royal cook
as she is being interrogated and tortured.

1043
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:38,171
Your Royal Highness, I'm innocent!

1044
01:18:38,255 --> 01:18:40,424
Something isn't right!

1045
01:18:40,507 --> 01:18:41,633
Shut your mouth!

1046
01:18:42,217 --> 01:18:44,761
Until the wench confesses the truth,

1047
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:45,971
torture her!

1048
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:47,097
- Yes, Your Royal Highness!
- Yes, Your Royal Highness!

1049
01:18:47,681 --> 01:18:49,224
No, wait. Your Royal Highness.

1050
01:18:49,307 --> 01:18:50,726
Your Royal Highness!

1051
01:19:00,527 --> 01:19:03,321
GOCHO

1052
01:19:34,352 --> 01:19:37,272
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

1053
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:40,442
<i>Are you implying</i>
<i>that I was behind all this?</i>

1054
01:19:41,735 --> 01:19:45,655
<i>You know better than anyone</i>
<i>that I wouldn't do such a thing.</i>

1055
01:19:45,739 --> 01:19:47,449
<i>Please prove my innocence.</i>

1056
01:19:47,532 --> 01:19:51,161
<i>This is not His Majesty's doing.</i>

1057
01:19:51,244 --> 01:19:53,121
I guess it would not be so bad
to stand by and watch.

1058
01:19:53,872 --> 01:19:55,582
<i>It means the time has come.</i>

1059
01:19:55,665 --> 01:19:58,251
<i>I do not want you to leave.</i>

1060
01:19:58,335 --> 01:20:00,337
We must silence that female physician.

1061
01:20:00,921 --> 01:20:02,589
Did Consort Kang put you up to it?
