1
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:49,966
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

2
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:51,926
Who goes there?

3
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,817
<i>Is this a revolt?</i>

4
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,569
<i>What about His Majesty?</i>

5
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:11,321
<i>What happened to him?</i>

6
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,239
YI HEON
KING OF JOSEON

7
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:16,743
<i>Your Majesty,</i>
<i>you must get out of here immediately!</i>

8
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,828
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

9
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:38,973
Who are you?

10
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:42,018
Can you not tell? We are jesters!

11
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:43,520
Drop your sword!

12
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:52,862
Cook Yeon, we must go right now.

13
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:14,676
<i>Cook Yeon.</i>

14
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:17,762
<i>You, above all, must be safe.</i>

15
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,025
<i>The purge hasn't even happened.</i>

16
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,027
<i>What's happening?</i>

17
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,865
Tell me, Gong-gil.

18
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:39,742
I saw the guards wearing red headbands.

19
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:41,703
Is this…

20
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,538
It is treason.

21
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:45,415
Treason?

22
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,376
Who's leading it?

23
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,296
Grand Prince Jesan and his followers.

24
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,923
They already killed Im Seo-hong,
the Second Minister of Works.

25
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,925
They were targeting you next.

26
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,302
That is why I hurriedly got you out.

27
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:58,761
Me?

28
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,390
What about His Majesty? Where is he?

29
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:04,517
I do not know yet.

30
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,478
The best you can do now is hide.

31
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,230
What are you saying?

32
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,857
I must see His Majesty right now.

33
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,319
Did you not hear me say
they are after you?

34
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,030
Are you that worried about him?

35
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,656
Yes.

36
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,617
I guess you're not.

37
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:25,079
What if you go back and they capture you?

38
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,665
Do you not see it?

39
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,209
You must stay alive.

40
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,878
That is the way to help His Majesty.

41
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:42,513
His Majesty tried so hard
to restrain himself.

42
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,225
How could this happen?

43
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,614
It is rather odd that Her Royal Highness
summoned us at this hour.

44
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:02,909
Do you think
she heard about our gathering?

45
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,580
I believe she has finally
made up her mind.

46
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,291
She did witness
His Majesty's madness unleash after all.

47
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,835
We will see soon enough.

48
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,420
Let us hurry.

49
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,421
- Yes, my lord.
- Yes, my lord.

50
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:24,722
Your Highness, what are you doing here?

51
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,100
And for what reason
are you holding a sword?

52
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,144
I am here to uphold a royal command.

53
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,021
A royal command?

54
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,106
The command

55
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,318
to eliminate the treacherous
Han family, who, reveled in power,

56
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,656
manipulated the nation from the shadows.

57
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,408
Then it was not

58
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,495
Her Royal Highness who summoned us?

59
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:50,957
How dare you!

60
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,334
Do you not fear the heavens?

61
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,544
The heavens?

62
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,589
The heavens, you say?

63
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,601
Do not worry.

64
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:14,230
For your death will go down as the doing

65
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,358
of the current king, the tyrant.

66
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,901
What?

67
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,205
Do not shut the gate!

68
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,207
May you rest in peace.

69
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:40,381
- No!
- Do not shut the gate! Let us out!

70
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,177
Mother, I am so afraid.

71
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,553
It is all right.

72
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:46,721
It will be all right.

73
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,014
GRAND PRINCE JINMYEONG
YI HEON'S HALF BROTHER

74
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,307
QUEEN DOWAGER JAHYEON
YI HEON'S STEPMOTHER

75
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,207
Grand Prince Jesan.

76
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:23,758
Your Royal Highness.

77
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,385
A disaster has befallen us.

78
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,597
That is why I came to you in haste.

79
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,015
What is this disaster you speak of?

80
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,767
Brace yourself for the news.

81
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,852
His Majesty lost his mind

82
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,688
and murdered the Grand Royal Queen Dowager

83
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:41,150
and slaughtered
all the court officials indiscriminately.

84
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,568
Then

85
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,113
are you saying Her Royal Highness…

86
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,116
has passed away?

87
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,119
I reached her too late.

88
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:55,206
And so I hurriedly gathered
the officials of the Sarim faction

89
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:58,376
and entered the palace,
risking discourtesy,

90
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,921
to protect Your Royal Highness
and Grand Prince Jinmyeong.

91
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:05,424
Then where is His Majesty right now?

92
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:09,053
He went to Salgoji Forest
to battle the rebel forces

93
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:13,724
who rose to hold him responsible
for his madness.

94
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,226
Battle, you say?

95
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:18,896
Mother.

96
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,065
Are you all right?

97
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,525
Mother.

98
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:23,526
Jinmyeong.

99
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,736
What should we do now?

100
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,114
Your Royal Highness.

101
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,198
It is time

102
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,454
for Grand Prince Jinmyeong
to ascend the throne.

103
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,876
What did you just say?

104
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,880
How could you say such a thing
when His Majesty is still alive?

105
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,551
Are you saying you want my Jinmyeong
to become a rebel leader?

106
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,719
Do you truly…

107
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,473
not see

108
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:55,600
who the tyrant's blade…

109
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,521
will come for next?

110
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:05,276
Before His Majesty becomes a threat
to you and Grand Prince Jinmyeong,

111
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,195
he must be dethroned.

112
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,197
Even so…

113
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,452
Jinmyeong is still too young.

114
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,218
Must we…

115
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,346
shed even more blood

116
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,516
for you to listen to me?

117
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,607
Three days.

118
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,610
Give me three days
to contemplate the matter.

119
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,153
Her Royal Highness' funeral--

120
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,363
I cannot.

121
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,616
The throne must not be left vacant
for even one day.

122
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,203
The coronation will be held
as soon as dawn breaks tomorrow.

123
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,163
That is final.

124
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:03,668
What if His Majesty were to return?

125
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,379
How will you handle the consequences?

126
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:08,923
This time…

127
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:13,302
it will be almost impossible

128
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,805
for him to return alive.

129
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,613
Your Majesty.

130
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,410
Your Majesty…

131
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,296
Your Majesty.

132
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,176
Your Majesty!

133
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:57,638
Your Majesty!

134
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:03,894
COURSE N° 12 HWANSEBAN

135
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,783
Your Royal Highness.

136
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:21,704
A calamity has struck the palace,
so we brought the royal seal to you.

137
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,456
Bring it forth.

138
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,756
This was sent from Sangseowon,
Office of the Royal Seal.

139
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,217
We request your wise counsel,
Your Royal Highness.

140
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:46,062
Inform the Ministry of Rites
that Her Royal Highness

141
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,856
will do what is right to honor
the royal ancestors and the state,

142
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,901
uphold order within the court,
and calm the disarray.

143
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,861
The coronation for the new king

144
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,655
will be held soon,

145
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,282
so instruct all officials
to prepare to show their respect.

146
00:10:58,908 --> 00:10:59,909
Yes, Your Highness.

147
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,585
Please issue the royal edict.

148
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,795
ROYAL EDICT: OFFICIAL DOCUMENT
CONTAINING THE KING'S COMMAND

149
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,389
Very well.

150
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,517
I will write the edict.

151
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:29,355
However, it will not simply include
the matter of the coronation,

152
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:34,777
but also a pledge for a new era.

153
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:36,904
I understand.

154
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:42,785
I, too, will take part in presenting

155
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:46,914
a new world to our people

156
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:53,629
alongside Grand Prince Jinmyeong,
who will soon ascend the throne.

157
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,102
<i>Have you heard?</i>

158
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,312
The king lost his mind last night,

159
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,189
murdered his own grandmother,

160
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,150
and indiscriminately slaughtered
the court officials.

161
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,026
And after committing such a heinous act,

162
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,320
- he left to hunt!
- How ridiculous!

163
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,990
The current king will be dethroned,
and a new king will ascend the throne.

164
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,116
Who will be the new king?

165
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,367
Grand Prince Jinmyeong.

166
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,536
He will soon ascend the throne.

167
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:28,831
Word is that the king died
in a hunting accident.

168
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,459
- The king has passed? Is that true?
- Yes.

169
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,960
I heard he was burned to death.

170
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,588
- He was punished by the heavens.
- Indeed.

171
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:40,092
CORONATION

172
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:48,309
<i>Our nation has been cultivating virtue</i>
<i>for one hundred years,</i>

173
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:51,145
<i>and by doing so,</i>
<i>it has let down strong and healthy roots.</i>

174
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:55,691
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>our current king neglected his duties,</i>

175
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:59,153
<i>crushing the people's trust</i>
<i>and plunging them into distress.</i>

176
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:02,740
<i>- For the sake of our nation…</i>
<i>- …and its people,</i>

177
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,159
<i>by the mandate of the heavens,</i>

178
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:08,370
<i>Grand Prince Jinmyeong</i>
<i>will be appointed as the new king</i>

179
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,290
<i>and shall ascend the throne</i>
<i>as the 11th King of Joseon.</i>

180
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,709
<i>As the new king,</i>

181
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:19,173
<i>may he rule wisely</i>
<i>and save his people from their concerns.</i>

182
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:22,885
Long live the king.

183
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:26,514
- Long live the king!
- Long live the king!

184
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:30,059
- Long live the king!
- Long live the king!

185
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:33,479
- Long live the king!
- Long live the king!

186
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,501
The reign of the tyrant is over at last.

187
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,797
Congratulations.

188
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,051
Your efforts for this very day

189
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,345
have finally paid off.

190
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,432
I owe this glory to you all

191
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,351
who have assisted me throughout.

192
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:17,648
Soon, the people will offer you
their support and favor.

193
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,359
You should ascend the throne then.

194
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:24,071
And become a sage king for us all.

195
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,949
- Become a sage king for us.
- Become a sage king for us.

196
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,413
My goodness.

197
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,959
It has been less than half a day

198
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,712
since our new king ascended the throne.

199
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,298
Save your breath.

200
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,886
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

201
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:50,931
What happened to His Majesty
after he went to Salgoji Forest?

202
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,309
They say there were no survivors,

203
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,268
so it seems

204
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,229
no one has made it through last night.

205
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,275
I find it odd

206
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,945
that the chief royal cook
found out and got away.

207
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,157
Do not worry.

208
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,117
With His Majesty gone from the palace,

209
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,911
the chief royal cook's life

210
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:13,662
is at its close.

211
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,000
<i>That's impossible.</i>

212
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,754
His Majesty had agreed to eat
with the Grand Royal Queen Dowager.

213
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:24,214
So why would he harm her?

214
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,633
Or his subjects?

215
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,844
A new king ascended the throne overnight.

216
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,471
There is nothing we can do now.

217
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,810
If Grand Prince Jinmyeong
ascended the throne,

218
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,939
what's going to happen to His Majesty?

219
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,693
Upon hearing you were taken
by a band of rebels,

220
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,654
he went to Salgoji Forest,

221
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,739
and he has not been seen since.

222
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,534
He went all the way there because of me?

223
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:56,705
They say there were piles of dead bodies

224
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,832
at Salgoji Forest.

225
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,502
No one has found his body yet,

226
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,963
but it is unlikely he survived.

227
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:07,883
It can't be.

228
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,512
I shall go out and see
if I can get more news.

229
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:14,473
Wait here until I get back.

230
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:16,684
Wait.

231
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:22,940
Take this.

232
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,446
Please find His Majesty
and give this to him.

233
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,532
Tell him I'm safe.

234
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,660
I shall.

235
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,628
Court Lady Kim…

236
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,965
I cannot believe you died
such a futile death.

237
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,052
I do not understand what is happening.

238
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,263
How can everything change overnight?

239
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,890
I hope our chief royal cook
is somewhere safe.

240
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,018
It worries me that she just vanished.

241
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,394
It worries me too.

242
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,563
She left without a word to me.

243
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,818
If she returned to the future
that she said she came from,

244
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,320
I would not be so worried.

245
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:13,115
What are you talking about?

246
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,617
Our chief royal cook came from the future?

247
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,078
- Well…
- Are you all right, Maid Seo?

248
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,621
Are you not feeling well?

249
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,290
- No, it is--
- There is already enough madness

250
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,500
in the palace as it is.

251
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,462
- Get a hold of yourself.
- This is so frustrating!

252
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,589
Why can you not believe me?

253
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:32,176
This is why
she did not tell any of you about it.

254
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,596
Miss…

255
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:39,266
Is it true that His Majesty lost his mind

256
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:42,311
and plunged the palace into chaos?

257
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,481
He did have fits,
but nothing like this has ever happened.

258
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,649
I find it hard to believe.

259
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,987
How have you all been?

260
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,421
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

261
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,800
<i>Where are you?</i>

262
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,136
<i>Who are you?</i>

263
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,138
Are you Korean?

264
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,890
<i>Could she be a </i>gwinyeo<i>?</i>

265
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,016
No, stop it.

266
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,018
<i>Halt!</i>

267
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:27,189
<i>I command that she be immediately</i>

268
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,274
<i>appointed as the chief royal cook!</i>

269
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:33,821
<i>Now that I've survived</i>
<i>the harrowing, difficult times…</i>

270
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,115
<i>A true cook</i>

271
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,034
<i>does not blame the lack of time,</i>
<i>but selects good ingredients</i>

272
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,120
<i>to create an exquisite dish.</i>

273
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,580
<i>…I realize</i>

274
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:47,501
<i>that you always made me</i>
<i>want to become a better chef.</i>

275
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,421
<i>I do not wish to eat anything tonight.</i>

276
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,633
<i>Now, if you're not there to eat my food,</i>

277
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,719
<i>I have no reason to cook.</i>

278
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,264
<i>Promise me…</i>

279
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,975
<i>that you will never</i>
<i>let yourself get hurt again.</i>

280
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:10,023
<i>I can finally be honest with my feelings.</i>

281
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:13,986
I miss you…

282
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,238
Your Majesty.

283
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,130
It is an ambush!

284
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:41,513
<i>Are you saying</i>
<i>you lost the dethroned king?</i>

285
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,933
If what he says is true,
is this not a disaster, Your Highness?

286
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,437
I apologize, Your Highness.

287
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,065
I will bring you his head
within three days.

288
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,360
Leave it.

289
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,448
A tiger that has lost its territory

290
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,035
can do nothing but roar out in rage.

291
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,579
Lord Yoo.

292
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,080
You may enter.

293
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,253
The remnants of Urimwi
ambushed the North Gate.

294
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,171
What?

295
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,673
Urimwi launched an ambush?

296
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:17,674
What should we do?

297
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,886
We have a new king,
so this stands as an act of treason.

298
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,433
What more can a dethroned king

299
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,393
who is on the run do?

300
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,480
Your Highness!

301
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,482
We urgently request your presence.

302
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:52,042
Why must it be so hard
to enter my own home?

303
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:04,304
Consort Kang,
I truly hoped you were not one of them.

304
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,766
I thought you harmed Jinmyeong
only out of jealousy toward my cook.

305
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,646
I see the hands that used to console me…

306
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,901
were hiding a blade.

307
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:23,031
I waited for this day to come
from the very beginning.

308
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,994
I will not seek
your understanding or forgiveness.

309
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,670
Yes. That is what I expect of you.

310
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,047
But do not forget this.

311
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,675
One who bears a sword with a grin…

312
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,971
will eventually be struck by it.

313
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:54,187
Uncle.

314
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,481
You are back, Your Majesty.

315
00:21:58,775 --> 00:21:59,776
Yes.

316
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:01,862
I am back alive.

317
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:04,948
We must have one final conversation.

318
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:25,719
I see the preparations at Salgoji Forest
were not sufficient.

319
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,598
They were more than sufficient.

320
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,558
However,

321
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,935
you chose the wrong ground for the battle.

322
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:37,647
You wanted the people to think

323
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:41,777
the tyrannical king who killed his own kin
went hunting in Salgoji Forest,

324
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,071
where he was punished by the heavens.

325
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:46,490
Is that not right?

326
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,241
However,

327
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:51,369
you overlooked the fact that
I am familiar with the terrain there.

328
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:57,626
Now I see why my men lost you.

329
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:02,089
So, did you leave for the forest
fully aware of the disaster

330
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,674
that would befall the palace?

331
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:08,804
Were you also aware I was behind the plot?

332
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,973
I realized
right before I left for the forest.

333
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,685
I just was not certain.

334
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:18,563
Do explain how.

335
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:26,071
<i>"The edges of objects</i>
<i>are always harder to see,</i>

336
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:29,741
and when you sleep,
be sure to lock the latch securely."

337
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:30,826
That was the message.

338
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:33,328
<i>It is a riddle based on</i>
<i>the sounds of characters.</i>

339
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:36,123
<i>Did Tang Bailong</i>
<i>try to send me a message with a riddle?</i>

340
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,166
Je<i> for "edge."</i>

341
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,336
San<i> for "latch."</i>

342
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:42,462
JESAN

343
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:50,428
I see the Ming cook
has spoken out of turn.

344
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:53,098
Either way, you lost.

345
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:54,891
Do you not agree?

346
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,435
It must be retribution
for the Muin Literati Purge.

347
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,857
Then are you prepared to accept

348
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,734
whatever punishment is given to you?

349
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,403
I have already been dethroned.

350
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,615
What more do you want from me?

351
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:15,412
You resented your grandmother
and her Han family so much,

352
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:16,454
and it was I

353
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:21,084
who killed them on your behalf,
was it not?

354
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:25,463
Now,

355
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:30,719
it is time for you
to take full responsibility.

356
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:35,849
It is true
that I once wanted them all dead.

357
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:38,518
However, I was going to reconcile
with my grandmother.

358
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,561
What if you did?

359
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,313
What would that have changed?

360
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,525
What about the lives
of the loyal subjects you killed

361
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,152
during the Muin Literati Purge?

362
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,576
<i>What about the officials you took down</i>
<i>using </i>chaehong<i>,</i>

363
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,036
<i>led by the Chief Royal Secretary,</i>

364
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,830
under the guise of avenging
the deposed queen?

365
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:00,624
Have you forgotten

366
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,919
all that happened in those days?

367
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,004
Have you forgotten
the pain and suffering you caused?

368
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,097
It is all my fault.

369
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,894
I have absolutely no excuse…

370
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,190
for what happened.

371
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,736
Now you show remorse?

372
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,989
What more must I do

373
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:36,618
to absolve myself of my sins?

374
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:38,870
Though I am not sure

375
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,249
if I can be absolved of them at all.

376
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:44,751
The very thought of them…

377
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,047
torments me greatly as well.

378
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,173
That is why

379
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:53,343
I returned everything to order
with a revolt.

380
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:55,053
Your mother's tragedy.

381
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:57,305
Your late father
and the Han family's mistake

382
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,932
of putting you on the throne!

383
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:00,016
You!

384
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,893
You should never have been king.

385
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,270
It should have been me!

386
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,605
The throne should have been mine!

387
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,573
So that is what this was all about?

388
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,869
I see you wanted to be king, Uncle.

389
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:22,247
I have one question.

390
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,082
Why did you return to the palace?

391
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:25,125
There was

392
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,712
no place for me
to hide on this land anyway,

393
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:31,256
so I wanted to settle things with you
once and for all.

394
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,215
Very well.

395
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:33,842
Tell me.

396
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:35,218
What do you want?

397
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:40,932
I want your word
that you will uphold Jinmyeong's reign,

398
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,477
so he does not make the mistakes I did.

399
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:49,024
Then I will take full responsibility
and accept my dethronement.

400
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,901
I am prepared to do so.

401
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,113
What a just ruler you are.

402
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,449
Very well.

403
00:26:57,532 --> 00:27:01,453
I will banish you
to where your mother is buried.

404
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:02,996
Very well.

405
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:07,208
If shouldering the weight of it all

406
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,544
is the way to atone for my sins.

407
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:18,136
<i>Just as I thought,</i>
<i>I cannot leave you be, Uncle.</i>

408
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,513
<i>I may be a living criminal,</i>

409
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,434
<i>but you are</i>

410
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,853
<i>a true tyrant possessed by madness.</i>

411
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:31,024
<i>You sure have changed a great deal</i>

412
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,777
<i>after meeting the chief royal cook,</i>
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

413
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,745
Here is the journal you asked for.

414
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:46,414
You will never eat such dishes again,

415
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,834
so consider this His Highness' mercy,
allowing you to keep your memory.

416
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:02,972
MANGUNROK

417
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:10,688
<i>Cook Yeon.</i>

418
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,525
<i>Are you still alive?</i>

419
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:23,076
<i>The chief royal cook</i>
<i>greatly misses the hometown</i>

420
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:24,911
<i>she left behind.</i>

421
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:28,164
<i>How does </i>"hwanseban,"<i> meaning</i>
<i>"food that brings one home," sound?</i>

422
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,749
HWANSEBAN

423
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,504
<i>My dearly beloved,</i>

424
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:36,631
<i>if…</i>

425
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,592
<i>you were to read this someday,</i>

426
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:42,470
<i>may you come back</i>

427
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,014
<i>to my side.</i>

428
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,518
MANGUNROK

429
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,019
<i>For then,</i>

430
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,272
<i>I will recognize you</i>

431
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,275
<i>at first glance.</i>

432
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:57,944
<i>For then,</i>

433
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,655
<i>my heart shall belong to you</i>
<i>from the very beginning.</i>

434
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,504
<i>You are alive,</i>

435
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,383
<i>Cook Yeon.</i>

436
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,471
<i>That is a great relief.</i>

437
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,850
His Majesty is really alive?

438
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:31,227
The situation is not ideal,

439
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:32,937
but he is alive.

440
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,940
I gave him the butterfly ornament,

441
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,985
so he will know you are alive.

442
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:40,069
Then…

443
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:45,867
will His Majesty be exiled now?

444
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,620
How do you know that?

445
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,372
I heard he will be banished.

446
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,499
BANISH: TO SEND A CRIMINAL FAR AWAY
AS PUNISHMENT

447
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,667
<i>The events are unfolding</i>
<i>just as they did in history,</i>

448
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,711
<i>even though</i>
<i>he didn't even initiate a purge.</i>

449
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,463
<i>At this rate,</i>

450
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:00,924
<i>he'll die shortly after being exiled.</i>

451
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,510
I heard you came from the future.

452
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,890
Do you know what happens
after he is exiled?

453
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,725
The records say

454
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,144
he died shortly afterward.

455
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:15,438
I see.

456
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:18,107
It may seem like they are showing mercy,

457
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,109
but who knows what will happen to him

458
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:21,778
once he is banished?

459
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:23,822
Gong-gil.

460
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,949
We must save His Majesty, no matter what.

461
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:27,659
Will you please help me?

462
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,209
That damned man.

463
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,297
- He should be beheaded.
- Indeed.

464
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,134
<i>Though the criminal Yi Heon</i>

465
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,137
<i>ascended the throne</i>
<i>by the mandate of the heavens,</i>

466
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,473
not only did he neglect his duties,

467
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:54,185
but he also persecuted
and executed his subjects without cause.

468
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,603
As if that were not enough,

469
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,814
<i>he committed the heinous impiety</i>

470
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:00,066
<i>of murdering</i>
<i>the Grand Royal Queen Dowager,</i>

471
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:03,820
and just one day after his dethronement,
he committed treason.

472
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:06,823
Thus, he is hereby demoted
to the status of a prince as Yeonhuigun

473
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:10,118
<i>and sentenced to exile in Ganghwa.</i>

474
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,203
<i>I remember.</i>

475
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,413
Yeonhuigun.

476
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:14,914
You don't know the tyrant Yeonhuigun?

477
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,207
The worst tyrant of Joseon.

478
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:20,336
<i>How did you know I would like this dish?</i>

479
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,380
I studied Yeonhuigun.

480
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:24,674
I'm from the future.

481
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,552
Yeonhuigun.

482
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,431
That was me.

483
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:34,392
<i>Cook Yeon.</i>

484
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:36,477
<i>I see now</i>

485
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:40,523
<i>that you recognized me</i>
<i>from the very beginning.</i>

486
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:53,411
You do not look so content.

487
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,956
It would be crazy of me
to laugh in this situation.

488
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,420
Does that mean I am crazy?

489
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:09,427
Your Highness, it is finally over.

490
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,803
Congratulations.

491
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,389
A fire is not fully extinguished

492
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:16,017
until the last embers are put out.

493
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,561
We still have something to take care of.

494
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,063
Do you mean…

495
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:22,357
The thought of sparing his life
weighed on my mind.

496
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,484
You are truly very wise.

497
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,903
Lords Sung and Kim,
please remain in the palace

498
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:28,780
and watch over our new king.

499
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:32,617
- Lord Yoo, please prepare the soldiers.
- I will do as you command.

500
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:35,662
- Deok-chul.
- Yes, Your Highness.

501
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,163
While I am away,

502
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:40,750
make sure to take good care of Her Grace.

503
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,126
Yes, Your Highness.

504
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,736
Oh my, my lord.

505
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:10,488
Make way!

506
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,741
We only wish to make a living.

507
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,410
Step back!

508
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,661
I said step back!

509
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:19,122
You need not be so angry.

510
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,541
How dare they harm something
that belongs to me?

511
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:23,001
They should be taught a lesson.

512
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,002
Make way!

513
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,381
Cook Yeon.

514
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,095
What are you doing here?

515
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,263
Don't worry.

516
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:36,848
Go.

517
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,141
Go, now!

518
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,019
Hang in there.

519
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,895
You have to stay strong.

520
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:44,689
Bang!

521
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,150
Okay?

522
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,443
Do not do anything foolish.

523
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,111
I have a plan of my own.

524
00:33:58,494 --> 00:33:59,537
Step back!

525
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,621
Cook Yeon!

526
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:05,710
My goodness. All right, we are leaving.

527
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:07,837
Hurry along!

528
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,422
Let us get going.

529
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:10,965
- Cook Yeon.
- Hurry!

530
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,219
Cook Yeon.

531
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:16,888
Cook Yeon…

532
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:47,960
Halt.

533
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,129
- Drag him out!
- Yes, sir!

534
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,974
I will not say much.

535
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:04,769
Blame the heavens.

536
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,648
Of course.

537
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,401
Just as expected, Uncle.

538
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,030
Now.

539
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:27,667
Your Majesty, are you unharmed?

540
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,591
You made it in time.

541
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:40,805
Here is your royal sword, Your Majesty.

542
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,192
<i>My first prediction was correct.</i>

543
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:55,695
<i>My second one will be as well.</i>

544
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:58,406
You will see.

545
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,408
I am certain

546
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,494
my uncle will come to check my dead body.

547
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,456
Eliminating him then

548
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:10,459
is the last thing I can do for Jinmyeong

549
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,670
as a dethroned king.

550
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,059
Oh dear.

551
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:31,731
I see I overestimated you, Your Majesty.

552
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:35,276
I thought you would have
a decent group of followers.

553
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,736
But this is it?

554
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,573
Unless you have other plans,

555
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:43,075
you will die here today.

556
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,162
Your Majesty!

557
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:50,666
Cook Yeon.

558
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,794
I'm here to save you.

559
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,088
Gong-gil and these men
are here to save you.

560
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,466
Gong-gil.

561
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,343
Cook Yeon!

562
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:01,385
Miss!

563
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:05,097
Cook Yeon!

564
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,515
- Miss!
- Chief Royal Cook!

565
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,142
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

566
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:09,769
Gil-geum.

567
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,312
What are you all doing here?

568
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,856
Gong-gil told us of the plan.

569
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,815
What?

570
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,486
All right then.

571
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,490
Let us have some fun!

572
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:25,660
Let us go!

573
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,624
The royal kitchen cooks and jesters.

574
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:33,876
What a useless bunch of fools.

575
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:45,805
Archers!

576
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,935
Shields!

577
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,109
Fire!

578
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,740
Fire!

579
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,882
Now!

580
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:25,136
Strike down the rebels!

581
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,096
Oh my, miss!

582
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,892
Those damned bastards.

583
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:14,935
Spears! Forward!

584
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,955
- Step back!
- Stay away!

585
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,415
- <i>Gochogaru</i>!
- Cook Sim!

586
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,334
Throw the <i>gochogaru</i>!

587
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,316
Cook Yeon!

588
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,734
I am here!

589
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:07,988
Am I late?

590
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:11,075
No. You're right on time.

591
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:14,078
I will get to use these
to my heart's content.

592
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:16,664
<i>Su</i> for "hand," and <i>tu</i> for "throw."

593
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,749
Behold, <i>sututan</i>, you scoundrels!

594
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:56,620
Your Highness, we must retreat for now.

595
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:58,038
Those damned…

596
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,459
All because of that
wretched chief royal cook again!

597
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,512
Miss!

598
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:58,015
- We won!
- We won!

599
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:00,559
- We won!
- We won!

600
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:01,977
It is not over yet.

601
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,104
Capture Grand Prince Jesan!

602
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,439
Heon!

603
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,197
Cook Yeon.

604
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,282
Do you remember

605
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:18,285
where we drank together
before you ascended the throne?

606
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,663
Wolyeongru.

607
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:22,039
Let us meet there.

608
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:24,041
If you do not come alone…

609
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:29,380
the chief royal cook will die.

610
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:37,304
How dare that damned bastard
take a woman hostage?

611
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,434
Your Majesty, I will go save her.

612
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:44,061
I will go as well!

613
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:45,646
- Me too!
- Me too!

614
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:46,772
Please let us join!

615
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:48,691
Miss!

616
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:52,403
I am the one my uncle wants.

617
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:54,738
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty, you cannot go.

618
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:56,156
It is dangerous!

619
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:59,410
Do not worry. I will return.

620
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,537
While I save the chief royal cook,

621
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,497
you all must eliminate
the rest of my uncle's men

622
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:05,291
and reclaim the palace.

623
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:06,709
Your Majesty.

624
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:11,171
- No, Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

625
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,339
Miss!

626
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,843
<i>Attack!</i>

627
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:22,141
<i>Lord Sung. We received word</i>
<i>that Grand Prince Jesan was defeated.</i>

628
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:25,227
<i>What? His troops were annihilated?</i>

629
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:30,107
<i>Leave the rest to me and go!</i>

630
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:32,359
<i>We are heading to Gangnyeongjeon!</i>

631
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:40,326
Are you not the assassin
from Salgoji Forest?

632
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:43,370
Then why did you side with the king?

633
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:46,123
Because what you lot were doing

634
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:47,416
was more foul than filth.

635
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:57,343
<i>I will not die like this.</i>

636
00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:59,178
<i>Not like this!</i>

637
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:03,724
<i>Your Highness.</i>

638
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:08,479
<i>What happened to the world</i>
<i>you promised us?</i>

639
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,106
<i>Do not stand back!</i>

640
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,233
<i>Strike down the rebels!</i>

641
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:28,791
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

642
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,168
<i>Please return safely.</i>

643
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:34,880
<i>I cannot believe that the palace</i>
<i>was reclaimed so easily.</i>

644
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:39,510
<i>We greatly underestimated</i>
<i>the dethroned king.</i>

645
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:49,561
I yearned for a reign of peace.

646
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:54,817
But it was nothing but a fleeting dream!

647
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:01,198
<i>Your Highness…</i>

648
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:14,044
Is anyone there?

649
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:40,112
Your Grace.

650
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:43,323
You…

651
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:45,200
You are…

652
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:47,870
I am here to take revenge for my sister.

653
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,496
And also…

654
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:54,877
for all the women you used then discarded.

655
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,380
<i>One who bears a sword with a grin</i>

656
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:00,966
will eventually be struck by it.

657
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:08,515
I will never beg for my life
to you lowly scoundrel.

658
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,350
You wench!

659
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:14,396
Do you know how many lives you have taken?

660
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,362
I am but a jester, just like yourself.

661
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:24,364
Do not be ridiculous.

662
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:29,369
You have no right
to call yourself a jester.

663
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:36,877
That is not for you to decide.

664
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:56,688
This…

665
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:01,109
is for my sister.

666
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:01,461
It is all over, Chief Royal Cook.

667
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:09,177
This time, for once,

668
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:12,931
I stand with His Majesty.

669
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:29,573
WOLYEONGRU

670
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,505
I knew he would come.

671
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:50,552
The love that makes him
do anything for you.

672
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:52,679
It is so very touching.

673
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:56,850
Will having company on one's way to hell
make the journey more pleasurable?

674
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:14,159
I see you are unharmed.

675
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:15,702
That is a relief.

676
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:31,134
Step aside.

677
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,520
Uncle.

678
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:45,857
You took my cook
that even the Ming could not take.

679
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:47,651
Are you prepared to face the consequences?

680
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:59,663
Did you yourself come here prepared?

681
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:03,792
Let us see if you can reach me.

682
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:06,920
I will make you come to me.

683
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:20,767
MANGUNROK

684
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:28,358
Cook Yeon.

685
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:57,345
Not bad.

686
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:31,463
Your Majesty!

687
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:32,964
Cook Yeon!

688
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:37,469
Cook Yeon! Get away from here!

689
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:38,428
Hurry!

690
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:41,723
No.

691
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:43,391
I can't go on my own.

692
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:44,726
Do not worry about me.

693
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:45,727
Go!

694
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:53,109
MANGUNROK

695
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:58,698
No way.

696
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:01,117
Is this <i>Mangunrok</i>?

697
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:08,166
<i>Next</i>

698
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:10,418
<i>is the potage.</i>

699
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:13,588
"Mangunrok"<i>?</i>

700
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:15,465
They're recipes.

701
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,051
<i>Today's special dinner menu</i>

702
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:19,511
<i>is </i>doenjang<i> pasta.</i>

703
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:24,182
<i>The dish I prepared today</i>
<i>is a German dish called schnitzel.</i>

704
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:28,228
<i>It is crunchy on the outside,</i>
<i>but moist and chewy on the inside.</i>

705
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:31,982
<i>These are the foods</i>
<i>I made for His Majesty.</i>

706
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:37,279
<i>I used butter instead of sesame oil.</i>

707
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:38,989
<i>It is just barley rice.</i>

708
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:42,200
Why is this page torn?

709
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:44,119
HWANSEBAN

710
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:53,712
"My dearly beloved…"

711
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:55,088
<i>My dearly beloved,</i>

712
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:58,383
<i>if you were to read this someday…</i>

713
00:52:58,466 --> 00:53:00,677
"…may you come back…"

714
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:01,845
<i>…may you come back</i>

715
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:03,930
<i>to my side.</i>

716
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:06,308
I don't believe it.

717
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:09,227
<i>Mangunrok </i>was written

718
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:11,605
by His Majesty?

719
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:21,531
- Do not just stand there. Get that wench!
- Yes, Your Highness!

720
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:35,045
Uncle.

721
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:38,673
It is not too late to sheathe your sword.

722
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,801
It is your great fortune
that you have escaped death

723
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,261
time and time again.

724
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:46,932
It is retribution for your sins

725
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:48,892
to die by my sword.

726
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:50,477
Uncle!

727
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:54,898
Power you cannot control
is nothing but a poison!

728
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:06,701
No!

729
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:32,102
Cook Yeon.

730
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:35,522
No.

731
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,440
Cook Yeon!

732
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:01,006
Cook Yeon.

733
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:09,806
Your Majesty…

734
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:12,058
Do not speak.

735
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:14,644
I actually…

736
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:20,066
didn't want to leave.

737
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:22,610
Where would you dare leave

738
00:55:23,778 --> 00:55:25,155
without my permission?

739
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:48,887
I love you,

740
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:51,014
Your Majesty.

741
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:02,317
Cook Yeon.

742
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:04,736
Cook Yeon.

743
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:07,781
I beg of you. Please open your eyes.

744
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:12,827
Please!

745
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:30,011
HWANSEBAN

746
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,847
Please open your eyes.

747
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,520
Please…

748
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:41,815
Please…

749
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:47,070
No…

750
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:48,238
No.

751
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:50,990
Please, no…

752
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,159
No…

753
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:58,832
Please.

754
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:01,668
No.

755
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:10,593
No, Cook Yeon…

756
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:31,281
The <i>Mangunrok</i> she desperately searched for

757
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:34,617
was my journal.

758
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:40,540
Why now?

759
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,334
Why?

760
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:46,671
Why?

761
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:32,634
No.

762
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:50,276
Cook Yeon.

763
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:56,699
Cook Yeon!

764
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:13,091
Wherever you are,

765
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,093
I will find you.

766
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:23,601
I will send you along with her!

767
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:53,798
Heon…

768
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:56,384
I should have been

769
00:59:57,176 --> 00:59:58,469
the king of Joseon.

770
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:00,847
Uncle.

771
01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:05,685
Please go in peace.

772
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:36,007
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

773
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:39,218
<i>Please don't forget your promise</i>

774
01:00:39,927 --> 01:00:41,095
<i>to find me.</i>

775
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:55,985
WOORI UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

776
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:16,798
No!

777
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,805
<i>Where am I?</i>

778
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:26,391
<i>A hospital?</i>

779
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:29,477
<i>Am I back?</i>

780
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:38,611
<i>This wound…</i>

781
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:40,655
<i>It wasn't a dream.</i>

782
01:01:40,738 --> 01:01:42,532
<i>Then what about His Majesty?</i>

783
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:43,866
<i>What happened to him?</i>

784
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:45,535
<i>No!</i>

785
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:49,414
Mangunrok.

786
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:51,541
<i>Where is it?</i>

787
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:59,590
<i>I have to go back.</i>

788
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:10,059
Ji-young.

789
01:02:13,354 --> 01:02:14,355
You're awake.

790
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:17,066
Dad.

791
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:19,736
Do you know how worried I was?

792
01:02:20,778 --> 01:02:21,988
<i>Dad.</i>

793
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:27,368
<i>Just a moment. Are you all right?</i>

794
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:29,704
<i>You can't move around all of a sudden.</i>

795
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:45,511
Ji-young.

796
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:49,265
Stay home and rest
while I get some groceries, okay?

797
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:50,725
- Okay.
- I'll be quick.

798
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,630
THE REAL BASIC COOKBOOK

799
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:37,855
<i>Cook Yeon!</i>

800
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:39,232
Get away from here!

801
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:42,068
No. I can't go on my own.

802
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:43,444
Do not worry about me.

803
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:44,570
Go!

804
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:48,032
<i>No!</i>

805
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:51,202
<i>No. Cook Yeon.</i>

806
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:53,496
<i>Cook Yeon.</i>

807
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:55,373
Cook Yeon.

808
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:57,875
I beg of you. Please open your eyes.

809
01:04:00,586 --> 01:04:02,171
<i>Please!</i>

810
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:08,678
No…

811
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:28,865
YEONHUIGUN

812
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:36,372
YEONHUIGUN

813
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:38,416
FOOD EQUALS POLITICS…

814
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:39,333
DETHRONED KING OF JOSEON

815
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:43,254
"Yeonhuigun's body was never found"?

816
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:45,590
<i>"Yeonhuigun went missing"?</i>

817
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,925
History changed.

818
01:04:50,803 --> 01:04:51,679
I might

819
01:04:52,513 --> 01:04:54,807
be able to meet him again if I go back.

820
01:04:58,769 --> 01:04:59,729
<i>Give me your word.</i>

821
01:05:01,272 --> 01:05:02,356
Promise me…

822
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:05,860
that you will come back to me.

823
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:09,906
MANGUNROK

824
01:05:14,201 --> 01:05:15,786
"My dearly beloved,

825
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:18,956
if you were to read this someday,

826
01:05:20,124 --> 01:05:22,168
may you come back to my side."

827
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:34,388
No.

828
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:39,143
"My dearly beloved,

829
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:41,145
if…

830
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:44,982
you were to read this someday,

831
01:05:45,816 --> 01:05:47,109
may you

832
01:05:48,235 --> 01:05:49,445
come back to my side."

833
01:06:13,177 --> 01:06:14,553
It's not working.

834
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:17,306
Why won't it work?

835
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:23,604
The bathroom.

836
01:06:39,787 --> 01:06:41,664
"My dearly beloved,

837
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:46,377
if you were to read this someday…

838
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:51,882
may you come back to my side."

839
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:42,683
<i>I'll show you.</i>

840
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:44,060
<i>Open up.</i>

841
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:58,365
<i>What if…</i>

842
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:01,744
I want to come back but can't?

843
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:03,996
In that case,

844
01:08:05,289 --> 01:08:06,540
I will find you.

845
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:10,544
<i>I hope…</i>

846
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:15,299
<i>that wasn't our last day together.</i>

847
01:08:34,318 --> 01:08:36,278
ONE MONTH LATER

848
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:52,253
Oh, Chef Yeon.

849
01:08:52,336 --> 01:08:53,254
Hey.

850
01:08:54,255 --> 01:08:56,257
You look well.

851
01:08:57,675 --> 01:08:59,343
Were you surprised to hear from me?

852
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:01,887
I guess a little bit.

853
01:09:02,429 --> 01:09:03,430
What's up?

854
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:05,141
Nothing's up. It's just…

855
01:09:06,058 --> 01:09:08,102
- Let's do business together.
- What?

856
01:09:08,686 --> 01:09:10,688
Michelin has begun their selection process
here in Korea.

857
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:16,694
I'm sorry, but I'm not exactly
thinking about working right now.

858
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:19,530
If you can't work full-time,
then just one month.

859
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:22,158
Just until we find a decent chef.

860
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,578
If we don't receive
a Michelin star again this time,

861
01:09:26,912 --> 01:09:28,455
the hotel will shut down the restaurant.

862
01:09:30,499 --> 01:09:32,585
Please, Ji-young.

863
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:35,838
Can I see the kitchen?

864
01:09:35,921 --> 01:09:36,881
Come this way.

865
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:00,529
<i>Might as well.</i>

866
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:02,448
I'll do it.

867
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:03,657
Chef Yeon.

868
01:10:06,827 --> 01:10:10,331
May I taste the dessert?

869
01:10:30,851 --> 01:10:32,978
It's just for a month though.

870
01:10:33,604 --> 01:10:34,605
Okay.

871
01:10:34,688 --> 01:10:37,608
And if you want a Michelin star,

872
01:10:37,691 --> 01:10:39,818
this menu won't cut it.

873
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:41,862
I'll try developing a new one.

874
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:43,572
The dish you won during the competition?

875
01:10:44,156 --> 01:10:44,990
No.

876
01:10:45,532 --> 01:10:49,787
Fine dining that incorporates
Joseon royal cuisine.

877
01:10:50,287 --> 01:10:51,622
You know how to cook royal cuisine?

878
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:59,964
This is Yeon Ji-young,
Enfin's new head chef.

879
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:02,174
- Hello, Chef.
- Hello, Chef.

880
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:03,092
No way.

881
01:11:03,175 --> 01:11:04,593
Cook Eom!

882
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:07,137
Cook Maeng!

Gil-geum!

886
01:11:13,644 --> 01:11:14,645
Sorry?

887
01:11:14,728 --> 01:11:16,438
My name is Sun-geum.

888
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:17,982
What?

889
01:11:19,066 --> 01:11:20,067
SEO SUN-GEUM

890
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:21,902
<i>This is unbelievable.</i>

891
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:23,529
<i>How can they look so alike?</i>

892
01:11:24,321 --> 01:11:25,698
<i>Are they their descendants?</i>

893
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:27,866
<i>They look too much alike</i>
<i>for it to be a coincidence.</i>

894
01:11:30,202 --> 01:11:34,248
I'm Yeon Ji-young, and I'll be overseeing
the kitchen at Enfin.

895
01:11:34,331 --> 01:11:35,833
I hope we get along.

896
01:11:35,916 --> 01:11:37,501
La Poêle d'Or.

897
01:11:37,584 --> 01:11:39,169
- Oh, the winner?
- For real?

898
01:11:39,253 --> 01:11:41,338
- Oh, the--
- That's enough.

899
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:45,801
We're going to develop a new menu
for the upcoming Michelin evaluation.

900
01:11:45,884 --> 01:11:46,885
And…

901
01:11:48,095 --> 01:11:51,223
I plan on creating a dining course
inspired by the royal kitchen

902
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:55,769
that was in charge of serving meals
to the kings of the Joseon Dynasty.

903
01:11:55,853 --> 01:11:57,313
I have a feeling

904
01:11:57,855 --> 01:11:59,815
we'll do great as a team.

905
01:11:59,898 --> 01:12:02,693
- I look forward to working with you.
- I look forward to working with you.

906
01:12:05,946 --> 01:12:09,241
<i>Just like that,</i>
<i>I returned to the life I used to live.</i>

907

01:12:11,618 --> 01:12:13,287
<i>my heart and my time</i>

<i>remained in the Joseon royal kitchen.</i>

910
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:20,210
<i>I took the royal cuisine I'd come across</i>
<i>as the chief royal cook</i>

911
01:12:20,294 --> 01:12:23,422
<i>and the dishes His Majesty</i>
<i>had recorded in </i>Mangunrok

912
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:25,549
<i>to create a new menu.</i>

913

<i>I applied the techniques</i>
<i>I'd learned in Paris</i>

914
01:12:29,094 --> 01:12:31,388
<i>toward developing a royal dining course.</i>

915
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:36,852
<i>And I named it</i>

916
01:12:36,935 --> 01:12:39,313
<i>the Chief Royal Cook's Dining Course.</i>

917
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:58,332
Chef Yeon, take a look at this.

918
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:01,251
NATURE-INFUSED MODERN ROYAL KOREAN CUISINE
CHIEF ROYAL COOK'S COURSE HIGHLY PRAISED!

919
01:13:01,335 --> 01:13:02,419
Highly praised?

920
01:13:02,961 --> 01:13:03,879
Chef!

921
01:13:06,006 --> 01:13:07,132
Congratulations!

922
01:13:08,425 --> 01:13:10,969
- She's awesome.
- Congratulations, Chief Royal Cook!

923
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:12,221
Three Chief Royal Cook courses.

924
01:13:12,304 --> 01:13:13,806
Prepare your dishes, everyone.

925
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:15,224
- Yes, Chef!
- Yes, Chef!

926
01:13:24,858 --> 01:13:26,985
Good evening, sir.
Did you make a reservation?

927
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:29,238
A table at 7 p.m. for Steve Im.

928
01:13:29,863 --> 01:13:32,616
Great, thank you. Please follow me.

929
01:13:48,173 --> 01:13:50,926
I heard there's a new menu here.

930
01:13:51,009 --> 01:13:52,261
CHIEF ROYAL COOK

931
01:13:52,344 --> 01:13:54,179
Modern Korean cuisine, Chief Royal Cook.

932
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:55,722
Yes, sir.

933
01:13:55,806 --> 01:13:57,933
We've reinterpreted dishes
that were served to the king

934
01:13:58,016 --> 01:13:59,726
as a modern course meal.

935
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:01,186
It's Enfin's signature course.

936
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:02,396
I'll order that.

937
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:05,274
Can I get two glasses
of mineral water first?

938
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,734
Yes, of course.

939
01:14:10,654 --> 01:14:11,697
Chef Yeon.

940
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:13,073
The Chief Royal Cook course
for table seven.

941
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:15,367
It's Michelin.

942
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:18,162
He asked for two glasses of water
and had two phones.

943
01:14:20,539 --> 01:14:22,583
Just do as you always have, okay?

944
01:14:22,666 --> 01:14:24,251
- Yes, Chef!
- Yes, Chef!

945
01:14:24,334 --> 01:14:25,544
The consommé looks great.

946
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:27,212
- Please plate it up.
- Yes, Chef.

947
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:30,132
The beef tartare with seaweed
gets soggy easily,

948
01:14:30,215 --> 01:14:31,842
- so make sure to plate it on time.
- Yes, Chef.

949
01:14:31,925 --> 01:14:34,052
- Slice it a bit thinner.
- Yes, Chef.

950
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:36,305
It's ready to be plated, so Cook Maeng…

951
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:37,514
- Excuse me?
- Sorry.

952
01:14:38,182 --> 01:14:40,684
Chef Maeng, please prepare the garnish
for the bourguignon.

953
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:41,727
Yes, Chef.

954
01:14:50,861 --> 01:14:52,863
- Dessert for table seven.
- Yes, Chef.

955
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:55,657
Chef.

956
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:58,160
The guest at table seven
said it tasted bad.

957
01:14:58,243 --> 01:15:01,079
He says the meat is dry
and wants it remade.

958
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:03,999
What? He didn't even touch the food.

959
01:15:05,709 --> 01:15:06,877
I'll serve him.

960
01:15:11,965 --> 01:15:14,009
It has a great finish.

961
01:15:16,845 --> 01:15:17,930
Hello.

962
01:15:18,013 --> 01:15:20,432
I'm Yeon Ji-young, the head chef at Enfin.

963
01:15:22,476 --> 01:15:24,937
<i>He looks exactly like Im Song-jae.</i>

964
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:26,605
And why are you here?

965
01:15:27,856 --> 01:15:29,441
<i>He's nitpicking here too?</i>

966
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:31,109
Well…

967
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:32,903
You asked us to remake the short ribs

968
01:15:32,986 --> 01:15:35,280
braised in wild grape rice wine
and <i>ogolgye samgyetang</i>.

969
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:38,242
Is there a problem with the food?

970
01:15:38,742 --> 01:15:41,203
I see you didn't understand
because I was being indirect.

971
01:15:41,745 --> 01:15:43,580
You called it modern cuisine
that holds the essence of nature.

972
01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:45,624
I couldn't feel the nature you spoke of.

973
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:48,252
<i>He's nitpicking over nothing.</i>

974
01:15:48,835 --> 01:15:52,130
They say it's impossible
to stop a human from lying.

975
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:56,760
You didn't even touch the food.

976
01:15:56,843 --> 01:15:59,596
Are you saying I'm lying
without tasting anything?

977
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:00,639
I have to say,

978
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:03,475
that's quite an impressive way
to avoid evaluation.

979
01:16:04,101 --> 01:16:06,478
You shouldn't cook if you lack the skill.

980
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:08,105
Are you even with Michelin?

981
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:11,149
How can someone like you be a judge?

982
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:12,150
What did you say?

983
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:14,027
You're crossing the line.

984
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:16,905
How can someone like you be a chef?

985
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:20,158
You know what?
I'll give you a proper evaluation today.

986
01:16:20,742 --> 01:16:22,035
Blame your cooking.

987
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:23,078
What?

988
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:25,163
If what you say is true…

989
01:16:30,168 --> 01:16:31,587
I will try it myself.

990
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:49,062
Who are you?

991
01:16:50,355 --> 01:16:52,316
What? "You"?

992
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:56,320
Do you wish to be struck down
with a sword?

993
01:16:56,903 --> 01:16:57,738
A sword?

994
01:16:58,322 --> 01:17:00,824
Is he crazy? Why does he talk like that?

995
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:04,661
- What?
- Sir.

996
01:17:04,745 --> 01:17:07,331
Let me take you to our suite.

997
01:17:07,414 --> 01:17:08,415
Let go of me.

998
01:17:08,498 --> 01:17:09,499
Consider this your lucky day!

999
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:11,501
- How dare you!
- Come with me.

1000
01:17:11,585 --> 01:17:12,878
- A suite?
- Yes.

1001
01:17:17,215 --> 01:17:18,091
Your Majesty.

1002
01:17:24,181 --> 01:17:25,140
Is it…

1003
01:17:26,433 --> 01:17:27,517
really you?

1004
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:29,519
I came to keep my promise.

1005
01:17:29,603 --> 01:17:31,897
My promise to find you.

1006
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:39,988
Look at you, acting all cool.

1007
01:17:42,282 --> 01:17:43,575
What about your <i>seoksura, </i>evening meal?

1008
01:17:44,201 --> 01:17:46,453
How could I enjoy it without you?

1009
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:48,664
Come and taste it.

1010
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:12,497
EPILOGUE

1011
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:34,811
- Hey.
<i>- Chef Yeon.</i>

1012
01:19:34,895 --> 01:19:37,564
The Michelin guy really was a fraud.

1013
01:19:37,647 --> 01:19:39,941
- What?
<i>- I called the police, and they took him.</i>

1014
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:41,318
I knew it.

1015
01:19:41,401 --> 01:19:43,069
What a jerk.

1016
01:19:43,153 --> 01:19:45,530
He deserves to pay
for messing around with food.

1017
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:46,656
Cook Yeon.

1018
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:48,325
I'm coming.

1019
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:51,286
All right, I'll see you tomorrow.

1020
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:54,915
Thank you for cooking.

1021
01:19:56,666 --> 01:19:59,085
My goodness, what's with all this mess?

1022
01:20:00,045 --> 01:20:01,296
Come and sit down.

1023
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:09,846
It's just bibimbap.

1024
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:11,431
"Just"?

1025
01:20:12,557 --> 01:20:14,226
It is a royal bibinbap

1026
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:16,603
that I, the king of Joseon,
made for the first time.

1027
01:20:16,686 --> 01:20:17,854
It is called <i>hwanseban</i>.

1028
01:20:17,938 --> 01:20:18,772
Right.

1029
01:20:18,855 --> 01:20:20,524
Do not eat if you do not want to.

1030
01:20:20,607 --> 01:20:22,567
No. I will eat it.

1031
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:25,028
Thank you.

1032
01:20:25,612 --> 01:20:26,613
Then…

1033
01:20:29,741 --> 01:20:31,493
Open up.

1034
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:38,667
Does it

1035
01:20:39,626 --> 01:20:40,460
taste good?

1036
01:20:41,294 --> 01:20:43,505
It needs some brown butter.

1037
01:20:43,588 --> 01:20:45,549
<i>"Blown batter"?</i>

1038
01:20:45,632 --> 01:20:47,676
<i>This is called beurre noisette.</i>

1039
01:20:47,759 --> 01:20:49,719
<i>You melt butter as if you're burning it.</i>

1040
01:20:49,803 --> 01:20:51,888
<i>This is such a fascinating brazier.</i>

1041
01:20:51,972 --> 01:20:54,224
<i>Shouldn't you change the way you talk?</i>

1042
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:56,142
<i>How should I do that?</i>

1043
01:20:57,894 --> 01:20:59,396
<i>It's hard to believe,</i>

1044
01:20:59,479 --> 01:21:01,982
<i>but he's from the 1500s.</i>

1045
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:05,235
<i>By the way, how did you find me?</i>

1046
01:21:06,444 --> 01:21:07,654
<i>Well…</i>

1047
01:21:07,737 --> 01:21:09,072
<i>How did he get here?</i>

1048
01:21:09,155 --> 01:21:10,448
<i>That is a secret.</i>

1049
01:21:10,949 --> 01:21:12,325
<i>That's not important.</i>

1050
01:21:12,826 --> 01:21:15,412
<i>Because we're together again.</i>

1051
01:21:33,513 --> 01:21:36,433
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

1052
