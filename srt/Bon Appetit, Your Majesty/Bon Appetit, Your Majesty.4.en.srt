1
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:49,966
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

2
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,762
<i>Being a tyrant's chef</i>

3
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:56,681
<i>means risking my life</i>
<i>on consecutive tests.</i>

4
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:01,144
<i>The situation calls for it</i>
<i>against my will.</i>

5
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,812
YI HEON
KING OF JOSEON

6
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:14,783
Your Royal Highness,
please reveal the theme.

7
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:17,035
GRAND ROYAL QUEEN DOWAGER INJU
YI HEON'S GRANDMOTHER

8
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,245
QUEEN DOWAGER JAHYEON
YI HEON'S STEPMOTHER

9
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,042
KANG MOK-JU
FOURTH JUNIOR CONSORT, YI HEON'S CONCUBINE

10
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,346
MAENG MAN-SU
EIGHTH-RANK SENIOR COOK

11
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,931
EOM BONG-SIK
SEVENTH-RANK SENIOR COOK

12
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,259
What letter is that?

13
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,012
<i>That's cursive.</i>

14
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,139
<i>What does that say?</i>

15
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:20,807
<i>Yi?</i>

16
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:21,891
<i>Filial piety?</i>

17
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,853
The theme of the competition is…

18
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:26,354
filial piety.

19
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,150
<i>Right. It can't be the family name, Yi.</i>

20
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:35,446
The food you will prepare
for this competition

21
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,074
should incorporate
the spirit of filial piety.

22
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,326
The ingredients must include

23
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:44,330
tofu and <i>doenjang, </i>soybean paste<i>.</i>

24
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:46,749
You will have

25
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,335
two hours.

26
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,298
Now, you may begin.

27
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,018
THE COMPETITION BEGINS

28
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,730
The current time is<i> osibangak</i>.

29
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:09,856
OSIBANGAK: AROUND NOON

30
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,071
FILIAL PIETY

31
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:22,869
<i>I won't stand a chance</i>
<i>if I cook a traditional palace dish.</i>

32
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,704
<i>Focus.</i>

33
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:29,417
<i>Tofu and </i>doenjang<i>…</i>

34
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,628
<i>Daddy made something new for you.</i>

35
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,421
<i>What's this?</i>

36
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,758
<i>- Ever heard of </i>doenjang<i> pasta?</i>
<i>- </i>Doenjang<i> pasta?</i>

37
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,217
<i>It's so good, Dad.</i>

38
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,470
<i>Is it? Eat up.</i>

39
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:42,847
<i>That's it.</i>

40
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:46,935
<i>Let's make </i>doenjang<i> pasta</i>
<i>that Dad often made for me.</i>

41
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:50,647
<i>I'm sure the Grand Royal Queen Dowager</i>
<i>will like it.</i>

42
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:57,028
Gwinyeo.<i> Do not make a mistake.</i>

43
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,197
<i>There will be no mercy.</i>

44
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,158
<i>What's with that smirk?</i>

45
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,494
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

46
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:18,758
<i>The key to making good food</i>
<i>is using good ingredients.</i>

47
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,679
<i>There's no way I'll lose.</i>

48
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,723
My goodness.

49
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:32,021
Your Majesty, you must be disappointed.

50
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:36,109
You seem to have grown quite close
to the <i>gwinyeo</i> cook.

51
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,570
Grandmother.

52
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,698
They say you can only know
the depth of water by crossing it,

53
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,908
and that you can only know a person
by befriending them.

54
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:48,746
It is too early to assume
who will become the winner.

55
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,790
But you should know, Your Majesty,

56
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:54,752
I have been feeling rather tired lately

57
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,170
and have lost my appetite.

58
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,506
You are known to be sensitive

59
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:01,009
and lack appetite,

60
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,219
and yet you say you are tired
and have no appetite?

61
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,764
That makes this competition
much more interesting.

62
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:12,145
I look forward to seeing
if the new chief royal cook

63
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,024
can do well
and restore your lost appetite.

64
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,863
<i>She and her skills even dissuaded me</i>

65
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,906
<i>from taking her life.</i>

66
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,576
We will soon find out.

67
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,204
<i>We shall see</i>

68
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,041
<i>if things go your way.</i>

69
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:36,461
<i>Your Majesty, what I wish to cut today</i>

70
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,463
<i>is not the</i> gwinyeo<i>'s arm.</i>

71
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,759
<i>It is your heart that is drawn to her.</i>

72
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:48,848
COURSE N° 4 **** AND SPINACH DOENJANG SOUP

73
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,456
They took everything?

74
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,336
No, give me that.

75
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:19,253
Tofu.

76
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,176
Oh no. They're all smashed.

77
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:28,763
Are you serious?

78
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,306
I can't believe those people.

79
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,644
I have won.

80
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,313
<i>When it comes to gray mullet,</i>

81
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:39,524
<i>the ones with a white coat over their eyes</i>
<i>tend to be the tastiest.</i>

82
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,818
Come on, can you not even catch that?

83
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:44,487
Come here!

84
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,796
I don't mind that the tofu is crushed,

85
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,507
but I don't have enough<i> doenjang</i>
for anything.

86
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,343
What do I do?

87
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,180
They're so nasty.

88
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,391
What do I do?

89
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,979
This is spinach.

90
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,188
It's really fresh.

91
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:20,773
<i>Then again,</i>

92
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,734
<i>spinach was introduced</i>
<i>in late-Goryeo and early-Joseon,</i>

93
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,695
<i>so it makes sense that they have some.</i>

94
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:26,654
Right.

95
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:30,700
<i>Spinach is good for bones and anemia,</i>

96
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,702
<i>so it's perfect for her,</i>
<i>considering her health condition.</i>

97
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,245
Let's add spinach pesto.

98
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,789
Okay, spinach.

99
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,416
Why are you still here?

100
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:39,709
Mister Eunuch Yoon.

101
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,961
The other cooks already got
all the ingredients they needed

102
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,255
and returned to the yard of the
Grand Royal Queen Dowager's quarters.

103
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:47,383
- Could I get some <i>doenjang</i>?
- <i>Doenjang</i>?

104
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,927
They must have some in the pot
in Saongwon, Office of Royal Meals.

105
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:53,431
The other cooks took everything,
so it's empty.

106
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,600
Oh dear. What to do about that?

107
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,311
That is all the <i>jeolmi doenjang</i>
we have left.

108
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,271
So that was the <i>doenjang</i>
made with black soybeans.

109
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:03,649
No wonder it was deep,
rich, and flavorful.

110
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,151
What should I do now?

111
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,904
The quality of <i>doenjang</i>
decides the outcome of the dish.

112
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,322
It is not <i>jeolmi doenjang</i>,

113
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,908
but we have some three-year-old <i>doenjang</i>
in the backyard.

114
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,284
Follow me.

115
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,036
Do you really?

116
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,078
Thank you!

117
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,622
Thank you, mister.

118
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,166
<i>A cooking competition?</i>

119
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,710
All sorts of petitions
and impertinent remarks

120
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:26,214
have been going about the palace,
which in itself is a disgrace,

121
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:29,050
so it seems
Her Royal Highness decided to step in.

122
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,427
I understand her intentions,

123
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:35,056
but do we have the leisure
to wait for the result of a competition?

124
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:38,434
Even if the lowly wench were to win,

125
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,603
we must not accept the <i>gwinyeo</i>

126
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,563
becoming the chief royal cook.

127
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,774
You are frustratingly shortsighted.

128
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:48,152
His Majesty will not step back.

129
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,655
- How about we--
- Oh my goodness!

130
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,698
Oh dear.

131
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,992
I apologize.

132
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,036
My hands are so weak.

133
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:58,913
Do not worry about it.

134
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,873
- It is fine, Your Highness.
- Goodness me.

135
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,667
Your Highness.

136
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,920
Please share your insight with us.

137
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,841
Poop.

138
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,469
I must go empty my bowels.

139
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,513
Where is the outhouse?

140
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:18,266
- Your Highness, are you all right?
- No.

141
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,934
The outhouse. I cannot wait.

142
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,310
- Where is it?
- Come with me.

143
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,729
- Oh dear. Let us go.
- Be gentle.

144
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,481
It has come out. Oh good lord.

145
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,026
- Walk slowly.
- Do not touch me!

146
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,454
Cook Maeng.

147
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,706
Is it <i>eomandu</i> you are making?

148
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,792
You may have learned
to cook in Waegwan, a Japanese village,

149
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,420
but you should know that
if the fish slices are not uniform,

150
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,298
the part that is wrapped
with the thinner slices will burst

151
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,175
when you steam them.

152
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,594
You are in no position to worry about me.

153
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,680
I see you are preparing <i>yeonpotang</i>.

154
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,683
You should carefully watch
how long you cook the tofu.

155
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:46,145
I will take this opportunity to show you

156
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,647
what I learned in Sichuan.

157
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:20,096
<i>Relax, Yeon Ji-young. You can do this.</i>

158
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,524
It seems the <i>gwinyeo</i> cook made a dough.

159
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,693
Could she be making noodles?

160
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:18,904
That is too simple a dish
for a competition.

161
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:23,075
She is blanching a strange vegetable.

162
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,369
I have never seen that in my life.

163
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,871
First Junior Consort Sung.

164
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,581
Do you not even know spinage?

165
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,792
It makes sense that you do not know
since you have never done any chores.

166
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,711
Is that called spinage?

167
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,589
But that is a <i>muknamul</i>
meant to be dried before eating.

168
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,507
MUKNAMUL: VEGETABLES MEANT TO BE DRIED
AND STORED FOR LATER CONSUMPTION

169
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,343
And now she is crushing it
with something else.

170
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,096
Is she ignorant or just brave?

171
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,266
It looks like the <i>gwinyeo</i>
will lose an arm today.

172
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,560
She will be crying out in pain soon.

173
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:51,103
Will you be quiet?

174
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,354
- Yes, Your Royal Highness.
- Yes, Your Royal Highness.

175
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,191
What could she be cooking?

176
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:59,069
The <i>gwinyeo</i> seems to lack in many ways
compared to the other cooks.

177
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:03,532
Cook Maeng seems to be making<i> eomandu</i>

178
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,451
Her Royal Highness praised
at the last banquet.

179
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:10,080
It looks like Cook Eom is making
his famous <i>yeonpotang</i>.

180
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,999
Just watching them
makes me feel hungry already.

181
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,711
<i>Eomandu</i> and <i>yeonpotang</i>.

182
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,380
I look forward to tasting them.

183
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,216
What about you, Your Majesty?

184
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,384
I am not so sure.

185
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:23,886
No matter how good they are,

186
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,263
we already know what they taste like.

187
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,184
You still seem to have great hope

188
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:33,437
about what the <i>gwinyeo</i> cook will make.

189
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,355
Indeed.

190
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:37,608
The chief royal cook's dishes
left me in awe every time.

191
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:40,778
I cannot wait to find out

192
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,115
if I will also taste what you tasted

193
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,742
and be left in awe.

194
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,370
You should feel it for yourself.

195
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,081
Lips may tell lies,

196
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,543
but the tip of a tongue
only tells the truth.

197
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:23,487
Doenjang<i> soup carries a personal meaning</i>
<i>to Her Royal Highness,</i>

198
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:24,822
<i>so she often asks for it.</i>

199
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,533
A refreshing savory flavor?

200
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,411
She has always had a small appetite
since she was a child.

201
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:31,787
From what I heard,

202
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,622
she could not eat at all
on the day she entered the palace

203
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,000
because she cried so much
at the thought of leaving her parents.

204
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,127
So she has a small appetite.

205
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,546
I heard that the last food
her mother made for her

206
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,258
was soup made with <i>doenjang</i>
from the region near the Seomjin River.

207
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,635
Her mother mixed rice in the soup,

208
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,555
and she said the soup
she tasted then was excellent

209
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:52,016
and has been missing it ever since.

210
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:56,270
I believe she said
it had a refreshing savory flavor.

211
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:57,897
What then?

212
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,650
The cooks did their best
to replicate that flavor in their soups,

213
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,278
but she always said
it did not taste right.

214
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,780
<i>What do I do?</i>

215
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,533
<i>What gave the refreshing savory flavor</i>

216
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:12,244
<i>that the Grand Royal Queen Dowager misses?</i>

217
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:16,540
<i>Did she just feel that way because it was</i>
<i>the last meal her mother made for her?</i>

218
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,128
<i>I don't think </i>doenjang<i> pasta</i>
<i>will be good enough.</i>

219
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:23,964
Miss.

220
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,842
What are you doing
with your mind elsewhere?

221
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,761
You need to concentrate.

222
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,310
The broth smells fantastic.

223
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,354
It is time to chop some green onions.

224
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:43,108
Oh dear. Did I use them up already?

225
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,404
Cook Maeng, lend me some green onions.

226
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,783
I put too much in my broth, you see.

227
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,953
Why are you not answering me?
Do you not hear me?

228
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,038
Oh, come on.

229
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,874
I asked you for some green onions.

230
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,377
This is an official competition.

231
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,922
Not preparing enough ingredients
is also a good reason for elimination.

232
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,966
There can only be one chief royal cook.

233
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,051
I did not take you
for that kind of person,

234
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,302
but you are so heartless.

235
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,225
<i>A refreshing savory flavor.</i>

236
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,394
<i>How did she make such a flavor?</i>

237
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,895
<i>What do I need to…</i>

238
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,147
What are you doing?

239
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,482
Let go!

240
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,067
Why, you!

241
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,622
How could you?

242
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,335
Jeez, they're fighting
at a time like this?

243
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,940
A refreshing savory flavor.

244
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,192
That's it.

245
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,655
I have enough to make the broth.

246
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,414
- What are you doing?
- Just a moment.

247
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,249
Where are you running off to
during the competition?

248
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,626
Just let me get something really quick!

249
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:30,799
I need to get more ingredients.
It won't take long!

250
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:31,842
Bring her here.

251
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,635
But… Please.

252
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:35,846
Oh, come on.

253
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:42,895
What is the matter?

254
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,733
I would like to get one more ingredient.
Could you please allow it?

255
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,693
What nonsense is this?

256
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,528
Return to your station this instant.

257
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:53,489
I apologize.

258
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,949
- But--
- What is the ingredient that you need?

259
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,870
- It is--
- If I may interject,

260
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:02,206
this cannot be allowed, Your Majesty.

261
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,252
We do not yet know
what the other cooks will present.

262
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:10,631
However, now that their dishes
are starting to take shape,

263
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,800
she wants to add an ingredient midway?

264
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:16,512
She must have realized
that she is no match for the other cooks

265
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,139
and is trying to change
what she is making.

266
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,850
The rule was to complete the dish
within the given time.

267
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,019
No one said anything about
not being able to use more ingredients.

268
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,438
Even if that were the case,

269
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,900
you have seen enough to know
what the other cooks are making.

270
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:33,987
It would not be fair to allow
the <i>gwinyeo</i> cook to add more ingredients.

271
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,537
It's true that I changed my mind
about my dish,

272
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,414
but it's not for the reason you speak of.

273
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:49,002
Changing your dish midway
is not at all easy.

274
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,131
There's no time!

275
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,050
That is your situation and your problem.

276
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,051
Grandmother.

277
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:59,805
As Consort Kang said, it is unfair,

278
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,056
but as the chief royal cook said,

279
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,809
there were no rules against
using more ingredients either.

280
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,063
So why not allow her
to use another ingredient,

281
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,399
and if she still loses,

282
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,778
we cut off both her arms?

283
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,158
<i>You crazy bastard.</i>

284
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,076
<i>Keep your mouth shut.</i>

285
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,579
<i>Man, he's really pissing me off.</i>

286
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,415
That is truly a great idea, Your Majesty.

287
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,336
Very well then.

288
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,589
However, as Consort Kang said,

289
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,550
if this turns out to be a trick
on His Majesty and me,

290
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,969
you must be prepared to give up your life.

291
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:41,597
Okay.

292
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:43,765
I understand.

293
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,812
<i>Ma'am, whether it's my arms or head,</i>

294
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,273
<i>it would be the end for me anyway.</i>

295
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,410
I really don't have much time left.

296
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,331
I can't finish in time if I leave now.

297
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,002
Gil-geum.

298
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,254
SEO GIL-GEUM
GIRL WITH HEIGHTENED SENSE OF SMELL

299
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,964
- Trust me.
- Thanks.

300
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,646
CHU-WOL
INSPECTOR COURT LADY

301
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:56,046
<i>This is the only way to beat</i>
<i>their </i>jeolmi doenjang<i>.</i>

302
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,006
<i>I need to add a smoky flavor.</i>

303
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,595
What is with that obnoxious antic?

304
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,681
What a crude act.

305
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,717
What is she doing to the tofu?

306
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,844
Did she just put it in oil?

307
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,598
Just you wait, miss.

308
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,489
<i>Miss…</i>

309
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:18,170
<i>What's taking Gil-geum so long?</i>

310
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,432
- Cook Maeng does not disappoint.
- Great.

311
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,893
I cannot wait to taste his <i>eomandu</i>.

312
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:39,191
Cook Eom's <i>yeonpotang</i>
looks marvelous as well.

313
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:43,528
It looks like a small banquet
is happening around the bowl.

314
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,489
It certainly does.

315
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:57,042
Did she just put fresh spinage
into the hot broth?

316
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:59,169
It is simply absurd
to put <i>muknamul </i>in soup.

317
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,420
What did you say?

318
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:03,381
She put spinage in the <i>doenjang</i> soup?

319
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:09,346
<i>Is this a new dish,</i>
<i>or have you lost your mind, Cook Yeon?</i>

320
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,473
<i>You must have my grandmother</i>

321
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:14,184
<i>taste the exquisite flavors</i>
<i>of your dishes.</i>

322
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:23,610
<i>Please, Gil-geum.</i>

323
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,112
<i>I need you here now.</i>

324
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,330
Miss.

325
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:38,625
Gil-geum!

326
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:42,921
Gil-geum!

327
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,173
I know I am late.

328
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,217
- I am sorry.
- What happened?

329
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:48,844
Is that blood on your head?

330
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,054
I will explain later.

331
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,597
Hurry up and take this.

332
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:53,932
Thank you, Gil-geum.

333
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,725
Now go.

334
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,687
Do not act recklessly, all right?

335
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,778
<i>Perfect. I can use them right away.</i>

336
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:17,330
What did the <i>gwinyeo</i> cook put in the pot?

337
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:19,833
That is…

338
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:23,253
I am afraid I do not know what that is.

339
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:24,713
You do not know?

340
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:28,592
Earlier on, she added spinage to the soup.

341
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:31,178
Did this kind of cooking method exist?

342
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:34,097
It is clearly <i>doenjang</i> soup,

343
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,516
but she is making it
in a way I have never seen before.

344
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,853
This is so very bizarre.

345
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,064
What if we all fall ill
after tasting that?

346
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:47,319
Can spinage cause an illness
when consumed improperly?

347
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:48,486
Unfortunately,

348
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,573
I have never seen it
boiled or seasoned in such a manner

349
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,700
that I cannot say for certain.

350
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:54,701
What?

351
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,578
How are we to eat something like that?

352
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,497
Shall I tell her to stop cooking?

353
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:04,544
Are you insulting my authority?

354
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:07,756
I ordered a competition
for the position of the chief royal cook.

355
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,717
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.
I implore you.

356
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,637
- I have committed a grave sin.
- Your Majesty.

357
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,765
Her words were merely based on the rules.

358
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,392
She would not dare to insult you.

359
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,311
Do not be so angry.

360
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,354
The rules?

361
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,946
Did you just say "the rules"?

362
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:34,157
This competition was held
because you doubted

363
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,909
the chief royal cook's skills
in the first place.

364
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,452
In other words,

365
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:39,788
you doubted the sanity and authority

366
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:43,250
of the king who appointed her.

367
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,085
- Your Majesty.
- However, I agreed to the competition

368
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:49,381
because I understood everyone's concern,
as this was unprecedented.

369
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:50,632
If you were to stop the competition

370
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:53,677
even before trying the food,
using rules as an excuse,

371
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,845
just because Cook Yeon
is making something you do not recognize,

372
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:58,848
how would that make me look
when I issued a royal command

373
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:01,226
for them to compete
for the position of the chief royal cook?

374
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:04,104
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

375
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,397
You are right,

376
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,942
and there is no law forbidding her
from becoming the chief royal cook.

377
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,277
All I wish

378
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,905
is that this does not become
a disruptive precedent.

379
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,866
I see very clearly how you feel,

380
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:21,538
so all that is left is to taste the food
and then decide.

381
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,040
<i>This competition</i>

382
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:27,794
<i>was planned with the sole purpose</i>
<i>of getting rid of the chief royal cook.</i>

383
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,379
<i>Do not think that I am not aware of that.</i>

384
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:33,550
<i>Do finish on time.</i>

385
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,218
<i>Please.</i>

386
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,554
All hands off.

387
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:28,980
<i>Cook Yeon.</i>

388
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,399
<i>It is down to the taste now.</i>

389
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,069
<i>Will you officially become my cook,</i>

390
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,988
<i>or will your life end now?</i>

391
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:52,921
EOMANDU: A JOSEON ROYAL COURT DISH
OF STEAMED DUMPLINGS

392
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,632
WITH THIN SLICES OF FISH
USED AS THE DUMPLING SKIN

393
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:45,724
It is moist and tender.

394
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:50,228
How is it so moist,
unlike most other dumplings?

395
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,647
Your Royal Highness, the secret to that

396
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,358
is the wrapping made with
gray mullet flesh sliced thinly enough

397
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:57,527
<i>that you can see through it.</i>

398
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,904
This <i>eomandu</i> is incredibly tender.

399
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:05,118
Wrapping made with gray mullet flesh
coated with starch flour.

400
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:07,620
<i>The stuffing made with finely minced beef,</i>

401
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:09,789
<i>stir-fried cucumber,</i>
<i>mung bean sprouts, and tofu</i>

402
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,333
<i>comes together and bursts out at once,</i>

403
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,002
flooding the mouth with flavor.

404
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,213
I am always in awe
of His Majesty's sense of taste.

405
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:21,259
The <i>eomandu</i> was so delicious.
I am lost for words.

406
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:22,510
It is delicious.

407
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,137
However…

408
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,975
I do not taste the <i>doenjang</i>.

409
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,147
I mixed some <i>doenjang</i>
with vinegar and honey

410
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,274
to make the dipping sauce.

411
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:39,652
The dipping sauce.

412
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:54,793
The <i>doenjang</i> does shine through.

413
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,086
Still, it is a shame

414
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,756
that you used it only for the sauce.

415
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,468
I am enamored by the texture of the fish

416
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,929
that melts away
the moment it touches my tongue.

417
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:09,057
Every ingredient in the stuffing
retained its moisture

418
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,935
while it was cooked to perfection.

419
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,853
That is very true.

420
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:17,732
It is an ideal food
for someone my age to enjoy.

421
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,484
I thank you for your generous praise.

422
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,655
So, how would you say

423
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:25,824
this dish speaks of filial piety?

424
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:29,327
His Majesty is the father figure
of all his subjects.

425
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,997
His people sent ingredients from all over
as a child would to a parent,

426
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,791
and with that,

427
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:37,502
I have prepared a dish for you,
Your Royal Highness.

428
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,838
If that were not
the pinnacle of filial piety,

429
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,881
I would not know what is.

430
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,759
That is a sensible answer.

431
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,636
It is a wise answer.

432
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,722
If it is as you say,

433
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:52,433
that would apply to all the dishes
in the palace since they are made

434
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,602
with ingredients received as tribute.

435
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:10,368
YEONPOTANG: A JOSEON ROYAL COURT DISH

436
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:13,872
OF CLEAR SOUP
WITH TOFU COOKED IN THE BROTH

437
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:16,457
Is this not tofu <i>yeonpotang</i>?

438
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,002
It is, Your Royal Highness.

439
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:22,338
I remembered how much you enjoyed it
at the last banquet,

440
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,173
and I did my best today.

441
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,619
It has a very clean taste.

442
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:56,539
Is there a particular reason
the pan-fried tofu has such a clean taste?

443
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:59,417
Instead of using beef for the stuffing,

444
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,711
<i>I used minced chicken,</i>
<i>which makes it less greasy.</i>

445
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:04,130
That is why it is lighter and cleaner
to the taste.

446
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:07,258
How did you cook the pan-fried tofu?

447
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,385
I cooked the sliced tofu on a griddle,

448
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:12,221
<i>then tied them with water parsley</i>
<i>for the added fragrance.</i>

449
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:14,682
<i>I then cooked it in chicken broth</i>

450
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,185
mixed with <i>jeolmi doenjang</i>
to add depth to the flavor.

451
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:20,980
That is why the pan-fried tofu
and the soup paired well together.

452
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,650
The aroma of the various rare mushrooms
was also delectable.

453
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,735
I am eternally honored, Your Majesty.

454
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,695
<i>I enhanced the flavor</i>

455
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,656
<i>by using Pyogo mushrooms from Jinan</i>
<i>and caterpillar fungus,</i>

456
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,699
which is good for boosting one's energy.

457
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:37,538
What is the filial piety
that your <i>yeonpotang </i>represents?

458
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,415
According to the ancient Chinese book,
<i>Myeongsim Bogam</i>,

459
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:42,085
everything is accomplished
when a household is harmonious,

460
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:45,755
and the parents are filled with joy
when the children are filial.

461
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:48,174
I prepared this dish

462
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:50,969
hoping that all the descendants
of the royal family

463
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,971
could gather round
and eat this warm meal together.

464
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,974
This is a warm dish
that parents and children

465
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,935
could sit around together and share.

466
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,812
Yes, that is true.

467
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:03,648
I am reminded of your banquet,
Your Royal Highness.

468
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:07,110
This time,
the pan-fried tofu tasted better.

469
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:09,112
It has an even richer flavor.

470
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,617
Are you saying

471
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:18,788
that extravagant dish
represents a child's love for a parent?

472
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:23,126
Yes. That is so, Your Majesty.

473
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:45,898
Just soup?

474
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:49,610
<i>Is he an ally or an enemy?</i>

475
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,612
What were you thinking

476
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,948
when you made this?

477
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:58,911
This is a special <i>doenjang</i> soup for you,
Your Royal Highness.

478
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:01,414
Please taste it.

479
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:38,576
<i>What's with those looks?</i>

480
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,953
<i>Does it taste good or bad?</i>

481
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,791
<i>It is a refreshing savory flavor.</i>

482
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:48,127
<i>It is amazing</i>
<i>that she thought to add this.</i>

483
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:51,047
<i>Wait, did he figure out what I used?</i>

484
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,509
<i>He really does have</i>
<i>an absolute sense of taste.</i>

485
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:16,114
So, what filial piety
does your food speak of?

486
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:20,243
This dish represents
filial piety in many ways.

487
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:22,787
First, the <i>doenjang</i> soup,
made with stir-fried <i>doenjang</i>,

488
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,665
<i>that has a deep flavor</i>
<i>that calls to mind a mother's cooking.</i>

489
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:30,044
Second, the deep-fried tofu
that enhances the flavor of the tofu.

490
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:33,339
- Inside--
- Stop rambling and get to the point.

491
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:35,383
Or I will have
your arm cut off this instant!

492
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:36,425
Enough.

493
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,389
This food…

494
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:47,854
represents filial piety.

495
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,087
<i>Thank goodness she's eating it.</i>

496
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,840
<i>What a relief.</i>

497
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,221
<i>No, Mother.</i>

498
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:25,266
<i>I do not want to eat. I just want to go.</i>

499
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,852
<i>If you do not eat anything,</i>

500
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:31,689
<i>the journey to the palace</i>
<i>will exhaust you.</i>

501
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:34,108
I really do not want to eat.

502
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:37,987
<i>I sent someone</i>
<i>all the way to the Seomjin River</i>

503
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,780
<i>to procure this </i>doenjang<i>.</i>

504
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:43,659
<i>I will rarely get to see you</i>
<i>once you enter the palace.</i>

505
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,913
<i>Please, just have a bite.</i>

506
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,320
<i>How mysterious.</i>

507
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,615
<i>How was she able to create this taste?</i>

508
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:27,703
<i>I hoped to scold her</i>
<i>with a lecture on filial piety.</i>

509
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:29,747
<i>Instead, she has served me a dish</i>

510
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:32,541
<i>that questions the very meaning of it.</i>

511
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,544
The ingredient…

512
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,257
The last ingredient you added.

513
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,218
What was it?

514
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,137
They were clams.

515
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:53,312
<i>Nothing beats clams</i>
<i>when making a refreshing broth.</i>

516
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,273
<i>In Joseon,</i>

517
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:58,276
<i>only people living by the Seomjin</i>
<i>or Nakdong River could eat them.</i>

518
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,611
The clean taste of the clams

519
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:04,824
the chief royal cook added
by putting both of her arms on the line

520
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,702
has enhanced
the refreshing flavor of the soup.

521
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,499
<i>Nicely said, my tyrant.</i>

522
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,295
<i>That little wench.</i>

523
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:20,673
<i>So that is how she has been</i>
<i>seducing His Majesty.</i>

524
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:22,925
By clams,

525
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:27,221
do you mean the small shellfish
that are used in regular shellfish soup?

526
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,181
Yes, that's right.

527
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:32,643
That's the secret
to the refreshing savory flavor

528
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,729
that you've searched for your whole life.

529
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:39,692
The last bowl of <i>doenjang</i> soup
your mother made you

530
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:43,487
<i>would've tasted of clams</i>
<i>from the Seomjin River.</i>

531
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:48,242
I included that refreshing flavor
in my <i>doenjang </i>soup.

532
00:38:58,294 --> 00:38:59,211
However,

533
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,506
this is the first time
I am trying it like this.

534
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:07,261
Where did you get the idea
to add spinage to <i>doenjang</i> soup?

535
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:10,598
It is very tender and sweet.

536
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:13,225
<i>Wait. Why is she asking</i>
<i>something so obvious?</i>

537
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:16,937
<i>Did I just become the creator</i>
<i>of clam and spinach </i>doenjang <i>soup?</i>

538
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,566
Spinage becomes sweeter and softer

539
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:24,528
when cooked in soup,
and it goes well with <i>doenjang</i>.

540
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,655
It also tastes good,
blanched and seasoned,

541
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:27,907
<i>so I served that as a side.</i>

542
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,992
- And also--
- Also what?

543
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,328
It weighed on my mind

544
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:35,915
<i>that you were having trouble keeping</i>
<i>your balance and shaking your hands.</i>

545
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,835
Spinage is good
for bone health and anemia,

546
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:42,755
so eating it often
will benefit your health.

547
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,301
Your Royal Highness.

548
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:51,347
There's that saying we all know,
<i>sikyakdongwon</i>.

549
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,682
It means food and medicine
are of one origin.

550
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,811
Rather than with the help
of bitter medicine,

551
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:59,647
I hope you can maintain your health
with tasty food.

552
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:10,324
You are truly clever and thoughtful.

553
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,288
I will no longer

554
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,624
question who you are.

555
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,543
However,

556
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:24,505
will you make me
a dish like this again next time?

557
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:25,714
Pardon?

558
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:31,429
Yes, I will.

559
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,184
It looks like

560
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,312
we have a winner.

561
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,657
The winner of today's competition is…

562
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,292
Cook Yeon.

563
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,885
<i>I get to live.</i>

564
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,970
<i>Thank you so much!</i>

565
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:15,514
<i>Dad, I made it!</i>

566
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,310
<i>The spinage </i>doenjang<i> soup Cook Yeon made</i>

567
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:22,354
truly captured the spirit of filial piety.

568
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,315
With a method never seen before,

569
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,567
she used clams and spinage

570
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,111
and created a refreshing savory flavor

571
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,780
in a dish that also improves
one's health and energy.

572
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,576
She has truly moved me.

573
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:43,626
As of this moment,
the chief royal cook of the royal kitchen…

574
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:49,173
is Ji-young of the Yeon family.

575
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:56,347
Very well then.

576
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:59,683
- You all did very well today.
- Thank goodness.

577
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:05,689
Now…

578
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,944
The time for punishment has come.

579
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,912
Have the two cooks
who lost the competition

580
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:21,372
kneel before the straw cutters!

581
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:22,623
- What?
- Yes, Your Majesty!

582
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:23,666
Your Grace…

583
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,505
He's actually going to cut their arms?

584
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,092
Put their arms under the blade.

585
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:35,219
- Yes, Your Majesty!
- Yes, Your Majesty!

586
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:38,347
No.

587
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:39,473
No!

588
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,642
No!

589
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:44,520
<i>No.</i>

590
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,159
No! Wait, Your Majesty!

591
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:07,167
How dare you interrupt?

592
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,338
I may be out of line to say this,

593
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:14,633
but if you chop off their arms,

594
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,343
you will ruin the competition.

595
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:18,345
Is that what you want?

596
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,764
What kind of nonsense is that?

597
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,266
A deal is a deal.

598
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,478
No!

599
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:28,147
Your Majesty!

600
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:32,526
The theme of competition was filial piety.

601
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,612
Step aside while I let you.

602
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:35,571
Your Majesty.

603
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:39,867
Her Royal Highness maintained her health
thanks to the food

604
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,869
these two cooks have prepared
all this time.

605
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,954
Wouldn't it be unfilial

606
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:46,081
to cut off the arms of such cooks?

607
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,959
How brazen of you.

608
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,337
I let you live because you can cook,

609
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,881
and you dare try to lecture me?

610
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,133
Do you truly wish to die?

611
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,427
I wish to live.

612
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,679
And so must they.

613
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:03,974
Cutting the arm of a cook
is no different from killing them.

614
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:06,435
We only competed to create better dishes.

615
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:09,063
I don't understand
why we should die for it!

616
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,814
Shut your mouth!

617
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,203
Your Majesty.

618
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:27,790
Cook Yeon is right.

619
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:31,460
Forgive the other two cooks.

620
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:34,338
The fault is with me

621
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:39,051
for failing to understand your will
and intention in the first place.

622
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:43,472
The truth is,

623
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:48,060
it saddened me to see you despise deer

624
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:50,396
and find enjoyment in hunting them

625
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,774
because of the late king's
fondness for them.

626
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,277
Then I heard that Cook Yeon

627
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:00,864
had thoughtlessly served you deer meat,

628
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:04,576
which is why I came up with the theme
of filial piety to scorn her.

629
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:07,454
FILIAL PIETY

630
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:10,290
<i>Oh, so that was the story behind this?</i>

631
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:13,961
<i>He really is something else, isn't he?</i>

632
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:16,547
<i>How could he do that</i>
<i>even if he hated his father?</i>

633
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:17,840
However,

634
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:21,301
Cook Yeon,
who is now the chief royal cook,

635
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,554
has made me rethink the notion

636
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:26,765
of filial piety with her food.

637
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:31,979
I see why you value her so much.

638
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:33,522
Your Majesty.

639
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,482
How about

640
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,527
you leave it at this for today?

641
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:44,992
Still…

642
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:48,704
a competition is a competition.

643
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:52,416
We must make a clear distinction
between reward and punishment.

644
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:55,836
In that case,

645
00:45:55,919 --> 00:46:01,383
how about you have the two cooks
learn from Cook Yeon for a while,

646
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:06,513
as a means of teaching them to be filial
and loyal to the royal family?

647
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:12,561
- Spare us, Your Majesty!
- Please spare us, Your Majesty!

648
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:14,271
Your Majesty!

649
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:17,441
Your Majesty. Please.

650
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:21,570
- Have mercy, Your Majesty!
- Have mercy, Your Majesty!

651
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:27,242
- Spare me, Your Majesty!
- Spare me, Your Majesty!

652
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:30,454
- Spare me, Your Majesty!
- Spare me, Your Majesty!

653
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:31,830
<i>Please, Your Majesty.</i>

654
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:33,665
<i>- Spare me, Your Majesty!</i>
<i>- Spare me, Your Majesty!</i>

655
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:52,768
Listen carefully, you two cooks.

656
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,897
The rules of the competition
should be honored.

657
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:57,898
However,

658
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:01,401
since the new chief royal cook
and Her Royal Highness pleaded with me,

659
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,111
I will make a special exception this time

660
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:05,697
and spare your lives.

661
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:09,076
As Her Royal Highness has said,

662
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,745
the two cooks who lost

663
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:14,039
will learn how to cook from Cook Yeon
for the time being.

664
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:18,210
With that,
we will conclude this competition.

665
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,421
Take away the straw cutters.

666
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:22,756
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

667
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,516
Your Majesty.

668
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:35,936
Will you join me for some tea?

669
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:38,063
- I feel rather--
- Perhaps the <i>doenjang</i> soup

670
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,191
reminded you of someone you missed.

671
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:42,442
You seem to be

672
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:45,404
unusually generous today.

673
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:05,841
Let us go inside.

674
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:18,145
<i>Now, there should be no more complaints</i>

675
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,105
about the <i>gwinyeo</i> cook.

676
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:24,151
Did you see Consort Kang
walk off first in a huff?

677
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:26,695
She was angry
that she did not get her way.

678
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:28,113
Leave her be.

679
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,490
I no longer

680
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:34,328
have to hear her meaningless chatter
about visiting me more often.

681
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:37,205
I cannot help but mention that it seemed

682
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:41,585
His Majesty's temper suddenly flared
after the competition ended.

683
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:42,878
You are right.

684
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:47,299
It troubles my mind to think
he may know something about the incident.

685
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:48,550
If that is not the case,

686
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:50,802
His Majesty would have no reason

687
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:53,639
to be so cold toward Her Royal Highness.

688
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:55,807
Do you hear yourselves right now?

689
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:58,602
Are you not aware that you are speaking
of things that should not be spoken aloud?

690
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,688
<i>Perhaps the </i>doenjang<i> soup</i>

691
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,899
reminded you of someone you missed.

692
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:08,070
You seem to be unusually generous today.

693
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:11,823
Who is to say that is our fault?

694
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:16,411
The deposed Queen Yeon should not have
done something so disgraceful.

695
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,330
Thinking that His Majesty might know

696
00:49:18,955 --> 00:49:20,082
sends chills down my spine.

697
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,168
Should we not come up with a plan?

698
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:24,336
That is enough.

699
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:25,420
His Majesty believes

700
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:28,215
his mother passed away
due to an illness when he was young.

701
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:30,342
He does not know she was deposed
and poisoned to death.

702
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:31,843
Who knows?

703
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:35,722
He could have someone
looking into the matter in secret.

704
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:38,141
That is enough.

705
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:42,813
Even if His Majesty finds out
what happened to his mother,

706
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:44,523
what could he do?

707
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:48,485
Even if I were to go back in time,

708
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:52,364
I would make the same decision.

709
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,414
<i>I believe Her Grace Consort Kang</i>
<i>was also present.</i>

710
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:01,456
It seems that

711
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,959
the groundless rumor that you exiled
Governor Hong because of Cook Yeon

712
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:06,002
started at Jahongwon.

713
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:08,964
<i>Consort Kang set this up.</i>

714
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,216
Halt.

715
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:15,262
Chang-seon.

716
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:16,304
Yes, Your Majesty.

717
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:18,557
Where is Consort Kang?

718
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:21,435
I heard she returned to Jahongwon.

719
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:23,437
Let us head there.

720
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:35,157
Oh gosh, my legs are aching.

721
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:39,995
There's nothing easy in life.

722
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:41,747
- Don't you agree, Gil-geum?
- Yes.

723
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:45,751
I was so worried
they were going to lose an arm.

724
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:54,885
What is this for?

725
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:56,928
Well,

726
00:50:57,512 --> 00:50:59,639
thank you for what you did earlier.

727
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:02,184
I learned a thing or two
about cooking from you as well.

728
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:04,853
No need to thank me.

729
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,898
We all work hard for a living.

730
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:10,275
I'm grateful that you appreciate it.

731
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:13,779
Jeez, I'm so thirsty.

732
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:16,990
I wish someone would get me some water.

733
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:21,411
I wish

734
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:24,623
someone would get me some water.

735
00:51:39,095 --> 00:51:41,807
I acknowledge that you are
extremely lucky,

736
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:43,934
and that luck saved us all today.

737
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,645
- Yes, your luck--
- My goodness.

738
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:49,689
What a long-winded way
of saying thank you.

739
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:01,201
I'm a little hungry.

740
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:04,162
Are there any leftover <i>eomandu</i>?

741
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:06,248
<i>Eomandu</i>?

742
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:07,499
Yeah.

743
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:13,713
Are there any leftovers?

744
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:18,134
Darn it!

745
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:33,775
Goodness, Man-su.

746
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:42,826
My gosh, miss.

747
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:46,913
It really feels like you have become
the chief royal cook now. What a relief.

748
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:49,332
I think I've put the royal kitchen
in order now.

749
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:53,545
By the way, Gil-geum,
is your head injury all right?

750
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:54,504
What happened?

751
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:57,257
Well, you see…

752
00:52:57,799 --> 00:53:01,011
I was returning from Saongwon
with the ingredient you asked for

753
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:04,097
when someone suddenly hit me
and made me fall.

754
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,974
That's when I smacked my head
on the ground.

755
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:08,852
Is that true, Gil-geum?
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

756
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:09,895
Let me see.

757
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:14,649
How could I tell you when you were
in the middle of a competition?

758
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:16,985
I really am okay though.

759
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:18,737
Who was it? Did you see their face?

760
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,114
No, I did not.

761
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:24,576
<i>I held on to the clam basket</i>
<i>even as I fell down.</i>

762
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:26,745
- Who is that?
<i>- Then a man suddenly appeared</i>

763
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:30,206
<i>and shouted at the culprit,</i>
<i>so they quickly ran away.</i>

764
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:34,544
It was the handsome jester, Gong-gil.

765
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:36,463
Gong-gil?

766
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:44,596
<i>She is no ordinary woman for sure.</i>

767
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:47,724
<i>She will cause trouble one day</i>
<i>if I let her be.</i>

768
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:49,768
That wench has an ulterior motive.

769
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:52,187
She must be a spy planted by someone.

770
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:55,315
However, it is a fact
that she is a skilled cook.

771
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:57,651
His Majesty is keeping her around
for a reason.

772
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:00,028
Shall I have her kidnapped and sold?

773
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:03,198
She has luck on her side,
so do not act rashly.

774
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:07,535
I must set a trap.

775
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:09,412
A trap?

776
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:12,707
His Majesty the King has arrived.

777
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,176
What happened?

778
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:25,762
Were you worried about me?

779
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:28,139
The lengthy competition
gave me a headache,

780
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:30,517
so I left early to rest.

781
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,353
I heard you were the one
who organized the competition.

782
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:35,897
Moreover, I heard that the false rumor

783
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:38,233
that I exiled Hong Gyeong-dal
because of Cook Yeon

784
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:40,860
started right here at Jahongwon.

785
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:43,530
Your Majesty.

786
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:53,873
<i>Tell me.</i>

787
00:54:57,919 --> 00:54:58,920
Why did you do it?

788
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,674
Answer my question! Why did you do it?

789
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:06,761
Do you not know that questioning
the chief royal cook appointed by me

790
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:10,432
is no different
from questioning my authority?

791
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:11,558
This is…

792
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:15,729
not the time
for you to coddle the <i>gwinyeo</i>.

793
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:16,855
What did you say?

794
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:20,150
You used to spend sleepless nights
searching for the sworn enemy

795
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:22,068
who drove your mother to her death.

796
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,696
Have you already forgotten
what happened that day?

797
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:27,991
You said you remember
the day your mother was deposed.

798
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:30,493
You said you would avenge
her wrongful death!

799
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:31,619
Did you not?

800
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:33,496
Shut your mouth.

801
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,751
Do not dare speak of
what happened to my mother.

802
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:39,461
Not only did you bring

803
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:42,005
a woman of unknown birth
to the palace at this important time,

804
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:44,924
but you also appointed her
as the chief royal cook.

805
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,510
So how do you expect me
to just sit back and watch?

806
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:50,388
Is that why you acted
without coming to me first?

807
00:55:51,347 --> 00:55:52,348
I am

808
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:54,851
extremely disappointed in you.

809
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:56,519
Misunderstandings

810
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:59,606
start with something trivial,

811
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:02,275
but once they take root,
there is no stopping them.

812
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:04,360
Just like how the late king

813
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:06,988
came to misunderstand your mother.

814
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:08,406
Shut your mouth!

815
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:10,366
Shut…

816
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:12,118
that mouth.

817
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:17,040
<i>The sworn enemy</i>
<i>who drove your mother to her death.</i>

818
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:19,375
<i>You said you remember</i>
<i>the day your mother was deposed.</i>

819
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:21,711
<i>Just like how the late king</i>
<i>came to misunderstand your mother.</i>

820
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:24,130
<i>You said you would avenge</i>
<i>her wrongful death!</i>

821
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,090
<i>Did you not?</i>

822
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:26,299
Your Majesty.

823
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:29,177
Are you all right?

824
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:31,179
<i>Are you all right, Your Majesty?</i>

825
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:34,891
I will help you relax.

826
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:38,353
Calm down, Your Majesty.

827
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:39,604
Leave it!

828
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:40,897
Leave me alone.

829
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:49,405
Your Majesty.

830
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:52,617
Your Majesty!

831
00:57:07,423 --> 00:57:10,802
<i>The </i>gwinyeo<i> cook</i>
<i>must be something amazing indeed.</i>

832
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:13,721
To think she was recognized

833
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:16,141
by the Grand Royal Queen Dowager
in the competition.

834
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:17,851
Now I am curious

835
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,311
about the food that cook makes.

836
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:23,565
You should, of course,
taste the food one day.

837
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:25,942
His Majesty's physical examination
is next month.

838
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:30,280
How about tasting the <i>gwinyeo</i>'s food
when you dine with him then?

839
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:33,158
Yes, that is a good idea.

840
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:36,494
So, what have you found out
about the Salgoji Forest assassin?

841
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:38,997
You were right, Your Highness.

842
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,790
Director Kim Yang-son,
the older brother of Kim I-son,

843
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:43,293
whose corpse was desecrated
during the Muin Literati Purge,

844
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:46,546
had acted on his own.

845
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:51,885
I told them over and over that no one
was to act out until the right time.

846
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:54,679
Did you find the assassin?

847
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:56,806
We did, however--

848
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:57,974
Did you lose him?

849
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:02,103
<i>His face was covered with a mask,</i>

850
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:05,148
<i>but his movements</i>
<i>were as agile and swift as the wind.</i>

851
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,567
<i>He must be quite the master of his trade.</i>

852
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:15,158
Your Highness, please give me three days.

853
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:18,328
I will find him myself and end his life.

854
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:23,082
Forget it.

855
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:26,085
There is something more urgent
you must do tonight.

856
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:28,588
They are an important figure,

857
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:31,424
so be well-prepared.

858
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:37,722
I heard you proved your skills
in the competition yet again.

859
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:48,066
I will find your handybag or bundle
or whatever it is one day.

860
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:51,236
This is a great opportunity
to win over His Majesty.

861
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:56,157
His Majesty likes well-adorned women,
so embellish yourself with the jewelry.

862
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:59,619
No, wait.

863
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:01,871
What are you talking about?

864
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:04,415
- You must be mistaken.
- What do you mean?

865
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:07,210
There's no flirting or anything going on
between His Majesty and me.

866
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:09,045
- Right, Gil-geum?
- What?

867
00:59:09,128 --> 00:59:10,588
Yes, that is right.

868
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:13,967
- They are not blurting or anything.
- "Blurt"?

869
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,176
"Flirt," not "blurt."

870
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,302
- Flirt?
- Flirt.

871
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:18,096
- Yes, flirt.
- "Flirt."

872
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:19,973
What in the world are you saying?

873
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,140
What I mean is,

874
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:26,854
His Majesty doesn't fancy me
or favor me that much.

875
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:28,231
That's my point.

876
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:30,358
- Yes, that is the truth.
- You fools!

877
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:32,694
You are truly ungrateful.

878
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:37,365
Do you truly not know what His Majesty
is putting up with to protect you?

879
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:39,909
Are you talking about the competition?

880
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:45,790
It may look like he protected me,
but that wasn't all there was to it.

881
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:49,586
My cooking skills
are what convinced everyone that--

882
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:54,674
Do you honestly think you survived
with your skills alone?

883
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:56,551
What?

884
00:59:57,218 --> 00:59:59,971
Are you there, Cook Yeon?
It is time to prepare His Majesty's meal.

885
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:02,974
Understood. Please give us a moment.

886
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:05,643
- I shall visit another time.
- Wait.

887
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:07,353
You need to finish what you were saying.

888
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:08,563
What about His Majesty?

889
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:14,360
I hope that His Majesty enjoys

890
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:15,945
your blurting.

891
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:20,992
Is he kidding me right now?

892
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:22,994
Look at him blurting out nonsense.

893
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:25,413
<i>Sorry, we're late.</i>

894
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:27,081
We apologize for that.

895
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:32,629
This is going to be the first royal meal
that I prepare as the chief royal cook.

896
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:34,547
Please follow my instructions.

897
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,591
First, Cook Eom--

898
01:00:36,674 --> 01:00:37,800
Everyone.

899
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:40,219
Eunuch Yoon.

900
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:43,556
I have bad news.

901
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,809
His Majesty had a fit at Jahongwon,

902
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:49,604
and he just retired to his chambers.

903
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:51,689
- Pardon?
- He still has fits?

904
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:54,192
He seems to have calmed down for now,

905
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:56,903
but he returned to his chambers
in an extremely sensitive state.

906
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:02,158
It is possible that someone could die
serving tonight's meal.

907
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:07,246
Be sure to double
and triple-check everything

908
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,248
until the very end.

909
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:11,167
- Yes, Eunuch Yoon.
- Yes, Eunuch Yoon.

910
01:01:13,878 --> 01:01:15,755
His Majesty has fits?

911
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:18,257
When things get bad…

912
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:21,386
Who poisoned my food?

913
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:23,554
<i>Throwing tables and bowls</i>

914
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:25,682
<i>and making a mess is the least of it.</i>

915
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:29,977
<i>Sometimes, he trembles all over</i>
<i>and says he hears things.</i>

916
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:31,104
<i>Once a fit takes hold,</i>

917
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:33,564
<i>everyone in the palace freezes in fear.</i>

918
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:36,025
<i>Your Majesty, are you all right?</i>

919
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:38,736
<i>Only Consort Kang can console him.</i>

920
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:42,740
<i>He's a famous tyrant,</i>

921
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:44,534
<i>but this is news to me.</i>

922
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:47,245
What will you do?

923
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:56,087
<i>He's usually so normal.</i>

924
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:57,672
<i>Right.</i>

925
01:01:57,755 --> 01:02:00,925
<i>The traits of a tyrant</i>
<i>and the strange behavior</i>

926
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:03,052
<i>could be symptoms of a wounded heart.</i>

927
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:05,012
<i>That and the whole deal</i>
<i>with his mother being deposed.</i>

928
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:15,106
For dinner today, we will serve something
to console His Majesty.

929
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:18,568
Are you sure about this?

930
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:21,779
I'm not,

931
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:26,117
but I'll do my best
to survive this day as well.

932
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:37,003
I see them, miss. They are coming out.

933
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:39,380
Okay. Is it working fine?

934
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:17,335
My gosh.

935
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:21,589
Do you all wish to die?

936
01:03:22,673 --> 01:03:24,175
I will not let you be!

937
01:03:30,431 --> 01:03:31,516
Your Majesty.

938
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:33,643
Your <i>seoksura</i>, evening meal, is ready.

939
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:50,493
Leave, all of you!

940
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:53,830
What shall we do with your meal?

941
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:57,166
Do you wish to be killed?

942
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,753
- Do not make me repeat myself!
- Yes, Your Majesty.

943
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:07,635
Wait!

944
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:14,600
The blue ribbon in your hair
tells me you are the chief royal cook.

945
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:19,772
<i>I'm screwed.</i>

946
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,072
Yes, Your Majesty.

947
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:30,074
You shall stay.

948
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:56,601
So,

949
01:04:57,184 --> 01:04:59,061
what did you prepare this time?

950
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:04,984
Noodles?

951
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:09,488
Today's special dinner menu

952
01:05:10,114 --> 01:05:11,365
is <i>doenjang</i> pasta.

953
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:13,826
<i>The noodles are made with buckwheat flour,</i>

954
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:18,706
and the sauce is made with salty
stir-fried <i>doenjang</i> and savory clams.

955
01:05:18,789 --> 01:05:21,459
How dare you insult me?

956
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:23,669
I had <i>doenjang</i> earlier in the day!

957
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:26,672
<i>He's definitely</i>
<i>extremely on edge right now.</i>

958
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:29,425
<i>He was fine during the competition.</i>

959
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:31,385
Your Majesty.

960
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:34,639
This is called "pasta,"

961
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:38,267
and it's Italian for "dough."

962
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:41,395
The base of the sauce
may be the same <i>doenjang</i>,

963
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:43,064
but it's a completely different dish.

964
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:46,484
It means "buster" in "stallion"?

965
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:47,985
"Stallion"?

966
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:50,863
Pasta.

967
01:05:51,572 --> 01:05:52,865
"Bastra"?

968
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:55,117
Pasta.

969
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:56,869
- Pas…
- Pas…

970
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:02,124
Taste the food.

971
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:30,069
Please try it.

972
01:06:56,804 --> 01:06:58,389
I'll show you.

973
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:01,684
You hold it like this and…

974
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:10,484
Open your mouth.

975
01:07:29,336 --> 01:07:30,713
<i>"Busta."</i>

976
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:06,832
I had <i>doenjang</i> earlier as well,
but it tastes so different now.

977
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:10,628
Together with the spinage,
it is smooth and sweet.

978
01:08:10,711 --> 01:08:13,798
On top of that, the earthy buckwheat
and the savoriness of the clams

979
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:16,050
linger in my mouth until the end.

980
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:17,093
That's right.

981
01:08:18,886 --> 01:08:19,720
Very accurate.

982
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:22,681
This <i>doenjang</i> pasta

983
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:27,019
is what my dad made me
whenever I was upset.

984
01:08:27,895 --> 01:08:31,857
I'm sure you had
a lot to think about today.

985
01:08:32,733 --> 01:08:35,820
I also had a terribly long day,

986
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:39,198
so I made it with memories of my dad.

987
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:41,617
I see.

988
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,329
What about your mother?

989
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:49,667
She passed away when I was young.

990
01:08:55,256 --> 01:08:56,507
You must have felt lonely.

991
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:01,804
You must have been in a lot of pain.

992
01:09:03,055 --> 01:09:04,640
<i>Is he consoling me?</i>

993
01:09:04,723 --> 01:09:07,560
<i>He's just as lonely</i>
<i>with no one to turn to.</i>

994
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:11,105
<i>You must have felt alone, just like me.</i>

995
01:09:13,607 --> 01:09:16,902
Where is your father right now?

996
01:09:18,445 --> 01:09:22,783
He's probably desperately looking for me.

997
01:09:23,951 --> 01:09:26,162
He must not know
you are here in the palace.

998
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:28,497
Shall I send him a message?

999
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:30,624
No, Your Majesty.

1000
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:34,712
It seems you still don't believe me,
even though I've told you many times,

1001
01:09:35,254 --> 01:09:37,381
but I really am from the future.

1002
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:44,013
I'd be able to prove it
if only I had my handbag.

1003
01:09:44,805 --> 01:09:47,349
- Is this it?
- Yes, this is it!

1004
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:48,559
Thank you!

1005
01:09:50,811 --> 01:09:53,564
Do you mean the bundle

1006
01:09:54,064 --> 01:09:55,983
- I threw over the cliff?
- Yes.

1007
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:58,277
There's a book

1008
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,696
called <i>Mangunrok </i>in that handbag.

1009
01:10:01,405 --> 01:10:04,408
You'd be able to believe me
if only I had it.

1010
01:10:05,409 --> 01:10:06,619
"<i>Mangunrok</i>"?

1011
01:10:07,786 --> 01:10:11,207
What kind of book is <i>Mangunrok</i>?

1012
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:14,210
If I'm right,

1013
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:18,839
I believe it's the book
that brought me here.

1014
01:10:19,423 --> 01:10:20,883
It brought you here?

1015
01:10:22,843 --> 01:10:23,844
How so?

1016
01:10:27,139 --> 01:10:28,599
By time-slipping.

1017
01:10:33,145 --> 01:10:36,065
A magic book that sent me here

1018
01:10:36,982 --> 01:10:38,025
from the future.

1019
01:10:39,026 --> 01:10:41,862
I do not understand a word you are saying.

1020
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:43,280
Very well.

1021
01:10:45,324 --> 01:10:47,493
Tell me about my future.

1022
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:50,162
If you get it right, I will believe you.

1023
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:53,916
And I will send my troops if needed
to recover your bundle.

1024
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:55,334
What do you say?

1025
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:57,419
<i>Listen, Yeonhuigun.</i>

1026
01:10:57,503 --> 01:11:00,464
<i>The Gapshin Literati Purge</i>
<i>happens in the near future.</i>

1027
01:11:00,547 --> 01:11:02,925
RETALIATION WHERE YEONHUIGUN EXECUTED
OFFICIALS INVOLVED IN HIS MOTHER'S DEATH

1028
01:11:03,008 --> 01:11:06,387
Go on. Tell me what you know.

1029
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:10,307
<i>It happens in the Year of Gapshin,</i>
<i>Year of the Blue Monkey,</i>

1030
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:14,687
<i>a revolt ensues,</i>
<i>and you get dethroned and deposed.</i>

1031
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:18,148
<i>How am I supposed to tell you that</i>
<i>when history can't be changed?</i>

1032
01:11:19,733 --> 01:11:22,611
So you want to know
about the future, right?

1033
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:28,450
Then let me see…

1034
01:11:29,743 --> 01:11:30,703
First,

1035
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:33,872
you must get through this year well.

1036
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:36,458
Hold back, even if you get angry,

1037
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:38,460
and beware of those close to you.

1038
01:12:07,239 --> 01:12:09,908
<i>Will the Gapshin Literati Purge</i>
<i>actually happen?</i>

1039
01:12:12,536 --> 01:12:14,621
<i>I'm not in the position</i>
<i>to worry about someone else.</i>

1040
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:18,042
<i>What should I do?</i>

1041
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:31,555
CLAM DOENJANG PAASTA

1042
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:35,642
<i>On the 20th day of the Month of Gyeongjin,</i>
<i>which fell on the Gihae day,</i>

1043
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:37,311
<i>the chief royal cook placed first</i>

1044
01:12:37,394 --> 01:12:39,813
<i>in the competition hosted</i>
<i>by the Grand Royal Queen Dowager.</i>

1045
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:43,233
<i>It has been many years since I ordered</i>
<i>Principal Drafter Yi Jang-gyun</i>

1046
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:44,651
<i>to find the draft</i>
<i>of the historical record.</i>

1047
01:12:45,235 --> 01:12:46,779
<i>He will return today</i>

1048
01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:50,824
<i>with the secret of what happened</i>
<i>to my mother 20 years ago.</i>

1049
01:12:55,913 --> 01:12:58,999
There's a book called <i>Mangunrok</i>
in that handbag.

1050
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:00,667
A book called <i>Mangunrok</i>.

1051
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:02,419
There's a book called <i>Mangunrok</i>.

1052
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:04,129
"<i>Mangunrok</i>."

1053
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:07,132
Mangunrok<i>…</i>

1054
01:13:12,971 --> 01:13:15,140
<i>Does it mean "to yearn for the clouds"?</i>

1055
01:13:21,021 --> 01:13:22,898
MANGUNROK

1056
01:13:24,024 --> 01:13:26,568
MANGUNROK

1057
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:54,138
Your Majesty, it is I,
the commander of Urimwi.

1058
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:55,722
You may enter.

1059
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:01,645
What is it?

1060
01:14:01,728 --> 01:14:04,148
Your Majesty, I have bad news.

1061
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:05,732
Principal Drafter Yi Jang-gyun

1062
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:06,942
has vanished.

1063
01:14:07,025 --> 01:14:09,319
What? Yi Jang-gyun has vanished?

1064
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:10,237
Yes.

1065
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:11,613
I was to meet him tonight

1066
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:13,574
at the twenty-second hour
at the North Gate,

1067
01:14:13,657 --> 01:14:16,160
but he did not appear,
so I searched the area

1068
01:14:16,243 --> 01:14:20,080
and found this in a spot
stained with a lot of blood.

1069
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:27,629
- Was he attacked by an assassin?
- Yes.

1070
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:28,672
Kill him!

1071
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:33,010
Let us go.

1072
01:14:33,552 --> 01:14:35,471
<i>Judging from the blood</i>
<i>and fallen identification plaque,</i>

1073
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:37,639
it seems certain
he was attacked by an assassin.

1074
01:14:39,266 --> 01:14:40,976
This is outrageous.

1075
01:14:46,064 --> 01:14:48,150
<i>No one else knew</i>
<i>about the order I gave him.</i>

1076
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:51,570
<i>Who could have done this?</i>

1077
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:55,657
<i>What crime could my mother have committed</i>

1078
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:57,868
<i>that they are trying so hard to hide it?</i>

1079
01:14:59,077 --> 01:15:00,204
<i>It is possible</i>

1080
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:04,249
<i>that every one of them</i>
<i>was involved in her death.</i>

1081
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:08,128
<i>All of those who wish to retain</i>
<i>their position and power.</i>

1082
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:15,594
<i>I cannot trust anyone.</i>

1083
01:15:17,971 --> 01:15:19,014
<i>Then again…</i>

1084
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:22,684
<i>I was always alone anyway.</i>

1085
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:26,730
Your Majesty.

1086
01:15:26,813 --> 01:15:29,149
The wind is cold.

1087
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:32,319
Please return to your chambers.

1088
01:15:32,986 --> 01:15:34,446
Bring me a drink.

1089
01:15:36,323 --> 01:15:37,324
A drink, Your Majesty?

1090
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:40,661
I need to get drunk tonight.

1091
01:15:57,803 --> 01:15:58,887
Your Majesty.

1092
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:00,389
Drinking on an empty stomach

1093
01:16:01,306 --> 01:16:03,559
will harm your health.

1094
01:16:03,642 --> 01:16:05,519
I shall request a <i>juansang</i>,
so you can have some food.

1095
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:24,663
Cook Yeon, are you in there?

1096
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:27,249
Cook Yeon.

1097
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:30,586
Yes. I'm coming.

1098
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:33,755
This is just crazy.

1099
01:16:34,464 --> 01:16:37,509
Why does he not sleep?

1100
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:47,436
Your Majesty, your <i>juansang</i> is ready.

1101
01:17:00,532 --> 01:17:01,533
Your Majesty.

1102
01:17:04,578 --> 01:17:06,747
Your Majesty, are you all right?

1103
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:11,668
You are here.

1104
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:14,296
<i>Is he drunk?</i>

1105
01:17:14,963 --> 01:17:16,381
<i>He reeks of alcohol.</i>

1106
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:19,635
<i>It's one thing after another with him.</i>

1107
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:24,806
Yes. I brought your <i>juansang</i>--

1108
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:34,733
Well, Your Majesty…

1109
01:17:39,529 --> 01:17:40,947
Stay still.

1110
01:17:43,367 --> 01:17:44,368
But I…

1111
01:17:45,118 --> 01:17:46,536
Stay as you are.

1112
01:17:48,705 --> 01:17:49,873
Just for a while.

1113
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:38,690
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

1114
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:43,403
Do you not remember
what happened last night?

1115
01:19:47,657 --> 01:19:48,950
I'm going to destroy you!

1116
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:52,579
What is it? What about the draft?

1117
01:19:52,662 --> 01:19:56,458
I will prepare the <i>natgeotsang</i>
after the physical examination today.

1118
01:19:58,001 --> 01:20:00,712
I'll prepare my <i>natgeotsang</i> as planned.

1119
01:20:03,173 --> 01:20:04,800
<i>Who is the chief envoy this time?</i>

1120
01:20:05,592 --> 01:20:08,428
<i>I was told he brought</i>
<i>as many as three cooks.</i>

1121
01:20:08,512 --> 01:20:10,263
<i>We're expecting a special guest today.</i>

1122
01:20:10,347 --> 01:20:12,098
<i>Brace yourselves, envoys.</i>

1123
01:20:15,143 --> 01:20:20,148
