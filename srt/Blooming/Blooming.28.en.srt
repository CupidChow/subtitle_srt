Didn't he come to you?

00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,360
I was busy in the library last night.

00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:40,960
I just came back.

Tantan, don't worry.

42
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,760

to the whole mountain,

00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,000
still no sign of Senior Mu Bai.

80
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,200
Tantan, have some hot tea to warm up.

81
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,720
It's OK. Let me do it myself.

What do you have to say?

83
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,720
I found out from my book

84
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,720
that after the four petals
of the Xilan Flower unfold,

85
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,160
it will not only weaken
the cultivator's spiritual power,

86
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,200
but also

87
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,000
cause amnesia.

88
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,840
Amnesia?

89
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,440
To what extent?

90
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,800
Will he not be able to find his way home

91
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,880
like you did before?

92
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,120
No, I was just stupid.

93
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,040
Amnesia means

94
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,480
he may forget about the past,

95
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,320
but he can still take care of himself.
Don't worry.

96
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,200
No.

97
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,960
Even if he can take care of himself,

98
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,200
his spiritual power is fading.

99
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,200
He's still dangerous to be alone.

100
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,200
Also...

101
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,720
Also...

102
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,400
What?

103
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,280
Also...

104
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,080
Also what?

105
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,160
Come on, say it.

106
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,160
I'll say it.

107
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,280
Also,

108
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,320
I've found a way

109
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,880
to stop his spiritual power from fading.

110
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,520
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

111
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,480
Yeah. Why didn't you?

112
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,640
I was going to say.

113
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,800
But when I found out about it
in the morning,

114
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,600
there was an explosion.

115
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,160
Enough, say it.

116
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,080
Say it.

117
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,320
Here goes,

118
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,280
it's said that there's a Longgu Herb
on the Longquan Cliff

119
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,560
that can inhibit the four petals
from harming Cui Chen.

120
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,480
OK.

121
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,320
I'll go get it now.

122
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,160
Tantan,

123
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,800
that place is extremely dangerous.

124
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,560
I don't think you should go alone.

125
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,400
Well,

126
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,680
I'll go with you.

127
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,000
Master,

128
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,080
you have to attend to everything

129
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,360
in the Sect.

130
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,680
I can do it alone.

131
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,120
I'm the most powerful in the Sect now.

132
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,600
Then Sha will go with you.

133
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,520
We'll go with you too.

134
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:17,840
Yeah, Tantan.

135
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,440
Yeah. We're going too.

136
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,160
Don't bother.

137
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,960
Enough.

138
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,360
It's settled.

139
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,200
It's non-negotiable.

140
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,600
What's wrong?

141
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,030
Sir,

142
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,640
I've lost track of Young Master

143
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,550
since he entered the Qingyuan Sect.

144
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,760
I caught one of their disciples

145
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,030
at the foot of the mountain.

146
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,030
I didn't know until I interrogated him.

147
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,640
Go on.

148
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,030
Lian Wen had taken over

149
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:43,960
Zhao Tantan's body.

150
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,040
Young Master exposed

151
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,440
his identity in advance to help her.

152
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,320
He has been locked up
by the Qingyuan Sect.

153
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,240
Unfilial bloke!

154
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,280
I gave him a lotus seed as a leverage

155
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,200
and sacrificed so many
high-ranking demon cultivators.

156
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,160
I racked my brains to put on this show,

157
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,960
not expecting him
to jeopardize it for a woman.

158
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,600
Demon cultivators will lose their power
when they enter the Qingyuan Sect.

159
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,400
This is no secret to Mu Xuan,

160
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,360
the former disciple of the Sect.

161
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,080
That's why you took me in.

162
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,520
I'll burst in the Qingyuan Sect

163
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,160
and rescue him now.

164
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:13,960
Idiot!

165
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,320
Once the Demons enter the Sect,

166
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,440
all our skills will be invalidated.

167
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,920
What can you do?

168
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,640
But he is your child, after all.

169
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,400
I took him in

170
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,960
because he was once a cultivator

171
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,560
who could sneak into the Qingyuan Sect
and steal the Seven-Leaf Lotus.

172
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,760
Now he's screwed everything up.

173
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,120
Do we still need to rescue him?

174
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,360
Sir,

175
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,800
for the sake of our loyalty
over the years,

176
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,360
you can't just leave him alone.

177
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,680
It depends on
whether he can turn the tables.

178
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:50,960
Anybody!

179
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,080
Anybody!

180
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,600
What's wrong?

181
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,760
I have a heartache suddenly.

182
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,520
Would you come in and help me?

183
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,040
No.

184
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,000
Senior Mu Bai forbade

185
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,720
anyone to enter your cell.

186
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,000
Stop it.

187
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,360
Sha.

188
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,960
He seems to have passed out.

189
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,520
Didn't I tell you?

190
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,520
Qiu Yuebai is full of tricks.

191
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,440
Don't approach him

192
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,320
unless necessary.

193
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,120
What should we do now?

194
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,160
He said he had a heartache.

195
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,800
Go find Huai Meng.

196
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,480
Get some of his foot skin.

197
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,720
Rub it into a ball

198
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,920
and feed him.

199
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,080
Go.

200
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,280
Whether you are Qiu Yuebai
or Mu Xuan,

201
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,800
in my opinion, you're a traitor.

202
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,720
I'm warning you, you'd better behave

203
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,120
and not play any tricks.

204
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,880
Tantan.

205
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,080
Tantan, let's go.

206
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,200
Tantan.

207
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,280
Tantan.

208
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,600
Where is Tantan?

209
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,800
She wasn't here when I came in.

210
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:04,880
Too bad!

211
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,120
She might have gone alone.

212
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,280
She left a message.

213
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,280
(Friends, I'm sorry.)

214
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,680
(I'm leaving alone.)

215
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,480
(This is my own business.)

216
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,000
(I don't want to implicate you.)

217
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,840
(Also, your magic art levels are low.)

218
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,400
(In case you are in danger,)

219
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,440
(I have to look for the herb
as well as help you.)

220
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,560
(It's exhausting.)

221
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,520
(Be good. Wait for me at home.)

222
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,440
(Love, Tantan.)

223
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,680
Zhao Tantan,

224
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,440
this is your first time working alone

225
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,320
without Cui Chen.

226
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,680
Don't be afraid.

227
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,880
Don't chicken out.

228
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,600
Longgu Herb?

229
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,760
Where is Tantan?

230
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,240
Haven't you found her in three days?

231
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,120
We went all the way to the Longgu Herb.

232
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,800
There was no sign of Tantan.

233
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,640
And there's

234
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,080
a fierce wolf spirit.

235
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,920
The four of us couldn't even defeat it.

236
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,840
Do you think it had eaten Tantan?

237
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,120
Xueyi, don't be ridiculous.

238
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,440
You...

239
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,480
Send the whole sect
to look for her tomorrow!

240
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,840
How did I get hurt so bad?

241
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,520
After three days and three nights,

242
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,080
you've finally woken up.

243
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,800
Miss.

244
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,000
Miss.

245
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,160
Why is she a fool?

246
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,960
Did she hurt her brain?

247
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,680
It's a shame
that such a pretty girl became a fool.

248
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,680
Did

249
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,640
you save me?

250
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,400
You're not a fool. Great.

251
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,000
The other day,
when I went to collect firewood,

252
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,160
I found you passed out,

253
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,200
with your arms and legs hurt.

254
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,400
So I brought you back.

255
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,640
What's your name?

256
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,640
You're the first person
to ask me the question

257
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,840
and the first person I saw in the woods.

258
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,400
What's your name?

259
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,440
My...

260
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,960
My name is Zhao Dahua.

261
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,560
I'm an herb gatherer.

262
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,760
That day, I went to collect herbs

263
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,280
and fell down accidentally.

264
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,160
Thankfully, you saved me.

265
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,280
Dahua,

266
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,360
why don't you give me a name?

267
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,360
Maybe

268
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,840
Gousheng.

269
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,360
You don't look very healthy.

270
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,600
I heard that with a name like that,

271
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,880
you can grow healthy.

272
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,120
Who says I'm not healthy?

273
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,320
But Gousheng

274
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,960
sounds good to me.

275
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,600
My name will be Cui Gousheng then.

276
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,680
Why is your surname Cui?

277
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,120
Why is my surname Cui?

278
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,830
Why is my surname Cui?

279
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,200
Because

280
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,310
Cui just popped into my head.

281
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,040
What's wrong?

282
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,400
Isn't Cui good?

283
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,920
It's good.

284
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,960
Cui Gousheng.

285
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,880
Are you hungry?

286
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,200
I'll make you some food.

287
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,120
After the four petals
of the Xilan Flower unfold,

288
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,760
it will not only weaken
the cultivator's spiritual power,

289
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,040
but also cause amnesia.

290
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,480
(It's good
that Dabai has lost his memory.)

291
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,440
(If he doesn't remember me,)

292
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,560
(I can stay by his side.)

293
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,520
Here.

294
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,560
Get up.

295
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,640
Dabai, is the food ready?

296
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,400
Dabai?

297
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,000
You've said that name twice.

298
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,360
Who is Dabai?

299
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,360
Here.

300
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:45,680
Watch your leg.

301
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,640
He was a dog I kept.

302
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,000
Dog?

303
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,640
Could a dog cook?

304
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,840
Of course not.

305
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,520
But he would call me

306
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,400
when the food was ready and he smelt it.

307
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,920
You seem to be very close.

308
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,120
You look for it
first thing in the morning.

309
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,600
Yeah.

310
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,080
Unfortunately,

311
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,440
I'll probably never hear him

312
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,880
call me for dinner again.

313
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,640
Why?

314
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,320
Because he's sick.

315
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,480
He's gone to a faraway place
for treatment.

316
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,200
I don't know when he'll be back.

317
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,800
He'll be back.

318
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,240
Really?

319
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,120
Yes, I have a hunch.

320
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,480
Here. Eat.

321
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,720
Eat more. It's good for you.

322
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,240
I'm sorry.

323
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:02,920
Come on.

324
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,720
Lean over.

325
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,560
Lean over.

326
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,840
I'm sorry.

327
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,760
I'd better use a spoon.

328
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,160
It's OK.

329
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,200
Be careful.

330
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,560
Never mind. I'm not eating.

331
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,760
I'm not hungry.

332
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,480
Sit down.

333
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,640
I'll feed you.

334
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,440
Here.

335
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,400
How do you like it?

336
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,800
Try this fish.

337
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,720
I made it especially for you.

338
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,240
Other people use cooking wine,
scallion, ginger and garlic.

339
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,360
But I don't cook it the same way.

340
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,280
Try it.

341
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,760
Is it good?

342
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,120
It isn't fishy at all, right?

343
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,560
This is my secret recipe.

344
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,360
Slow down.

345
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:32,920
Here.

346
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,520
I'll get you something. Wait for me.

347
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,120
Look.

348
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,520
This is for you.

349
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,200
This is...

350
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,520
I made it myself.

351
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,800
To help you walk.

352
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,200
After all, we're not the same sex.

353
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,720
You have to do some things yourself.

354
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,080
Try it.

355
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:18,840
Stop practicing.

356
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,160
It's my fault for making you do this.

357
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,880
You're bleeding from the wound.

358
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,760
Don't use it again.

359
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,080
If you don't mind,

360
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,400
I'll carry you.

361
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,480
Does it hurt?

362
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,280
Is it hot?

363
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,000
Slowly. Be careful.

364
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,960
Try this. Here.

365
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,120
Gousheng.

366
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,680
Gousheng.

367
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,360
Gousheng.

368
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,800
Gousheng.

369
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,680
Gousheng!

370
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,520
(I'm going fishing.)

371
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,960
(I'll cook you a good meal
when I come back.)

372
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,520
There's something missing.

373
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,160
From now on, I'll live here with Dabai.

374
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,680
We'll eat good food
while enjoying the beautiful view.

375
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,840
That's what life is all about.

376
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,080
His room must be as dull as he is.

377
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,640
Here's a surprise for you.

378
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,200
Dahua!

379
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,000
You're back.

380
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,600
Look at the fruit I've picked.

381
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,400
Give it to me.

382
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,760
Don't laugh. Help me.

383
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,640
Don't be anxious.

384
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,640
Look.

385
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,800
I caught two fish today.

386
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,000
I'll make you a big meal tonight.

387
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,720
What flavor would you like?

388
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,440
I'd like both steamed and braised.

389
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,280
No problem.

390
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,000
Dahua, fish are ready.

391
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,200
One steamed and one braised.

392
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,400
You have both you want.

393
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,680
OK.

394
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,480
Come on.

395
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,360
Try it and see if it's good.

396
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,280
I'm sure it's good.

397
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,960
How do you know before you taste it?

398
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,240
Who says I haven't...

399
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,840
I mean,

400
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,120
you're so good-looking.

401
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,080
I don't have to eat your food

402
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,920
to know it tastes good.

403
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,120
You...

404
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,720
You're good at flattering.

405
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:08,840
Here.

406
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,200
Try it.

407
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:15,840
How is it?

408
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,080
Is it good?

409
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,120
I was right.

410
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,680
The flavor is really amazing.

411
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,120
Eat more if it's good.

412
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,960
I saw the flowers and the couch.

413
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,360
Did you prepare these?

414
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,920
Don't you like them?

415
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,120
I do.

416
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,000
It feels more like home.

417
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,000
For the sake of your thoughtfulness,

418
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,080
I'll reward you with a dessert.

419
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,400
What would you like?
I'll make it for you right now.

420
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,120
I don't have a favorite.

421
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,000
Just make one of your favorites.

422
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:53,960
OK.

423
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,840
Actually, I don't have

424
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,120
a favorite dessert.

425
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,480
But there was a person
who was very important to me.

426
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,600
Her favorite sweet is

427
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,160
candied haws.

428
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,000
Candied haws?

429
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,720
Who's the person

430
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,280
that was important to you?

431
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,320
Who else

432
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,080
is most important to me but you?

433
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,320
Tantan.

434
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,600
I...

435
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:23,960
Look!

436
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,560
[Her favorite.]

437
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,600
[She said dried durian tastes good.]
[I can find her.]

438
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:21,080
[A token for me and her.]
[She said a wish will keep us together.]

439
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,440
[Who is she?]

440
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,720
When did he recall this?

441
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,560
It's almost dawn.

442
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,120
I should leave.

443
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,640
I thought if you lost your memory,

444
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,000
I could stay with you longer.

445
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,080
But I didn't think

446
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,800
that even such a small wish
couldn't come true.

447
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,880
Compared to temporary happiness,

448
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,080
I want you to live as well

449
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,560
and proudly as before.

450
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:14,880
There's a fire.

451
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:16,920
There's a fire.

452
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,080
A fire!

453
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,360
Fire!

454
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,320
Foot washing water!

455
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,320
Foot washing water!

456
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,600
Gousheng, you're awake!

457
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,440
Who is Gousheng?

458
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,640
What are you doing?

459
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,720
My head itches.

460
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,400
I...

461
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,880
It's better to jump while scratching.

462
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,920
Jump while scratching.

463
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,200
Who are you?

464
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,520
Why are you in my house?

465
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,720
I'm Zhao Dahua, remember?

466
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,720
Zhao Dahua?

467
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,360
I only know Zhao Tantan
whose surname is Zhao.

468
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,720
Who is Zhao Tantan?

469
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,200
None of your business.
You don't know her.

470
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,160
(It seems that Dabai)

471
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,000
(doesn't even remember Zhao Dahua.)

472
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,640
(But why does he
still remember Zhao Tantan?)

473
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,760
Who are you exactly?

474
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,400
I'm your cousin, Zhao Dahua, remember?

475
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,640
Cousin?

476
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,200
Really?

477
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:20,800
Yes.

478
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,800
You're sick.

479
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,760
Your father asked me to get you.

480
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,560
Why don't I remember?

481
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,160
Your disease

482
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,840
makes you forget things.

483
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,760
No big deal. It's OK.

484
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,160
But I still remember Zhao Tantan.

485
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,800
Tomorrow is her birthday.
She is coming to see me.

486
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,520
I'm going to give her a surprise.

487
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,640
What surprise?

488
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,840
I'm going to propose to her.

489
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,600
Propose?

490
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,560
Yes.

491
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,120
Proposing
is what she cares about the most.

492
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:55,920
Cousin,

493
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,800
I don't have any ideas for the proposal.

494
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,280
Why don't you give me some ideas?

495
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,800
What are you waiting for? Come on.

496
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,360
Come.

497
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,480
Where is this place?

498
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,190
The place I'm going to propose to her.

499
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,670
But it's still empty.

500
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,400
Help me figure out how to decorate it.

501
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,880
Don't worry about it.

502
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:27,000
As long as you're true to her,

503
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,440
she'll be happy no matter what you do.

504
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,190
No way.

505
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,670
This is my proposal.

506
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,360
I must give her the most romantic

507
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,710
and heartfelt proposal.

508
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,760
Where are you going?

509
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,880
To set up the site.

510
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,240
Let me help.

511
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,080
Let me help.

512
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,800
Don't bother.

513
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,320
Your mission today

514
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,960
is to wait for Zhao Tantan here

515
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,880
and bring her

516
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,360
to the open space at night.

517
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,880
How do you know she will come today?

518
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,720
If she doesn't,

519
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,400
I'll keep waiting.

520
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,600
Don't run around today.

521
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,200
If she can't find the place at night,

522
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:20,720
I...

523
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:23,800
I'm off.

524
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,640
I'm sorry.

525
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,120
Zhao Tantan really can't make it today.
