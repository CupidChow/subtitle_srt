00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,320
No.

191
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,110
No.

192
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,910
I am the light of Qingyuan.

193
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,200
I must be like the light.

194
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,000
Calm down.

195
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,030
Calm down.

196
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:52,960
Corn!

197
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,790
Something must be wrong
with the corn grains.

198
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,550
If the corn grains make me bigger,

199
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,960
the pine nuts should make me smaller.

200
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,400
Anyway, let me eat one.

201
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,630
I'm so smart.

202
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:23,680
Brilliant.

203
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,590
I've shrunk too much.

204
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,630
No more shrinking.

205
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,040
Oh, dear.

206
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,040
How did I get so small?

207
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,440
I can't believe I've shrunk so much.

208
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,070
Are you playing with me?

209
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,040
Why don't I eat another corn grain?

210
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,070
Forget it.

211
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,390
The golden fox

212
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,120
was able to take the scholars
without a sound.

213
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,800
Did he use the pine nuts
and corn grains?

214
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,150
No, I have to take a look

215
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,560
Why is there a human smell?

216
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:39,510
Cui Chen.

217
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,920
Cui Chen.

218
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:50,750
It's you.

219
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,920
What can I do for you?

220
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:53,680
I was browsing around

221
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,880
when I noticed your scripts
and paintings.

222
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm also a fan.

223
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,240
I'd like to discuss them with you.

224
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,750
I didn't realize you're not only pretty

225
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,000
but also have good taste.

226
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,830
I'm in a hurry.

227
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,190
Let's talk when I get back.

228
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,560
OK. Let's talk later.

229
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,630
I didn't expect you to be so bold
at a young age.

230
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,190
You dared to break into
a fox hole alone.

231
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,480
And you managed to escape.

232
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,800
It seems that Master's worries about you

233
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,040
are indeed unwarranted.

234
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,560
Stop talking rubbish.

235
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:30,710
Get me back to normal.

236
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,680
This is the fox's spell.
I can't do anything about it.

237
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,320
Then...

238
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,630
What should we do?

239
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,680
You can't do without me.

240
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:40,830
How can you

241
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,360
face the golden fox alone?

242
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,000
Hurry. Turn me back.

243
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,240
I've turned you back.
How can you repay me?

244
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,320
You Sweet Dumpling!

245
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,040
Master calls you the voice
of goodness and beauty.

246
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,320
How dare you tease me?

247
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,800
Don't shush me. You can't stop me.

248
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,560
I...

249
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,480
The golden fox has gone out.

250
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,480
Why are they still doing this?

251
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,680
Have they been brainwashed?

252
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,240
This place

253
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,240
doesn't smell like the fox holes

254
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,560
I've been before.

255
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,630
I don't care about the smell.

256
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,800
Let's get them out of here first.

257
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,000
Listen to me, everyone.

258
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,830
I'm here to save you.

259
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,880
Cheer up!

260
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:11,320
We, the Qingyuan Sect,
are dedicated to upholding justice

261
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,560
and eliminating demons.

262
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,870
Eliminate...

263
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:19,870
It's OK.

264
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,470
I'm here

265
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,110
to take you out

266
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,680
and fight the golden fox to the end.

267
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,350
Did you hear me?

268
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,840
No, you didn't.

269
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,720
It's OK. He may have a poor ear.

270
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,600
I'll talk to another one.

271
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,150
My dear fox loves the snacks

272
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,750
I make for him.

273
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,720
No, he doesn't.

274
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,960
He loves the dental chews
I make for him.

275
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,990
Stop it!

276
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,470
Guys,

277
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,110
I don't want to judge you.

278
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,320
But at such a critical moment,

279
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,320
you're not thinking about how to escape,

280
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,200
but how to please the fox.

281
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:02,840
I...

282
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,800
Or what?

283
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,750
You should escape, of course.

284
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,680
Resist the hegemony.
No more humiliation.

285
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,680
Stop it.

286
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,840
Do you think there's no more humiliation
after we escape?

287
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,840
If I had known, I wouldn't have
wasted my life saving you.

288
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,320
Go.

289
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,510
Chill out.

290
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,080
Do you remember why we came down?

291
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,040
Good. Well said.

292
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,470
What you said just now

293
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,150
made my blood boil.

294
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,750
I'd like to help you.

295
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,750
I wonder if you'd like that.

296
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,870
Of course.

297
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,720
You're the handsome man on horseback
I saw yesterday,

298
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:51,510
Mr. Qiu.

299
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,630
That's me, Qiu Yuebai.

300
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,630
I'm Zhao Tantan from the Qingyuan Sect.

301
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,680
He is

302
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,040
in my same sect.

303
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,750
Cui Chen.

304
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:11,630
It's time to eat.

305
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,080
What could the fox feed them?

306
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,510
These scholars eat so well,

307
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:32,040
better than what I ate at the Sect.

308
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,320
My stingy master

309
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,110
didn't give me meat even for a month.

310
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,960
Today I must enjoy...

311
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,390
My poor drumsticks.

312
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,110
(Zhao Tantan,
you should have backbones.)

313
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,320
(You can't eat Sweet Dumpling's food.)

314
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:31,990
(Zhao Tantan, it's Cui Chen's fault,
not the drumstick's.)

315
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:35,150
(Every drumstick
should have its destiny.)

316
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,110
(You're its destiny.)

317
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:43,920
Thanks.

318
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,230
Mr. Qiu,

319
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,470
you have so many admirers.

320
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,750
You have bodyguards when you go out.

321
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:51,960
How did you get caught?

322
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,750
There were problems
with my business in Yunzhou.

323
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,720
So I sent my bodyguard to deal with it,

324
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:58,150
not expecting that I'd be caught
soon after he left.

325
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,040
But since you're here,

326
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,390
you can get us out of here.

327
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,080
As cultivators,

328
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,600
this is what we should do.

329
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,990
When the golden fox comes back,

330
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,750
I'll catch him

331
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:12,990
and make him release us.

332
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,440
Before we know what's going on,

333
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,270
don't act rashly and alert the enemy.

334
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,440
Though being careful
helps you sail a boat perpetually,

335
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,390
the boat will capsize
if you wait too long.

336
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,320
And your noodles will be soggy.

337
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:24,840
Wait.

338
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,110
Are you cultivators?

339
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:26,920
That's great.

340
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,320
Though I don't know magic arts,

341
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,560
if you need help,

342
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,200
I can help you catch the fox spirit.

343
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,200
Good friend,

344
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,560
you're much more reliable
than Sweet Dumpling.

345
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,720
Sweet Dumpling, what are you doing?

346
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,800
We're not at the Qingyuan Sect.

347
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,800
There should be a prudent reserve
between the sexes.

348
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,320
Don't do that again.

349
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,440
I'm doing it. So what?

350
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,270
Are you going to
report me secretly to Master?

351
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,080
I won't.

352
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,390
I'll tell him fair and square.

353
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:53,600
OK.

354
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,560
What's this again?

355
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,230
It's time for a nap.

356
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:04,750
Go to sleep.

357
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,470
Have they really not been brainwashed?

358
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,270
Why are they so obedient?

359
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,230
They always seem to be.

360
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:27,510
Someone's coming.

361
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:36,350
Move.

362
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:36,960
Move over.

363
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:39,150
You're too close to me. I'm not dead.

364
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:25,840
Hey, kid,

365
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,800
be sensible and come with me.

366
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,560
I promise you a quick death.

367
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:30,960
Stupid girl.

368
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,110
How did you get in here?

369
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,600
You're not even close
to gaining the upper hand.

370
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,720
Try and take one more step.

371
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,200
Don't be impulsive. Let him go.

372
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,200
Giving up evil is your only way out.

373
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:45,720
Dear fox,

374
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,040
I'm Zhong Zhuangyuan.

375
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,680
You love the cookies I make.

376
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,630
Shut up. Don't move.

377
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,200
Let's make a deal.

378
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:54,150
You let me go and I'll let him go.

379
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,320
Let him go. Hold me as your hostage.

380
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,350
Mr. Qiu.

381
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,800
I didn't realize there was a scholar
with a backbone like you

382
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,320
among the captives.

383
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,390
I'll be your hostage.

384
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,080
I promise I won't resist or run away.

385
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,680
Walk over slowly.

386
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,720
Get out of my way!

387
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,470
Otherwise, I'll...

388
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:22,600
I'll kill him!

389
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:29,870
Darn it!

390
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,800
Want to run?

391
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,150
Tantan,

392
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,390
let's play whack-a-mole.

393
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,720

00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,480
♪What's good and what's bad♪

405
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,470
Still trying to escape?

406
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,150
I'll make you show your true forms.

407
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,230
Run.

408
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,720
Keep running.

409
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,800
Good exercise,

410
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:38,750
isn't it?

411
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,200
You've got good means.

412
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,150
Of course.

413
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,350
You know what, I've got a lot of skills.

414
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,560
You're impressed, right?

415
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,990
Are you OK?

416
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,080
You've caught the golden fox.

417
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,720
When I'm here,

418
00:26:58,870 --> 00:26:59,960
how could he get away?

419
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,600
But look carefully,

420
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,600
he isn't the golden fox.

421
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,630
He's just a hamster spirit.

422
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,800
Hamster?

423
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,230
You're running too slow.

424
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,150
Spare me.

425
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,510
Don't kill me.

426
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,800
I'm doing this for my daughter.

427
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,230
Your daughter?

428
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:03,630
What happened to her?

429
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,040
My daughter...

430
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,390
She isn't born yet.

431
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,440
What's wrong with you?

432
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,680
What does stealing the men have to do

433
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,720
with your unborn daughter?

434
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,040
Because I admire human civilization.

435
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,960
I hope to marry my daughter
to a human in the future.

436
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,320
So, I've been scouting for talents

437
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:28,230
in human society for a long time.

438
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:31,150
I've never hurt them.

439
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,800
I've been feeding

440
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,320
my future sons-in-law well.

441
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:39,560
You wanted talented scholars.

442
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,600
Then why did you catch him?

443
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:45,040
Temperament is also important.

444
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:47,630
I really haven't done anything harmful.

445
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:48,960
I don't believe you.

446
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,270
If you say so, I'll show you.

447
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,990
I've put in a lot of effort to make sure

448
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,920
they can study in peace

449
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,390
and win an official rank.

450
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,680
Based on my continuous observation,

451
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,470
he didn't harm the scholars.

452
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,110
That's true.

453
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:04,200
He was unreasonably good to them.

454
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,720
In that case,

455
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,600
I'll give you a chance
to atone for your faults.

456
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,750
I'm not like that barbarian.

457
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,200
I never hit anyone.

458
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,510
We're in Yunlai Town

459
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,110
to look for the golden fox.

460
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,200
Have you seen him?

461
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,080
I really don't know

462
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,080
who the real golden fox is.

463
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,270
I only assumed his name.

464
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,320
Really?

465
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,350
Really.

466
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,750
I swear on my unborn daughter.

467
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,040
Then you're useless to me.

468
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,230
Wait. Wait a minute.

469
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,230
Do you have any last words?

470
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,390
Please let me go.

471
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,600
Let you go?

472
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,680
What can I get in return?

473
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,510
You can pick any man in the hole.

474
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,230
I suggest it for her good.

475
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,350
I'm shallow.

476
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,600
I'm vulgar.

477
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,990
With all due respect,

478
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:09,680
are you blackmailing me blatantly?

479
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:10,440
Or what?

480
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:12,990
There's no other way.

481
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,840
If you let me go,

482
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:17,800
on behalf of my entire clan
of 862 hamsters,

483
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,990
I'd like to offer you our treasure.

484
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,150
Deal. Go.

485
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,510
Please.

486
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:38,960
Treasure!

487
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:42,960
We're rich!

488
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:44,750
We're rich!

489
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,470
I'm going to be rich.

490
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:55,960
What's wrong?

491
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,800
He's lying.

492
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,600
This is the property

493
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,470
that our clan has guarded for centuries.

494
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,270
This is the treasure to be passed on
to our future generations.

495
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,750
I never thought it would change hands
in my generation.

496
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,800
Father, Mother, I am unfilial.

497
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:17,150
Tell me,
what can I do with these soybeans?

498
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,990
I want jade, pearls, and gold.

499
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,630
I have none.

500
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:21,080
I...

501
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,110
Enough.

502
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:23,600
For a hamster,

503
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,680
so many soybeans

504
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,470
are indeed family treasures.

505
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:33,150
So, what are you going to do with him?

506
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,440
In my opinion,
since he didn't hurt anyone

507
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,320
and took good care of those scholars,

508
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,350
we should let him go for now.

509
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,230
What do you think?

510
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,320
You captured him. It’s your call.

511
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,800
You!

512
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,320
Look for a son-in-law
after you have a daughter.

513
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,080
What if you have a son?

514
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,040
Are you going to

515
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,750
catch pretty girls?

516
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:57,470
Let me tell you,

517
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:59,200
if you do this again, I'll be unpleasant.

518
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,720
Thank you, Miss.

519
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,630
Thank you, Miss.

520
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,800
Give me your hand.

521
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,560
Go.

522
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,920
Thanks.

523
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:08,960
Go.

524
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,840
Don't linger on here.

525
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,270
Go home and reunite with your family.

526
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:15,750
Go.

527
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,320
Go.

528
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,080
Go.

529
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,390
I'm not leaving.

530
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,040
We were provided with free food,
accommodation, and even a wife.

531
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:23,080
No studying, no exams.

532
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,350
Even if I got the first
at the Palace Exam,

533
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,800
I might not get these.

534
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:28,390
It's your fault for meddling.

535
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:31,560
As a young man,
do you want to live off others?

536
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,200
I live off others by hard power.

537
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,230
It's none of your business.

538
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,150
You don't look like

539
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,920
you've read a book of sages.

540
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,080
That hamster spirit has raised you all

541
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,750
to be good-for-nothings.

542
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,080
Does it have anything to do with you?

543
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:49,440
That's true.

544
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,600
But the hamster spirit has escaped.

545
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,440
There's no one to feed you.

546
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,510
You may have to wait to die.

547
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:56,320
Go for it.

548
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:58,750
Go for it.

549
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,200
We've been busy for two days,

550
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,110
not expecting that
he is a hamster spirit.

551
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:06,200
Why? Are you shrinking back?

552
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,990
How could I?

553
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,270
We haven't found the golden fox yet.

554
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,440
And you've just reached
the foundation phase.

555
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,800
Don't rush into anything.

556
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,470
Look at me. I'm already...

557
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,390
I know.

558
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,470
We who have just reached
the foundation phase

559
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,080
can't compare to
a high-ranking cultivator

560
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,270
like you.

561
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:26,840
Miss Zhao.

562
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:27,680
Mr. Cui.

563
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:29,990
Mr. Qiu.

564
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,990
Why haven't you headed home?

565
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,080
Are you going to the town?

566
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,350
Honestly, after what I've gone through,

567
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,440
I'm a little scared.

568
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:39,230
I want to go back with you.

569
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,470
I wonder if you agree.

570
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:42,630
Of course I agree.

571
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,110
I...

572
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,150
Anything wrong with your throat?

573
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:47,630
If you don't agree,

574
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,840
I won't force you.

575
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,200
Yes.

576
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:53,230
Of course he agrees.

577
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,390
I'll protect you.

578
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:56,470
Go.
