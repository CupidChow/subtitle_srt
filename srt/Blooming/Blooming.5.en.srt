00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,270
Do you think

190
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,240
if we can't catch the fox,

191
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,830
will the Tianyin Palace
give Master a hard time?

192
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,710
Have you lost confidence?

193
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,200
Don't worry.

194
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,830
If you can't catch him,

195
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,150
I can.

196
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,760
In your dreams.

197
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,270
I will catch him myself

198
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,430
to prove my strength.

199
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,800
Good.

200
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,200
Mr. Cui, Tantan.

201
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,150
Open the door.

202
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,240
It's Qiu.

203
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,000
Serve the food.

204
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,040
Qiu, this is...

205
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,950
To thank you and Mr. Cui
for saving my life.

206
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:54,950
Cooked at a small restaurant,

207
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,000
the humble meal isn't enough
to thank you.

208
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:05,360
It's no bother.

209
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,800
It's not worth your money.

210
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,710
It's getting late.

211
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,440
Why don't we...

212
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:08,950
Tasty.

213
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,240
Tasty.

214
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,270
Finally, I don't have to eat the food
from the Yunlai Inn.

215
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,750
The chef I brought from Yunzhou

216
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:16,880
made the food specifically for you.

217
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,560
Mr. Cui, you should try it too.

218
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,190
See if it suits your taste.

219
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,360
Mr. Qiu, you're impressive.

220
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:29,950
You've got a lot of admirers

221
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,320
and a successful business.

222
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,590
Let me see.

223
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,190
Shark's fin, shrimp,
scallop, and sea cucumber.

224
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,150
This isn't cheap, is it?

225
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,710
To thank my life savior,
this is nothing.

226
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:45,150
What are you waiting for?
Why don't you eat?

227
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,480
It's delicious.

228
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,240
I've never eaten any delicacy like this.

229
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,150
Is the food to your taste?

230
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,150
Sure. Definitely.

231
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,150
Cui Chen, here.

232
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,320
Try it.

233
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,510
You are...

234
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,150
He is

235
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,360
Mu Bai Zhenren of the Qingyuan Sect.

236
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,800
I'm a humble cultivator.

237
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,680
What do I have to do with him?

238
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,950
I didn't say that.

239
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,390
I thought you were...

240
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,000
What?

241
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,240
I've heard that the Qingyuan Sect

242
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,630
has ignored worldly affairs for 100 years.

243
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,800
You don't leave your mountain easily.

244
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,240
Then what did you

245
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,440
leave the mountain for this time?

246
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,440
This time, we're going to...

247
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,320
It's the Sect secret. We can't tell you.

248
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,710
Yeah.

249
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,830
It's the Sect secret. We can't tell you.

250
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,560
It's so delicious.

251
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,440
Tantan, you're the cutest girl

252
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,680
I've ever seen.

253
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,240
There must be many men pursuing you.

254
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:45,950
Pursue?

255
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,240
My lifetime pursuit

256
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:53,360
is to develop our sect
and become the light of Qingyuan.

257
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,710
Whoever dares to stop me will be like...

258
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,390
This.

259
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,320
The food has been delivered.

260
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,920
And you are safe in the town.

261
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,880
Why don't you leave?

262
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,320
What are you doing, Qiu?

263
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,390
Tantan, please take me as your disciple.

264
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,560
You want me to be your master?

265
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:23,750
You want her to be your master?

266
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,950
You've deeply impressed me

267
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,830
ever since you fought

268
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,480
with the hamster spirit the other day.

269
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,320
After hearing your talk
with great eloquence,

270
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,920
I've made up my mind to learn from you.

271
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,830
I want to be a real cultivator.

272
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,680
Really?

273
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,070
Yes.

274
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,190
Really?

275
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:42,830
Yes.

276
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,590
Did you see that?

277
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,270
Someone admires my talent

278
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,750
and wants to learn from me.

279
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,510
She's a cultivator who has just reached
the foundation phase.

280
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,800
What can she possibly teach you?

281
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,390
Sweet Dumpling,

282
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,190
why don't you keep your mouth shut?

283
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,240
It doesn't matter.

284
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,590
I think the essence of cultivation is
to cultivate the spirit.

285
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,120
Magic arts can be practiced.

286
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,560
But a decent person like Tantan

287
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,830
is really rare.

288
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,120
Sneer again.

289
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:12,560
I'm one of the best
in the cultivation world,

290
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,590
not to mention

291
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,270
in the Qingyuan Sect.

292
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,040
Tantan, what do you think?

293
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,950
Well...

294
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,880
What's wrong?

295
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,800
I just heard a sound.

296
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,320
It's getting late.

297
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,800
Mr. Qiu, you'd better go to sleep.

298
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:39,880
What about me learning from Tantan?

299
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,190
Our sect has its criteria

300
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,630
for admitting disciples.

301
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,390
Bye.

302
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:43,950
No, wait.

303
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,510
It's all of a sudden.

304
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,480
Let's talk it over.

305
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,040
It's important, after all.

306
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,270
I...

307
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,120
Leave.

308
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,240
Tantan.

309
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,510
Tantan.

310
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,190
What are you doing?

311
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,510
You can't take him as your disciple.

312
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,320
Why not?

313
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,510
There's something wrong with him.

314
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,560
What's wrong with him?

315
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,360
He's cuter than you.

316
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,270
He has a better temper than you

317
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,440
Is that wrong?

318
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,920
You're so close minded.

319
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,590
I suspect he's hiding his spiritual power.

320
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:09,630
Any proof?

321
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,000
A cultivator's sixth sense.

322
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,920
My future disciple

323
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,590
has made a very tasty meal.

324
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,680
He's unlike my former disciple,

325
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,920
who is an

326
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,710
ungrateful liar.

327
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,560
But I'm only going to

328
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,240
take one disciple in my life.

329
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,590
If you call me master once again,

330
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,590
I won't consider accepting Qiu Yuebai
as my disciple.

331
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,120
What do you think,

332
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,680
Cui Chen?

333
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,360
Liar.

334
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,070
He looks down on me
and won't let me take a disciple.

335
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,000
Sweet Dumpling, liar.

336
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,440
I will take him.

337
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,510
I must take him.

338
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:11,680
I'm sorry.

339
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,630
I can't take you as my disciple.

340
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,680
Why?

341
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,680
Did I do something wrong

342
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,750
or offend Mr. Cui?

343
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,320
You didn't.

344
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,070
It has nothing to do with you.
It's my fault.

345
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,950
Sweet Dumpling is right.

346
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,190
I haven't reached the virtuoso phase.

347
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,120
According to the rules
of the Qingyuan Sect,

348
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,560
I can't take disciples.

349
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,800
As for Sweet Dumpling,

350
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,880
don't mind him.

351
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,390
That's what he is. He has a poker face.

352
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,190
It's OK. I don't mind him.

353
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,440
Master, come in and have a cup of tea.

354
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,150
Don't call me master.

355
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,040
Master, I can wait,

356
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,440
as long as

357
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,800
you allow me to follow you.

358
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,510
Master, have some tea.

359
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,950
I told you not to call me master.

360
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,480
I'm a rookie who has just
reached the foundation phase.

361
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,710
I'm unable to bear the title.

362
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,390
You'd better call me Tantan.

363
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,120
Tantan.

364
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,000
Moreover,

365
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,590
if you follow me,

366
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,270
how can you manage your inn chain?

367
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:07,880
I...

368
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,390
I don't have to work indoors every day.

369
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,150
Also, if I follow Master,

370
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:12,880
Tantan,

371
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,270
when we travel around,

372
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,510
I can conveniently

373
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,240
inspect my inns.

374
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:22,320
Do you have Seven Nights Inns
everywhere in the country?

375
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,070
Almost everywhere.

376
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,710
And when we travel around,

377
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,830
we have places to stay.

378
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,950
Moreover, there are many people
coming and going at my inns.

379
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,750
We can easily inquire about information.

380
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,390
Do you know the Seven-Leaf Lotus?

381
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,320
I think I've heard of it.

382
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,680
To be honest,

383
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,320
I'm looking for the seed

384
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,950
of the Seven-Leaf Lotus.

385
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:49,190
Since the Seven Nights Inn is famous,

386
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,590
could you help me look for the seed?

387
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,630
Well...

388
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,390
There should be no problem.

389
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,880
Then let's get some rest tonight.

390
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,240
OK.

391
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,560
Great.

392
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,710
Tomorrow we can start off secretly
without Sweet Dumpling's knowledge.

393
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,070
Master,

394
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,040
isn't Mr. Cui with you?

395
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,830
I'm not with him.

396
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,070
Are you eavesdropping on us?

397
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,440
The golden fox?

398
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,680
Has the fox appeared?

399
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,390
Just in time.

400
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,270
We'll catch him soon,

401
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,560
then we can go back.

402
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,150
I heard that someone wanted

403
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,950
to take a stranger she just met

404
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,080
to look for the treasure
of the Qingyuan Sect?

405
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,630
Can you still deny eavesdropping on us?

406
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,870
Mr. Cui, are you suspecting me?

407
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,800
Yeah, I'm suspecting you.

408
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,990
My junior sister just left the mountain

409
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:17,230
and can't tell a good person
from a bad.

410
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:19,840
Never left the mountain before.

411
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,350
Can't recognize a bad person.

412
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,390
You, bad.

413
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,230
Qiu, good.

414
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,230
You're either frosty or sneering.

415
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,990
Do you think you're great,
Mu Bai Zhenren?

416
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,960
You always think you're smarter
than others.

417
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,200
I'm taking Qiu to look for the seed.

418
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,040
You'd better take me.

419
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,320
You?

420
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:44,840
What can you do?

421
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,110
Qiu can help me find the seed.

422
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,440
Can you?

423
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,150
Let me ask you.

424
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,200
If there is a person in this world

425
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:53,390
who can pinpoint the Seven-Leaf Lotus,

426
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,960
is it possible that this person

427
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,440
is the guardian of the lotus?

428
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:05,920
Cui Chen, why don't we get in
for a cup of tea

429
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,920
and have a little chat?

430
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,470
Come on.

431
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:09,800
Come.

432
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,680
Come.

433
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,750
Please have some tea.

434
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,350
OK.

435
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,510
Be careful. It's hot.

436
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,110
OK.

437
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,560
Cui Chen,

438
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:53,990
who do you think should get the seed
after we find it?

439
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,350
I see.

440
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,040
A man of your moral character

441
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,200
would humbly yield to your junior sister

442
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,270
and give it to her.

443
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,230
It depends.

444
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,960
We'll talk about it
after we find the seed.

445
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,560
How precise is your positioning

446
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,040
of the lotus seed?

447
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,630
Do you feel the seed scent is coming

448
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,230
from all directions now?

449
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,350
Did you eat garlic?

450
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,680
Your mouth smells like garlic.

451
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,510
Shut up.

452
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,230
How about this,

453
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,510
I'll confirm the general location

454
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,040
of the seed through my inns.

455
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,350
Then Mr. Cui can locate

456
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,840
their exact position.

457
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,350
That's right.

458
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,320
You two make a great match.

459
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,630
Come.

460
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:52,800
Come.

461
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,470
I declare that from today on,

462
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,560
you two are locked together.

463
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,680
From now on,

464
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,750
we're the golden group
in search of the lotus seed.

465
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,470
Let's hit the road together.

466
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,560
Here.

467
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,800
You insisted on coming along. Hurry!

468
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,350
After we find the golden fox...

469
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:27,080
We'll set out!

470
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:46,270
It's been a long time
since I've been so full.

471
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:56,990
What are you doing, Mr. Cui?

472
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,390
What's your purpose

473
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,720
for following us all the way?

474
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,440
Because I want Tantan to be my master.

475
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:03,600
Really?

476
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,680
Do you believe it?

477
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,150
(What are they mumbling about?)

478
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,230
A good young man is wooing
a fair maiden he loves.

479
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:13,840
I have another idea
besides seeking guidance.

480
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,200
Do you think you have a chance?

481
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,440
Is it because you cultivators
are forbidden to fall in love,

482
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,560
or your sect forbids marriage,

483
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,350
or you've fallen for her too?

484
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:36,200
(Aren't they at odds with each other?)

485
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,560
(What are they plotting?)

486
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,470
(Or is Cui Chen)

487
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,390
(trying to steal my disciple?)

488
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,200
Qiu Yuebai, drop your idea
before it's too late.

489
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,920
We both have a chance.

490
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,990
Let's play fair.

491
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,440
Cui Chen?

492
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,750
You're good.

493
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,080
What do you mean?

494
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,800
I know everything.

495
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,510
Don't worry, I won't tell Master.

496
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,470
Tantan.

497
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,390
Mr. Cui.

498
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:27,920
Morning.

499
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:28,720
Morning, Qiu.

500
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:29,270
Please.

501
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:30,840
OK.

502
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,390
Please.

503
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,040
You sit here.

504
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,470
Give it to me.

505
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:48,680
Come.

506
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,150
Sit.

507
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,040
Sit.

508
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,960
Here, Tantan.

509
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:08,510
This is more irresistible than yesterday.

510
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,270
But why are there no other guests?

511
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,800
I've booked the whole inn.

512
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,390
I don't know what you like,

513
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,040
so I just prepared some ordinary food.

514
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,510
I like them all.

515
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,470
Mr. Cui, why don't you eat?

516
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,560
Isn't the food to your taste?

517
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:25,560
I'm not hungry.

518
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,470
Don't resist anymore.

519
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,470
You haven't eaten since yesterday.

520
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,870
Do you want to die from hunger?

521
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:01,960
Qiu,

522
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:04,200
why did you order their roast chicken?

523
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,110
I didn't.

524
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,680
This chicken isn't for eating.

525
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,800
Gentlemen, would you do me a little favor

526
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,510
and advertise this chicken?

527
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,600
Advertise?

528
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,600
Of course.

529
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,350
I have the final say on their business.

530
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:27,560
But they won't advertise it for free.

531
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,960
If Mr. Butterfly and Mr. Qiu

532
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,870
advertise the roasted chicken for me,

533
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:38,350
the three of you

534
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,560
will get free accommodation for life.

535
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,680
Let's do it.

536
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,320
Mr. Fox, we love you!

537
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,510
Our eternal god!

538
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,990
[Most Handsome Fox]
Mr. Fox.

539
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,150
Mr. Fox.

540
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:50,870
You're the best.

541
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,560
We love you.

542
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,200
Mr. Fox.

543
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:54,600
Stop.

544
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:57,960
Mr. Fox.

545
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,230
Aren't you the guy
who made little cookies

546
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,560
in the hamster hole?

547
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,080
What's your name?

548
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,870
Zhong Zhuangyuan.

549
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:06,750
Yeah.

550
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:07,920
Well,

551
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,750
what are you doing?

552
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,560
What's the meaning of your slogan?

553
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:12,270
You!

554
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:15,040
Didn't you promise to work hard?

555
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,800
I'm working hard

556
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,750
in my own way.

557
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,270
That day, I was lucky
to hear your teachings,

558
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,720
and I finally figured it out.

559
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,440
I should only wink

560
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,110
at those who appreciate beauty.

561
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,320
The golden fox knows me best.

562
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,630
OK. You keep winking

563
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,920
and making little cookies.

564
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,230
But what's wrong with these guys?

565
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,870
They also want the golden fox

566
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:38,560
to take them home.

567
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,800
What's wrong with you guys?

568
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,800
He isn't the golden fox.

569
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,560
And I drove him away, didn't I?

570
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,040
We firmly believe

571
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,920
that no matter the fox
or hamster spirit,

572
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,720
he will make a comeback

573
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,750
and take us home.

574
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,920
Mr. Fox, I love you.

575
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,720
Mr. Fox.

576
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,230
Did you see that?

577
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,200
I think they may piss off

578
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,350
the golden fox today.

579
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:04,840
They have no taste at all.

580
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,110
I pity

581
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,470
the real golden fox.

582
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:11,230
Unfortunately,
all people in this society

583
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,720
despise labor
and want to take shortcuts.

584
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,600
If you fail a career,
you can start over,

585
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,320
but if you fail as a human,
you're hopeless.

586
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,600
Qiu, you're definitely a successful man.

587
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,750
Good point!

588
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:20,800
What's good?

589
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:21,720
Why is it good?

590
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,870
I think it depends.

591
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,510
Not everyone is worth helping.

592
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,390
But
some people are indeed worth helping.

593
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,080
Someone who is ignorant of the trend

594
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,390
isn't worth helping.

595
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,560
Mr. Cui, you're right.

596
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,270
After all, you've helped me before.

597
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,470
Do you think I know the trend?

598
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,150
Give me one piece.

599
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,110
Give me one piece.

600
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:39,560
Let me grab it.

601
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,200
This is mine.

602
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,270
- Mine.
- Mine.

603
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:42,800
Don't grab.

604
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,750
What does it say?

605
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:54,920
The real golden fox will hold

606
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,080
a clarification conference

607
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,990
at the square of Yunlai Town tonight.

608
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,440
The fox is handed to us on a plate

609
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,840
when we're worrying
about where to find him.

610
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,040
Mr. Qiu,

611
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,840
it's our job

612
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,870
to catch the golden fox.

613
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,470
We're not going to bother you.

614
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,560
Though I don't know magic arts,

615
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,230
I know everything
about the laws of the world.

616
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,510
I can do my bit.

617
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,110
OK.

618
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,040
I hope you'll impress me

619
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,390
with your bit.

620
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,800
What are you talking about?

621
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,870
Hurry up. Let's go get a seat.

622
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,750
Let's go.

623
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,320
Hurry.

624
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:37,350
Tantan is so cute. Don't you think so?

625
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,870
It's right ahead.

626
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:53,080
When will it begin?

627
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,390
I'm so tired.

628
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:02,720
What's wrong with you?

629
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,870
Bird and Flower are here too.

630
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,720
It's OK. I'm with you.

631
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,390
Hurry up.

632
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:12,990
When will he come?

633
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,600
When will he show up?

634
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:16,440
He'll be right here.

635
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,440
We all come to see Mr. Fox.

636
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:20,870
Sure.

637
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,840
- Good!
- Great!

638
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,040
Miss Fox?

639
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,600
Miss Fox?

640
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,200
Miss Fox!

641
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,470
The golden fox?

642
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,470
I heard that someone in town
impersonated me.

643
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,150
If anyone dares to slander me again,

644
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,350
I won't spare them.

645
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,320
Do you understand?

646
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,200
That move looks familiar.

647
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,680
Get out of here quickly.

648
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,840
Miss Fox, take us home.

649
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,630
Miss Fox.

650
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,960
Yeah, take us home.

651
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,800
- Take us home.
- Miss Fox.

652
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,800
Miss Fox.

653
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,230
You people have arms and legs,

654
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,680
but still, you try to live off a fox

655
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,990
in the prime of your lives.

656
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,680
Don't you want to come with me?

657
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,630
Let me teach you a lesson.

658
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,680
Is she the golden fox?

659
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,560
I've heard of the nine-tailed fox.

660
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,920
This is the first time
I've seen an eight-tailed fox.

661
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,750
What a waste of time!

662
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:27,600
Go.

663
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,470
Wait here.

664
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,600
Tantan.

665
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:54,720
Yunlai Inn?

666
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,040
Is it her?

667
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,270
I'm beautiful,

668
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:09,800
right?

669
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,600
You're my favorite.

670
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:19,270
Who's your favorite?

671
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:20,510
You...

672
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:21,350
You guys...

673
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:22,870
Want to do what?

674
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,750
Golden Fox,
we've had a hard time finding you.

675
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,150
Miss, I don't know
what you're talking about.

676
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:37,920
Stop pretending.

677
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,720
You're not going to admit it

678
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,870
until I make you
show your true form, right?

679
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,270
My Mirror!

680
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:50,350
Look at this.

681
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,720
What are you going to do?

682
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,510
The mirror is important to me.
Give it back.

683
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,510
I'm not doing anything.

684
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:57,600
I'm just thinking it's a nice mirror.

685
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:59,990
It should sound pleasant when it breaks.

686
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,870
[Yunlai Inn]

687
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:05,200
Let's not lose heart.

688
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:05,990
We must hold out

689
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,800
until Miss Fox accepts us.

690
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:11,390
Miss Fox, we'll be waiting for you.

691
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,040
We'll be waiting for you.

692
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,150
- Miss Fox.
- Miss Fox.

693
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,870
You're disturbing us. Stop yelling!

694
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,840
Tantan, tell me

695
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,510
about the golden fox.

696
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,800
It's a pity you didn't see it.

697
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,560
Luckily, I was there.

698
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,350
Otherwise, it would have been a tragedy.

699
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:27,270
Her eight tails

700
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,110
were flapping and swishing.

701
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,560
She suddenly descended from the sky.

702
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,470
With a wave of her hand,
she threw Sweet Dumpling into the air.

703
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,200
I grabbed her by the neck

704
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,080
and held her in the air.

705
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,990
Aren't I awesome?

706
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,230
(She is getting better and better
at bragging.)

707
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,560
I beat that fox up

708
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,470
with only ten percent of my force.

709
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,680
How I wish I were there

710
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,320
to witness your power.

711
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,320
And then?

712
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,680
She knew she couldn't get away from me.

713
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,230
So she went all out.

714
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:01,680
But how could she intimidate me?

715
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:04,960
I immediately took out the demon rope
and tied her up.

716
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,630
(She should thank me for helping her.)

717
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,320
Sweet Dumpling, look out!

718
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,800
Not until we subdued the fox,

719
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,080
did we know she had a painful secret.

720
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,560
In fact, I have a lover.

721
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,270
But he went missing.

722
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,840
I ran the inn in such a high-profile way

723
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,270
in the hope that one day
he would come to see me.

724
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:48,630
You may leave.

725
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,040
Take this.

726
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,920
That's what happened.

727
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,840
That's the whole process.

728
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,270
So the golden fox
is the owner of Yunlai Inn.

729
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:01,800
We've settled the matter of the fox now.

730
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,990
We shouldn't stay here for long.

731
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:05,270
So, Master,

732
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:05,920
Mr. Cui,

733
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,040
you stay here for now.

734
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,080
I've sent Mo Yan
to ask about the lotus seed.

735
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:09,040
We'll hear from him soon.

736
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,270
Really?

737
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:10,840
Yes.

738
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,800
Great. Thanks, Qiu.

739
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:13,720
Don't mention it.
