00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:30,990
Master.

191
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:33,280
You're from
the Tianyin Palace, Bird and...

192
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:33,600
No,

193
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,960
Miao Yu, Hua Xiang.

194
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,430
My fellow cultivators.

195
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,430
Sorry to be late.

196
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,190
Do you want some tea?

197
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,080
No need.

198
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:42,720
A few days ago, your disciple intervened

199
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,110
and took away the locust tree spirit
that belongs to the Tianyin Palace.

200
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,040
Do you know about this?

201
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,430
I know a little about it.

202
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,920
But I heard that you two didn't want it,

203
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,670
that's why my untalented disciple

204
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,750
took advantage of it.

205
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,600
- No, Master...
- Take advantage of it?

206
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,430
That was robbing.

207
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,480
You know what,

208
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,990
if you don't give us
the locust tree spirit,

209
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,670
we...

210
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,190
We won't spare you.

211
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,310
Why should I give him to you?

212
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,110
I caught him on my own.

213
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,280
Why should I give him to you?

214
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,600
Fine, let's do the math.

215
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,840
Did I catch the locust tree spirit?

216
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,040
Since I did,

217
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,360
this is called upholding justice.

218
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,400
But after I caught him,

219
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,400
you want him.

220
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,480
Then this is called outsourcing.

221
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,720
As my client,

222
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,840
you should pay the deposit,

223
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,190
travel expenses, and remuneration.

224
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,920
By the way, the locust tree spirit

225
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,040
rented a house on the backside
of our mountain.

226
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,400
The lease is for 300 years.

227
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,670
He can leave with you,

228
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,400
but you have to pay the rent first.

229
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,230
That's right.

230
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:35,520
Go ahead.

231
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,040
You...

232
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,360
Don't waste with them.

233
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,310
She talked so much just to confuse us.

234
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,920
You won't give him to us?
We'll just take him away.

235
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,080
Take him away.

236
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:44,840
Who's causing trouble here?

237
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:45,630
Mu Bai.

238
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,670
My goodness.

239
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,920
It's Mu Bai Zhenren!

240
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,160
Don't be so surprised.

241
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,160
Today we're debt collectors, not fans.

242
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,310
(He's a complete scammer.)

243
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,310
(God knows why he has so many fans.)

244
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,040
You guys, though the Qingyuan Sect
keeps a low profile,

245
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,790
it doesn't mean
anyone can act recklessly here.

246
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,670
Let's fight him together.
Do you have the confidence?

247
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,600
We better leave a way out.

248
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,110
Cultivators should
take the righteous path,

249
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,110
fight against evil and uphold justice.

250
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:18,720
- Does it matter who caught the spirit?
- (What a hypocrite.)

251
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,720
Of course it does.

252
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,520
This is about our sect's reputation.

253
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,080
But since you say so,

254
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,360
we'll do you this favor.

255
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,190
We'll do you this favor.

256
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,310
You can have the locust tree spirit.

257
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,520
That's great.

258
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:30,390
Master.

259
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,390
Harmony makes money.

260
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,390
But

261
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,150
there's a golden fox down the mountain

262
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,830
who has abducted many people.

263
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,510
Since you won't give us
the locust tree spirit,

264
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,360
then catch the golden fox for us.

265
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,880
That way, we'll consider
the matter settled.

266
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,830
(It means I can go down the mountain
to find lotus seeds.)

267
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,560
(By then,
I'll be the light of Qingyuan.)

268
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,360
Okay.

269
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,000
It's just a fox.

270
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,800
I'll catch it for you.

271
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,440
You...

272
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,590
- Tantan.
- Okay.

273
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,070
The 15th of this month is the deadline.

274
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,480
If you don't give us the fox,

275
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,190
the Qingyuan Sect won't spare you!

276
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,590
The Tianyin Palace.

277
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,360
Yeah!

278
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,630
Take care. We won't walk you out.

279
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,320
Zhao Tantan.

280
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,070
Your mouth is faster than your brain.

281
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,510
You just can't change that.

282
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,120
Foxes are cunning by nature.

283
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,710
The golden fox is well-cultivated.

284
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,360
Are you sure you can handle it?

285
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,630
Can it be more cunning than you?

286
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,070
Look,

287
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:25,070
I can capture
a thousand-year-old locust tree spirit,

288
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:27,040
let alone a golden fox.

289
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,440
Do you want to put poison
in its porridge

290
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,270
and force it to comply?

291
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,120
- You...
- Don't.

292
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,920
Never mind. I'm just too powerful

293
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,150
and too responsible.

294
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,680
Since you've made a promise,

295
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,320
I'll do it for you.

296
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,390
First, I've never acknowledged you
as my senior.

297
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,630
Second, I don't need your help.

298
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,560
You just want to steal my thunder.

299
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,710
Do you think I don't know that?

300
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,320
Do you have any thunder to be stolen?

301
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,680
Master!

302
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,270
Fine.

303
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,320
If you don't believe me,

304
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,270
let's have a match.

305
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,750
If I win, let me go down the mountain.

306
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,680
All right. I'm having a headache.

307
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,480
Just work it out yourselves.

308
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,360
Let's go.

309
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,750
Tantan.

310
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,000
In terms of cultivation,

311
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:19,590
I suggest you stay here
and spend another hundred years on it.

312
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,750
Who said
I want to compete in cultivation?

313
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,830
I think Tantan will win.

314
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,070
Why?

315
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,830
She never blinks when she lies.

316
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,190
How would she lose?

317
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,630
Come on, Tantan.

318
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,390
Bravo, Mu Bai!

319
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,710
Bravo, Mu Bai!

320
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,190
It's just my usual performance.

321
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,190
Tantan, you lost.

322
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,590
Who told you I lost?

323
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,040
Two out of three.

324
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,710
Come on.

325
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,830
I didn't do it.

326
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,510
It was you. It's on you.

327
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,590
Sweet Dumpling, I won.

328
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,680
Okay, one win for each.

329
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,560
Let's call it a draw.

330
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,470
Well,

331
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,320
winning you is too easy.

332
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,110
It'll bring me no honor even if I win.

333
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,630
How about this, for the final round,

334
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,720
let's play something exciting.

335
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,990
Well, are you scared?

336
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:20,720
If you're scared, just admit defeat.

337
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,080
It's nothing.
There's no shame in losing.

338
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,870
Two out of three. Whatever you say.

339
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:29,680
Come closer.

340
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,680
You know the transformation instrument

341
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,270
that Master carries
in his arms every night.

342
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,800
It costs a silver coin just to touch it.

343
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,800
Starting midnight tonight,

344
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,720
before one incense stick burns out,

345
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,840
whoever gets it first wins.

346
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,040
Who is it?

347
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,200
Master.

348
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,510
It's me.

349
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,800
You scared me.

350
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:03,990
It's late.

351
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,920
Can't you take care of it yourself?

352
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,470
Master, I need to borrow
your transformation instrument.

353
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:11,960
Thank you.

354
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:13,510
Hurry up.

355
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,870
What is she doing here?

356
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,270
Master isn't here.

357
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,390
Sweet Dumpling
didn't follow me here, either.

358
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,080
It's a lucky break for me.

359
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,390
What does she want?

360
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,560
I don't know.

361
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,990
It's strange. Last time,

362
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,230
I saw Master hide it in the bedroom.

363
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,080
You're still cooing.

364
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,750
What are you cooing about?

365
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,350
Tantan asked me to tell her the time.

366
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,510
The incense is half burned.

367
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,920
Half of the time has passed.

368
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,350
I don't know how she is doing in there.

369
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,350
Has Sweet Dumpling taken it away?

370
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,960
Zhao Tantan.

371
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,350
Don't panic.

372
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,510
You're the light of Qingyuan.

373
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,800
It's been a while.

374
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,510
Don't take it that seriously.

375
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:11,990
Wait.

376
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:12,470
Hold on.

377
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:13,230
Just for a while.

378
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,750
Master, where did you hide it?

379
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,110
Could it be that someone told him

380
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,350
and moved it overnight?

381
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:23,040
But I've been guarding here

382
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,510
and I didn't see Master take it out.

383
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,750
It must still be in this room.

384
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,510
Master, where did you put it?

385
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,270
I cherish the all-nourishing bolus
so much

386
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,800
that I haven't even taken one
in half a year.

387
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,510
She...

388
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,600
Master, don't worry.

389
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,960
I'll make some more for you.

390
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:49,750
Really?

391
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,990
You're the best.

392
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,040
It's a deal.

393
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,040
Xueyi!

394
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,510
Hurry up!

395
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,270
Hurry!

396
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,150
Xueyi!

397
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,800
Hurry!

398
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:00,800
Tantan, hurry up!

399
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,230
Xueyi!

400
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,320
Go ahead.

401
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,720
Time's up.

402
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,560
Congratulations to Zhao Tantan
for winning.

403
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,270
My mistake.

404
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,350
Well,

405
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,510
Now you lost fair and square,
Sweet Dumpling.

406
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,960
A bet is a bet.

407
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:37,750
Xueyi.

408
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,560
Come on.

409
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,800
How is it?

410
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,960
I flew hundreds of miles day and night.

411
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:42,630
Along the way,

412
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,150
I lost several feathers,

413
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,270
which made my heart break.

414
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:46,630
Finally, I arrived at Yunlai Town.

415
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,440
To avoid being recognized,

416
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,990
I asked around by foot.

417
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,150
My legs almost gave out.

418
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,470
Normally, I use my wings.

419
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,150
[The 3rd Husband Selection in Yunlai]
I've never made my legs suffer
like that.

420
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,510
They're even growing muscles.

421
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,560
Guess what I see?

422
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,230
What?

423
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,920
I see a lot of beautiful flowers.

424
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,750
The red ones are like fire.

425
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:00,390
The pink ones are like haze.

426
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,320
The white ones are like snow.

427
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:02,750
Get to the point.

428
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,800
Well, Bird and Flower are right.

429
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,150
There has been
a golden fox in town lately.

430
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,230
Rumor has it

431
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,510
that it's a male

432
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,870
who likes to abduct handsome men.

433
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,270
Many scholars in town
have mysteriously disappeared lately.

434
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,870
The good thing is
a family member of one scholar

435
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,230
happened to see it.

436
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:19,110
Look.

437
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,840
He was studying in the courtyard.

438
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,110
I heard strange noises outside,

439
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,630
then I opened the door

440
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,230
and saw my son being abducted
by a monster.

441
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,110
It was a fox

442
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,840
with a golden face.

443
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,040
Look, these are the footprints it left.

444
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:38,990
Right here.

445
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,560
The footprints are here.

446
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,230
It's said that the golden fox is fierce

447
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,920
and difficult to deal with.

448
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,440
If we can't fight it,

449
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,800
let's use wit.

450
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,440
How?

451
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,800
Zhao Tantan's Strategies say,

452
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,040
'If you don't sacrifice the child,
you can't catch the wolf.'

453
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,320
There is another saying,

454
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:09,750
'If you throw a meat bun at a dog,
you won't get it back.'

455
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:14,040
You're too small-minded.

456
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,840
Zhao Tantan's Strategies also say,

457
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,750
'The beauty strategy always works.'

458
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,630
Beauty?

459
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,920
Where?

460
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:23,920
The final strategy of Zhao Tantan is

461
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,320
to make the best use of what you have.

462
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,600
Do you understand?

463
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,680
You get it, right?

464
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,990
No.

465
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,230
Look.

466
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,510
This is where
the black-hearted Sweet Dumpling

467
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,040
[The 3rd Husband Selection in Yunlai]
comes in.

468
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,320
It's not mealtime yet.

469
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,600
Is there anything?

470
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:09,920
Well,

471
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:12,870
I noticed that you've been
cultivating hard recently.

472
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,390
So I made some snacks for you.

473
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,350
Bravo!

474
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,630
The ending gesture is amazing.

475
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,800
I'm truly impressed and feel inadequate.

476
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,800
If you can't flatter properly,
then don't do it.

477
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,510
Just get to the point.

478
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,080
How can you say that?

479
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,390
Don't think of me so badly.

480
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,390
You're here for the golden fox, right?

481
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,350
That's why you're the light of Qingyuan.

482
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,510
Very perceptive.

483
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:55,920
I'm truly impressed.

484
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:14,960
Well, to be honest,

485
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,600
the Tianyin Palace

486
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:19,270
has been picking on us

487
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,350
due to our sect's weak position.

488
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,230
They'll make a big deal out of
the golden fox this time.

489
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,800
If we don't catch it,

490
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,200
they won't let us off.

491
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:34,080
So, I have a favor to ask you.

492
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,230
What kind of favor?

493
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:39,510
I want to borrow you.

494
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:40,510
Who?

495
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:41,840
You.

496
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,840
Who am I?

497
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,150
Cui Chen.

498
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,080
Mu Bai Zhenren.

499
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:45,990
The light of Qingyuan.

500
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,680
Why would I do that?

501
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,230
Who am I to you?

502
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:53,750
(Those who achieve great things
can take temporary setbacks.)

503
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:55,990
(Zhao Tantan, you can do it.)

504
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,230
Senior.

505
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,270
What?

506
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,560
Don't push it.

507
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,320
I'm a valuable person.

508
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,840
Since you're valuable,

509
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:16,560
wouldn't it be a waste not to be used?

510
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,150
It's not that I don't want to help you.

511
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,960
Look at my arm.

512
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,990
It's not healed yet.

513
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:25,800
Look.

514
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,150
(You sanctimonious
black-hearted Sweet Dumpling.)

515
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,800
(One day I'll expose you)

516
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:36,870
(and make everyone in the Qingyuan Sect)

517
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,510
(see your true colors.)

518
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,680
Senior.

519
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,200
Master said

520
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,630
you cultivate

521
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,440
as fast as setting firecrackers.

522
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,630
This little injury

523
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,470
is nothing to you.

524
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,750
Besides, let's not bother Master

525
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,600
with such a little thing.

526
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,990
If you're willing to step forward,

527
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,800
I'll lend a helping hand.

528
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:08,320
How's that?

529
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,390
I remember someone was afraid
I'd steal her thunder.

530
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:12,680
To stop me from doing it,
she even made a bet.

531
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,080
Do you know who it is?

532
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,720
(Impatience will upset great plans.)

533
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,630
(I'll endure it.)

534
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,110
I was kidding.

535
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,470
Look, I'm here
to ask for your help in person.

536
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,750
Are you not afraid of me
stealing your thunder?

537
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,150
Are you done?

538
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,990
I haven't made you pay
for what you did last time.

539
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,390
Last time?

540
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,040
Cui Chen!

541
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,390
Did you trick me into coming here

542
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,840
just to drown me?

543
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,680
You rascal!

544
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,110
Last time, didn't I...?

545
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,680
Are you gonna help me or not?

546
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,510
Forget it.

547
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,470
I'll do it.

548
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,870
As the senior of the Qingyuan Sect,

549
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,680
I must take responsibility.

550
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:01,800
I can go down the mountain,

551
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,270
but you have to promise me one thing.

552
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,960
No problem.

553
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:06,960
Just go ahead.

554
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,800
I haven't figured it out yet.

555
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,110
I'll save it

556
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,750
and tell you one day.

557
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:15,470
Okay.

558
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,560
A promise is a promise.

559
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,800
