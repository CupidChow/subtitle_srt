But you shouldn't confess to him.

184

00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,360
when wine is in, truth is out.

191
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,190
Bad idea.

192
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,560
It's not a bad idea.

193
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,240
Yeah.

194
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,150
A man like Cui Chen
who usually looks superior,

195
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,270
serious,

196
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,710
and only cares for the common people
in the world

197
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,560
does need a drink.

198
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,240
OK.

199
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,830
I'll get Cui Chen drunk today

200
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,920
and make him confess to me.

201
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,190
Come on.

202
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:32,710
Xueyi,

203
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,240
does that look like Uncle Zi Meng?

204
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:34,750
Yes.

205
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,270
Do you want it?

206
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,320
I want this.

207
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,320
What do you want?

208
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,390
Fish?

209
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,240
I want this.

210
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:40,950
Cui Chen,

211
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,510
shall we go guess the lantern riddles?

212
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,560
- OK.
- I'll go with you.

213
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,560
Mr. Qiu, why don't you come with us?

214
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,360
Come on. Come with me.

215
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,270
Go, Tantan.

216
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:55,750
Go.

217
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:56,750
Oh, I...

218
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,710
Have a look.

219
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,070
This.

220
00:11:59,070 --> 00:11:59,920
I don't want it.

221
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,150
See you next time.

222
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,880
Sir,

223
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,830
do you have that kind of riddle?

224
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:08,750
What kind?

225
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,480
Yes.

226
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,270
All my riddles are that kind of riddle.

227
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,270
Take your time.

228
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,510
Cui Chen, let's guess the riddles.

229
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,440
Who guesses all the riddles correctly

230
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,000
will be rewarded
with a string of candied haws.

231
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,440
OK.

232
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,040
Let me pick one.

233
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,120
This one.

234
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,480
I went to buy oysters today.

235
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,680
On my way back,

236
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,880
the oysters jumped down one by one

237
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,190
and went into the earth.

238
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,750
Then I thought,

239
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,680
"This must be..."

240
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,240
What is it, Cui Chen?

241
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:58,590
I can't guess.

242
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,150
It's...

243
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,040
Why do you give up before even thinking?

244
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,240
Guess again.

245
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,800
Let me guess.

246
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,150
I still can't guess.

247
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,270
Oysters like earth.

248
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,630
What?

249
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,400
I like you.

250
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,600
I like you.

251
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,270
I like you!

252
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,600
Do you hear me?

253
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,790
Are you confessing to me?

254
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,440
No way.

255
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,440
I'm telling you the answer.

256
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,270
Next one.

257
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,320
OK.

258
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:44,640
This one.

259
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:50,760
Once upon a time,
there was a lotus named Super.

260
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,230
She had a neighbor called You.

261
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:56,960
One day, Super confessed to You.

262
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,400
She said...

263
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:58,910
Enough, Tantan.

264
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,760
Your rustic words of love

265
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,320
have been out of date for 100 years.

266
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,110
So you knew about it already?

267
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,670
Why did you pretend not to know?

268
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,640
You're obviously doing it on purpose.

269
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,760
I know you like strings of candied haws.

270
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,400
I was going to buy you one.

271
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,150
I don't want it.

272
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,790
Really?

273
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,080
Yeah.

274
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,960
Your actions are more honest
than your words.

275
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,320
Any of your favorites?

276
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,350
Cui Chen, I want this bracelet.

277
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,110
Sir, count us in.

278
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,470
Participants must be a couple.
Is that OK?

279
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,000
It's OK.

280
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,520
And this gentleman, is that OK for you?

281
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,000
Cui Chen, isn't that OK?

282
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,000
There's a pharmacy.

283
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,440
Let's go get some tonic for Master

284
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,910
and take it back to the Qingyuan Sect.

285
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,590
Cui Chen!

286
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:04,640
Cui Chen.

287
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,080
Cui Chen.

288
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,280
We can buy the tonic later.

289
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,440
I'll take you to a place first.

290
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,640
What place?

291
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:15,760
This way, sir.

292
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,320
Cui Chen,

293
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:20,230
we should have a drink
on such a beautiful day.

294
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,550
Excuse me, a pot of wine.

295
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,590
Yes.

296
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,550
Master said you used to steal wine
when you were little.

297
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:27,710
Are you craving for wine again?

298
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,470
Yes, I am.

299
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,760
Where are the other guys?

300
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,150
Don't worry about them.
Let's drink ourselves.

301
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,670
OK, then.

302
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,110
What a coincidence.

303
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,670
(What is he doing here?)

304
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,760
(How can I carry out my plan now?)

305
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,960
Qiu, why are you here?

306
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,030
Don't you want me to be here?

307
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:52,440
No.

308
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,710
Sir, here's your wine.

309
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,640
I happen to feel like a drink.
Let's drink together.

310
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,400
No.

311
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:15,440
Tantan.

312
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,400
Tantan, can't I?

313
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,710
It's not impossible.

314
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,710
Yes.

315
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,110
It's the Double Seventh Day.

316
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,350
Let's not waste this beautiful day.

317
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,440
OK.

318
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,280
Mr. Qiu, would you tell me

319
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,470
how we drink the wine?

320
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,710
Why don't we play a wager game

321
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,880
and compose poems about the festival?

322
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,400
I'm not good at that.

323
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,670
Let's just drink.

324
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,030
I'll drink first.

325
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:50,790
Slow down.

326
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,200
Why does Qiu Yuebai
have to join in the fun?

327
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,200
Fun?

328
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,680
Fun. Where is it?

329
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:05,590
Nothing.

330
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You guys go ahead.

331
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,520
Xueyi and I will catch up with you
after an act.

332
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,520
Go.

333
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,110
How can you sneak a drink

334
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,760
behind our backs?

335
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,760
Tantan.

336
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,160
How can you drink without me?

337
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,590
Well, since you're here, join us.

338
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:29,590
OK.

339
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,950
Let's not return without getting drunk.

340
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,880
One pot of wine
isn't enough for all of us.

341
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,920
Excuse me, one pot for each of us!

342
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,950
Yes.

343
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,470
Mr. Qiu,

344
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,430
I haven't got a chance to thank you.

345
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,160
You kindly took over my Yunlai Inn,

346
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,920
otherwise, I would lose all my money.

347
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,560
I can't thank you enough.

348
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,430
I'll drink this wine up.
Please suit yourself.

349
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,070
No.

350
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,280
Miss Hu, you're welcome.

351
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,830
Your properties are in prime locations.

352
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,040
I only made an honest offer.

353
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:57,920
I'll drink a little.

354
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,760
Mr. Qiu, you're not sincere.

355
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,560
I'm not good at drinking.

356
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,800
Mr. Qiu, come on.

357
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,070
Drink, Mr. Qiu.

358
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,040
OK, drink.

359
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:17,560
Good.

360
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:20,800
Mr. Qiu,

361
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,640
I've been worried
since Tantan left the mountain.

362
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,350
Luckily she met you.

363
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,590
Here is to you.

364
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,190
Thanks for taking care of my friend.

365
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:28,760
You're welcome.

366
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,040
OK.

367
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:31,800
Mr. Qiu,

368
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,760
I've heard that you're a gallant man.

369
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,230
Why are you drinking like a girl?

370
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:37,920
Exactly.

371
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,760
Here, one more pot.

372
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,830
Come on.

373
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:41,230
Come on, Mr. Qiu.

374
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,230
Cheers.

375
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,760
Drink it.

376
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,560
Drink, Mr. Qiu.

377
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,280
Here.

378
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:50,470
Mr. Qiu.

379
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,640
No.

380
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,800
I can't.

381
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,680
Mr. Qiu.

382
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:57,160
Mr. Qiu.

383
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:07,070
Mr. Qiu is drunk. I'll take him back.

384
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,280
No.

385
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,040
Wait, Cui Chen.

386
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,680
Sit.

387
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,560
Sit down.

388
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:11,830
Well,

389
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,710
there's still much wine left.

390
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,800
I'll have one more drink.

391
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,590
What's wrong?

392
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,640
How can I possibly get drunk?

393
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,310
Tantan.

394
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,800
You take Tantan back first.

395
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,400
Leave Mr. Qiu to us.

396
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,110
Yeah.

397
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,040
Here.

398
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:29,880
Let me help you.

399
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,710
Be careful.

400
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,280
Then, I'll just...

401
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,560
I'll...

402
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,040
- See you later.
- See you later.

403
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:42,830
Be careful.

404
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:43,520
Waiter.

405
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:44,520
Coming.

406
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,590
Come on. Have a look.

407
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,760
Cui Chen,

408
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,070
I want to hear you sing.

409
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,110
I don't know how to sing.

410
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,000
If you don't sing, I won't let you go.

411
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:01,920
OK. I'll sing.

412
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,400
I'll sing.

413
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,070
(He is so powerful,)

414
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,350
(but he can't even sing in tune.)

415
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,710
(How lovely!)

416
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,880
No, I'm fine.

417
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,110
I want to bask in the moon by the river.

418
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,310
Are you sure you're fine?

419
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,710
OK. If you like,

420
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,310
we'll go bask in the moon by the river.

421
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,560
Look over there.

422
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,230
It's bustling over there.

423
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:34,640
Look.

424
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,350
Look.

425
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,710
Do you think we make a good couple?

426
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,680
Do we?

427
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,590
Be good.

428
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:40,400
Let go.

429
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,160
They say we make a good couple.

430
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:48,710
Cui Chen.

431
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,160
Look, the moon is so big and full.

432
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,710
Yes, the moon is full today.

433
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,760
Look at that one.

434
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,400
It's even bigger and fuller.

435
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,310
I'm going there.

436
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,280
I'm going there.

437
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,760
OK. Be quiet.

438
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,230
Be quiet and still.

439
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,950
We'll go there to bask in the moon, OK?

440
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,160
Look, that one...

441
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,230
Be careful.

442
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,430
Cui Chen, why don't you like me?

443
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:33,830
I...

444
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,800
Why?

445
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,400
Answer me.

446
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,590
Answer me.

447
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,280
Is that

448
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,680
so hard to answer?

449
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,400
Just because one piece of the tangram
is missing,

450
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,950
can't we be together?

451
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,070
I'm sorry.

452
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,640
I'm sorry for causing you so much pain.

453
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,400
In fact, I like you so much.

454
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,190
Really.

455
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,400
I do like you.

456
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:41,470
I don't know since when

457
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,110
I've been thinking about you
all the time.

458
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,600
I remember the way
you eat a string of candied haws,

459
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,710
the way you pout when you get annoyed,

460
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,720
and even the way you stamp your foot

461
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,680
when I piss you off.

462
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,960
But I can't.

463
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:16,000
♪Oh, night and day♪

464
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,270
You know what?

465
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,160
I can make another piece

466
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,000
if one piece of the tangram is missing.

467
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,070
But what I'm really worried about

468
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,430
is that my feelings for you

469
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,030
would bring you bad luck.

470
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,960
If...

471
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,120
If it's going to hurt you,

472
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,710
I'd rather it never starts.

473
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,240
Do I have to take the initiative?

474
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,630
You're not drunk?

475
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,200
Of course not.

476
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,310
Then,

477
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,310
earlier...

478
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,670
What was the first thing you said?

479
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:24,990
The first thing...

480
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:30,560
It doesn't matter
if one piece of the tangram is missing.

481
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,670
I can make another one.

482
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:32,920
Not that one.

483
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,520
The one before.

484
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:36,840
Before?

485
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:40,120
I said I didn't know since when,

486
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,840
I've been thinking about you...

487
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,840
Before.

488
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:47,990
I like you.

489
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,990
Cui Chen, I like you.

490
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:59,560
I know you're worried

491
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,080
and afraid.

492
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,640
But I'm not afraid of anything.

493
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:08,870
You just stay where you are.
I'll do the rest.

494
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,590
Don't back off, OK?

495
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:16,790
No.

496
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:32,590
From now on, you stay where you are.

497
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,950
I'll protect you.

498
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,680
♪If you want it, if I want it♪

499
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:44,960
♪It's a vow of night and day♪

500
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:57,920
♪It's a vow of night and day♪

501
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,030
Sir, Cui Chen and his friends

502
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,200
got a lotus seed from the fox.

503
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,960
They're in Zhu Village now.

504
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,350
How are they doing now?

505
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,510
Zhao Tantan's strength has improved

506
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:18,510
after contacting the lotus seeds.

507
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,510
Cui Chen...

508
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:22,560
I mean, how is their relationship going?

509
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,150
They...

510
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,600
They exchanged love vows
on the Double Seventh Day.

511
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:32,320
This is exactly the same
as 100 years ago.

512
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:37,350
How many petals does the Xilan Flower have
on Cui Chen's forehead?

513
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:41,270
I don't know what flower you refer to.

514
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,200
The flower on his forehead.

515
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:46,990
If I remember correctly,
it should have two petals.

516
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,440
Cui Chen,

517
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:53,150
you can't escape the Xilan Flower Curse.

518
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,920
Let's wait until
the flower has five petals.

519
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,150
What do you mean?

520
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,080
Nothing.

521
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,150
You just follow them closely.

522
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,150
Report to me
if there's anything unusual.

523
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,390
Remember,

524
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,200
don't let anyone hurt them.

525
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:16,110
What's wrong?

526
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,720
Anything else?

527
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,870
I only know

528
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:22,840
that you keep Cui Chen
so that he'll find the lotus seeds.

529
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,200
As for the value of Zhao Tantan...

530
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,270
You don't need to worry about that.

531
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,390
Just follow them closely.

532
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,560
Yes.

533
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:41,440
What's wrong?

534
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,720
It's late.

535
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,920
I don't think you should get in my room.

536
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,230
Yeah.

537
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,320
Well, then.

538
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,750
I'm off.

539
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,560
(Does falling in love)

540
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,510
(make me weak physically?)

541
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,200
(Luckily, it won't affect Tantan.)

542
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,390
Come in.

543
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,110
Cui Chen,

544
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:35,150
do you remember
we still have one more thing to do?

545
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,320
We do have

546
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,870
one more important thing to do.

547
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:50,110
I don't think it's a good idea.

548
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,480
What are you thinking?

549
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,840
I was talking about this.

550
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,030
I was talking about this too.

551
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,800
OK, let's get started.

552
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,150
It won't work
after the Double Seventh Day.

553
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:19,750
OK.

554
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,350
Look, I've put it together.

555
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:52,960
Did you even look at it?

556
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,350
I'm done.

557
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,680
Why are you shy?

558
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,510
Didn't you steal a kiss from me?

559
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,750
Alright.

560
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,320
I was wrong. I won't say it again.

561
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,480
That's more like it.

562
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,390
- Make a wish.
- OK.

563
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,440
I'm done.

564
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:28,920
I'm also done.

565
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,840
What's your wish?

566
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,320
I wish

567
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,600
that no matter what happens,

568
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:45,110
we'll get through it together

569
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,480
and never let go of each other's hands.

570
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:51,800
What's yours?

571
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,720
My wish is...

572
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,630
I won't tell you.

573
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:02,960
It's not fair.

574
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,630
Didn't I tell you mine?

575
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:08,350
I'll tell you what,
you go somewhere with me tomorrow

576
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,320
and I'll tell you.

577
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:12,960
OK.

578
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,510
Don't trip and fall.

579
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:35,920
Tantan,

580
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:37,840
do you know why

581
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,320
I brought you here so early
in the morning?

582
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,800
(Isn't it obvious?)

583
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,870
(Of course I know. It's a date.)

584
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:50,110
It's been a long time
since I've felt so refreshed.

585
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,750
It's clear and windless here.

586
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,560
He's trying to make conversation.

587
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,440
Aren't you the Light of Qingyuan?

588
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:01,150
Hold his hands. Don't put it off.

589
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:04,150
Come on, take the initiative.

590
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,800
I can't.

591
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:09,800
Hu Meng said girls should be reserved.

592
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,230
That's so out-of-date!

593
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,080
Women who take the initiative
are the most fortunate.

594
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,230
- I can't.
- You can.

595
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,800
- I can't.
- You can.

596
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,270
- I can't.
- You can.

597
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:18,960
Enough!

598
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,150
I'll make my own choice.

599
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,510
What's wrong with you?

600
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,200
Nothing.

601
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:39,150
Cui Chen, what were you going to say?

602
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:44,200
I want to say,
it's such a beautiful place,

603
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,200
which is perfect for us to...

604
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,150
Do morning practice.

605
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,510
Do morning practice?

606
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:03,960
Is that why you brought me out

607
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,560
so early in the morning?

608
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:06,920
Or what?

609
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,870
Great.

610
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,600
Practice yourself.

611
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,270
I'm just kidding.

612
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,230
It's a date.

613
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,840
This is our first date.

614
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:26,560
Well, why don't you hold my hands?

615
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,110
I'm holding it now.

616
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,960
Then don't you ever

617
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,350
let go of it.

618
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:40,480
I won't.

619
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,920
You can't even shake me off.

620
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,920
Cui Chen, I want to tell Xueyi
and the others

621
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,350
about us being together.

622
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:51,600
OK.

623
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,030
Don't go back on your word.

624
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,960
Don't drag your heels like before.

625
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,630
I had too many concerns before.

626
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:02,750
I put you through a lot of trouble.

627
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:04,920
I'm sorry.
