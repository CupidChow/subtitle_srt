00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,510
A robber acts like a cop?

191
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,630
If I don't look at her,

192
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,510
can you go get the lotus seed for me?

193
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,000
I...

194
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,070
I'm not just gonna fix my eyes on her.

195
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,630
I'm gonna talk to her alone.

196
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:56,710
Fine.

197
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,320
Here.

198
00:13:59,190 --> 00:13:59,880
Look.

199
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:00,880
What's this?

200
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,560
Forget friendship for women's charms.

201
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,590
What's this?

202
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,270
The anti-pervert powder

203
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,680
I developed with Huai Meng.

204
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,390
I'm sorry.

205
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,390
It's OK.

206
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,680
Did I say anything strange?

207
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,120
I don't remember.

208
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:32,120
I only felt a sour smell drifting to us.

209
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,920
(The Gathering of Fated Marriage
is about to begin.)

210
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,880
The Gathering is going to begin.

211
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,830
(Please prepare to enter.)

212
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:38,190
Let's hurry over
and not delay our business.

213
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:38,920
OK.

214
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,240
Go.

215
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,360
Be careful.

216
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:00,750
Be careful.

217
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,590
Where have you been?

218
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,830
What's wrong with him?

219
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,320
It's OK.

220
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,070
It's OK.

221
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,510
Cui Chen, are you really OK?

222
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,680
Are you kidding me?

223
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,240
Your powder was

224
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,880
far from enough to do harm to me.

225
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,680
Manqian, thanks for your hard work.

226
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,830
Don't mention it. It's my job.

227
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,950
Master, the results will come back soon.

228
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,000
Do you expect your destined love?

229
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:29,880
We are implementing new policies.

230
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,150
There's a lot of work in our sect.

231
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,000
I'm not in the mood for that right now.

232
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,590
You are saying you didn't

233
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,120
put your name in the tripod?

234
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,270
But you should hurry up

235
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,680
and find your destined love.

236
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,800
Don't lose time.

237
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:43,880
I...

238
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,560
I'd rather stay by your side
and assist you.

239
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,000
Everyone,

240
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,800
it's time for our annual

241
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,750
Gathering of Fated Marriage again.

242
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,360
I know that you are busy

243
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,950
with daily work

244
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,560
and have no time for relationships.

245
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,120
You must have traveled

246
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,440
thousands of miles to our sect

247
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,120
to find your fated marriage.

248
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,830
In the Marriage Tripod beside me

249
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,360
are your name plates

250
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,800
with your birth dates on them.

251
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,070
If two name plates
emerge at the same time,

252
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,480
their owners are destined
to be together.

253
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,440
I wish you all the best of luck

254
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,320
in finding your true love

255
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,750
for a lifetime.

256
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,120
I hereby announce

257
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,750
the official opening
of the Gathering of Fated Marriage

258
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,920
of the Qionghua Sect.

259
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,800
- Great.
- Great.

260
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,800
Do you think it's true?

261
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,880
Do you believe that?

262
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,480
Zhao Qiao, Qin Lu.

263
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:04,870
It's me.

264
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:05,870
It's him.

265
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,270
I envy them.

266
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,600
I'm envious.

267
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,200
They are so happy.

268
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,080
Great.

269
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,320
Bless you.

270
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:18,920
Let's go.

271
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,040
Congratulations.

272
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,800
Thanks.

273
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,630
Congrats.

274
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,870
It works.

275
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,800
Luo Er, Xiuxiu.

276
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,440
Congratulations.

277
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,080
It's me.

278
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,200
Xiaodie, why isn't it you?

279
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,270
Who is Xiuxiu?

280
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,630
It's me.

281
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,230
I've finally found you.

282
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,110
I told you.

283
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,080
Xiaodie.

284
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:43,680
Xiaodie.

285
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,800
- Don't leave.
- Wait for me.

286
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,000
- The Marriage Tripod...
- Xiaodie.

287
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,680
- Could separate people in love.
- Come back.

288
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,470
Tantan, whose name

289
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,110
do you want yours to emerge with?

290
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,320
I'm not into superstition.

291
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,120
[Qiu Yuebai, Zhao Tantan]

292
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,800
Qiu Yuebai, Zhao Tantan.

293
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,200
Tantan.

294
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:28,990
Who's the girl?

295
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,720
Why is he alone?

296
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,870
Tantan, let's go.

297
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,510
Why is this happening again?

298
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,040
Mr. Cui, you have a problem with this?

299
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,150
I have a problem.

300
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:47,960
[Cui Chen]

301
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,960
Why is there a third person?

302
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,230
Cui Chen.

303
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,720
Why is there another one?

304
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,390
Cui Chen.

305
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,600
Is it a scam?

306
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,800
- I want a refund!
- Refund!

307
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,560
Please be patient.

308
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,320
This is the first time this has happened
to the Marriage Tripod.

309
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,200
But the Qionghua Sect
will make a thorough investigation

310
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,270
and give you an explanation.

311
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,110
Someone!

312
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:11,680
Yes.

313
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,040
Gather all the disciples
who have touched the Marriage Tripod.

314
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,110
I'll examine them one by one.

315
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,800
Yes.

316
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,960
The right match will be
one couple for a lifetime.

317
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,230
You can go to the divination table
to ask for divination sticks.

318
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,840
Then ask Lu Yi for interpretation.

319
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,840
He'll tell you

320
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,470
who is your destined love.

321
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,560
Tantan,

322
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,150
let's ask Lu Yi for interpretation.

323
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,920
The powder has a strong delayed effect.

324
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,270
This way, please.

325
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,110
(One of them)

326
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,080
(must be my destined love.)

327
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,270
(Qiu?)

328
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,200
(No way.)

329
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,080
(Is it Cui Chen?)

330
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,440
(The tripod is the most valuable treasure
of the Qionghua Sect.)

331
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,600
(It's strange that three names
emerge at the same time.)

332
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,110
(Someone must have cheated.)

333
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,200
(Mo Yan couldn't even)

334
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,920
(handle such a petty thing.)

335
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:12,080
(Luckily, I've made preparations
in advance for the interpretation.)

336
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,080
(Cui Chen?)

337
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,600
(No way.)

338
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,320
I don't think

339
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,440
the tripod predicted accurately.

340
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,870
It gave three names.

341
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,080
Let's just forget it.

342
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,470
Hold on.

343
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,080
We are here now.

344
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,270
Let's have some fun.

345
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,600
You seem to expect it.

346
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,320
Don't you expect it?

347
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,560
What? The Marriage Tripod
gave three names?

348
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,040
We're still looking into it.

349
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,200
If we don't give the participants

350
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,320
a satisfactory explanation,

351
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,870
this will greatly diminish
our credibility

352
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,560
in the cultivation world.

353
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:46,840
I understand.

354
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,040
Manqian, you've always been careful.

355
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,230
Why did you make such a big mistake?

356
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,270
I'll bring it
to a satisfactory settlement.

357
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,510
I'm going to the hall
to reassure the participants.

358
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,390
You find a way to solve this.

359
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,320
This way, please.

360
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,840
Please wait a moment.
Let me inform him first.

361
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,510
Why are the three of them
always together?

362
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,510
Do you think
which one of them is unwanted?

363
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,800
Next one, Qiu Yuebai.

364
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,390
Tantan, it's our turn.

365
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,150
It's your turn,

366
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,800
not her turn.

367
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,350
Why is he jumping the queue?

368
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:44,960
Everyone.

369
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,200
Please be patient.

370
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,510
As you can see,

371
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,990
considering the unusual circumstances,

372
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,390
they need a timely interpretation.

373
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,840
Please excuse us.

374
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,750
Cui Chen, are you upset?

375
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,840
Do I look upset?

376
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,110
The line is too long.

377
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,390
That's true.

378
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,560
Why don't we play a game?

379
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:09,920
What game?

380
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,200
Look.

381
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,600
You...

382
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:33,840
I...

383
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,270
Go.

384
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,230
(First, we get the treasure ware.)

385
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:31,390
(The shadow of the sundial
of the treasure ware)

386
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,750
(points in the direction of the door.)

387
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,440
(It points in different directions
at different times of the day.)

388
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,230
(No wonder
the location of the vault door)

389
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,960
(changes all the time.)

390
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,600
(Now we've got the treasure ware.)

391
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,840
(As long as we follow the steps)

392
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,800
(to determine the location
and find the direction,)

393
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,390
(we'll find the door.)

394
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,390
How's it going? Still not working?

395
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,350
That's odd.

396
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,990
Cui Chen, I think something is wrong.

397
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,080
Look.

398
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,920
When I hold it at a different angle,

399
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:15,080
the direction of the shadow changes.

400
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,750
Every time Zou Manqian

401
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,720
comes to the garden,

402
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,960
she finds
the direction of the door easily.

403
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,680
Why can't we find it?

404
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,440
I see.

405
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,720
Zou Manqian stood in the same position

406
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:44,230
both times she came to the vault,

407
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,390
facing south.

408
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:50,800
Oh, that's it.

409
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,150
It's here.

410
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:21,870
Get in.

411
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,870
Do you smell a strange odor?

412
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,040
It smells sour.

413
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:41,720
This Qionghua Sect is really rich.

414
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,840
They have so many treasures.

415
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,230
This is...

416
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,510
There may be a trap.

417
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:52,960
Let's find the lotus seed first.

418
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,040
Lotus seed?

419
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,320
How did you get in here?

420
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,150
They are...

421
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,440
The treasure ware?

422
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:32,800
Misunderstanding.

423
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,600
Misunderstanding.

424
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,200
Mu Bai Zhenren of the Qingyuan Sect.

425
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:38,720
Not everyone can enter

426
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,990
the treasure vault of the Qionghua Sect.

427
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:43,040
Would you give us an explanation?

428
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:43,790
Master.

429
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,910
Nothing is lost

430
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,720
except a chest of gold.

431
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,030
So you broke into our vault

432
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,270
to steal the gold.

433
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,760
Don't sling mud at us.

434
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,840
That's a chest of gold.

435
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,670
How could we carry it with us?

436
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:58,880
Moreover,

437
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:01,150
we're participants in the Gathering.

438
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,840
How can you turn your back on us?

439
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,430
Mr. Su,
in the name of the Qingyuan Sect,

440
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,150
I swear we didn't steal the gold.

441
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:14,390
Give us one day.

442
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,640
If we can't catch the thief,

443
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:16,640
we're willing to be punished.

444
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,480
No.

445
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,240
Since you've broken into our vault,

446
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,240
you must be intent on stealing.

447
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,430
If we give you more time,

448
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,080
you may make more trouble.

449
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:25,790
Enough.

450
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,670
Manqian has a point.

451
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,360
But we Qionghua Sect won't bully anyone.

452
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,150
You have one day

453
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,880
to find out the truth
and prove your innocence.

454
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,720
In addition,
you must properly explain to me

455
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:36,790
why you were

456
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,190
in our treasure vault.

457
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,190
Otherwise,

458
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,120
don't blame me for being unpleasant.

459
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,430
That's more like it.

460
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:43,510
Thanks, Mr. Su.

461
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,480
But, Master...

462
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,240
Manqian,

463
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:46,720
as the guardian of the vault,

464
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,430
you should be responsible
for the burglary.

465
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,720
Considering your past service,

466
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,190
you are grounded for three days.

467
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,430
If it happens again, you'll be punished.

468
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,600
Yes.

469
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,000
Please leave.

470
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,030
Lu Yi.

471
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,270
Please.

472
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,670
I'm here to deliver the pastries.

473
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,550
OK, then.

474
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,550
You can take your time to eat and rest.

475
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,030
We have people stationed at the door.

476
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,880
Tell them if you need anything.

477
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,270
I'm pissed off.

478
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,480
How could they suspect us
of stealing the gold?

479
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,270
Mr. Su suspects us.

480
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,510
I also suspect him.

481
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,720
I don't think so.

482
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,390
Given his temperament,

483
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,720
he wouldn't do such a thing.

484
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,000
We'd better

485
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,240
find the real thief.

486
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:40,310
The only people who can open the door
with the treasure ware

487
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,910
are Su Zhinan and Zou Manqian.

488
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,240
So I suspect her.

489
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:46,030
Do you think Zou Manqian stole the gold?

490
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,550
No way.

491
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,840
She wouldn't do that.

492
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,270
She wouldn't steal from her beloved.

493
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,120
You're saying Zou Manqian likes
Su Zhinan?

494
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:58,270
Today, I saw her throwing her name plate

495
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:00,000
into the Marriage Tripod too.

496
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:04,150
Who do you think is the best match
for her in the Qionghua Sect?

497
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,240
Lu Yi.

498
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,480
Mr. Su, of course.

499
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,120
And I've...

500
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:13,550
You've what?

501
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,910
Nothing.

502
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,000
Anyway, It's definitely not Zou Manqian.

503
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,000
You can't be sure.

504
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,910
She's been guarding the vault all along.

505
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,600
I think there are undiscovered stories.

506
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,390
I found gold powder

507
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,310
on the floor of the vault today.

508
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,880
Gold powder?

509
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,880
Anyway, I think
there's something fishy in the vault.

510
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,240
We need to get in there again.

511
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,030
I'm sure
we'll find something unexpected.

512
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,150
Guys,

513
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:39,760
take your time.

514
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:42,600
Mr. Lu,

515
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:46,030
about the Romantic Relationship...

516
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,390
Academy.

517
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,510
Academy.

518
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:49,880
Recently, I've been thinking

519
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,390
of investing
in some promising businesses.

520
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,270
That's right.

521
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,910
As for investment,

522
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,150
in my opinion,

523
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:57,550
the Romantic Relationship Academy

524
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,080
is a good choice.

525
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,390
If you invest in the Academy,

526
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,600
we'll give you 20% of the profits.

527
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,550
What do you think?

528
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,120
20% isn't enough.

529
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,080
It would be better

530
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:07,790
if you give me 40%.

531
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:10,270
Mr. Qiu, I don't think your proposal

532
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,910
is infeasible.

533
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,600
You've got an interesting thing.

534
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,150
This is...

535
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,030
This?

536
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:31,840
What's this?

537
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:32,790
I don't know.

538
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,120
Let's take it back for studying.

539
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:35,550
OK.

540
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,550
I'll ask Zi Meng.

541
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,480
He's knowledgeable.
He should know what this is.

542
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,390
OK.

543
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,960
We didn't find anything.

544
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,120
Forget it.
Let's go back and think about it.

545
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:46,910
Tantan.

546
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:48,270
Let's go.

547
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,080
So, I...

548
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,000
Next time.

549
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,600
I'll talk to you next time.

550
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,430
OK.

551
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:56,640
- Please.
- Please.

552
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,840
Uncle Zi Meng.

553
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,240
Come on. Look what this is.

554
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:12,080
This is...

555
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,030
Gold powder.

556
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:22,080
A crystal of gold powder?

557
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,790
Did someone

558
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,790
carry gold crystals away?

559
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:27,510
I see.

560
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,120
Someone must have melted the gold

561
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,240
and smuggled it out.

562
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,550
Is it?

563
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,240
No way.

564
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,600
It couldn't be Hu Meng.

565
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:36,840
No.

566
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:40,240
Hu Meng doesn't know how to melt gold.

567
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,840
What's the sour smell?

568
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,480
I've smelled it somewhere.

569
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,430
It's written in the Strange Tales
in the Secular World.

570
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,360
Only the tears of a lemon spirit

571
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:04,390
can corrupt all the gold and silver.

572
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,720
Could a lemon become a spirit?

573
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,430
This is the first time I've heard of it.

574
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,910
But everything has a spirit.

575
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,240
A lemon becomes a spirit.

576
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,960
I can live with that.

[Qionghua Sect]

578
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,000
You sent someone to tell me
you found a clue.

579
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,640
What have you found?

580
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,760
Here is the thing, Miss Zou.

581
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:40,760
With my intelligence,

582
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:43,000
we've made a great discovery.

583
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,190
You know what,

584
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,550
once I present my proof,

585
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,880
Mr. Su will immediately know
that the thief is someone else.

586
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,270
Yeah, I'm surprised

587
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,790
that the thief was so lame.

588
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,430
They didn't even destroy their traces.

589
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:00,880
Is it safe

590
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,190
to keep our stuff in the vault?

591
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:05,910
Keep your voice down.

592
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:08,240
We're the only ones knowing about it.

593
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:11,550
Of course, you know it too, Miss Zou.

594
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,390
Why did you bring me here?

595
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,840
I almost forgot.

596
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,480
The thing is,

597
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,030
Miss Zou, would you please

598
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,910
watch over the treasury for us?

599
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,360
Tonight,

600
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,310
we'll invite Mr. Su to the vault.

601
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:28,760
Then the truth will come to light.

602
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,000
I thought I had cleaned it up.

603
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,480
I mustn't cry anymore.

604
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,080
You're caught red-handed.

605
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,640
Do you have anything to say?

606
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,030
Tell us. What happened?

607
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,430
How did you know it was me?

608
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,270
You've been guarding the vault.

609
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,880
The door wasn't broken.

610
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,240
How could the gold vanish into thin air?

611
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,640
I dug around a little.

612
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,790
The disciples of the Qionghua Sect
speak highly of you.

613
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:15,230
They say you're pretty and capable.

614
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,550
You accuse me
of stealing from our own vault.

615
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,600
What proof do you have?

616
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,640
Miss Zou, is this yours?

617
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,680
It smells sour.

618
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:31,920
Does that mean you're nervous?

619
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,840
What if it's mine?

620
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,360
I'm the guardian of the vault.

621
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,270
It's only natural
that my stuff was left here.

622
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:46,230
Then, is the gold in here also yours?
