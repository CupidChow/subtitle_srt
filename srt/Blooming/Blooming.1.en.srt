I don't think we should bother you

190
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,790
with such a small matter
of catching a locust tree spirit.

191
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,480
No.

192
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,390
It's no trouble.

193
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,550
It's our duty.

194
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,080
Mr. Immortal,
there's a saying that goes,

195
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,080
'A wise man knows his own limitations.'

196
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,670
Sir.

197
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,200
Please stay. I'll take my leave.

198
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,550
Sir!

199
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,440
[Qingyuan Sect's Account Book]

200
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,200
[Lard, honey]

201
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,030
Well,

202
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,000
there is no money for food this month.

203
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,910
What are we going to do?

204
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,630
Master.

205
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,320
I've collected some crab paste
and bird's nest today.

206
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,120
I'll have Qifang and Xianfang
sell them tomorrow.

207
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,360
Are you blind?

208
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,480
How much can that bring in?

209
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,910
Don't you know

210
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
how many mouths are there to feed?

211
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,630
I'm so mad.

212
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,270
You all never made it easy for me.

213
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,390
We hardly have any business all year,

214
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,630
and when we finally get one,
it flies away.

215
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,120
It's really getting on my nerves.

216
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,840
Master.

217
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,030
It's better to live than to die.

218
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,510
I'll just catch it back if it flies away.

219
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,390
You just...

220
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:09,360
Back in the day, our Qingyuan Sect
was prosperous.

221
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,000
If it wasn't for the loss
of the Seven-Leaf Lotus...

222
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,550
Seven-Leaf Lotus.

223
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,750
We wouldn't be in such a state.

224
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,030
Now,

225
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,150
it's just a small spirit.

226
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,270
Those mortals would rather
go to great lengths

227
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,120
and spend a fortune
to seek the Tianyin Palace's help

228
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,270
than come to us.

229
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,910
We're much cheaper.

230
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,480
If your senior was still here...

231
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:28,960
If your senior was still here...

232
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,360
Mu Bai.

233
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,880
I miss you so much.

234
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,840
My senior.

235
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,670
What's so good about him?

236
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:40,910
The person who is serving you
diligently now

237
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,840
and will take care of you
in your old age

238
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,750
is me, the light of the Qingyuan Sect,

239
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,320
Zhao Tantan.

240
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,510
Save it.

241
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,240
When your senior was around,

242
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,480
our Qingyuan Sect was thriving.

243
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:50,480
You know what,

244
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,550
the line of people
coming to seek discipleship

245
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,030
stretched all the way down
to the foot of the mountain.

246
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,790
There wasn't even enough standing room.

247
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,840
Quiet!

248
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,000
Quiet!

249
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,480
Today we are going to auction

250
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,200
this 24-carat gold elixir.

251
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,480
Great!

252
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:06,720
Great!

253
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,320
Great!

254
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,400
[The love of my life is Mu Bai.]

255
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,430
Do you know who made this old elixir?

256
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,630
Mu Bai!

257
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,360
I've got another piece of good news
for you.

258
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,790
In addition to this gold elixir,

259
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,000
we're auctioning something else,

260
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,910
which is...

261
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,200
Mu Bai!

262
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,880
What are you doing?

263
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,680
My senior.

264
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,400
He's been missing for over 100 years.

265
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,590
Maybe the grass on his grave

266
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,920
is taller than the roof.

267
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,880
You still expect him
to solve your problems.

268
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,920
Well,

269
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,830
if you had let me leave
for trials earlier,

270
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:17,070
the Qingyuan Sect would have
regained its former glory,

271
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,190
and I would definitely
have taken his place.

272
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,520
Forget it.

273
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:21,920
It's been 18 years,

274
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,360
and you haven't even advanced
one level in your cultivation.

275
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,000
You better

276
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,550
stay here with me.

277
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:28,760
I...

278
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,760
Mu Bai.

279
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,710
I'm not as skillful as him,

280
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,310
but all the spirits and creatures here
are afraid of me now.

281
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,760
I'm not afraid to leave the mountain.

282
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,760
Mu Bai.

283
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:39,790
I...

284
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,160
Fine.

285
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,760
Wait for me.

286
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,240
In less than three days,

287
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,470
I'll show you

288
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,120
who the true light of Qingyuan is.

289
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:55,520
- Master!
- Master!

290
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:56,920
Master!

291
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:58,550
He is cultivating himself.

292
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,070
- Master.
- Master.

293
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,590
Master, Zhao Tantan left.

294
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,710
Check the ponds and puddles
on the back mountain.

295
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,360
She must be playing with Xueyi.

296
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:13,950
Master!

297
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,790
Master, this is not good.

298
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,310
A spirit saw Zhao Tantan
coming down the mountain.

299
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:19,470
Go to...

300
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:21,520
You two

301
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,640
go and get

302
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,310
that mischievous girl back.

303
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,710
Don't come back without her!

304
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,040
Yes.

305
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,070
Hurry up!

306
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,640
Tie her up if you have to!

307
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,190
Didn't I ask you to keep an eye on her?

308
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,590
How could you let her
go down the mountain?

309
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,040
She's never left the Qingyuan Sect.

310
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,550
I don't want to lose her.

311
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:36,880
For God's sake,

312
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,160
the little money we've saved on rent

313
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,360
is not enough to be spent on her.

314
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,670
We've been her playmates
and practice partners. We even have to act.

315
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,550
We're like the most filial spirits.

316
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,670
If you hadn't told us
not to hit or scold her,

317
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,070
she wouldn't have been spoiled
beyond measure.

318
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,430
Now she ran away, and you're blaming us.

319
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,710
Just let others take care of
that troublesome girl.

320
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,640
All right.

321
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,000
Now is not the time for this.

322
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,120
Just go and find her.

323
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,160
Hurry up, will you?

324
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,550
Just go.

325
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,600
(I've finally found the lotus seed.)

326
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,470
(I need to send it back now.)

327
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,710
I failed to get the task done well

328
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,560
and made you get injured.

329
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,160
Please punish me.

330
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,560
He also received a blow from me.

331
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:42,950
Do you know who he is?

332
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,470
Based on his magic power,

333
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,800
he might be from
the school of cultivation.

334
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,030
But ever since you released
the news about the lotus seed,

335
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,320
he's the only one

336
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,990
who has taken it from you.

337
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,400
The Seven-Leaf Lotus has been lost
for over a hundred years,

338
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,080
and there have been no clues.

339
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,920
The guardian is looking for it.

340
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,400
Why shouldn't I?

341
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,880
You mean, he is...

342
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,600
[Xinhuai Village]

343
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,320
We're finally arrived.

344
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,950
Xueyi, go back with Uncle Centipede.

345
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,080
We should wait for you.

346
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,510
You can't fly with a sword.

347
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,710
It will take you a long time

348
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,400
to return to the Qingyuan Sect on foot.

349
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,710
After I complete the challenges,

350
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,510
I'll be much more powerful.

351
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:46,510
By then, flying with a sword
will be a piece of cake.

352
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,640
I better stay here with you.

353
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,750
If you stay here,

354
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,080
you will only cause me trouble.

355
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,360
You two should go back now.

356
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,230
Or the people Master sent
to capture me will find me soon.

357
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,270
Do you still remember coo-coo-coo?

358
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,360
Coo,

359
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,320
coo-coo-coo-coo-coo,

360
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:58,880
coo-coo.

361
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,270
Each one is different.

362
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,880
Okay, I get it.

363
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,800
Just go back.

364
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:03,880
Okay.

365
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,920
This is the air down the mountain.

366
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,880
Wait for me.

367
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,320
Take a look.

368
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,670
Good day.

369
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:37,640
Hello, Miss.

Welcome.

371
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,400
What would you like to eat?

372
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,710
What are you looking at?

373
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,990
Beautiful.

374
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:51,840
Beautiful?

375
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,120
Do you want it?

376
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:54,840
Yes.

377
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,950
Obviously, you're not from my village.

378
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:57,880
Sit down.

379
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,320
There's a locust tree spirit
in the Liu family's old house.

380
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,230
Whenever he sees someone
with a masculine aura,

381
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,600
he beats them up,
dresses them in women's clothes,

382
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,120
and throw them out.

383
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,600
We are afraid of getting beaten up,

384
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,750
so we have to dress up like this.

385
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,120
The locust tree spirit
is quite interesting.

386
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,670
What's interesting about
a perverted locust tree spirit?

387
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,840
What do you want to eat?

388
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:20,840
Make your order.

389
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,720
[Menu]

390
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,080
Well,

391
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,230
how much is
the most expensive noodle here?

392
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,400
Miss, don't underestimate
our little Xinhuai Village.

393
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,560
Our specialty is

394
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,400
Seafood Noodles in Bone Soup,

395
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,920
created by our master chef

396
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,510
after forty-nine days of improvement.

397
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,270
It's a superb delicacy

398
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,880
with a rich and savory broth.

399
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,750
The noodles are chewy.

400
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,080
There is also the special stinky tofu.

401
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,190
Not ten taels,

402
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,080
not five taels,

403
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,640
the combo is only five maces of silver.

404
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,400
Well, Miss, would you like to try it?

405
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,710
Not the combo.

406
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,080
How much for a bowl of noodles?

407
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:11,920
Four maces.

408
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:12,750
Without meat?

409
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,430
Three maces.

410
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:14,400
Just the broth?

411
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:14,950
One mace.

412
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:15,600
And the noodle soup?

413
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:16,840
It's free.

414
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,560
You...

415
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,270
Are you gonna order or not?

416
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:18,640
Yes.

417
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,270
What's your order?

418
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:24,230
I'll have a bowl of noodle soup.

419
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,880
Boss!

420
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,270
Don't come to a restaurant
with no money.

421
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,270
If you can't afford it, just get lost!

422
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,360
Do you know who you're throwing out?

423
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:37,990
You know what,

424
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,470
after I catch the spirit,

425
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,230
I won't eat here even if you beg me to.

426
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:42,750
Help!

427
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,400
Stop!

428
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:43,950
Help!

429
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:44,800
Stop!

430
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:45,710
Don't run! Stop!

431
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,400
Help!

432
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,320
Stop!

433
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,030
Stop!

434
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:51,750
- Help!
- Stop!

435
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:52,920
Stop!

436
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,320
Don't run!

437
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,120
Catch him!

438
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,400
They're abducting a man.

439
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,070
Is the world down the mountain
so interesting?

440
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,510
It's different from
what's written in books.

441
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,070
Help!

442
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,120
Don't run!

443
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,070
Stop!

444
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:07,470
Help!

445
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,070
Don't run!

446
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:10,840
Brother!

447
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,440
Come back!

448
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,790
This one is better.

449
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,030
Don't worry, sister.

450
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:21,120
We'll take care of
your lifelong happiness.

451
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,550
You can have anyone you want.

452
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,070
Are you serious, dude?

453
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:28,470
How audacious!

454
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,160
How dare you abduct a man

455
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,310
in public?

456
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:38,710
Don't be afraid.

457
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,750
Listen, since I'm here today,

458
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,920
I'd like to see who dares to touch him.

459
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,840
Are you teaching me how to do things?

460
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,360
I'm teaching you how to be a human being.

461
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:49,510
Get her!

462
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,120
Go!

463
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,840
Senior, I've won this time.

464
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,790
I only read about

465
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,310
the Farmer and the Viper story in books.

466
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,030
Today I'm experiencing it.

467
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,400
I helped you out of kindness,

468
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,400
but you returned the favor
by molesting me.

469
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,640
Sorry.

470
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:15,470
You...

471
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,310
Don't think you can do whatever you want

472
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,400
just because you're handsome.

473
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,750
Qingyuan is the most prestigious sect
of cultivators,

474
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,990
and I'm the inner disciple
of its leader.

475
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,310
How dare you mess with me?

476
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,440
Do you still hate me?

477
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,990
What's wrong with you?

478
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,310
You know what,

479
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,270
I have something to do now,
so we're square.

480
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,750
You have a flower on your head,
you fraud.

481
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,790
Where are you going?

482
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,680
As a heroine like me,

483
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,750
I'm off to do good deeds.

484
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:50,680
Let go of me.

485
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:55,120
No, I won't let you leave me again.

486
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,270
(She doesn't remember me.)

487
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:00,600
I see.

488
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:01,960
You're trying to extort me.

489
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:02,840
No way.

490
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,750
You've hurt my arm.

491
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,270
Are you just gonna walk away?

492
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,960
You should be responsible for me.

493
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,790
Let me see if I really hurt your arm

494
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,710
with my sword.

495
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:16,880
Don't scream.

496
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,200
It's a fairly rare mutant spirit root.

497
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,270
He doesn't have spiritual power yet.

498
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,030
He has a prodigious talent
for cultivation.

499
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,510
(With Lian Wen's level of cultivation,)

500
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,840
(there is no way
she can't feel my spiritual power.)

501
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,680
(Could it be...)

502
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,360
Are you done touching me?

503
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,160
(If I had known
I would take him as my disciple,)

504
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,640
(I wouldn't have hurt him.)

505
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,440
(What do I do now?)

506
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,030
What are you going to do?

507
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,440
I'll be responsible for you.

508
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,070
How?

509
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,310
By marrying you.

510
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:12,030
You definitely don't want what.

511
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,120
How about this,

512
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:18,230
I'll take you as my disciple.

513
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,600
How's that?

514
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,440
Do you feel really lucky now?

515
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,550
I've longed to become a cultivator,

516
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,680
but it's a big deal to take on a master.

517
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,470
Isn't this too hasty?

518
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,510
Alright, I happen to have
an important task

519
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,400
that can prove it to you.

520
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:46,400
Do you know there's a locust tree spirit
in this village?

521
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,750
A locust tree spirit?

522
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,960
A locust tree spirit.

523
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:52,960
It's scary.

524
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,880
I'm just passing by.
I don't know anything.

525
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,510
I came down from the mountain

526
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,160
for this important task,

527
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,840
to subdue the locust tree spirit
and protect the people.

528
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,960
I'll let you follow me

529
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,510
and show you my strength,

530
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,640
which you can't even imagine.

531
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,600
Really?

532
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,230
That's great. I'd love to see it.

533
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,200
Let's go.

534
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,400
Okay, let's go.

535
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,360
Come on.

536
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,750
Hold on.

537
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,470
What's your name?

538
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:30,960
Cui Chen.

539
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,840
Looks like this is the place.

540
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,750
My future disciple.

541
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,550
Don't be afraid.

542
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:52,990
Stay close to me.

543
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:56,070
I will protect you with my life.

544
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:57,790
Yes.

545
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,160
Well, I'm powerless.

546
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,160
I have to count on you.

547
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:04,230
No problem.

548
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,510
Leave it to me.

549
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,310
(Zhao Tantan, what are you afraid of?)

550
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,750
(You've been domineering)

551
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,470
(in the den of monsters
since you were a kid.)

552
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,680
(What's a mere locust tree spirit
to you?)

553
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,880
I'll show you what I'm capable of.

554
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,990
What are you doing here?

555
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,510
I was wondering

556
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,400
why I could smell something foul
from miles away.

557
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,960
Turns out

558
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,680
it's the poor Qingyuan Sect.

559
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,120
Why don't you hide in the mountains?

560
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:41,600
You got some nerve to come here.

561
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,960
His breath is quite bad.
Can you smell it?

562
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,230
It is quite bad.

563
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,960
We're here to eliminate the evil spirits

564
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,200
and bring peace to the people.

565
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:55,640
You two? Eliminate the evil spirits?

566
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:56,640
How ridiculous.

567
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:01,920
As for us, we were specially invited

568
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,990
by the village chief
from the Tianyin Palace.

569
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:06,230
If you're smart, get lost now,

570
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,600
in case you should be scared

571
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,120
by my force.

572
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,600
Sir.

573
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,680
Go back and prepare the money.

574
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:15,790
We'll take care of this for you.

575
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:16,440
Okay.

576
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:20,990
Don't you know the chief came to us first?

577
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,310
The capable one gets the job.

578
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,470
My goodness.

579
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:48,200
Oh, my God. It's cruel.

580
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,920
I told you

581
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,840
this is what happens

582
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:57,160
when you're not strong enough.

583
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,790
But I'm different.

584
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:02,840
Even the thousand-year crab spirit
is no match for me.

585
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,440
I'm not afraid of animals,

586
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,600
let alone a plant.

587
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,030
Sure.

588
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,270
(I can't let him find out)

589
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,680
(that I haven't built my foundation
and I can't fly.)

590
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,990
Look, the people from the Tianyin Palace

591
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:18,600
are so cowardly.

592
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,200
They only dare to fly in.

593
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,030
But for us,
who are from a prestigious sect,

594
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,790
we must enter through the front gate.

595
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,030
This locust tree spirit is
quite powerful.

596
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,550
The door is sealed
with some powerful spells.

597
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:44,070
In order not to alarm the spirit,

598
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:46,400
I've decided to take the smart way.

599
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:48,990
I'll climb the wall.

600
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:57,550
Well,

601
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,270
since you haven't joined
our Qingyuan Sect,

602
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,160
I can't let you learn my magic skills.

603
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,990
Turn around and don't look back.

604
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:27,230
(Turns out the gate should be pulled,
not pushed.)

605
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:28,840
(This guy is quite smart.)

606
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,160
This is the tree.

607
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:41,230
It doesn't seem special at all.

608
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,960
Oh, no, what's the next line?

609
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:25,470
How could I forget it at this moment?

610
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:30,840
Watch out!
