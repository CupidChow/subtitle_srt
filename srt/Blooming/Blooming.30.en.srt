Come on.

18
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,400
Eat.

Xiaobai.

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,600
Eat.

22
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,760
Yeah, I'm Xiaobai.

00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,960
Tomorrow is your wedding.

29
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,080
So I have a few dishes prepared today

00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,880
to celebrate for you.

31
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,560
It's just a fake wedding. No big deal.

32
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,040
Cui Chen, don't say that.

33
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,320
If you say that,

34
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,400
you'd...

35
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,080
Uncle, let me pour you some wine.

36
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,800
Come on. I'll pour you some wine.

37
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,160
Uncle, I'm telling you,

38
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,360
don't awaken his memory.

39
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,400
If he regains his memory, he'll blossom.

40
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,600
Then he'll degenerate into a demon.

41
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:40,920
Yes.

42
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,640
Uncle,

43
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,040
before I lost my memory,

44
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,280
what kind of person was I?

45
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,880
A person who didn't like meat.

46
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,880
I'll eat it.

47
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,520
Don't.

48
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,960
You can't drink.

49
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,200
You're just getting better.

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,280
Have some tea.

51
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,040
I have another question.

52
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,840
Why did I lose my memory?

53
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,200
Uncle.

54
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,640
Bottoms up.

55
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,000
Well, I...

56
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,600

00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,920
Can't I ask that either?

58
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,520
Then I have another question.

59
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,240
Uncle.

60
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,440
Drink up.

61
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,920
I don't like to drink.

62
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:28,960
Drink.

63
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,000
Uncle, you're drunk.
Let me take you back.

Cui Chen, listen to me.

I've watched you two

66
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,880
walk all the way here with my own eyes.

67
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,840
From the Er Mansion to here.

68
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,160
You should've been happy together.

69
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,600
But destiny is not in your favor.

70
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,840
Who do you refer to by "you two"?

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,320
You and Tantan.

72
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,400
How come

73
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,280
you are no better than an old fool?

74
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,520
Check your chest.

75
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,080
There's a tangram necklace
on your chest.

76
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,880
Check.

77
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,800
How do you know?

78
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,280
It's your love token.

79
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,520
We all know about it.

80
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,600
Uncle, didn't I tell you
not to talk nonsense?

81
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,160
Bro, don't listen to him.

82
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,920
There was nothing
between you and Tantan.

83
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,520
Nothing.

84
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,360
Not in love.

85
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,000
No proposal.

86
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,640
Absolutely nothing.

87
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,120
No, you had nothing.

88
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,400
I can't stay up any longer.

89
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,880
I'm going back to bed.

90
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,080
Nothing.

91
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,360
Tell me.

92
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,080
Enough, Uncle.

93
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,720
What do you know?

94
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,360
Let's go.

95
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,560
You're not in love.

96
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,800
Remember, not in love.

97
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,720
Go.

98
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,680
Go.

99
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,840
Go to sleep.

100
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,360
You can walk.

101
00:04:59,360 --> 00:04:59,840
Go.

102
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,120
This is a tangram.

103
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,400
Why is one piece missing?

104
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,200
Perhaps Heaven
doesn't want them to be together.

105
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,040
Heaven is nothing.

106
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,920
As long as they truly love each other,

107
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,120
nothing can stop them.

108
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,000
If you can make a bridge

109
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,640
out of the tangram blindfolded,

110
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,720
it will help the separated couple
in the legend

111
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,000
to reunite and fulfill their wishes.

112
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,720
I didn't realize

113
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,640
I had so many memories with you
in only a few months.

114
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,080
(I'm sorry
for causing you so much pain.)

115
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,880
(In fact, I like you so much.)

116
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
(I do like you.)

117
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,680
(I don't know since when)

118
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,440
(I've been thinking about you
all the time.)

119
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,600
I remember the way
you eat a string of candied haws,

120
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,160
the way you pout when you get annoyed,

121
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,000
and even the way you stamp your foot

122
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,440
when I piss you off.

123
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,880
(But I can't.)

124
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,440
(You know what?)

125
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,560
(I can make another piece
if one piece of the tangram is missing.)

126
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,880
But what I'm really worried about

127
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,840
is that my feelings for you

128
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,520
would bring you bad luck.

129
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,480
If it's going to hurt you,

130
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,680
(I'd rather it never starts.)

131
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,160
I used to think

132
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,280
that there was nothing I couldn't solve

133
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,480
as long as I advanced bravely.

134
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,560
But now I realize

135
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,120
that fate is terrible.

136
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,880
It seems that I can't beat it

137
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,280
no matter how hard I try.

138
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,680
I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do.

139
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,440
That's the only way.

140
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,400
What is the only way?

141
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,080
What are you doing here?

142
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,440
Have you forgotten what Master said?

143
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,720
We can't see each other

144
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,000
at any time other than the wedding.

145
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,560
Tantan,

146
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,600
I'm Dabai.

147
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,360
Your very own Dabai.

148
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,240
I remembered everything.

149
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,320
I'm glad I remembered.

150
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,240
Otherwise, I would ruin
such a beautiful wedding

151
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:18,000
because of my memory loss.

152
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,000
Tomorrow's wedding

153
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,240
is just a show.

154
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,400
I know.

155
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,240
But I'd rather

156
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,320
bring my beloved Zhao Tantan

157
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,800
into the bridal chamber

158
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,400
than an unfamiliar partner.

159
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,680
But,

160
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,960
now that you've regained your memory,

161
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,400
there's a chance
your passion will be aroused.

162
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,840
Don't you trust my willpower?

163
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm so attractive.

164
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,520
You've never been able to resist me.

165
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,640
Failing that,

166
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,280
I'll ask Huai Meng

167
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,840
to tie my pants tighter

168
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,160
and put some gravel in my shoes.

169
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,760
If it doesn't work,

170
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,080
I'll ask him to stomp on me.

171
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,080
Will that do?

172
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,920
It's not a wedding.

173
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,880
It's a torture.

174
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,960
I'm willing to be tortured.

175
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,480
Tantan,

176
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,400
after we get rid of the Demon Lord,

177
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,760
you stay on the mountain to help Master.

178
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,480
Don't look for me

179
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,200
or ask about me.

180
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,400
I have a lot of things to do.

181
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,680
Don't cry.

182
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,200
I can't wipe your tears.

183
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,920
I have to save my willpower

184
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,440
for our wedding tomorrow.

185
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,080
OK.

186
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,600
I have something for you.

187
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,640
Here you are.

188
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,520
How do I look?

189
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,880
It suits you perfectly.

190
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,120
If I get another chance,

191
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,720
I'll make up for all the kisses and hugs.

192
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,480
I want to give you right now.

193
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,440
OK.

194
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,600
Alright. Go back.

195
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,800
The groom and the bride
can't see each other.

196
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,000
OK.

197
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:15,840
Good night,

198
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,920
my bride.

199
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,960
(Tantan, let me watch over you
for one last night.)

200
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,440
(After tomorrow,
we'll never see each other again.)

201
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,520
Master.

202
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,200
Master.

203
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,560
Master,
Cui Chen has regained his memory.

204
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,680
What's wrong? Isn't it good news?

205
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,280
I tested Cui Chen's spiritual power
this afternoon.

206
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,600
It's about to dissipate.

207
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,960
It'll last until 5 p.m. tomorrow
at the most.

208
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,520
No way. I don't believe it!

209
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,080
He looks better than he did

210
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,200
before the four petals unfolded.

211
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,960
How could it only last
until 5 p.m. tomorrow?

212
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,640
He's living on borrowed time.

213
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,000
Master!

214
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,640
Are you lying to me, Master?

215
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,720
- I don't believe it, Master!
- Tantan!

216
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,440
Don't scream. Calm down.

217
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,360
Good girl, don't think too much.

218
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,280
Don't do anything stupid.

219
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,840
Don't worry.

220
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,720
If I have to use up all my attainments
to save him,

221
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,400
I will.

222
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,160
Yes.

223
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,120
Master, I see.

224
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,880
We have a great war tomorrow.

225
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,160
You should get some rest.

226
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,400
You too.

227
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,280
Master, don't lie to me.

228
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,400
When you came to my room this afternoon

229
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,520
to test my spiritual power,

230
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,040
I already knew about it.

231
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,920
Cui Chen, shall we

232
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,360
cancel the wedding tomorrow?

233
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,440
If your passion is aroused
and you blossom at the wedding,

234
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,000
you'll be a demon.

235
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,040
You'll be at the Demon Lord's service.

236
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,920
There's no turning back.

237
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,720
We must catch the rat in the hole.

238
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,480
How about I knock you out?

239
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,240
If you lose your memory,
you won't bloom.

240
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,640
But you'll also
forget about your magic arts.

241
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,720
You'll be like a lamb in a tiger's den.

242
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,360
Master, don't worry.

243
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,480
Tantan and I have talked it over.

244
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,640
We already have a plan.

245
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,760
My passion won't be aroused.

246
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,600
Really?

247
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,360
We've got

248
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,680
our priorities straight.

249
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,240
That's good.

250
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,160
In fact, I'm most worried

251
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,960
about what will happen to me

252
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,400
when my spiritual power
dissipates after 5 p.m.

253
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,680
If I age and die quickly like Zhu Yan,

254
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,520
I'll be lucky.

255
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,640
But if I'm infested with the demon aura

256
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,960
and degenerate into a demon,

257
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,000
please kill me

258
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,680
and give me the last decency.

259
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
[Qingyuan Sect]

260
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,400
Sir, Young Master has sent word.

261
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,160
Go ahead.

262
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:35,920
Young Master said

263
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,600
he's bribed
a disciple of the Qingyuan Sect.

264
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,720
At the wedding
of Zhao Tantan and Cui Chen,

265
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,760
he'll destroy
the Sect's Demon Purifying Shield.

266
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,040
Then we'll be able to

267
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,200
exert our magic power there.

268
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,240
Well done. That's my son!

269
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,120
[9 o'clock]

270
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:01,960
You're handsome.

271
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,520
If, after the wedding,

272
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,600
you and Tantan could be together
for the rest of your life,

273
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,320
that would be great.

274
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,200
Master, if I can tell heaven and earth

275
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,680
and my parents my love for Tantan,

276
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,480
I'll have no regrets.

277
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:23,920
Cui Chen.

278
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:26,760
I'm fine.

279
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,440
Master.

280
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,120
Master, Senior Mu Bai,

281
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,640
it's almost the auspicious hour.

282
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,920
Master, I'll get ready in the hall.

283
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:34,600
Go ahead.

284
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,560
Why are you nervous?

285
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,840
Huai Meng and Uncle Zi Meng

286
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,560
have got everything ready.

287
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,960
Is something wrong in the hall?

288
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,000
Nothing is wrong.

289
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,480
Master asked me to give you this

290
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,760
to suppress the Demon Lord.

291
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,640
I'll go get ready.

292
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,720
Don't be nervous.

293
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,350
Though your wedding is held

294
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,680
to capture the Demon Lord,

295
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,840
Senior Mu Bai has regained his memory.

296
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,680
As long as you two join hands,

297
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,630
we'll definitely defeat the Demon Lord.

298
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,560
(If only everything was

299
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,480
as simple as Xueyi said!)

300
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:25,720
Let's go.

301
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,440
Let's proceed with the wedding
and get it over with.

302
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,000
Go.

303
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,440
There you are.

304
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,480
Mr. Qiu, the wedding has begun.

305
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,400
Let's go.

306
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,440
By the way,

307
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,040
Mr. Qiu,

308
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,000
have you drawn up the contract
you promised me?

309
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,320
Mr. Qiu, what do you mean?

310
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,120
You promised me

311
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,080
half your title if I let you out.

312
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,000
Now you...

313
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,760
You can't do business like this.

314
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,120
Mr. Qiu...

315
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,480
[Qingyuan Sect]

316
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,200
Why isn't she here yet?

317
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:20,760
Yeah.

318
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,160
Is she ready?

319
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,280
I can't see her.

320
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,120
She's coming.

321
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:27,920
There she is.

322
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,400
She's coming.

323
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:29,640
Get ready.

324
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,560
Get ready.

325
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,960
Stand straight.

326
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,080
Great.

327
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,000
Yeah.

328
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,080
She's so beautiful today.

329
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,800
Music!

330
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,080
Hurry up.

331
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,640
Enough!

332
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,160
We cultivators
don't need such mumbo-jumbo.

333
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,520
Cui Chen and I
will pay ceremonial obeisances directly.

334
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,080
Alright, don't miss the auspicious hour.

335
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,160
That's not gonna work.

336
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,320
Tantan's wedding is a major event
for the entire Qingyuan Sect.

337
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,440
How can we be so casual?

338
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,960
We've made a lot of preparations

339
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,080
for your wedding.

340
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,240
We've prepared a festooned carriage.

341
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,440
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

342
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,000
[Around 11 a.m.]

343
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,520
(I must take Dabai to the Lotus Realm
before 3 p.m.)

344
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,960
Enough!

345
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,960
Alright. I appreciate your kindness.

346
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,640
Just play the music. Skip the rest.

347
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:25,840
OK.

348
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,800
Play the music.

349
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,200
Music.

350
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:27,640
Music.

351
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,000
Come on, Cui Chen.

352
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,880
Let's go perform formal bows.

353
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,840
Cui Chen, when I shut down
the Demon Purifying Shield,

354
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,760
you'll be dead.

355
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,200
My son is useful, after all.

356
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,800
I didn't train him for 100 years in vain.

357
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,600
I'm going to catch Zhao Tantan.

358
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,840
You go steal the lotus magic instrument
in the chaos.

359
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,520
Yes, sir!

360
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,560
Dabai, are you OK?

361
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,680
I'm OK.

362
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,880
I've got gravel in my shoes
making me unsteady.

363
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,360
Here, Dabai.

364
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,680
Master, let's begin.

365
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,440
Isn't it a bit hasty?

366
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,120
- Why are you in such a rush?
- I am in a rush.

367
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,160
- Master, don't listen to them.
- What's the rush?

368
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:41,880
Let's get started.

369
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,960
Don't heckle.

370
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,120
Where is Zi Meng?

371
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,360
Where's Zi Meng, the wedding conductor?

372
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,000
Here.

373
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,960
Hurry up.

374
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,200
Gosh, Uncle.

375
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,720
Master, don't worry about it. Sit down.

376
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,680
Hurry up.

377
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,880
- Hurry.
- Coming!

378
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,720
First bow to heaven and earth!

379
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,400
Hurry.

380
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:56,960
Hurry.

381
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,560
Second bow to parents!

382
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,360
Bride and groom bow to each other!

383
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,280
I'm here.

384
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,800
You're in such a hurry.

385
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,240
I'm your wife from now on.

386
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,680
Is it all over?

387
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:15,920
It's so hasty.

388
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,760
It's too soon.

389
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,600
So hasty.

390
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,320
Exactly.

391
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,440
There's no sense of ceremony.

392
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,080
Master!

393
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,680
What's up?

394
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,000
Master, the Demon Lord is on the move.

395
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,760
Demon Lord?

396
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,920
Demon Lord?

397
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:30,840
What should we do?

398
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,560
Demon Lord?

399
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,840
Guys, calm down!

400
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,560
Calm down!

401
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,440
Feng Bao,
take them to Spirit Village.

402
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,080
OK.

403
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,480
Follow me.

404
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,880
Xueyi, you should go too.

405
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,160
Everyone, get ready.

406
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,800
Stick to the plan.

407
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,280
I'll leave things here to you.

408
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,480
OK.

409
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,880
I'd like to see

410
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,600
what the Demon Lord has taught you
over the years.

411
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,640
You've come quickly.

412
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,160
We're in a hurry
to shut the dog up to beat it.

413
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,760
Otherwise, the cornered beast
may do something desperate.

414
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,160
Turn on the Demon Purifying Shield.

415
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,640
Yes.

416
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,400
Demon Lord.

417
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,280
Zhao Tantan, I've been looking for you
for over 100 years.

418
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,120
Why didn't you even
send me a wedding invitation?

419
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,200
You've come here shamelessly anyway.

420
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,520
I advise you to surrender

421
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,760
lest the Qingyuan Sect

422
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,040
ends up like Wanfang City.

423
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,400
We don't know who will gain supremacy.

424
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,440
Fine, let's see.

425
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,720
I thought you were formidable,

426
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,080
but that's all you are.

427
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,400
Are you OK?

428
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,760
We must use the Demon Purifying Shield.

429
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,960
You're no better after 100 years.

430
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,320
You're not even close to Cui Chen.

431
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,360
Cui Chen!

432
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,320
His magic power has gone.

433
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,040
Go!

434
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,480
Cui Chen!

435
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,240
Cui Chen!

436
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:32,600
Go.

437
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,560
[To Master]

438
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,960
I won't let you take the lotus seeds.

439
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,720
Tantan has already taken them.

440
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,840
(Master, I'm sorry.)

441
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,960
(I've taken the lotus seeds.)

442
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,960
(It may be a little cruel.)

443
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,960
(But I've thought it over.)

444
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,800
(I can only count on you.)

445
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,680
(After the war,)

446
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,960
(I'll take Cui Chen to the Lotus Realm.)

447
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,360
(I'll sacrifice myself there,)

448
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,880
(revive the Seven-Leaf Lotus,)

449
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,760
(summon the power of the universe,)

450
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,040
(and break
Cui Chen's Xilan Flower Curse.)

451
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,880
Does it need Tantan
to revive the Seven-Leaf Lotus?

452
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,160
It's none of your business!

453
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,680
[Around 3 p.m.]

454
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,680
Tantan, go to the Lotus Realm.

455
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,440
No.

456
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,160
You've descended
to the Foundation Phase.

457
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,400
You can't deal with the Demon Lord.

458
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,480
Hang in there.

459
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,880
I'll be able to help you soon.

460
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,320
After 100 years,

461
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,080
I've finally found you.

462
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,320
Tantan.

463
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:08,960
Leave her alone!

464
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:13,840
Tantan!

465
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,680
Tantan!

466
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,040
Cui Chen,

467
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,480
you don't even
have the most basic magic arts,

468
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,040
you'd better not fight it.

469
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,560
I won't let you kill her.

470
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,840
After sacrificing Zhao Tantan

471
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,560
and reviving the Seven-Leaf Lotus,

472
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,680
we'll have access
to the power of the universe.

473
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,800
Father,

474
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,080
you didn't say you need to kill her
to revive the Lotus.

475
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,040
Are you going to stop me
from achieving hegemony

476
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,120
because of a woman?

477
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,760
Have you thought it through?

478
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,880
Yes, I have.

479
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,320
Though she doesn't love me, I love her.

480
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,520
I'll do everything I can to protect her.

481
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,440
Tantan, don't be afraid.

482
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,120
Dabai.

483
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,840
I'm here.

484
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,480
I'm here.

485
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,240
Dabai!

486
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,200
Dabai!

487
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,800
Tantan!

488
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,720
Dabai!

489
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,240
Dabai, no.

490
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,600
Dabai, no.

491
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,080
Dabai!

492
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,520
Dabai!

493
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,760
Dabai,

494
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,280
you're the Light of Qingyuan

495
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,440
and the model of the cultivation world.

496
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,000
You can defeat the demon nature.

497
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,960
Don't dream about it.

498
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,640
Mu Bai Zhenren is gone.

499
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,840
Standing in front of you is Cui Chen,
the demon cultivator.

500
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,720
Don't touch her.

501
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:13,840
Dabai!

502
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,920
Tantan, the Linglong Pagoda!

503
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,160
Dabai!

504
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,240
Tantan!

505
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,520
Dabai.

506
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:51,880
Dabai.

507
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,960
Kill me quickly!

508
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,200
I can't control myself.

509
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,080
I won't let you die.

510
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,760
I'll keep you alive.

511
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,960
If you don't kill me,

512
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,600
I'll cause the common people calamity

513
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,840
and get you killed.

514
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,280
Dabai,

515
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,880
help me take care of Master,

516
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,680
revitalize the Qingyuan Sect,

517
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,040
and make all the spirits

518
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,000
live in peace with the cultivators.

519
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,760
Dabai,

520
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,840
you've always protected me.

521
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,400
Now it's my turn to protect you.

522
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:03,880
Tantan.

523
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,400
The Seven-Leaf Lotus
will be reborn in 10,000 years.

524
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:10,040
As long as your love for me
doesn't change,

525
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,400
we can renew our predestined love
in 10,000 years.

526
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,840
10,000 years is too long.

527
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,800
Every day without you

528
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,600
is an ordeal for me.

529
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,270
I feel the same.

530
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,800
But the Qingyuan Sect needs you.

531
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,840
The cultivation world
needs Mu Bai Zhenren.

532
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,080
You must revitalize the Qingyuan Sect.

533
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,480
After 10,000 years, I'll come back

534
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,190
and be your junior sister again.

535
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,160
After 10,000 years,

536
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,670
I'll be your senior master.

537
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,600
Don't try to take advantage of me.

538
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,080
You can only be my senior brother.

539
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,640
Tantan.

540
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,160
The power of the universe,

541
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,560
please lift the Xilan Flower Curse
off Cui Chen.

542
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,920
Tantan!

543
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,040
Tantan!

544
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,560
Tantan!

545
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,160
[Qingyuan Cross Age Clean Energy]

546
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,560
Mr. Cui, your company's energy products

547
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,000
have been successfully applied
in new energy vehicles.

548
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,440
Do you plan to continue

549
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,200
marching toward the auto market

550
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,960
or develop a new business landscape?

551
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,480
The auto industry

552
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,120
will continue
to be our fundamental focus.

553
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,960
We are also open

554
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,720
to the development of new fields.

555
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,720
We'll build an efficient
and systematic technology system

556
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,440
to support the development
of environmental protection.

557
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,800
He's coming.

558
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:06,800
Mr. Cui is coming.

559
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,960
Is that his car?

560
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:08,560
I suppose so.

561
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,080
Yes.

562
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:09,760
Mr. Cui.

563
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,120
Mr. Cui.

564
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,280
He's coming.

565
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:11,920
Hurry.

566
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:12,800
Get ready.

567
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:13,720
Keep up.

568
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,360
Take photos.

569
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:14,840
Take photos.

570
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:15,960
Mr. Cui.

571
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:16,960
Don't take photos.

572
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,440
Stay back.

573
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,880
Excuse me.

574
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,840
Excuse me.

575
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,960
- Sorry, we don't do interviews.
- The new energy you've introduced...

576
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,240
Mr. Cui, this way, please.

577
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,480
May I ask you a question?

578
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,560
Step aside.

579
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,080
Mr. Cui,

580
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,640
do an interview with us!

581
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,680
Senior!

582
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,680
(I've fallen for a man today.)

583
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,640
(I want to say to him,)

584
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,280
("Senior, where are you running?")

585
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,640
Would you like broccoli tonight?

586
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,200
Yes.

587
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:12,070

588
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:15,910
