Come on.

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,440
Bai Diezi, are you ready?

18
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,400
Tantan.

19
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,400
Tantan.

20
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,520
Qiu, I told you

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,560
that I can't say yes to you.

22
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,120
Tantan, I'm sorry.

23
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,680
Why are you apologizing to me
all of a sudden?

24
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,160
Look, this is for you.

25
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,320
A lotus seed.

26
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,560
Bai Diezi, I've told you

27
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,040
I can't say yes to Qiu
because of the lotus seed.

28
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,840
Take it back.

29
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,520

Tantan.

32
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,200
Yuebai told me

33
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,240
that although I like you and Qiu,

34
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,400
I can't force you with the lotus seed.

35
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,480
Tantan, just take it.

36
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,200
It's useless to me anyway.

37
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,520
You clever girl.

38
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,320
You're a talker.

39
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,360
Tantan, if you take it,

40
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,360
you'll be happy, and I'll be happy.

41
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,240
Tantan, take it.

42
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,040
My arms are sore.

43
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,760
You take it.

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,520
- Qiu, thank you.
- She runs pretty fast.

52
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,720
Please say thank you
to Bai Diezi for me.

53
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,960
You can say thank you yourself.

54
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,120
Tantan, don't feel stressed.

55
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,960
I know you can't make a choice now.

56
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,800
I won't force you.

Qiu.

58
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,040
But at least we're still friends, right?

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,480
Qiu, thank you.

00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,200
You'll always be my best friend.

I need to talk to Mr. Qiu.

We can talk, Mr. Cui,

64
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,480
but let go of my hand first.

65
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,840
Yeah, let go of him.

66
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,160
Stay out of men's business.

67
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,400
I'm warning you.

68
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,760
Don't play tricks again
to approach Tantan.

69
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,520
I have a clear conscience.

70
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,880
Tantan is a simple girl
but a poor judge of character,

71
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,680
but I'm not like her.

72
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,120
You're not a simple man indeed,

73
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,480
and your relationship history
is complicated.

74
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,830
Besides, you and Tantan have broken up.

75
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,240
You have no right
to interfere in her affairs.

76
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,360
That's none of your business.

77
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,720
Just remember,

78
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,640
I'm the only one who Tantan loves.

79
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,800
But that's just for now.

80
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,120
We don't know about the future.

81
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,640
Listen, don't force it
when it doesn't belong to you.

82
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,000
I'll also tell you one thing.

83
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,280
There is nothing

84
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,000
that I can't get.

00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,160
Yuebai.

86
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,640
Why are you still up so late?

87
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,720
Is this Tantan?

88
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:06,840
Yes.

89
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,680
If you like her that much,

90
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,160
why did you ask me to give her
the lotus seed unconditionally?

91
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,040
Did you carve this?

92
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,280
Yes.

93
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,080
(Every time I touch the lotus seed,
I can see strange images.)

94
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,520
(This time should be no exception.)

95
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,520
What's wrong?

96
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,440
It's bleeding.

97
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,360
I've told you many times,
but you won't listen.

98
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,640
I'm your older sister.

99
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,960
Why are you lecturing me?

100
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,880
All right, my good sister.

101
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,120
I've brought you some delicious cakes.

102
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,240
What is it?

103
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,200
Tantan.

104
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,440
What is it?

105
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,360
Her incarnation?

106
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,720
Every time I touch the lotus seed,

107
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,080
my power will increase by one level.

108
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,720
This time, I've reached
the Incarnation Phase.

109
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,280
That's why there is my incarnation.

110
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,440
Did Bai Diezi give you the lotus seed?

111
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,200
Oh my God!

112
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,280
Don't tell me
you're with Qiu Yuebai now.

113
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,480
What are you talking about?

114
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,680
Qiu convinced Diezi to give it to me.

115
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,120
He retreated in order to advance.

116
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,880
Do you have to interpret his sincerity

117
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,640
in such a narrow-minded way?

118
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,320
All right. Don't fight.

119
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,640
Sit down. I have something to tell you.

120
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,640
Every time I touch the lotus seed,

121
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,400
I can see strange illusions.

122
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,400
Did it happen to you

123
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,680
when you touched the lotus seed before?

124
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,640
Illusions?

125
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,280
How could there be illusions?

126
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Doesn't the lotus seed
only enhance magic power?

127
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,800
That's strange.

128
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,920
Am I the only one
who sees strange images

129
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,280
when touching the lotus seed?

130
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,520
What images?

131
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,640
I know.

132
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,840
It must be a romantic dream
about you and Senior Mu Bai.

133
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,560
Don't talk nonsense.
There is no romantic dream.

134
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,840
I once dreamed about

135
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,480
Cui Chen and Lian Wen being in love.

136
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,360
Lian Wen?

137
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,600
You don't know that, do you?

138
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,640
Lian Wen is the master...

139
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,800
She's Cui Chen's fiancée
from 100 years ago,

140
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,560
Tantan's rival in love.

141
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,360
Don't you look like Lian Wen?

142
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,680
How can you tell in the illusion

143
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,240
that it's her
being in love with Cui Chen,

144
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,440
not you?

145
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,160
I couldn't tell it before.

146
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,720
Then Lian Rong told me

147
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,800
a lot of things about Lian Rong.

148
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,520
It's exactly the same as what I saw.

149
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,840
Memory is the most unreliable.

150
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,320
It's easily influenced
by the emotions of the moment.

151
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,160
You're still jealous
because of Cui Chen and Lian Rong.

152
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,080
That's why you've imagined

153
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,320
so many details about their love.

154
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,880
But what about this time?

155
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,680
I dreamed about two little girls

156
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,400
practicing magic arts in the garden.

157
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,520
The older sister was hurt,
and the younger sister healed her.

158
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:32,880
Then they were

159
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,880
eating pastries happily.

160
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,120
What else?

161
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,120
Tantan, are you talking about

162
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,710
our childhood?

163
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,000
When I met you,

164
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,320
you were over 200 years old.

165
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,080
How can it be our childhood?

166
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,600
Tantan.

167
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,920
I have a guess.

168
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,960
You'd better not say anything.

169
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,240
Go ahead.

170
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,880
Maybe the lotus seed just triggered

171
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,240
the memories sealed in your mind.

172
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,240
Or maybe you and Lian Wen
from 100 years ago

173
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,600
are actually the same person.

174
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,680
I'm Zhao Tantan.

175
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,600
I have nothing to do with Lian Wen.

176
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,520
That's right.

177
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,840
What nonsense are you talking about?

178
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,800
From now on,

179
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,720
if anyone links me to Lian Wen again,

180
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,200
don't blame me
for breaking our friendship.

181
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,520
I'm tired. You can leave.

182
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,040
Tantan.

183
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,760
It's late. Let's call it a night.

184
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,400
Let's go.

185
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,560
My best friend is Zhao Tantan.

186
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,840
- Not Lian Wen.
- I know.

187
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,360
Uncle Centipede.

188
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,000
What are you doing here?

189
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Senior Mu Bai told me to come.

190
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,480
He asked me to take you back
to the Qingyuan Sect with the lotus seeds.

191
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,920
Why didn't he tell me about it?

192
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,040
I decided it last night.

193
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,800
We don't have anything to pack anyway.

194
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,120
We can leave now.

195
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,120
In such a hurry?

196
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,720
Where are Xueyi and the others?

197
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,200
They'll be here right away.

198
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,360
Here we are.

199
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,280
- Everything is packed.
- Tantan.

200
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,200
Tantan.

201
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,000
Everything is packed.

202
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,840
There are so many people.

203
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,240
Since everyone's ready,

204
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,000
let's hit the road.

205
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:22,960
Wait.

206
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,200
I haven't said goodbye
to Feng Bao and Qiu.

207
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:25,760
Tantan.

208
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,120
Why are you leaving without telling us?

209
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,000
Yeah.

210
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,320
You said we were good sisters.

211
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,080
Are you afraid
we'll steal your lotus seeds?

212
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,360
Tantan, are you leaving me?

213
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:37,680
No.

214
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,040
We just decided

215
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,720
to send the lotus seeds
back to the Qingyuan Sect.

216
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,680
That's why
I didn't have time to tell you.

217
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,360
Where is the Qingyuan Sect?

218
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,000
If you're going there,
Yuebai and I are going with you.

219
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,320
I almost forgot about you.

220
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,560
Qiu, what are you going to do with her?

221
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,160
I'll let her stay with me.

222
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,480
You're a man.
How long can you take care of her?

223
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,280
Come over.

224
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,120
Bai Diezi.

225
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,680
Do you want to
go to the Qingyuan Sect with me?

226
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,280
I'll go if Yuebai goes.

227
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,400
Yuebai, are you willing to

228
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,840
go to the Qingyuan Sect with us?

229
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,920
Well, Bai Diezi.

230
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,320
He's never been to the Qingyuan Sect.

231
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,640
Why would he not like it?

232
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,560
You know what,

233
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,400
there are many people in the Qingyuan Sect
who would love to play with you,

234
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,360
like Sister Swiftlet and Brother Pig.

235
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,760
They will accompany you.

236
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,480
Bai Diezi, I have things to do.

237
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,080
I'll come to you as soon as I'm done.

238
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,880
You promise me.

239
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,200
Don't forget it.

240
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,480
I promise.

241
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,200
Pinky swear.

242
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,280
Tantan.

243
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,120
Our master is still waiting for us.

244
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,640
Time waits for no one. We have to go.

245
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,160
Okay. We're leaving.

246
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,200
If there's anything,

247
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,960
I'll have Xueyi write a letter
to the Seven Nights Inn.

248
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,680
Don't worry. They'll be fine.

249
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,560
I'm leaving.

250
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,840
Bye.

251
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,160
We can finally go back
to the Qingyuan Sect.

252
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,080
Yuebai, you promised me

253
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,600
to see me at the Qingyuan Sect.

254
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:10,920
Xueyi, wait for me.

255
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,920
Yuebai, you promised me

256
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,280
to see me at the Qingyuan Sect.

257
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,120
Remember that!

258
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,680
I'll do what I promised you.

259
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,120
Are you really going to give up?

260
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,560
Of course not.

261
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,120
Honey, I...

262
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,800
You've scared Bai Diezi.

263
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,880
What's wrong?

264
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,960
Are you all right?

265
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,400
I'm fine.

266
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,320
My knees are not doing well lately.

267
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,320
They can't handle too much weight.

268
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,360
Well,

269
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,440
there are so many of us.

270
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,960
Wouldn't it put more pressure
on your knees?

271
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,640
It's okay. I can endure it.

272
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,800
I'll be fine.

273
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,760
How about this, except for Uncle Zi Meng

274
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,880
and Bai Diezi,

275
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,320
the rest of us fly back.

276
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,080
It's not that serious.

277
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,520
Maybe two of you fly back

278
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,440
on your own.

279
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,240
I can carry the rest.

280
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,480
But...

281
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,000
Tantan.

282
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,480
You and Cui Chen are the most skillful
in magic arts here.

283
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,920
Why don't you fly back first?

284
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,160
We'll take the ride.

285
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,520
I'm tired of flying.

286
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,040
I can't fly. I want to take the ride.

287
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,080
I want to stay with Xueyi.

288
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,520
I can't fly.

289
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,800
Whoever wants to fly can fly back.

290
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,760
Okay, I'll go back with Cui Chen.

291
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,200
I want to stay with Tantan.

292
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,480
You little girl.

293
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,680
Just take the ride with us.

294
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:43,800
Come on.

295
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,680
Remember to listen to Meng.

296
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,440
Why did you bring me here?

297
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,680
I thought we were in a hurry.

298
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,880
There's no rush. We can fly, right?

299
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,520
Does this look like the place

300
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,000
where I bought you candied haws
the first time?

301
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,520
No.

302
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,960
There are candies haws over there.
Do you want some?

303
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:13,960
No.

304
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,000
Let's go.

305
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,080
Take a look.

306
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,960
There are many people there.

307
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,120
Let's go over there.

308
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,920
Today at Shu's Noodle Restaurant,

309
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,080
buy three and get one free.

310
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,440
Don't miss it.

311
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,720
At our Crab Noodle Restaurant...

312
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,400
Hold on!

313
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,320
Half price for the second bowl!

314
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,600
Half price?

315
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,040
Half price?

316
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,160
That's a better deal.

317
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:36,520
Let's go.

318
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,120
That's better.

319
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,640
Come here!

320
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,880
Inside, please!

321
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,080
Guys!

322
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,800
One coin at our shop!

323
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,040
One coin!

324
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,320
It's basically free!

325
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,120
Hurry!

326
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,840
It's free. Let's go!

327
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,080
Let's go!

328
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,520
Right in the middle. Go!

329
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,560
It's free here!

330
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,560
Yeah, free!

331
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,800
Free at our restaurant!

332
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:54,920
Free?

333
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,160
Is that how you do the business?

334
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,520
What do you want?

335
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,240
Do you still want to make money?

336
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,080
What do you want?

337
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,120
What do you mean?

338
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,280
What do you want?

339
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,080
I'll beat you to death!

340
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:04,720
I'll beat you to death!

341
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,560
Kid, are you okay?

342
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,280
I'm fine.

343
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,600
Tantan?

344
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,920
Crab Spirit!

345
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,200
Welcome to our restaurant!

346
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,920
Inside, please!

347
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,920
This way.

348
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,440
So, you opened this noodle restaurant

349
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,320
to look for me?

350
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,000
Yeah.

351
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,960
We left the mountain to find you.

352
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,360
We ate poorly
and almost had to beg for food.

353
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,480
Luckily, we met Mr. Crab.

354
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,680
That's right.

355
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,600
You know what,

356
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,920
in all the crab noodle restaurants
across the country,

357
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,400
there are posters looking for you.

358
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,720
But there's been no news of you.

359
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,240
All right, don't be sad.

360
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,280
We found her today, didn't we?

361
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,200
Yeah.

362
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,280
Tantan.

363
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,640
Don't leave us again!

364
00:15:59,320 --> 00:15:59,840
Tantan...

365
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,480
Let go of her.

366
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:02,720
Who is it?

367
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,120
I've been putting up with you two
for a while.

368
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,640
There are boundaries
between men and women.

369
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,160
Who gave you two permission to hug her?

370
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,200
The Light of Qingyuan is here.

371
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,160
Don't be cocky.

372
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,440
I don't know
who this hooligan came from,

373
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,440
daring to act recklessly here.

374
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,480
That's right.

375
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,200
Don't you know me?

376
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,400
On the night of the Double Seventh
Festival in Zhu Village,

377
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,920
the two of us were by the river...

378
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,680
I just...

379
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,880
That was a wonderful story.

380
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,640
Tantan, do you two know each other?

381
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,600
He's our senior fellow disciple,
Mu Bai Zhenren.

382
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:38,840
Mu Bai?

383
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,880
You're the famous

384
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,080
Senior Mu Bai?

385
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,360
It's me.

386
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,560
I'm sorry.

387
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,160
We were being impolite.

388
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,400
I'm sorry.

389
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,080
No problem.

390
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,080
Come here, you two.

391
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,880
Let's talk later.

392
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:53,920
What?

393
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,960
Look, don't listen to him.

394
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,920
He only knows how to act like a senior.

395
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,870
We grew up together.

396
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,320
We don't need...

397
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,280
Qifang, look.

398
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,150
Senior Mu Bai is really handsome.

399
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,110
Senior Mu Bai.

400
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,520
Can you sign for me?

401
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,040
Yes.

402
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:13,390
Sign here.

403
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,040
It's clean here.

404
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,350
Senior Mu Bai,
when I was on the mountain,

405
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,600
I went to Tantan's room every day

406
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,630
to worship your portrait.

407
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,440
Fortunately, Master cast a spell.

408
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,600
Otherwise, Tantan would have

409
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,440
turned your portrait
into a sieve with a cactus.

410
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,520
There is something you don't know.

411
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,240
Tantan was...

412
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,960
Right.

413
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,150
Qifang is right.

414
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,200
How is he right?

415
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,360
The noodles are ready. Let's eat first.

416
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,760
Yeah, eat noodles.

417
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,360
Here.

418
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,960
Here, Tantan.

419
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,280
Sit over there.

420
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,680
What?

421
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,880
Do you want hot sauce?

422
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,040
No.

423
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:57,680
I'll help myself.

424
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,760
The noodles are so good.

425
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:10,880
What are you doing?

426
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,400
It's on your mouth.

427
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,280
I'll do it myself.

428
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:18,840
I'll do it myself.

429
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,560
He's just a caring person.

430
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,520
He has to take a hand in everything.

431
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,240
After you spend more time with him,

432
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,400
he'll treat you like this too.

433
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,080
Right, Senior Mu Bai?

434
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,440
You're always right.

435
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,720
That's strange.

436
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,320
The noodles are so delicious.

437
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,720
Why are there no customers?

438
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,920
The Shu's Noodle Restaurant
across the street is contemptible.

439
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,800
They're charging half the price of ours.

440
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,680
That's right.

441
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,920
We're having an event today,

442
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,320
and they're doing it too,

443
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,400
selling a bowl of noodles for a coin.

444
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,680
How is that gonna make money?

445
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,920
It's like giving noodles away for free.

446
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,840
That's why we got mad

447
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,200
and got into a fight with them.

448
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,560
Well done.

449
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,160
The people of the Qingyuan Sect
can't be treated that way.

450
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:05,920
Exactly.

451
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,160
Fighting can't solve the problem.

452
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,280
Right.

453
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,880
It should be the quality of the noodles
that brings in the customers.

454
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,800
That's easy.

455
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,560
Let's hold a tasting event.

456
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,280
They'll find your noodles delicious

457
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,160
and eat here
no matter how much it is.

458
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,240
Right.
Let's attract more customers first.

459
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,520
We can talk about making money later.

460
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,040
Senior Mu Bai, you're good at chopping.

461
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,440
No wonder you're the Light of Qingyuan.

462
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,360
Look at the way you chop.

463
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,120
I can tell you're good with a sword.

464
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,720
Does chopping a cucumber well

465
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,960
make him the Light of Qingyuan?

466
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,840
If you can chop as fast and neatly

467
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,680
as Senior Mu Bai,

468
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,760
I'll also call you
the Light of Qingyuan.

469
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,560
Excuse me.

470
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,360
Come on.

471
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,040
Tantan, don't force yourself.

472
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,880
In my heart, the Light of Qingyuan
is always you.

473
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,360
Look.

474
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,600
Senior Mu Bai is so good to her.

475
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,920
What's the big deal
about chopping a cucumber?

476
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,800
Bring me

477
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,800
the most challenging thing here.

478
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,760
Please start your performance.

479
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:30,760
Watch this.

480
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,120
One,

481
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,320
two,

482
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,280
three!

483
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,600
What are you looking at?
Go and knead the dough.

484
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,200
Okay.

485
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,320
It was a mistake.

486
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,800
I'll do it again.

487
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:58,760
One,

488
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,520
two!

489
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,280
Xianfang, are you okay?

490
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:03,800
What's wrong?

491
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,400
What's wrong?

492
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,480
Senior Mu Bai.

493
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,600
She cut my finger.

494
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,160
Well...

495
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,720
It's okay.

496
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:21,760
It's okay. He's fine.

497
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,800
Tantan, chopping is not your thing.

498
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,400
Go have some rest. Leave it to me.

499
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,640
Well...

500
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,720
Cui Chen, let me take you to the hall

501
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,800
and see if the crab suit fits you.

502
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:37,680
Let's go.

503
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,160
Come here.

504
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,240
What's wrong?

505
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm warning you.

506
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,760
You'd better behave yourself
from now on.

507
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:49,960
Behave myself?

508
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:51,800
What's wrong with me?

509
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,000
What's wrong?

510
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,760
You're making people think

511
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,800
there is something between us.

512
00:21:59,200 --> 00:21:59,720
What is it?

513
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,280
Don't play dumb with me.

514
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:04,680
Well,

515
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,160
is there something going on
between them?

516
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,600
I think Senior Mu Bai likes Tantan.

517
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,680
You must be kidding.

518
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,600
That's Mu Bai Zhenren.

519
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,040
Tantan must have confessed
and been rejected.

520
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,600
Senior Mu Bai feels guilty about it,

521
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,120
and that's why he's been
so good to Tantan.

522
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,160
He's a friendly to his fellows.

523
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,280
No wonder he's the Light of Qingyuan
that our master can't forget.

524
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,880
Stay away from me.

525
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,720
How far away?

526
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,080
This far?

527
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,160
Stay away from me!

528
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,400
Have a look.

529
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,360
- This way. Have a taste of our noodles.
- We're offering free tasting today.

530
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,680
Everything is free.

531
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,480
If you can't finish it,

532
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,520
[Free Tasting]
you can take it to go.

533
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,760
Come inside and have a taste.

534
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,520
Inside, please.

535
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,160
Have a try of our noodles.

536
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:47,800
Have a look, my friends.

537
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,720
You've been shouting for a while.
Have some noodles.

538
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,680
It just came out of the pot.

539
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,440
Have a try.

540
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,880
Have a look, my friends.

541
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,400
You must get tired of eating noodles

542
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,120
at the Shu's Noodle Restaurant
across the street.

543
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:57,600
Now...

544
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,760
I added a lot of crab roe in it.

545
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,560
Just have one mouthful.

546
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,360
Just have one mouthful.

547
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,440
Shu's Noodle Restaurant.

548
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,840
Maybe it's because of my cooking.

549
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,560
Have some noodles!

550
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,000
Old Crab.

551
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,880
Your cooking is fine.

552
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,400
I'll go to the Shu's Noodle Restaurant

553
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,880
and gather some information.

554
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,160
I'll see

555
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,720
what spell he cast on everyone.

556
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,680
It's delicious.

557
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,680
I'll have one more!

558
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,880
Coming right up.

559
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,240
It's so good.

560
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,080
Waiter, I'll have one more!

561
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,000
All right!

562
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,240
Why do I feel that
they can't stop eating?

563
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,080
It's like they can't control themselves.

564
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,120
The noodles are coming.

565
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,360
Here are your noodles.

566
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,480
Here are yours.

567
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,760
Wait, there's spiritual power in it.

568
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,120
What spiritual power?

569
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,560
You just don't want me to eat it.

570
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,760
Tantan, stop eating.

571
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,840
I'll have one more!

572
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,520
You know what,

573
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,320
I thought Old Crab's noodles

574
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,800
were the best on earth,

575
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,400
but this is better,

576
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,400
so much better.

577
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,480
Waiter, I'll have three more!

578
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,120
All right!

579
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:24,880
Three more?

580
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:25,720
Are you not eating?

581
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,120
I'll eat for you.

582
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,440
It's good.

583
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,200
Waiter, I'll have two more!

584
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:30,400
Stop eating.

585
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,800
- Wait, I haven't finished.
- Come here. The noodles are not right.

586
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,200
I haven't finished.

587
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,760
Why are they leaving?

588
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,400
Shu's Noodle Restaurant.

589
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,160
Welcome. Inside, please.

590
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:45,800
Don't move.

591
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:46,600
Sit down.

592
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,600
What's wrong?

593
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,920
Is it so bad that it makes me cry?

594
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,120
I cry because it's so good.

595
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,280
Zhao Tantan.

596
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,800
Which side are you on?

597
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,120
Of course I'm on your side.

598
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,160
But their noodles are too delicious.

599
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,520
I'm so mad.

600
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:03,720
I'm so mad.

601
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,680
Looks like my restaurant
is going out of business.

602
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,640
Let's get ready to close up.

603
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,800
I'll go pack.

604
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,120
Wait.

605
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:12,920
Wait.

606
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,000
That's not what I meant.

607
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,000
We can figure it out.

608
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,480
Why are you following me?

609
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,800
Who's following you?

610
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,360
I went to buy some candied haws

611
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,560
and ran into you on my way back.

612
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:40,720
Do you want some?

613
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,240
I have no appetite.

614
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,160
Candied haws are appetizing food.

615
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,520
Look, this one is made of
strawberries and haws.

616
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,760
It's sweet and crunchy.

617
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,040
I'll eat it if you don't.

618
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,320
It's the best of the best.

619
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,560
The sugar coating is thin and crispy.

620
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,840
The haws are big and juicy.

621
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,840
Well, I'm not lying to you, right?

622
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,080
Cui Chen, do you think I'm stupid?

623
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,680
I always make things worse
out of good intentions.

624
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,320
Everyone can see your good intentions.

625
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,640
Why be so hard on yourself?

626
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,720
But I think

627
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,400
I'm the last straw
that broke the noodle restaurant's back.

628
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,640
It's because of my loose tongue

629
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,280
that they lost confidence
in the restaurant.

630
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,960
The restaurant hasn't closed yet.

631
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,400
Are you giving up now?

632
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,280
The Zhao Tantan I remember

633
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,480
is not like this.

634
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,480
As long as you don't give up,
I'll be there for you.

635
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,760
Let's look forward.

636
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,280
There will be a turning point.

637
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,880
Cui Chen.

638
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,000
Hurry up.

639
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,440
What are they transporting?

640
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,120
No matter what it is,

641
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,040
they look sneaky.
There must be something wrong.

642
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,400
Let's go check it out.

643
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,440
It stinks.

644
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,520
Don't look.

645
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,720
I'm gonna throw up.

646
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,480
No wonder they can lower costs.

647
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,280
They're using recycled slop.

648
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,600
Cui Chen.

649
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,560
Cui Chen.

650
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,360
You look delicious.

651
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,000
Wait.

652
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,280
Do you know what you're saying?

653
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,360
Let me have a bite.

654
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,280
Just one bite.

655
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,240
No!

656
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:37,920
No!

657
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:39,480
No!

658
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:39,960
Control yourself!

659
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,240
Tantan!

660
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,720
Don't do this!

661
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,760
Who are you guys?

662
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,160
You're a handsome man.

663
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,840
Why haven't I never seen you before?

664
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,320
He's my senior.

665
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,240
He's mine.

666
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,800
Who can prove it?

667
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,240
Yeah.

668
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,960
Who can prove it?

669
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,480
Don't you want to break up with me?

670
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,920
Did you hear that?

671
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,960
This handsome man said

672
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,280
he has nothing to do with you.

673
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:08,960
I...

674
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,320
I was kidding.

675
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,720
You don't know how sad I am.

676
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,200
I can't talk to you every day.

677
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,960
I'm afraid it's all my wishful thinking.

678
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,280
If Lian Wen comes back,

679
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,520
and you leave me...

680
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,000
Stop!

681
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,400
How can I bear to leave you?

682
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,520
My world revolves around you.

683
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,880
Tell me how to undo the spiritual power.

684
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,360
Turn the bottom of the instrument,

685
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,680
and you can undo the spiritual power.

686
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,520
See?

687
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,120
I was under a spell.

688
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,960
Don't take my words seriously.

689
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,360
But I'm sober.

690
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,040
Every word I say is from my heart.

691
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,480
Tell us what this is.

692
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,040
This cruet
is our boss's magic instrument.

693
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,280
It's called "Everyone-Love-It Cruet".

694
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,200
If you use a little bit
of the spiritual power side,

695
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,480
you can make people love
the enchanted object.

696
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,360
The more you use it,
the more they like it.

697
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,560
What happened to him?

698
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,280
It's the same.

699
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,800
After using the Everyone-Love-It Cruet,

700
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,480
even the most disliked person
can become likable.

701
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,160
Did you hear that?

702
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,520
It's because of this cruet.

703
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,240
Even the most disliked person
can become likable.

704
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,880
Stop eating!

705
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,280
The noodles are problematic!

706
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,640
Trust me!

707
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,520
What are you talking about?

708
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,200
Look at what you're eating.

709
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:02,440
Hurry up!

710
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,080
This restaurant is run
by an evil spirit!

711
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,390
Don't go!

712
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,120
Get out of here!

713
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:06,840
Hurry!

714
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:07,550
Come back!

715
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:07,950
Go!

716
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:08,840
Come back!

717
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,400
Close the door!

718
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,040
Who do you think you are?

719
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,800
I'm the owner, Shu Laoda.

720
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,360
Laoda?

721
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,160
You know what,

722
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,040
your nemesis is here.

723
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,760
You'd better reflect on yourself.

724
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,200
Then I can spare your life.

725
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,360
Catch them!

726
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,240
Have a taste of slop.

727
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,000
Go away!

728
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,200
Immortal Annihilation Formation!
