16
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:45,910
Hello, everyone, my last name is Qiu.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,680
Mr. Qiu, you don't need
to introduce yourself.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,190
Let's get into a real love story.

00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,120
[Judges]

20
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,080
A long time ago,

21
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:02,910
there was a boy

22
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,270
who was always bullied.

23
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,590
So, he swore

24
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,630
to make those who bullied him regret it.

25
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,750
But no matter how hard he tried,
it was futile.

26
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,630
Because his brother

27
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,750
always used various ways

28
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,750
to steal everyone's attention,

29
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,880
and this boy

30
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,960
became a stumbling block
in the eyes of everyone.

31
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,190
Until he met a girl

32
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,750
who was simple and kind.

33
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,910
She was always there for him,
encouraging him.

34
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,030
When this boy

35
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,910
was about to confess his love to her,

36
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,550
his older brother beat him to it

37
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,550
and proposed to her.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,390
Did the girl ever know

39
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,000
that the boy liked her?

40
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,800
Maybe.

41
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,440
I don't know.

42
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,520
It's touching.

43
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,910
Thank you, Mr. Qiu.

44
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,390
The one in the back. It's your turn.

45
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,830
Please share a real love story.

46
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,550
Some time ago, a friend of mine

47
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,520
was in love with a girl.

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,960
In everyone's eyes,

49
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,470
they were the perfect match.

50
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,320
However,
on the day before their wedding,

51
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,000
the girl told him

52
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,160
her identity was fake.

53
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,390
They were from two different worlds.

54
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,360
Then everyone was against
them being together.

55
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,390
Isn't this the typical plot
of a third-rate story?

56
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,270
Is there a good story at all?

Yes.

Hurry up.

61
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:56,600
Go ahead.

62
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:03,360
We grew up together,

63
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,830
without any earth-shattering events.

64
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,800
We lived a simple yet cozy life,

65
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,270
going on outings together,

66
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,600
and playing sports together.

67
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,640
We even bathed together.

- Bathed together?
- Bathed together?

00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,320
Bathed together?

70
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,950
That's an interesting story.

71
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,270
Bathed together?

72
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,390
No.

73
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,200
But there is one little thing
I remember.

74
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,480
You see, we have

75
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,600
completely different tastes,

76
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,000
so we ate separately.

77
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,110
But one time, on his birthday,

78
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:41,760
I snuck over to his house

79
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,480
to give him a surprise.

80
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,600
Guess what?

81
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,720
What happened?

82
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,000
What happened?

83
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,510
I found him

84
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,200
eating my favorite foods,

85
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,270
which are heavily oiled and spicy.

86
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,390
He was sweating profusely.

87
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,880
When he realized I found it,

88
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,270
he hid himself in a hurry,

89
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,270
looking really embarrassed.

90
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,350
But at that moment,

91
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,070
I felt he was the cutest in the world.

92
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,950
It's detailed and sincere.

93
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,390
A femme fatale.

94
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,070

95
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,350

97
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,270

Take care, Mr. Qiu.

102
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,350
I'm so mad.

103
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,160
They actually called me a femme fatale.

104
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,510
I just...

105
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,600

106
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,070

107
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,790
Did you make up that story?

108
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,440
What do you mean?

109
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,760
Didn't the examiner say

110
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,670
we must tell a real story?

111
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,670
I'm an honest person.

112
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,110
Why would I lie?

113
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,670
Besides, I spoke with such sincerity.

114
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,000
Can't you two tell?

115
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,550
When did it happen?
Why don't I know about it?

116
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,670
Time flies.

117
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,110
It was almost

118
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,040

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,670
Three years.

121
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,350
Luckily, I had him with me,

122
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,920
or the life at the Qingyuan Sect

123
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,600
would be too boring.

124
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,230

125
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,640
Do you really like him?

126
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,440
Of course I do.

127
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,000
He's really cute.

128
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,760
Though he can be naughty at times,

129
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,320
he's very smart

130
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,670
and learns fast.

131
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,070
If Xueyi

132
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,070
didn't lose him
when she was walking him,

133
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,200
I might still have him.

134
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,790
- A dog?
- A dog?

135
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:49,510
What else could it be?

136
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,110
What about you two?

137

I was talking about my friend.

138
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,600
I said it.

139

I...

140
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,040
Me, too.

141
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,390
It's Mo Yan.

The Qionghua Sect's
Gathering of Fated Marriage this year

148
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:17,760
is unprecedentedly popular.

149
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,110
The number of participants
has reached a record high.

150
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,390
That's why the interview is so strict.

151
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,270
But
you three are definitely rare talents.

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,390
Yes.

154
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,110
It's a specialized academy
under the Qionghua Sect.

Read the next two sentences.
That's what's important.

156

There are a few spots that lead to
the Gathering of Fated Marriage.

157
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:52,760
Yes.

158
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,440
If you three take the class,

159
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,390
you can definitely pass effortlessly.

160
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,830
What's the cost?

161
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,950
It's only five taels of gold

162
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:00,790
per person per session.

163
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,790
Read the last part.

164
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,830
There's also a nine-mace discount.

165
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,790
You're robbing us.

166
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,160
It's not expensive indeed.

167
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,790
Thanks for telling us that, Mr. Lu.

168
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,270
You're welcome.

169
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,000
Qiu.

170
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,790
This is clearly robbing.

171
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,070
They think we're fools.

172
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,000
The future light of Qingyuan.

173
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,110
That's not true.

174
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,270
Providing customers
with the best service

175
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,350
is my goal.

176
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,830
Lu Yi.

177
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,760
I have to go. I'll wait for you guys.

178
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:35,960
I'm not really here

179
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,960
for the Gathering of Fated Marriage.

180
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,910
How about we climb over the wall?

181
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:43,840
What's this?

182
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,550
What? There's a hole in the tripod?

183
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,110
Let's go to our master
and see if he can fix it.

184
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,520
No. He will blame us for negligence.

185
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,840
But the Marriage Tripod
is a treasure of the Qionghua Sect.

186
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,640
Only our master can fix it.

187
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,440
The most important thing now

188
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,840
is to find something
to fix the Marriage Tripod

189
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,840
and ensure the Gathering
of Fated Marriage goes well.

190
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,710
I know.

191
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,550
But what do we need?

192
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,230
That's why I'm asking you.

193
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,000
Aren't you always resourceful?

194
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,320
Figure it out.

195
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,710
Okay, let me think about it.

196
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,790
Thank God we didn't attend

197
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,320
that cram school,

198
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,280
or it would cost us a fortune.

199
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,030
The Marriage Tripod is broken

200
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,590
and they can't hold
the Gathering of Fated Marriage now.

201
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,230
It would be a big loss.

202
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,200
Do you really want to attend
the Gathering of Fated Marriage?

203
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,440
Don't forget we're here
for the lotus seed.

204
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,030
I know.

205
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,030
But without the Gathering
of Fated Marriage,

206
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,400
we can't find the lotus seed.

207
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,520
Do you want to force your way in?

208
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,590
Some people just like to argue.

209
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,760
Does it have anything to do with you?

210
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:49,880
It does.

211
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,110
Without him,

212
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,230
how could we get the enrollment fee?

213
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,710
What are you doing?

214
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,320
Can you stop

215
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,350
showing up out of nowhere every time?

216
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,640
It really scares me.

217
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,960
Then how should I show up?

218
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,150
Beating the gong and drums?

219
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,550
What are you talking about?

220
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,200
The Marriage Tripod is broken.

221
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,320
It's broken?

222
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,080
Then repair it.

223
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:21,350
The Marriage Tripod is a treasure.
How to repair it?

224
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,030
With my skin.

225
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,590
Manqian.

226
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,790
How's it going?

227
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,440
It doesn't work.

228
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,760
What should we do?

229
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,790
I think we should find our master.

230
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,350
No.

231
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,590
But I can't think of anything else...

232
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,670
What are you talking about?

233
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,670
Look.

234
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,150
Miss Zou, look.

235
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,550
What's this?

236
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,910
Toad coat?

237
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,470
The thousand-year-old toad coat

238
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,150
can repair any magic instrument
in the world.

239
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,960
Do you want it?

240
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,710
How do you know
I have an instrument to repair?

241
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,230
We're both cultivators.

242
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,150
The magic instrument

243
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,640
can be damaged at times.

244
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,790
Just tell me

245
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,400
if you want it or not.

246
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,470
What's your condition?

247
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:14,590
It's simple. Let us attend
the Gathering of Fated Marriage.

248
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:15,960
What do you want to do?

249
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,510
I...

250
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,200
Tantan.

251
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,160
Why don't we tell Miss Zou the truth

252
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,840
and let her help us?

253
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,400
Miss Zou.

254
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,190
In fact, Tantan and I
are destined for each other,

255
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,870
but an eminent monk said we are not.

256
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,070
Tantan was disappointed.

257
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,600
I begged her for a long time,

258
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,110
before she agreed to come
to the Gathering of Fated Marriage.

259
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,070
Please

260
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,750
give us another chance to prove it.

261
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,430
Tantan and I...

262
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,160
I've never seen

263
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,630
such a cheeky scoundrel like you.

264
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,070
Tantan and I are fated to be together.

265
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,870
Your marriage is arranged
by your parents.

266
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,840
We attend
the Gathering of Fated Marriage

267
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,190
to make this scoundrel back off

268
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,750
and give up Tantan.

269
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,360
Zhao Tantan.

270
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,600
Who do you like?

271
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:06,920
I...

272
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,670
Don't tell me you like both of them.

273
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,280
That's right.

274
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,310
They're both great.

275
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,310
I don't know who to choose.

276
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,430
That's why I'm here.

277
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,750
Miss Zou, please have mercy on me

278
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,360
and let me know
who's the right person for me.

279
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,600
Manqian.

280
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,550
Only with the toad coat

281
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,510
can we repair the Marriage Tripod.

282
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,160
Right?

283
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,510
If the three of them

284
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,720
can find their true love,

285
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,840
then their dramatic story

286
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,870
can be used to promote the next year's

287
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,800
Gathering of Fated Marriage.

288
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,840
And Qiu Yuebai.

289
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,280
Last time, when we were
talking business with him,

290
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,360
he was arrogant.

291
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,630
We can use this chance

292
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,670
to seal the deal.

293
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,430
All right.

294
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,160
Toad coat.

295
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,310
Here.

296
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,600
Here.

297
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,190
By the way,

298
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,630
we have one more condition.

299
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:19,040
Mr. Qiu must work with us.

300
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,430
That's too much.

301
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,840
You've got a bargain. Don't push it.

302
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,280
That's wrong.

303
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,550
This is a mutually beneficial situation.

304
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,600
Mr. Qiu should know this.

305
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,600
Business is business. No problem.

306
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,430
Good.

307
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,990
Tantan and I won't listen to

308
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,720
your business secrets.

309
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,310
I heard there's a nice night market
in Yunzhou.

310
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,360
Mr. Qiu, take your time.

311
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,480
We'll go to the night market first.

312
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,550
Let's go, my destined one.

313
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,550
But...

314
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,240
Mr. Qiu!

315
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,750
- Mr. Qiu, please stay.
- Find us at the night market.

316
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,840
We should discuss business.

317
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,670
How about we make it another day?

318
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,190
Well, if we make it another day,

319
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,430
the pass token

320
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,160
might have a problem.

321
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,750
Manqian, let's go chat.

322
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,600
Come on.

323
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:09,840
Bai, your acting was really bad.

324
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:10,990
Was your acting good?

325
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,510
He just put his hand on your shoulder.

326
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,510
Are you happy about it?

327
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,400
It's your problem to see it that way.

328
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,240
Tantan.

329
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,480
Uncle Zi Meng.

330
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,600
Well, how is it going?

331
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,960
The mission is perfectly accomplished.

332
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,720
Let's go to the night market.

333
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,840
I'll take you to eat something good.

334
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,510
I happen to know

335
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,110
a great noodle shop nearby.

336
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,070
Let's go.

337
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:34,800
Who's buying?

338
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:35,840
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

339
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,920
I'll eat many bowls of noodles.

340
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,670
Wait and see.

341
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,480
Uncle Zi Meng.

342
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,160
Why are you out today?

343
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,960
I heard that the night market
in YunZhou is bustling.

344
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,870
If I don't write it down

345
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:49,600
in the Strange Tales in the Secular World,

346
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,600
it would be a pity.

347
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,110
I didn't expect you

348
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,240
to have such professional ethics.

349
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,360
You still remember to catch up on it.

350
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,310
Or I won't be your senior.

351
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:58,800
It's that shop.

352
00:14:59,070 --> 00:14:59,920
Let's go.

353
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:01,870
Is it here?

354
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,430
Yes.

355
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,240
Why are there so many people?

356
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,310
This is the noodle shop I mentioned.

357
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,110
You know what,

358
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,080
it's been a long time since I updated
my Strange Tales in the Secular World.

359
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,910
Today I must fill it up.

360
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,030
I'm going in.

361
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:14,550
Okay.

362
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,440
Don't push.

363
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,470
Don't push.

364
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,200
Yeah.

365
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,670
I've been pushed out by some big girls.

366
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,150
Tantan, give me a hand.

367
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,350
- Okay?
- Okay.

368
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,710
Go.

369
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,000
Cui Chen, give me a hand too!

370
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,080
- Okay.
- Hurry.

371
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,000
What are you doing?

372
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,670
Who is it?

373
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,710
Go have fun. Don't worry about me!

374
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,150
Let's go.

375
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,110
Can we really leave him alone?

376
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,880
He's a 5,000-year-old toad.
He'll be fine.

377
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:37,840
Let's go.

378
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,640
You're right.

379
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,440
It's boring to wait around.

380
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,400
Let's go to the night market

381
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,030
and pig out.

382
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,280
Pig out?

383
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,760
Do you still have money on you?

384
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,880
Of course.

385
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,110
That's all I have.

386
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,110
This is what I have.

387
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,110
You can have it. I won't eat.

388
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,350
No way.

389
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:16,320
Don't worry. I won't eat alone.

390
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,960
First stop, candied haws.

391
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,000
Let's go.

392
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:22,910
Let's go.

393
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,400
Sir,
I'll have a bowl of crab roe noodles.

394
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,320
Coming.

395
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,760
Candied haws!

396
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:30,280
Sir, I'll have
two skewers of candied haws.

397
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,110
Okay.

398
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:31,790
How much?

399
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,710
Eight coins for one.

400
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:33,760
Sixteen coins for two.

401
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,960
Why is it so expensive?

402
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,280
Besides, there's no discount for two.

403
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:40,320
It's the best candied haws in Yunzhou,

404
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,320
made with genuine ingredients.

405
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,080
Have a taste

406
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,470
and you'll know why it's so expensive.

407
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,110
Have a taste.

408
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,670
Do you want it? Then bye one.

409
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,670
Okay, I'll have one.

410
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,910
Just one?

411
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,080
One is enough.

412
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,200
Here.

413
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:57,470
Here.

414
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,280
Take care.

415
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,150
I won't treat you badly.
I'll share half with you.

416
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,800
One, two, three, four.

417
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,560
That's shameless.

418
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:12,640
I'll just have one.

419
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,760
You can have the rest.

420
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,470
I'll take a look over there.

421
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,830
Come on, try it.

422
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,160
No.

423
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,710
Try it.

424
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:30,400
I won't eat it.

425
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,710
It's very good.

426
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,040
How is it?

427
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,280
Let's go. I told you it's good.

428
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,280
Twenty coins for one box.

429
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,920
How many pieces are there in one box?

430
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,880
Ten.

431
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:22,710
Here.

432
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,040
I'll have one, sir.

433
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:48,470
I'm only half full,
but we've run out of money.

434
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,560
What a pity.

435
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,710
Fireworks!

436
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,070
Bai!

437
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,640
Look!

438
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,710
The fireworks are beautiful!

439
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,470
Look, they're beautiful.

440
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,880
This is for you.

441
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,800
This is...

Something you've always wanted.

443
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,830
Uncle's toad coat?

444
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,920
I made a toad coat
out of Zi Meng's skin.

445
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,430
Now it can protect you

446
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,400
from all the dangers.

447
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,880
You mean,

448
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,520
now that I have it, I can go anywhere

449
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,920
and do anything I want?

450
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,430
You might even be more powerful than me.

451
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,950
Thank you, Bai.

452
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,070
It's so precious.

453
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,000
I must give it a name.

454
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,400
Let's call it...

455
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,680
Magic Toad Coat.

456
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,400

457

Okay, let's call it that.

458

Thank you, Bai!

459
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,590

Why are you two together?

464
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,760
I heard that the crab roe noodles here
are delicious.

465
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,800
I wanted to buy some for you

466
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,800
and ran into Uncle Zi Meng.

467
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:34,710
Well...

468
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,350
What's this, Tantan?

469
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,640
It's a toad coat that Bai gave me.

470
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,040
Well done, Cui Chen.

471
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,040
You're very thoughtful.

472
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:47,000
From now on,

I'll protect you guys wherever we go.

474
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,710
Shall we go back now?

475
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,800
The noodles are getting lumpy.

476
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,800
Okay, let's go back.

477
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,110
I'll share half with you later.

478

Only half of it?
There are so many bowls of it.

00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,080

It's so good.

00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,720
It's just hard on my claws.

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,560
Is there anything wrong?

What about you?

You've been recognized
by so many deacons. Is that not enough?

it comes and goes.

00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,600
This place
is usually off-limits to people.

563
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:03,800
It must be around here.

564
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:11,560
Be careful.

565
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:14,680
That's what I'm saying.

566
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:20,630
Hurry up.

567
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:12,720
- Yes.
- Yes.

568
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,560
I can't believe the entrance
to the treasury vault is here.

569
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,750
Be patient.

570
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,440
Let's wait and see what happens.

571
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:38,990
This way.

572
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:39,470
Come on.

573
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,040
Master, today is your birthday.

574
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,870
This is my gift to you.

575
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:12,870
Thank you.

576
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,920
But you don't have to
spend money on me next time.

577
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,750
I hope it's useful to you.

578
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,080
Okay.

579
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,990
Manqian, the gold is in place.

580
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,110
Thank you. You can go back now.

581
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,230
Yes.

582
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:51,840
Did you hear that?

583
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,150
Manqian just said thank you to me.

584
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,320
She said that to both of us.

585
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,080
Yes.

586
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,800
I like her so much.

587
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,470
She's coming.

588
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:09,720
She didn't say that to you.

589
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,080
She clearly said thank you to me!

590
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,870
Why would she say thank you to you?

591
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,600
That's ridiculous.

592
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,080
Look how weak you are.

593
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,320
I'm not weak.

594
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,800
How dare you talk
to your senior like that?

595
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,350
They're strange.

596
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,840
They were just getting along well.

597
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,840
Why did they start fighting

598
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,270
after Miss Zou passed by?

599
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,150
I sensed the scent of the lotus seed.

600
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,200
Really?

601
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,320
It's from where they came out.

602
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,750
Let's go there.

603
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:36,440
Let's go.

604
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:42,840
Ouch.

605
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,390
I think I just hit a wall.

606
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,110
Let me rub it for you.

607
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,080
No need.

608
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,560
I'll try again.

609
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,350
Here. I'll put it on your forehead.

610
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:30,390
I'll do it myself.

611
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:32,040
It's just a bump.

612
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,600
Okay.

613
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,080
Who is it?

614
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,990
It's me, Hu Meng.

615
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,230
Long time no see.

616
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,840
You golden fox.

617
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,200
Why are you working at the Qionghua Sect
as a relationship lecturer?

618
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,560
Didn't you say
you were going to find your lover?

619
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:50,630
To make a living.

620
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,990
I can make some money
as a relationship lecturer.

621
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,200
What are you two doing here?

622
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,840
You want to know

623
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,150
if you and Mr. Cui
are destined for each other,

624
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,040
right?

625
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,750
No.

626
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,390
Don't talk nonsense. We are...

627
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,840
I'll leave you guys to talk.

628
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,630
Come on, let's sit.

629
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,870
You've been here for a while.

630
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,350
How have you been?

631
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:26,560
Did Zou Manqian give you a hard time?

632
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,800
I'm fine.

633
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:30,230
Why do you think Zou Manqian
would give me a hard time?

634
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:33,350
I just think she's powerful.

635
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,230
She seems to be in charge of everything.

636
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:40,920
But why haven't I seen Mr. Su?

637
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:44,040
You think Zou Manqian is powerful,

638
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:46,470
but in fact,

639
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:48,200
she has to ask Mr. Su for permission.

640
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,230
Everything is done

641
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,390
under the direction of Mr. Su.

642
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,630
Zou Manqian.

643
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,960
Zou Manqian.

644
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,150
Master, it's me.

645
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,270
Come in.

646
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,800
Master, you've been reviewing
for over two hours.

647
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,040
Have some lotus seed soup
and rest early.

648
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,510
Is everything ready
for tomorrow's gathering?

649
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,080
Don't worry. Everything is ready.

650
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:35,200
I'm here to get the treasure ware.

651
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,680
Go ahead. Thank you.

652
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,510
(As expected, Su Zhinan
has the treasure ware.)

653
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:56,470
Master, as for the reward
you mentioned last time,

654
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,680
I've made up my mind.

655
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,510
I want to be your assistant.

656
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:06,200
That will waste your talent.

657
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,870
I just want to stay by your side
and help you.

658
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,040
Ever since you came
to the Qionghua Sect,

659
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,870
you've been a capable helper.

660
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,870
You've helped me a lot.

661
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:19,350
Thanks to you,

662
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,630
I've been able to keep the sect
in order.

663
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,800
You gave me the opportunity
to join the Qionghua Sect.

664
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:26,800
I must do my best to help you.

665
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,320
I'm gonna appoint you
as the manager of the Qionghua Sect.

666
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,440
You'll be in charge of
all external business.

667
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,990
What do you think?

668
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,350
That way, I'll have to
inspect the store regularly

669
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,270
and won't be able to stay in the sect.

670
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,320
It may be a bit challenging,

671
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,080
but I believe that
with your capabilities,

672
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,470
you can take our sect to a higher level.

673
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:53,960
Yes, Master.

674
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,270
What's more,

675
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,150
With the gathering approaching,
you have a lot of things to do.

676
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:00,680
You don't have to take care of me.

677
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:02,870
Yes.

678
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:04,510
If there's nothing else,

679
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:05,990
you can go back and rest early.

680
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:11,880
Is there anything else?

681
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:16,880
At the gathering tomorrow,

682
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,600
many distinguished ladies
will come for you.

683
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,560
Will you be there tomorrow?

684
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,080
I have my own plans.

685
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,470
You don't need to worry about it.

686
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,750
Go about your work.

687
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:29,360
I'll leave you to rest.

688
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:37,710
Stop!

689
