It doesn't matter
that the cultivators escaped.

124
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,480
As long as
we collect all seven lotus seeds,

125
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,510
the Seven-Leaf Lotus will be restored.

126

I'll just take some medicine.

188
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,360
I'm going to decoct medicine.

189
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,390
Take it.

190
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,390
Take it.

191
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,240
Cui Chen, you go decoct the medicine.

192
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,190
I can't leave him alone.

193
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,480
I'll ask Mo Yan

194
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,510
to decoct the medicine.

195
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:26,800
OK.

196
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,800
I'll decoct the medicine.

197
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,710
Thanks, Mr. Cui.

198
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,390
It's OK.

199
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,510
We're family.

200
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,360
(You let me decoct your medicine.)

201
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,590
(I'll cure you with the medicine.)

202
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,200
Qiu,

203
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,560
what do you think?

204
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,750
Isn't this ointment
for bruises and injuries

205
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,960
from our sect effective is powerful?

206
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,600
If you give me 10 taels of silver,

207
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,200
I'll give it to you.

208
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,630
What do you think?

209
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,230
Mr. Qiu.

210
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:34,150
Time to take medicine.

211
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,320
Thanks, Mr. Cui.

212
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,840
Why don't you bring a spoon?

213
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,200
It'll take effect quickly
if he drinks it in one gulp.

214
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,200
It's good. Come on.

215
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,870
It isn't very hot.

216
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:47,960
Qiu, drink up.

217
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,440
Drink.

218
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:51,720
Drink.

219
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,750
Good medicine tastes bitter.

220
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,110
I'm sure you know that.

221
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,200
Hurry.

222
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,080
He's right. Good medicine tastes bitter.

223
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,350
You must drink it.

224
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,680
Drink it and you'll get well soon.

225
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,870
Drink up. Get well soon.

226
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,960
Your face is getting rosy.

227
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,840
It seems that after the strong remedy,

228
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,200
you're almost cured.

229
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,270
Yeah, you have half the credit.

230
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,800
Since you've recovered,

231
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,510
we should take the lotus seed back
to the Qingyuan Sect.

232
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,390
Come.

233
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,350
I'll go with you.

234
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,390
Our sect doesn't engage
in sightseeing business.

235
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,510
I'm not going for sightseeing.

236
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:37,680
Tantan just said

237
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:38,840
she reached the virtuoso phase.

238
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,110
She can officially accept me
as her disciple now.

239
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,230
No time like the present.

240
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,750
Today is the day.

241
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,270
Yeah.

242
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,600
I've reached the virtuoso phase.

243
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,200
No time like the present.

244
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,230
Today, let’s go through
with the disciple admission ritual.

245
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,920
As your future senior master,

246
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,680
I need to explain to you

247
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,390
the seven rules of the Qingyuan Sect

248
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,630
lest you join the sect by mistake

249
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,720
and break our rules.

250
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,990
Rules?

251
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,320
Qiu,

252
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,920
we do have many rules,

253
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,720
but I don't remember any of them.

254
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,840
It's OK.

255
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,230
I'm all ears.

256
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,870
First, respect for all living things.

257
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:32,960
Keep in mind that all beings are equal.

258
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:33,750
Sure.

259
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,720
Second, maintain order and peace
in heaven and earth.

260
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,630
Guard the tranquility
and happiness of a region.

261
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,350
That's what I want.

262
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,150
Third...

263
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,350
Seventh, respect for seniority.

264
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,990
Abide by the rules of ethics and morality.
Live amicably with fellow disciples.

265
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,440
After hearing the seven rules,

266
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,990
I'm even more determined
to join the Qingyuan Sect.

267
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:08,920
Tan...

268
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:11,800
Tantan.

269
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:13,960
Tantan.

270
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:16,870
Yeah.

271
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,150
Well said.

272
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,470
I was right about you.

273
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,350
Come on.

274
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,750
What I've said

275
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,800
are only the guiding rules.

276
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,990
Under each rule,

277
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,270
there are over 300 detailed rules.

278
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,920
I'll tell you one by one.

279
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,110
Stop it.

280
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,110
We'll talk about the detailed rules
later.

281
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,110
The tea is getting cold.

282
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,110
Let's hurry up.

283
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,270
You can't do that.

284
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,720
I'm the senior brother
of the Qingyuan Sect.

285
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,390
I must be responsible for our sect.

286
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:41,470
Forget it.

287
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,040
I will

288
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,750
keep it simple for you.

289
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,080
Manager.

290
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,110
Manager.

291
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,630
Our inn opens at 11 p.m.

292
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,840
I'm not going to stay here.

293
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,600
I'm looking for a girl.

294
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,080
Take the third rule for example,

295
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,390
industry and frugality,
self-denial for public.

296
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,870
It requires us to be self-sufficient,

297
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,320
not to be greedy,

298
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,390
and share our wealth

299
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:35,560
with those in need.

300
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:38,870
Mr. Qiu, you've got such a big business
in the secular world.

301
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,230
I'm afraid you can't keep it.

302
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,800
Is it so strict?

303
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,720
Qiu, you should think it over.

304
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,080
What? Do you want to be a quitter?

305
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,200
What's wrong with my ears?

306
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,750
It's OK. You guys, go ahead.

307
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,350
After I become
Tantan's disciple officially,

308
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,080
I'll donate

309
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,200
all my assets.

310
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:06,800
OK.

311
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,510
The seventh, respect for seniority.

312
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,750
It means that along the way,

313
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,440
you must wait upon your master

314
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:19,720
and

315
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:25,750
your senior master, me.

316
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,600
Greet us in the morning.

317
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,470
Prepare our foot-washing water
in the evening.

318
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,320
Cui Chen,

319
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,630
it isn't nice.

320
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,470
Why not? It's great.

321
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,920
Cui Chen, don't you know

322
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,990
if your feet smell?

323
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:43,470
It's OK.

324
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,080
That's what I should do.

325
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,680
Above all, the seventh rule
requires the disciples

326
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,600
to abide by
the rules of ethics and morality

327
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,800
and forbids marriage between disciples

328
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,960
of different seniority.

329
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,600
What does that mean?

330
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,870
Hey, kids.

331
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,840
I finally found you.

332
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,270
How do you know we are here?

333
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,990
The owl told me.

334
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,350
Toad,

335
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,200
what can we do for you?

336
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,270
You wicked kid.

337
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,920
My name is Zi Meng,

338
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:18,150
not Toad.

339
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:21,680
I'm not a kid.

340
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,320
I'm Zhao Tantan of the Qingyuan Sect.

341
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,600
Let me introduce them.

342
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,870
This is Cui Chen.

343
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,630
The one behind you is Qiu Yuebai.

344
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:33,560
OK.

345
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,800
You saved me yesterday.

346
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,990
As a token of my appreciation,

347
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,600
I'll give you my toad coat

348
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,600
as a gift.

349
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,390
I'm not a toad. Why do I need your skin?

350
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,720
Besides, we've got the lotus seed.

351
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,390
Are you a fool?

352
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,320
The golden toad coat is invulnerable
to fire and water; sword and spear.

353
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:08,990
Good.

354
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:11,840
Interesting.

355
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,270
You may be young,
but you've got some sense.

356
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,440
The lotus seed wasn't mine anyway.

357
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,040
But, little girl,

358
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,470
do you know how many people

359
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,350
want my toad coat?

360
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,440
You don't know what's what.

361
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,840
You keep calling me little girl,

362
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:28,080
but how old are you?

363
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,390
I've lived a long time.

364
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,470
I can't remember how old I am.

365
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,990
But I'm at least 5,000 years old.

366
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,080
You toads...

367
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,440
No.

368
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:43,440
Are you golden toads related to turtles?

369
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,270
I don't know what you're talking about.

370
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,680
If you don't want my toad coat,

371
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,110
I'll take it away.

372
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,150
Of course I want it.

373
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,040
It's such a treasure.

374
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,320
With your profound strength,

375
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:00,600
how come you were trapped
at the bottom of the pool by Mr. Er?

376
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,600
I'm so embarrassed.

377
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,320
Over the past hundreds of years,

378
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,320
I haven't improved my accomplishment.

379
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,230
On the contrary,
I'm getting dumber and dumber.

380
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,150
Mr. Er told me

381
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:12,470
there was a place
where I could molt in peace.

382
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,600
When I got there, he trapped me at once.

383
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,110
He also passed off my inner pill
as the lotus seed

384
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,320
to fool you cultivators.

385
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,080
So he didn't know

386
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,230
you really had the seed.

387
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,270
Mr. Goose is evil.

388
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,200
But don't worry.

389
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,680
We Qingyuan Sect
has subdued him already.

390
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,600
Are you from the Qingyuan Sect?

391
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,080
Didn't I just tell you?

392
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,080
Didn't I tell you I wasn't smart?

393
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,510
I hear that your sect is a fair place
producing outstanding people.

394
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,470
There's a small village behind your sect

395
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,080
sheltering all kinds of spirits.

396
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:48,600
May I go there

397
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,080
to rest and recuperate?

398
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,270
You're exceedingly welcome.

399
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,630
Good girl.

400
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,600
This book...

401
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,990
What's all this?

402
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,150
I've never done anything serious

403
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,440
in 5,000 years

404
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,230
except for

405
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,990
collecting strange tales.

406
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,230
Weaving them together,

407
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,040
I've compiled a book,
Strange Tales in the Secular World.

408
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,230
But my original manuscript

409
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,080
has been messed up
during the difficult journey.

410
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,110
Strange Tales in the Secular World.

411
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:14,630
I've never heard of it.

412
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,390
It was a famous book
from 1,000 years ago.

413
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,390
It's said that in the book,

414
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:21,510
answers to all the questions
in the world could be found.

415
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,440
But since it was written

416
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,960
in an impalpable tadpole language,

417
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,150
few people could read it,

418
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,510
so it was lost.

419
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,960
Impressive.

420
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:32,920
So, do you know everything in this book?

421
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,470
I never use ghostwriters.

422
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,470
OK, let me ask you a question.

423
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,630
I'd...

424
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,560
Look at Cui Chen.

425
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:44,840
Here.

426
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:46,750
Here.

427
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,870
What's this flower on his forehead?

428
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,600
You...

429
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,560
Won't fail
to answer the first question, will you?

430
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,150
It's a curse.

431
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,560
Xilan Flower Curse.

432
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,390
Whenever he's enamored with someone,
the flower will bloom.

433
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,720
It will bloom five times at most.

434
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,080
We know.

435
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,920
What about after five times?

436
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,630
Is there a way to lift the curse?

437
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,600
I forgot.

438
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,600
Are you kidding me?

439
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,110
Do you only remember a name?

440
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:41,440
I told you again and again
I wasn't smart.

441
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,510
But don't worry.

442
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,150
When I settle down at the Qingyuan Sect,

443
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,510
I'll organize my manuscript
as soon as possible.

444
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,600
I'll tell you in person when I'm done.

445
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,630
No.

446
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,630
No.

447
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,270
Let me see.

448
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,750
Come here.

449
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,680
There's a lotus seed.

450
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,390
Look.

451
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,800
Let me see.

452
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,920
Yeah, this is the location
of a lotus seed.

453
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,040
It's in the Qionghua Sect.

454
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,960
The Qionghua Sect?

455
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,440
But they wouldn't

456
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,840
just let us in.

457
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:27,040
We have to find a way to sneak in.

458
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,560
Tantan,

459
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,110
I'm familiar with the Qionghua Sect.

460
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:31,040
Didn't Miss Zou ask me
to do business with her last time?

461
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,560
Let's hit the road before it's too late.

462
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,990
Let's finish
the disciple admission ritual first.

463
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,470
It won't take long.

464
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,080
We can do it some other day.

465
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,320
It's important to find the lotus seed.

466
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:38,840
Go.

467
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,320
Yes. Let's Go.

468
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,750
Qiu,

469
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,920
why is the lotus seed
in the Qionghua Sect?

470
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,840
Zou Manqian seemed

471
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,920
cold and distant last time.

472
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,560
I don't think the Qionghua Sect
is easy to deal with.

473
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:57,470
Indeed.

474
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,870
I hear that the whole sect
is obsessed with making money.

475
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,680
And their master even collects treasures
by cheating.

476
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,110
Once the treasures go into their vault,

477
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:03,990
it's hard to get them out.

478
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,080
What should we do then?

479
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,040
Zou Manqian

480
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,270
asked to do business with me last time.

481
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,750
Perhaps she would do me a favor.

482
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,320
Don't push.

483
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,150
We have enough.

484
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,750
Give me one.

485
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:16,440
Give me one.

486
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,200
Gathering of Fated Marriage.

487
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,230
[Qionghua helps you find true love.]
It's not only a grand event for the sect

488
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,800
but also a fellowship gathering
for the cultivation world.

489
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,920
[Qionghua Sect]

490
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,510
The Gathering of Fated Marriage
will come soon.

491
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,080
This is a great event
not only for our sect

492
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,750
but also for the cultivation world.

493
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,390
I hope everyone here
can fulfill their duties.

494
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:43,600
The affairs concerning the gathering
are proceeding smoothly.

495
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,600
Our newly established
Romantic Relationship Academy

496
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,560
has already earned 10,000 taels of gold.

497
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,150
I have some other good news.

498
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,040
Our divination fee income

499
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,320
has increased by 20% over last year.

500
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:54,840
Thanks to Senior Zou's suggestion

501
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,870
of discounts for singles

502
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,230
and middle-aged widows and widowers,

503
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,510
people attending this year's gathering

504
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:01,560
have greatly increased.

505
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,230
But remember,

506
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,600
we must think what people think

507
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,680
and ensure the divination accuracy.

508
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,510
This year's gathering

509
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,630
has the most registrants in history.

510
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,320
Moreover, Master's proposal

511
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,470
to involve non-cultivators

512
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,990
has finally been implemented

513
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,440
this year.

514
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,680
Very good, Manqian.

515
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,800
This is the first time

516
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:20,080
you've been in charge of the gathering.

517
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,510
Don't make any mistakes.

518
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,990
Though we are a business-oriented sect,

519
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:26,320
we should be honest

520
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,720
with all participants,

521
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,990
help all singles to find their love,

522
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,600
help lovers to tie the knot,

523
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,350
improve their marital happiness,

524
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,270
and make everyone happy.

525
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,390
Good point, Master.

526
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:37,350
Yes.

527
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:38,510
This place is lively.

528
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,750
What kind of place is the Qionghua Sect?

529
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,560
Why is it so heaving?

530
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,320
Yeah.

531
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,720
We Qingyuan Sect can't compare to them.

532
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,320
Come here.

533
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,390
What does it say?

534
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,110
Hello.

535
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,230
Take a look.

536
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:52,920
Here.

537
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:53,840
Please.

538
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,440
This way.

539
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,680
What do you think?

540
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,150
I'd like to take a look inside.

541
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:01,160
[Qionghua Sect]

542
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:01,880
You can have a try.

543
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,360
Where are you going?

544
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,270
What's this place?

545
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,910
A place for handling weddings
and funerals.

546
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:20,600
Excuse me.

547
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,240
Do you have more talismans?

548
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,840
I need one for praying for offspring
and one for avoiding disaster.

549
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,880
Don't run around.

550
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,310
Look.

551
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,430
These talismans
have no spiritual power at all.

552
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,880
Why would people snap them up?

553
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,030
Just for peace of mind.

554
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,120
If this works,

555
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,480
we don't have to practice so hard.

556
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,880
When will people line up like this

557
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,120
to give money to the Qingyuan Sect?

558
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:40,840
Tantan, come with me.

559
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,390
Take an inventory
of the gold we've got today

560
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,360
and seal it in boxes.

561
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,390
Yes.

562
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,000
Miss Zou, how are you?

563
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,840
Mr. Qiu,

564
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,270
aren't you scornful of our sect?

565
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,880
Why did you come to visit us?

566
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,360
You are mistaken about me.

567
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,240
I've brought

568
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,240
two of my friends

569
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,000
to visit your

570
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,600
Gathering of Fated Marriage

571
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,030
and explore business opportunities.

572
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:08,600
The registration desk is over there.

573
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:12,000
I wish all of you
would find your true love.

574
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:14,720
I still have work, excuse me.

575
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,240
So everyone can get in.

576
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,310
Someone thinks too highly of himself.

577
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,150
Come.

578
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,480
Tan...

579
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:38,880
Come on. Let's sign up.

580
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,000
We're going to the Gathering.

581
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,190
Two registration forms.

582
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:44,910
Three.

583
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,150
Ten taels of silver for each.

584
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:46,960
What?

585
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:47,910
Ten taels.

586
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,640
You're robbing us.

587
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,190
That's enough
to cover a month's expenses

588
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,270
for our whole sect.

589
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:54,600
Our Gathering of Fated Marriage
is a top service.

590
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,390
Of course it's expensive.

591
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:59,550
Turn left at the entrance,
you'll see a vendor selling red strings

592
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,550
for 10 cents each for marriage seeking.

593
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,120
Please leave.

594
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,310
Are you making trouble?

595
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,240
Is Qionghua such an unbridled sect?

596
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,880
I'm pissed off.

597
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:11,760
Tantan, let me handle it.

598
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,880
I'll pay for it.

599
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,120
No.

600
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:19,030
Though the Qionghua Sect
says love is priceless,

601
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:20,000
they only use it as a tool

602
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,390
to make money.

603
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,430
Gold has a price, but true love doesn't.

604
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,640
Our sect organizes
the Gathering of Fated Marriage

605
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,550
to help single people in the world

606
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,640
seek true love.

607
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,760
We charge a fee so that participants

608
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,240
can enjoy better services.

609
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:35,080
You're exaggerating by rhetoric.

610
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,720
If you say so,

611
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,360
the poor don't deserve true love, right?

612
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,080
We also offer affordable services.

613
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,510
Besides, what's wrong
with paying for true love?

614
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:45,550
You can ask anyone here

615
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,600
and see how many people would
pay everything for true love.

616
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,670
What right do you greedy people have

617
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:52,080
to talk about true love?

618
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:52,640
You...

619
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:53,480
Enough.

620
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:54,960
Give me.

621
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,390
Tantan, we've got work.

622
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,120
We're off.

623
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,030
I'm so pissed.

624
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,160
If this Gathering

625
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,710
doesn't help me find my true love,

626
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:17,030
I'll go to the government office
and report them for fraud.

627
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,160
We're here to look for the lotus seed.

628
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:20,680
Fine.

629
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,440
After we find the lotus seed,

630
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,710
I'll settle the score with them.

631
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:26,790
Next.

632
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,160
It's our turn.

633
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,000
[Judges' Table]

634
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,950
Mr. Qiu, you came too.

635
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,270
It's our honor.

636
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,710
You can set an example
for our participants.

637
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:43,680
Wait.

638
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:45,120
Let's get the rules straight.

639
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:45,840
It's simple.

640
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,360
Introduce yourself

641
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,160
and then tell a true love story.

642
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:51,160
If three or more judges

643
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,030
[Qualified]
do this, you can pass.

644
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,160
Tantan.

645
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,750
It's OK. I'll do it first.
