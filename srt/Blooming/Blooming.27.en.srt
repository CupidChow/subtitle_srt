It felt so real,

145
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,480
as if I had been there with you.

146
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,320
Tantan, don't think too much about it.

147
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,760

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,960
Okay, I'll leave.

169

Where is this place?

177
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,600
This is your consciousness.

How did you get in?

179
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,360
The seven lotus seeds
carry my consciousness.

180
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,400
After you touched the lotus seeds,

181
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,240
my consciousness awakened in your body.

182
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,160
Let me out!

183
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,640
Let me out!

184
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,000
Zhao Tantan, you used my appearance

185
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,440
and enjoyed too much love
that should have belonged to me.

186
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,830
Now I want you to stay here

187
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,040
and feel my hatred.

188
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,960
What do you want to do?

00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,240
What do you want to do?

190
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,680
What do I want to do?

191
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,560
I want you to watch

192
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,360
how I'm going to finish
what happened 100 years ago.

193
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,680
Mu Bai, and the Demon Lord.

194
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,200
All these people have to die one by one!

195
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,240
Don't go!

196
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,840
Let me out!

197
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,560
Let me out!

198
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,960
Let me out!

199
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,560
(There is something wrong with Tantan)

200
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,160
(after she touched the lotus seeds
and woke up.)

201
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,280
(Her look and tone were strange.)

202
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,800
But

203
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,680
you still had a relationship
with her, didn't you?

204
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,240
Tantan?

205
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,560
Why are you here?

206
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,600
Mu Xuan, it's me.

207
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm Lian Wen.

208
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,600
Lian Wen?

209
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,320
How could that be?

210
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,840
I was killed by Cui Chen with his sword.

211
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,400
Today Zhao Tantan
touched all the lotus seeds,

212
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,720
so I woke up.

213
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,120
Where's Zhao Tantan?

214
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,640
Don't worry.

215
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,240
She's fine.

216
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,880
Is this me?

217
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,800
Of course it's you.

218
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:29,960
I carved the wood

219
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,400
to remember your face.

220
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,800
With it by my side,

221
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,480
it's like having you with me.

222
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,040
If I had chosen you 100 years ago,

223
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,920
there wouldn't have been
so much pain, right?

224
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,800
I failed to protect you back then.

225
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,440
But if I were Cui Chen,

226
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,160
I would never let anyone hurt you.

227
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,440
I don't blame you.
I chose the wrong person.

228
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,760
Lian Wen, now that you're back,

229
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,080
just let go of the past
and give me a chance.

230
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,360
I'll make you happy.

231
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,280
No one can hurt you again.

232
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,080
If Zhao Tantan and I

233
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,760
appear in front of you at the same time,

234
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,040
who would you choose?

235
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,720
I've been looking for you
in the past 100 years.

236
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,920
I never thought about giving up.

237
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,040
So, don't ask me that question.

238
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,800
It's always you.

239
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,120
Mu Xuan,
only your love for me is genuine.

240
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,960
I won't fail you.

241
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,120
I came back this time

242
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,560
because
I have something important to do,

243
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,880
and I need your help.

244
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,240
What do you need me to do?

245
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,920
Take back all the lotus seeds
and kill Cui Chen.

246
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,280
Kill Cui Chen?

247
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,800
Don't you want that?

248
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,880
A hundred years ago,
you were trodden under feet.

249
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,840
Have you forgotten that?

250
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,360
(I promised the Demon Lord
not to kill Cui Chen,)

251
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,560
(just to bring Lian Wen back to life.)

252
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,800
(Now she's back.)

253
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,000
(I don't need to keep my promise.)

254
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,120
Of course I haven't forgotten.

255
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,520
How do you want to do it?

256
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,440
Why are you here?

257
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,600
Where have you been?

258
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,400
Didn't you say you were tired
and wanted to rest?

259
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,920
I lay down but couldn't sleep.

260
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,800
So, I thought of finding Hu Meng

261
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,240
and getting a bottle of aged wine

262
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,640
to help me sleep.

263
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,200
Since you're here,

264
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,080
have a drink with me.

265
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,960
You just woke up. You shouldn't drink.

266
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,920
Life is short.
We should have a good time.

267
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,040
Don't leave the glass empty
in the moonlight.

268
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,000
I'll be made

269
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,720
the Light of Qingyuan in two days.

270
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,000
Isn't it worth celebrating?

271
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,480
Come on, have a drink with me.

272
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,040
Mu Xuan?

273
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,080
What are you looking for?

274
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,600
Nothing.

275
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,160
Master, I want to tell you something.

276
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,080
What is it?

277
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,920
I dare not forget every move
you taught me.

278
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,760
You little brat.

279
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,800
Qiu Yuebai, you...!

280
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,240
You're Lian Wen.

281
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,520
So, you knew it.

282
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,000
Tantan is straightforward.

283
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,640
She doesn't speak in a bookish way.

284
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,520
All right. Then I won't
beat around the bush.

285
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,720
Mu Bai Zhenren.

286
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,280
You caused me so much pain back then.

287
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,880
Today, I want you to repay it.

288
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,600
Lian Wen, if you'd listened to me,

289
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,000
it wouldn't have ended up like this.

290
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,720
I trusted you too much

291
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,280
and confessed everything to you.

292
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,080
But what happened?

293
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,760
Just because I'm a lotus spirit,

294
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,120
you killed me.

295
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,080
I wasn't trying to kill you.
I was trying to save you.

296
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:24,760
Save me?

297
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,840
Fine. If I tell you

298
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,680
I hid Zhao Tantan's consciousness

299
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,680
to save you, do you believe me?

300
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:36,880
Where is Tantan?

301
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,240
Our matters have nothing to do with her.

302
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,760
Do you think I would tell you?

303
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,600
Senior Mu Bai!

304
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Senior Mu Bai, something happened.

305
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,320
It's bad.

306
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,680
Master is injured.

307
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,040
Did you get it?

308
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,640
Give it to me.

309
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,760
Mu Xuan, after we enter this portal,

310
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,920
no one can hurt us anymore.

311
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,040
Stop.

312
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,040
Don't make more mistakes.

313
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,840
Cover for me.

314
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,960
Put down the lotus seed.

315
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,000
Tell me, what you're going to do
with the lotus seed?

316
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,560
I want to kill the Demon Lord and you,

317
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,480
and take over this body to live on.

318
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,440
You've been consumed by hatred.

319
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,200
I can't let you have the lotus seed.

320
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,560
You never

321
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,400
loved me
as much as you love Zhao Tantan.

322
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,520
If you had trusted me 100 ago,

323
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,200
would you have stabbed me
with your sword?

324
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,000
Lian Wen.

325
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,840
A hundred years ago,
I used Dongxu Skill.

326
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,200
I was trying to save you.

327
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,920
- Thief!
- Thief!

328
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,920
I didn't,

329
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:10,760
Lian Wen!

330
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:12,200
Hand it over!

331
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,600
Hand it over!

332
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,280
You didn't trust me,

333
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,200
and you stabbed me with your sword.

334
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,760
We're done.

335
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,360
I'm placing the Xilan Flower Curse
on you

336
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,200
at the cost of my body and soul!

337
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,480
Did you stab me

338
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,840
to force away the cultivator behind me?

339
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,720
At that time,

340
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,840
you didn't give me a chance to explain.

341
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,600
It's impossible!

342
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,320
It's impossible!

343
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,840
Tantan has Dongxu Skill now.

344
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,200
You can stab me with this sword

345
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,680
to verify what I said.

346
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,800
Or, you can stab me

347
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,320
without using any skill

348
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,520
to avenge your death.

349
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,200
Lian Wen.

350
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,000
Lian Wen!

351
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,440
Use Dongxu Skill!

352
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,320
Lian Wen, please!

353
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,880
Please!

354
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,600
Use Dongxu Skill!

355
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,520
Lian Wen,
Cui Chen has told you the truth.

356
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,960
It's time to let go.

357
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,560
What do you know?

358
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,920
You have no idea

359
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,160
how much pain I've been through
over these years.

360
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,240
I know nothing about your pain.

361
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,760
But I trust Cui Chen.

362
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,240
I even trust Mu Bai's love for you
at that time.

363
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,760
He would never lie to you.

364
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,080
Why should I trust you?

365
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,120
Look, I don't trust anyone!

366
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,880
Use Dongxu Skill!

367
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:05,920
Please!

368
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,080
Please!

369
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,560
Lian Wen.

370
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,960
Everything is a misunderstanding.

371
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,040
Don't be so hard on yourself.

372
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,840
The only way to be free is to let go.

373
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,440
The only way to be free is to let go.

374
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,320
That's easy for you to say.

375
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,240
Even if he didn't intend to kill me,

376
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,320
he still shouldn't have hesitated

377
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,560
in front of all the cultivators.

378
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,640
If he loves me,

379
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,360
he should protect me unconditionally

380
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,680
and support me forever.

381
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,600
Lian Wen.

382
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,720
He's the Light of Qingyuan.

383
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,600
He's responsible for the long-established
foundation of the Qingyuan Sect.

384
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,480
How can he disregard everything
for personal matters?

385
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,680
He never distrusted you.

386
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,840
But facing the suspicion
of the entire cultivation world,

387
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,160
he had to find a compromise.

388
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,720
He couldn't act recklessly.

389
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,040
Listen,

390
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,160
all sacrifices come with a price.

391
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,600
Mu Bai, I want you to lose everything.

392
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,360
I won't let you hurt Cui Chen.

393
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,760
Try me.

394
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,440
As long as I'm still in your body,

395
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,840
I'll make sure he dies.

396
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,600
Zhao Tantan.

397
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,680
You and Cui Chen won't end well.

398
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,960
The Seven-Leaf Lotus gives you hope,

399
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,560
but
it will also give you disappointment!

400
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,280
What's wrong? Why doesn't she wake up?

401
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,440
I'm sorry, Cui Chen.

402
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,480
I don't know what's going on.

403
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,040
Why do you not know it every time?

404
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,880
No, I don't know

405
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,360
why I don't know it every time.

406
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,600
Then what do you know?

407
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,040
- It's just...
- Uncle Zi Meng, do you know anything?

408
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:44,800
Of course I do.

409
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,080
Go ahead.

410
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,400
When someone's spirit gets damaged,

411
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,480
it depends on luck
whether she can wake up or not.

412
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,120
If she doesn't wake up...

413
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,160
What?

414
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,920
Go on.

415
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,160
She'll be in a vegetative state.

416
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,160
You're still sleeping, sleepyhead.

417
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,400
Wake up and take your medicine.

418
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,560
I just got it from Huai Meng.

419
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,600
I know you don't like bitterness.

420
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,080
He specially prescribed
non-bitter medicine for you.

421
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:47,880
Here.

422
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,960
Is it still bitter?

423
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,720
Then you must get well quickly.

424
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,760
When you're better,

425
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,040
I'll take you to eat
your favorite candies haws.

426
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:30,880
Tantan.

427
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:37,520
Which is more beautiful,
sunrise or sunset?

428
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,520
If you wake up tomorrow,

429
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,000
I'll take you to see the sunrise, okay?

430
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,640
Tantan.

431
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,760
Today you're supposed to be made

432
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,920
the Light of Qingyuan.

433
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,840
Are you still not gonna wake up?

434
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,200
Aren't you afraid

435
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,240
I'll take back that title?

436
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:28,960
Senior Mu Bai.

437
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,120
What's the matter?

438
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,240
Mu Xuan wants to see Lian Wen.

439
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,120
Should we tell him

440
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,160
that Lian Wen is gone?

441
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,400
Okay.

442
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,240
Take care of Tantan. I'll go see him.

443
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,160
Okay.

444
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,000
Where's Lian Wen?

445
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,400
She's gone.

446
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,000
You scumbag.

447
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,520
You abandoned her again
like you did back then.

448
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,960
There is nothing I can do
if you have to think that way.

449
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,360
Speaking of that,

450
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,440
there's something
I still don't understand.

451
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,480
Perhaps you can answer it for me.

452
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,640
On our wedding day,

453
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,440
why did those cultivators

454
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,080
suddenly want her
to look into the Truth Mirror?

455
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,720
I've thought a lot about it.

456
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,640
Only you who betrayed the Qingyuan Sect

457
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,000
and turned to the Demon Lord
could do this.

458
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,000
So what if I did it?

459
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,360
I just want Lian Wen
to know your true colors.

460
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,400
It's you

461
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,160
who abandoned her dignity and love.

462
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,160
Is it true that you'll always trust me

463
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,880
no matter what happens?

464
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,240
No matter what happens,
I'll always trust you.

465
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,720
I'm a lotus spirit.

466
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,400
(Lian Wen, when your identity
is revealed to the public,)

467
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,520
The blessed moment has come.

468
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,600
(I don't believe Mu Bai,
the Light of Qingyuan,)

469
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,400
(will still be with you.)

470
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,800
(At that time, I'll take you away.)

471
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,040
Great!

472
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,320
Congratulations, Mu Bai Zhenren.

473
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,280
Congratulations.

474
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,840
She has a demonic token!

475
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,720
She's a lotus spirit!

476
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,400
What?

477
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,280
The esteemed Mu Bai Zhenren,

478
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,320
the paragon of cultivators,

479
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,040
is actually marrying a spirit.

480
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:28,760
Exactly.

481
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,960
A lotus spirit

482
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,800
deliberately came to a prestigious sect

483
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,200
and shamelessly seduced Mu Bai Zhenren.

484
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,000
There must be a conspiracy!

485
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,080
- That's right!
- Yeah!

486
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,080
You're a lotus spirit.
What are you doing here?

487
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,040
- Mu Bai is the guardian of the Lotus.
- Yes.

488
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,120
Are you marrying him

489
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,520
to steal the Seven-Leaf Lotus?

490
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,200
Say it!

491
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:43,640
Say it!

492
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,360
Say it!

493
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:44,880
- Say it!
- Say it!

494
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,840
Fellows,
don't make baseless accusations.

495
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,880
Say it!

496
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,600
I knew Lian Wen's identity long ago.

497
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,160
She never had the intention
of stealing the Seven-Leaf Lotus.

498
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,040
Take the Seven-Leaf Lotus out
and we'll know if she stole it.

499
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,640
That's right. Take it out!

500
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,800
Take it out!

501
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,120
Take it out!

502
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:58,440
Fine.

503
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,680
I'll go get it.

504
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,880
What's wrong?

505
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,520
Why is it gone?

506
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,120
The Seven-Leaf Lotus is missing.

507
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,240
There is only
a wilted lotus seedpod left.

508
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,440
You must have stolen it!

509
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,440
You're a thief!

510
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,400
You're a thief!

511
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,800
You're a thief!

512
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,720
(How could the Seven-Leaf Lotus
be lost?)

513
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,080
(Will these cultivators spare Lian Wen?)

514
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,600
- Kill her!
- Kill her!

515
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,360
You did it.

516
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,040
Have you thought about

517
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,240
if you hadn't done it back then,

518
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,360
none of this would have happened?

519
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,440
And Lian Wen wouldn't have died!

520
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,760
It's been 100 years.

521
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,960
You're still blaming others.

522
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,120
You don't deserve Lian Wen's love.

523
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,960
If Lian Wen had fallen in love with me,

524
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,920
I wouldn't have let her get hurt.

525
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,040
Wake up.

526
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,480
Lian Wen is gone.
Stop being so obstinate.

527
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,880
Even if she's gone,

528
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,520
as long as Tantan's body

529
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,440
and the Seven-Leaf Lotus
are still there,

530
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,360
I can still bring her back to life.

531
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,400
Mu Xuan.

532
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,680
I warn you,
don't try to do anything to Tantan.

533
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,040
Senior Mu Bai.

534
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,720
Thank you. Go back and rest.

535
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,160
Okay.

536
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,120
I'll take care of Tantan.

537
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,480
Tantan.

538
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,280
Why are we always like this?

539
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,440
Either you faint or I faint.

540
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,560
It feels like a tragic love story
every day.

541
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,840
Well, if we turn our story into a novel

542
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,320
and sell it,

543
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,120
will it sell well?

544
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,680
Then you won't have to worry

545
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,160
about the livelihood
of the Qingyuan Sect.

546
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,920
You can eat candied haws every day,

547
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,000
chatting with Xueyi and Hu Meng,

548
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,120
and doing romantic things with me.

549
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,760
Then a day goes by.

550
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,880
Get up.

551
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,720
I've bought you a lot of dried durians.

552
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,720
We're still gonna celebrate
the Double Seventh Day

553
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,600
thousands of times.

We collected the lotus seeds

to restore the Seven-Leaf Lotus

558

What's the problem?

574

We've collected all the lotus seeds.

575
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,400
Why can't it be restored?

00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,080

00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,000
I've put seven lotus seeds
into the lotus seedpod.

579
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,040
Why can't
I restore the Seven-Leaf Lotus?

Uncle.

Uncle, your Strange Tales
in the Secular World

582
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,640
has recorded a lot of things.

583
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,320
Isn't there anything

584
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,960
about how to turn the lotus seeds
into a lotus?

585
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,000
Oh, no!

586
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Cui Chen's spiritual power is declining!

587
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:51,760
Let me do it.

588
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,760
His spiritual power

589
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,160
has dropped from the seventh level
of Dacheng Skill

590
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,360
to the fifth level of Enlightenment.

591
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,120
He...

592
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,960
Will it keep dropping?

593
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,600
Based on his condition,

594
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,120
it will.

595
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,440
If

596
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,600
he loses all his spiritual power,

597
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,000
what will happen?

598
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,720
He'll turn into a mortal.

599
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,080
At his age,

600
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,760
he won't last long

601
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,680
before he dies.

602
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,240
Then...

603
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,840
Doesn't it mean
he'll end up like Zhu Yan?

604
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,480
Well...

605
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,240
If we can't lift the Xilan Flower Curse,

606
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:50,840
is there any way

607
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,680
to slow down the fading
of his spiritual power?

608
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,720
No matter what kind of
magic instrument or elixir he needs,

609
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,000
I'll risk my life to get it.

610
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,720
How about this,

611
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,840
I'll make some Essence-Stabilizing Soup
for Cui Chen first.

612
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,240
But it can only

613
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,000
temporarily prevent his weakness.

614
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,120
I can't stop

615
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,840
the decline of his spiritual power.

616
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,160
What should I do?

617
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,480
Do I have to

618
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,640
watch him die?

619
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,120
What should I do?

620
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,600
Master, what should I do?

621
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,750
Tantan, calm down.

622
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,190
Tantan, calm down.

623
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,560
Tantan, don't worry.

624
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,230
Aren't there tens of thousands of books

625
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,480
in our library?

626
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,080
Don't worry.

627
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,000
Even if I have to stay up all night,
not eating or drinking,

628
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,270
I'll still read them all

629
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:30,840
and find a way

630
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,270
to save Cui Chen.

631
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,190
I'll check the Strange Tales
in the Secular World.

632
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:34,920
Huai Meng.

633
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,120
Don't let me fall asleep this time.

634
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,320
You can pull my hair

635
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,840
or pinch my ass to keep me awake.

636
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,600
I will.

637
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,360
I will.

638
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:40,600
I will.

639
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,400
Tantan, you can't collapse.

640
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,230
All of us will help you, right?

641
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,400
Right?

642
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,120
I'm sorry.

643
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,000
I lost control of my emotions.

644
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,920
There's no such thing
as losing control of your emotions.

645
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,080
Anyone would be worried about
Cui Chen's situation.

646
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,120
You're not losing control.

647
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,520
It's okay.

648
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,960
Tantan,
it's normal that you feel this way.

649
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,520
If you don't lose control
of your emotions,

650
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,000
that would be strange.

651
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,840
Thank you.

652
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,480
When I was in a coma,

653
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,040
were you also worried like this?

654
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,400
You know what,

655
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,800
I thought

656
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,920
that by collecting all the lotus seeds,

657
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,920
I could restore the Seven-Leaf Lotus

658
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,680
and lift your Xilan Flower Curse.

659
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,120
But I didn't expect
my hopes to be dashed.

660
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:43,840
But...

661
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,840
But it doesn't matter.

662
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,200
I'll find a way,

663
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,160
even if

664
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,200
it means I have to stay away from you
for the rest of my life

665
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,280
or give up my life.
