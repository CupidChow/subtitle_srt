00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,910
Well, do you want to come with me?

190
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,110
I bought some dried durians. Have a try.

191
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,230
I hate dried durians.

192
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,400
Take it away.

193
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,000
Give it a try.

194
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,440
What's this? It stinks.

195
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,880
Yeah, it stinks.

196
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,320
You used to hate it.

197
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,230
It's quite tasty.

198
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,030
It's you.

199
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,520
You still hate...

200
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,230
I've found the right disciple.

201
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,790
You even know that I like cilantro.

202
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,960
I'll tell you the truth.

203
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,030
You're a fairly rare
mutant spiritual root.

204
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,550
As long as you follow me
and cultivate yourself diligently,

205
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,550
defeating Mu Bai Zhenren
won't be a problem.

206
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,910
Who is Mu Bai Zhenren?

207
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,000
Mu Bai?

208
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,520
He's a young genius
in the cultivation world.

209
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,280
Isn't it great
that we just live peacefully together,

210
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,030
built foundation and have fun?

211
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,910
But we heard that this guy

212
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,230
formed his core at five,

213
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,350
established his foundation at eight,

214
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,790
and had his Nascent Soul
take form at eighteen.

215
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,080
As a result,

216
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,640
the disciples who diligently cultivated

217
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,520
had to be nagged
by our master every day.

218
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,470
I'm incompetent. I'll be grateful
for your patience, Master.

219
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,470
Do you agree?

220
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,710
Good. From today on,

221
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,640
you'll be my first disciple.

222
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,910
You have to make me proud.

223
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,470
Your lifelong mission is to defeat
your senior master,

224
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,440
Mu Bai Zhenren.

225
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,710
Do you remember?

226
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,110
[Qingyuan Sect]
Master!

227
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,960
I'm finally back.

228
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,600
Master!

229
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,080
You know what,

230
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,520
I caught
a thousand-year-old locust tree spirit.

231
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,360
I even received a banner. Look.

232
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,600
My disciple.

233
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,400
You're back.

234
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,870
I've been missing you.

235
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,960
Master.

236
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,750
I've suffered so much.

237
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,670
My goodness.

238
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,750
Bai.

239
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,870
You're finally back.

240
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,040
Oh, my God.

241
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,160
The Qingyuan Sect is saved!

242
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,430
Hello.

243
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,960
Master, I've only been gone for one day,

244
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,720
and your eyesight has worsened so much.

245
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,280
Your favorite disciple is here.

246
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,040
Bai.

247
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,040
Where have you been
for the past 100 years?

248
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,520
Bai?

249
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:39,310
What?

250
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:42,040
He's my new disciple, Cui Chen.

251
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,520
He's not Bai.

252
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,670
My name is Cui Chen,

253
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,990
but my Daoist title
in the Core Formation Phase is Mu Bai.

254
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,110
How did my disciple

255
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,400
become Mu Bai?

256
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,670
He's been missing for over 100 years.

257
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,430
Why did I run into him?

258
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,040
People are treacherous.

259
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,750
Liar.

260
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,520
A big liar!

261
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,550
You're my best disciple indeed.

262
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,310
Of course.

263
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,310
Master.

264
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,750
Look, I caught
a thousand-year-old locust tree spirit.

265
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,400
Master.

266
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,720
Cui Chen lied to me

267
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,430
You must expel this deceitful fellow

268
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,550
from the sect.

269
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,360
Master.

270
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,600
Don't blame her.

271
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,110
Maybe I'm not good enough.

272
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,790
She never asked about my Daoist title.

273
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,160
Yeah.

274
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,600
Did you forget to ask his real name?

275
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,550
I...

276
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,110
How could I have known

277
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,160
my unrelated disciple

278
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,600
would be the despicable Mu Bai?

279
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,670
Don't call him that. He is your senior.

280
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,160
You should call him Senior.

281
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:44,990
Over my dead body.

282
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,110
Master.

283
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,280
I understand. I'm not angry.

284
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,630
We've just met. There is still time.

285
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,110
I'm never gonna get along with you.

286
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,230
Why did you come back together?

287
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:54,990
Master.

288
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,230
Master.

289
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,280
That's because I caught
a thousand-year-old locust tree spirit.

290
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:58,840
Take a look.

291
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,720
Bai, don't leave again.

292
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,520
You can focus on
practicing martial arts in the sect.

293
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,960
Leave all the dirty work to Tantan.

294
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,720
I don't think it's good.

295
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,520
It's okay.

296
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,080
Master,
why do I have to do these chores?

297
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,670
You know what,

298
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,080
here is the thing,

299
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,080
the Qingyuan Sect can't have both of us.

300
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,400
Today is too good
to have two happy events.

301
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,550
Master!

302
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,550
I've been your disciple for 18 years.

303
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,870
Doesn't that count for nothing
compared to this man

304
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:25,840
who left you

305
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,110
and made you cry every day?

306
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,960
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.

307
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,840
The longer, the better.

308
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,750
If you also disappear
for a hundred years,

309
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,520
I'll shed a couple of tears for you,

310
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,400
but not more than that.

311
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,230
However,

312
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,720
you left the sect without permission,

313
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,080
and this matter needs to be addressed.

314
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,160
I have an idea.

315
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,870
Let your senior have your room.

316
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,040
What?

317
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,720
Where do I stay then?

318
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,720
Master, this is unfair to me.

319
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,110
I see.

320
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,360
There's no place for me

321
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,600
in the Qingyuan Sect.

322
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,110
Clear your room first.

323
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,960
I've thought of a place for you.

324
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,630
Master.

325
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,520
It's okay. It's just a room.

326
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,040
As her senior, I should let her have it.

327
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,520
Look.

328
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,750
You're both my disciples.

329
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,040
Why are you so different?

330
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,550
No need.

331
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,630
Thanks.

332
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:10,790
You tricked me.

333
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,110
Fried peanuts.

334
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:12,960
It goes well with wine.

335
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,600
Bai, have a drink with me.

336
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,520
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

337
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,720
After moving out,
remember to attend class.

338
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,960
You haven't acquired alchemy.

339
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:20,870
As their senior sister,

340
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:21,870
you're going to emphasize
the key points to them.

341
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,840
Make sure you'll be there.

342
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,360
Let's go.

343
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,960
Come on.

344
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,040
What are you laughing at?

345
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,400
Master.

346
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,520
Tantan, this is the place.

347
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,360
This room is worse than my birdhouse.

348
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,630
Tantan.

349
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,960
This is the only room
at the Qingyuan Sect

350
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,630
that doesn't leak.

351
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,160
Master said you can stay here for now.

352
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,550
He'll make arrangements later.

353
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,670
Qing Zhufeng, you awful old man.

354
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:14,040
Cui Chen, you black-hearted
Sweet Dumpling.

355
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,990
I'm at loggerheads with you.

356
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:24,280
[Mu Bai]

357
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,080
I'm back after all.

358
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,110
The gate of the Qingyuan Sect
will always be open to you.

359
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,920
I brought a bottle of 80-year-old wine.

360
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:53,920
Let me see.

361
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,160
Tantan took a sip last time,

362
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,360
and I punished her for three days.

363
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,400
Let's drink secretly today.

364
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,750
Come on, sit down.

365
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,750
Let's have a good drink.

366
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:07,880
How is it?

367
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:08,910
It's good.

368
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:09,880
Cheers, Master.

369
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,550
I guess I'm the reason

370
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,480
why the Qingyuan Sect
has become like this.

371
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,550
Do you think
you're the light of Qingyuan

372
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,240
and we can't live without you?

373
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,390
You weren't even there.
Don't take the blame.

374
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,080
Tell me

375
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,790
where you have been
for the past 100 years.

376
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,910
Look over here.

377
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:41,120
I'll teach you about this today.

378
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,000
Let go of me.

379
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,480
I'm going to talk to Cui Chen.

380
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,000
Hold on.

381
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,480
You've failed
the preliminary alchemy exam

382
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,910
for five years straight,

383
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,030
but Mu Bai Zhenren passed it in one go.

384
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:55,910
Don't mention his name again.

385
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:56,720
Who?

386
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,760
Mu Bai Zhenren?

387
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,840
Believe it or not, if you say it again,

388
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,360
I'll sew up your pigeon mouth.

389
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,550
I won't say it.

390
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,310
Just go to class now.

391
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,360
No.

392
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,120
I'm so angry now.
I feel like an exploding furnace.

393
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,360
I'm not in the mood for class.

394
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,760
But if you don't go to class,
you won't pass the exam.

395
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,430
If you don't pass the exam,
you can't level up.

396
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,360
If you don't level up,
you'll never be the light of Qingyuan.

397
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,310
If you can't be the light of Qingyuan,

398
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,910
you'll never be able to defeat Mu Bai.

399
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,600
- If you can't defeat Mu Bai...
- Stop.

400
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,240
I see.

401
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:22,960
That's more like it.

402
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,190
Hurry up and go to class.

403
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:24,960
After school,

404
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,760
I'll go with you

405
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,720
to settle the score with Mu Bai, okay?

406
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:28,960
Just go.

407
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,840
I'm leaving.

408
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,840
Have a good time in class.

409
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,120
Goodbye.

410
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,030
Go to class.

411
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,030
Focus on your studies.

412
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,270
At such a young age,

413
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,360
she is even more talkative
than that old man, Qing Zhufeng.

414
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,150
There are different colors.

415
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,550
Do you remember it?

416
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,080
Yes.

417
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,120
Here, Master.

418
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,790
Master, when did you take Tantan?

419
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,430
I know what you're thinking.

420
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,960
But let me tell you,

421
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:02,670
Tantan can't be Lian Wen.

422
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,670
I found her 18 years ago

423
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:06,080
at the foot of the mountain.

424
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,880
She was just a baby.

425
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,390
Later on, somehow

426
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:11,390
she started looking
more and more like Lian Wen.

427
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,550
Now they look exactly the same.

428
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,510
All these years,

429
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,390
I've been

430
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,480
feeding her

431
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,150
and taking care of her.

432
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,910
She's definitely not Lian Wen.

433
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:23,670
Could it be reincarnation?

434
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,880
It's impossible.

435
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,270
Even if she were reincarnated,

436
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,960
a cultivator's aptitude doesn't change.

437
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,270
Tantan is a quick-witted girl,

438
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:34,150
but as a cultivator, her bones

439
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,480
are no match for Lian Wen's.

440
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,430
Besides, their personalities and habits

441
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,910
are completely different.

442
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,640
It's just a coincidence
that they look alike.

443
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,430
Think about it. After all,

444
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,720
there are all kinds of
good-looking people.

445
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,510
Even the ugly ones
can have some similarities.

446
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,000
Here, Master.

447
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,270
Why is there a petal of the Xilan Flower

448
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,360
in bloom on your forehead?

449
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,840
(Turns out what's on his forehead
is called Xilan Flower.)

450
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,390
Since she put this curse on me,

451
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,840
there had been no change
in the past 100 years.

452
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,270
But it blooms when I see Tantan.

453
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,430
There must be a connection between them.

454
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,670
Save it.

455
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:11,000
When she cursed you,

456
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,880
she said if you fall in love five times,
you'll encounter a great disaster.

457
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,390
It would bloom for anyone
you fall in love with.

458
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,360
Who is that?

459
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,670
Probably a lost wildcat.

460
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,670
It's okay. Let's go on.

461
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,960
I won't fall in love with any woman
other than Lian Wen.

462
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,390
You haven't seen Lian Wen for 100 years.

463
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,550
When you suddenly see someone
who looks like her,

464
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,790
it would remind you of her.

465
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,880
It's normal.

466
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:39,270
I'm also a man. I get it.

467
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,030
Master, she...

468
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:45,430
But don't take Tantan as Lian Wen,

469
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,030
or I won't spare you.

470
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,030
Probably my mind was messed up
when I ventured into the Demon World

471
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,000
and fought against
the demonic cultivators.

472
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,360
and it triggered the curse.
That's why it blooms.

473
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:59,430
You went into the Demon World alone.

474
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,760
You have grown up indeed.

475
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,120
Good for you.

476
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,960
Take a look, Master.

477
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,120
What's this?

478
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,310
After 100 years of leaving the sect,

479
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:14,360
I finally found a lotus seed
from the Demon Lord,

480
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,430
so I brought it back.

481
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:18,720
Master, I heard
that if you collect seven lotus seeds,

482
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,390
you can summon the Seven-Leaf Lotus.

483
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,600
Yeah. This is the scent
of the Seven-Leaf Lotus.

484
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,240
Master, why are you so familiar

485
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,000
with the scent of the lotus seed?

486
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,270
I also have one.

487
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,910
When I found Tantan

488
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,080
at the foot of the mountain,

489
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,670
I happened to find one, too.

490
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,790
Isn't that a coincidence?

491
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:43,430
Tantan and the lotus seed
showed up together.

492
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,510
Who cleaned this up so well?

493
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,270
Anyway, it's not Tantan.

494
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,150
I...

495
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,430
The lotus seed and the lotus seedpod
are a pair indeed.

496
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,120
Looks like our most valuable treasure,

497
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,360
the Seven-Leaf Lotus, is within reach.

498
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,640
Well, the day of revival

499
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,480
for our Qingyuan Sect is getting closer.

500
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,510
That's great.

501
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,720
Rest assured, Master.

502
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,550
I'll make up for the regrets
a hundred years ago

503
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,190
and collect the seven lotus seeds

504
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,640
to revive the Seven-Leaf Lotus.

505
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,000
(How pretending.)

506
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,030
(Hold on.)

507
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,030
(If I collect all seven lotus seeds,)

508
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:54,120
(I can get back the holy article
of the Qingyuan Sect.)

509
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,640
(It's just about collecting lotus seeds.)

510
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,720
(Within one day,
I can carry a sackful of it back.)

511
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,720
(Wait and see.)

512
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,390
You're indeed the light of Qingyuan.

513
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,910
I knew you wouldn’t let me down.

514
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,670
However,

515
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:07,670
this thing has been lost
for quite a while.

516
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,510
There is no rush.

517
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,430
You don't look very well recently.

518
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,270
You should stay here

519
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,600
for a few more days

520
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,790
and set an example
for your fellow disciples,

521
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:18,270
especially for Zhao Tantan.

522
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,190
She hasn't established her foundation
in 18 years.

523
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,360
Why don't you give her a hand?

524
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:25,640
Well,

525
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,720
it depends on
whether she is cooperative or not.

526
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,080
(I don't need your help.)

527
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,080
I don't care.

528
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:32,720
You must take care of Zhan Tantan.

529
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,080
I will if you say so.

530
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,310
Is this the lotus seed?

531
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,270
Once the marriage bond is established,

532
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,480
you can't escape.

533
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,270
Why is he everywhere?

534
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,550
Tantan!

535
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,790
Tantan, what happened to you?

536
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,640
Why are you here?

537
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:15,310
Why is your face so red?

538
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,000
Is it?

539
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:18,240
Did you have a nightmare?

540
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,790
It must be a nightmare.

541
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,760
I dreamed about Cui Chen.

542
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,360
Did you dream about Senior Bai?

543
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,480
They said that when girls dream of boys,

544
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,190
it's called...

545
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,640
called...

546
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:29,600
a romantic dream!

547
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,270
It's not...!

548
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,150
You're...

549
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,840
You're having a romantic dream!

550
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,720
I haven't had one.

551
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:36,600
They said

552
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,430
that only young girls who are in love
would have romantic dreams.

553
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,360
What's in it?

554
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,480
Tell me about it.

555
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:44,910
Xueyi.

556
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,120
Listen,

557
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,190
you should stop reading

558
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,270
those meaningless books,

559
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,840
or I'll rip off your wings

560
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,030
roast them.

561
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,790
Xueyi, don't run!

562
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,600
Stop!

563
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:58,310
Stop!

564
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,190
Tantan, you're flying.

565
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,480
Have I established my foundation?

566
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,360
Tantan!

567
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,190
Tantan!

568
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,270
It hurts.

569
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,030
You hit me first.

570
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,760
I didn't want you to fall to your death.

571
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,510
Who knew you'd stop?

572
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,640
Never mind.

573
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,790
It's a good day today.
I established my foundation.

574
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,080
I'll spare you.

575
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,640
But why did you suddenly

576
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,000
establish your foundation today?

577
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,480
Is it because our renowned

578
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,240
and respected Senior Mu Bai

579
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,390
gave you a lesson?

580
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,550
You know what,

581
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,270
that devious

582
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,240
fame-seeker

583
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,720
and crowd-pleaser, Mu Bai,

584
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,390
I would thank God
if he doesn't pick on me.

585
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,240
Look,

586
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,880
he's a sweet dumpling
stuffed with sesame seeds.

587
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,880
He looks white, but he's black inside.

588
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:14,550
Tantan.

589
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:21,000
Aren't you the one

590
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,880
who didn't dare
to reveal your Daoist Title,

591
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,270
Mu Bai Zhenren?

592
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,840
Well, don't you need
to drink with Master today

593
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:28,790
and fawn upon him?

594
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,310
I heard that you're Master's favorite.

595
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,120
I'm here to fawn upon you.

596
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,880
You're up to no good.

597
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,640
What?

598
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,390
Go to a place with me.

599
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,120
No.

600
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:38,360
Goodbye.

601
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,360
I heard that you've failed several times
to establish your foundation.

602
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,120
Don't you want to know

603
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,030
how I become the fastest cultivator?

604
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:50,360
How do you know it?

605
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,120
Tantan tried everything she could

606
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,430
to establish her foundation.

607
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,840
She just made it.

608
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,310
I've never seen anyone

609
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,960
struggle as much as you
to establish the foundation.

610
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,390
But she can fly now.

611
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,480
Thank you.

612
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,190
You're welcome.

613
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:04,480
I don't.

614
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,840
After all, there's no shortcut
to cultivation.

615
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,190
Never mind.

616
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,080
Xueyi, look at him.

617
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,360
His invitation is not sincere at all.

618
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,270
I've only turned him down twice
and he's given up.

619
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,150
Maybe

620
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:19,030
I'll go if he asks me the third time.

621
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,270
Just follow him.

622
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,080
It's a lesson from Senior Bai.

623
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,080
It doesn't happen all the time.

624
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,240
Go ahead.

625
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,510
Well,

626
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,240
I don't want to go,
but you made me do it.

627
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,000
Yes.

628
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,120
I made you do it.

629
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,880
Where are you taking me?

630
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,190
You'll find out soon.

631
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,310
Cui Chen!

632
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,120
You're treacherous.

633
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,310
You tricked me into coming here

634
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,840
just to drown me?

635
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:19,120
I must be a fool to believe you!

636
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,120
Tantan, I didn't mean it.

637
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:21,880
I brought you here

638
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,270
to prove something.

639
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,550
To prove
if I can be drowned in this pond?

640
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,720
Listen to me.

641
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:31,790
You...!

642
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,360
Scoundrel!

643
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,880
Tantan!

644
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,190
Bai.

645
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:47,150
Here is the new place I found.

646
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:50,510
The spiritual energy here is conducive
to cultivating our inner strength.

647
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,840
Poetic scenery is everywhere,

648
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,190
and beauty is abundant.

649
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,030
You have profound spiritual power.

650
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:57,270
You'll make the Qingyuan Sect
proud one day.

651
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,270
Well,

652
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,840
from now on, this place
will be our secret base.

653
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,310
You intentionally led me here,

654
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,390
I can't escape.

655
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,880
I'll reluctantly agree.

656
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:09,760
if you're just doing it reluctantly,

657
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,080
then forget it.

658
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,510
She is not Lian Wen.

659
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,080
Tantan.

660
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,550
I'm sorry.

661
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:42,960
I didn't

662
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,360
mean to do that to you.

663
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,720
I was out of line.

664
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,910
I know you're angry,

665
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,880
but you look so much like someone

666
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:54,030
I knew.

667
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,270
I thought she came back.

668
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,960
It was the only way I could verify it.

669
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,880
Now I know you're not the same person.

670
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,190
Tantan.

671
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:10,600
Tantan.

672
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,600
Why are your clothes wet?

673
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,640
Don't mention it.

674
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,430
It's all because of that scoundrel,
Mu Bai.

675
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,510
What a rascal.

676
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,000
What did he do to you?

677
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,720
I...

678
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,760
Forget it.

679
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,080
I was a fool.

680
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:54,720
It's okay.

681
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,390
When Senior Bai was away,

682
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,310
you were competing with him for Master.

683
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:01,190
Now he is back.

684
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,670
As far as I know you,

685
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,030
I'd be surprised if you're okay.

686
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:07,760
You know what,

687
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,270
there are new grievances

688
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:12,880
and old ones between us.
It's never gonna be over.

689
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,670
All right, you're always like a kid.

690
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,270
People will laugh at you.

691
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,670
He messed with me first.

692
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:19,190
I didn't start it.

693
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:19,960
All right.

694
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,240
I'll go to your room
to get some clothes for you.

695
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,390
Change out of these wet clothes

696
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:23,670
so you don't catch a cold.

697
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,120
Slowly.

698
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,880
Come on.

699
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,550
His leg is broken.

700
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:30,480
What's wrong?

701
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,640
It's probably a fracture.

702
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,240
Easy, it hurts.

703
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,310
- How did it happen?
- Can you heal him?

704
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,720
Don't move. I got this.

705
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:40,240
He's a doctor. I trust him.

706
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,240
Everyone, I need two spirits.

707
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:43,960
As for the rest of you,

708
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,240
Please cut some wood

709
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,430
and make a wheelchair for me.

710
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,190
A wheelchair.

711
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:47,790
- Okay.
- Okay.

712
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:48,640
Let's go.

713
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,670
Scissors.

714
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,080
Ouch.

715
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,080
Look.

716
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,310
It's almost done.

717
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,360
What's that?

718
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,480
Please give me some spider silk.

719
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:18,880
Wipe my sweat.

720
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:21,480
Okay.

721
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,270
It's done.

722
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,150
Thank you.

723
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,390
- No problem.
- It's amazing.

724
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,480
Stand up and try it.

725
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,790
I...

726
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,190
Well?

727
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,510
I feel better.

728
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,270
Remember to rest in bed
when you go back.

729
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,390
No strenuous exercise.

730
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,240
Thank you.

731
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,310
Be careful.

732
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,840
Your hand...

733
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,030
It's nothing.

734
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,790
It'll grow back with a little sun.

735
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,760
You're a tough guy.

736
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,510
You're the first one to understand me.

737
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,670
I've underlined the key points for you.

738
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,480
Don't come in last in the next exam.

739
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:29,240
Sha, you're the best to me.

740
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,240
Stop.

741
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,670
Don't act cute.

742
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,150
Since you know what,
you should study harder.

743
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:37,390
All right, I'm gonna bring porridge
to Master and Senior Bai.

744
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,120
Wait.

745
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:39,910
Hold on.

746
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,390
What's wrong?

747
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:44,390
We are short of food now,

748
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:47,080
and you're making porridge
for that black-hearted Sweet Dumpling?

749
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,550
Tantan.

750
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,880
You're a good girl, right?

751
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:52,910
Well,

752
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,840
I know you're a generous person.

753
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,190
When there is something delicious
next time,

754
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:58,150
I'll think of you first.

755
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,310
Sha.

756
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:05,790
How about I'll bring the porridge
to him?

757
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:08,640
I want to use this opportunity

758
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,400
to get to know him better.

759
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:14,440
What are you up to?

760
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:16,440
I dare not do anything.

761
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,600
Mu Bai Zhenren is the top figure
in the cultivation world.

762
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:22,230
I'll be looking for death
if I mess with him.

763
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:25,310
I just want to take this chance

764
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,920
to clear up
the misunderstanding between us.

765
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:29,440
Well,

766
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,510
all right, pick up the porridge
in the kitchen 15 minutes later.

767
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,360
(You lied to me and tricked me.)

768
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,710
(Now you still want to eat porridge.)
