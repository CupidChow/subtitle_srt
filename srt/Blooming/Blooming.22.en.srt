00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,280
OK. I'll see you in Changluo Town.

00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,120
How's it going?

18
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,640
Young Master, please punish me.

19
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,720
What about the letter to Zhao Tantan?

20
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,160
I've had someone deliver it.

21
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,280

30
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,040
I'm OK.

How's your search going?

32
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,800
Some said they met her before.

33
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,520
But since you were parted,

34
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,600
no one has seen her again.

35
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,880

39
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,360
Don't hide it. I've seen it.

40
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,240
Didn't I ask Sha to give it to Cui Chen?

41
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,680
Why do you have it?

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,600
Master, I was just looking at it.

43
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,640
I'll give it back to Sha later.

44
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,680
I know what you are thinking.

45
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,440
You want to leave the mountain
and go to Cui Chen, right?

46
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,840
Master, I won't cause any trouble.

47
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,960
I'll leave after I give him
the Demon Curb Chain.

48
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,120
I know exactly

49
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,600
what you and Cui Chen are thinking.

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,600
I was young once.

51
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,320
Master, so you also had stories

52
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,440
when you were young.

53
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,440
Don't talk nonsense.

54
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,920

Let's have a serious talk.

57
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,480
Actually, I know

58
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,480
you guys are passionately in love.

59
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,440
You can't help
but get close to each other.

60
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,000
Your passion can't be overcome by sense.

61
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,600
That's why you shouldn't get too close.

62
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,120
Once your passion is aroused,

63
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,560
the consequences will be disastrous.

64
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,440
Tantan, you guys have a bright future.

65
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,880
Your top priority now

66
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,760
is to collect the lotus seeds.

67
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,080
Master, let me see him once.

68
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,040
Just once.

69
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,720
I'll leave as soon as I give him
the Demon Curb Chain.

70
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,560
Master, I'm begging you.

71
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,120
Please.

72
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,920
Alright.

73
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,880

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,800
I can't stop you anyhow.

75
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,480
Don't get excited.

76
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,520
You must leave immediately

77
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,520
after you give him the chain.

78
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,040

79

were not all collected

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,040
after four petals had unfolded,

81
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,440

82

89

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:41,800
Tantan,

91
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,600
are you OK?

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,320
Stop smiling. It's worse than crying.

93
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,920
Qifang and I made you noodles.

94
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,960
Why don't you have some later?

95
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,080

106

I'm here to pick you up.

107
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,880
Pick me up?

108
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,560
Yeah.

109
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,200
We're going to Wanfang City
to look for the lotus seed.

110
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,400
Qiu,

111
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,840
I've bothered you a lot
in my search for the lotus seeds.

112
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,760
Thank you.

113
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,200
But this time,

114
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,760
I'm going on my own.

115
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,040
It's no bother. I want to go with you.

116
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,280
Qiu, for you,

117
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,320
I'm actually a bad person.

118
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,520
I've enjoyed your care

119
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,960
and used the information you got for me,

120
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,280
but I can't respond to your affection.

121
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,400
It doesn't matter.

122
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,560
I don't care.

123
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,760
I'd do anything

124
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,920
to stay with you.

125
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,800
No.

126
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,800
I can't do that.

127
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,160
How can I enjoy your kindness

128
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,440
while I'm in a relationship
with Cui Chen?

129
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,880
My conscience will be troubled.

130
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,240
In a relationship?

131
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,160
Didn't you break up?

132
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,200
We got back together
on the way back to the Qingyuan Sect.

133
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,600
Then why didn't you
leave the mountain together?

134

We...

135
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,000
Don't worry about that.

136
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,360
Tantan, it doesn't matter.

137
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,240
As long as you're not married,

138
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,400
I still have a chance.

139
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,600
You don't,

140
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,680
Qiu.

141
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,040
I won't

142
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,000
give a chance to anyone

143
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,440
but Cui Chen.

144
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,640
I'm grateful to you
for helping me find the lotus seeds.

145
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,680
If you're interested in cultivation,

146
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,840
I'll teach you everything
I've learned in my life.

147
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,880
And magic instruments.

148
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,760
I'll give you whatever you want.

149
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,400
But I can't do anything

150
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,400
other than that.

151
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,200
Tantan,

152
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,240
I don't want anything but you.

153
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,240
I'm sorry.

154
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,080
I will get

155
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,720
anything I want.

156
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,200
Tantan, I just bought this.

157
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,440
It's for you.

158
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,640
Tantan, how are you doing?

159
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,320
Tantan,

160
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,000
love you.

161
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,280
I'm sorry.

162
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,720
This is for you.

163
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,800
Why are you apologizing to me?

164
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,880
You're also a victim of the curse.

165
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,360
Oh, right.

166
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,480
This is for you.

167
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,520
Let me put it on you.

168
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,360
OK.

169
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,160
You'd better put it on yourself.

170
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,040
To you,

171
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,200
I'm the most dangerous right now.

172
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,400
I don't think it would do so much harm.

173
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,120
Who knows?

174
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,080
I'm too charming to resist.

175
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,480
Sure.

176
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,600
Here.

177
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,240
I didn't think it would work.

178
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,160
Thanks.

179
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:43,800
Go.

180
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,080
Well,

181
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,600
this is for you.

182
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,800
What's this?

183
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,840
Put the two pieces together.

184
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,560
Is this the piece of tangram you made?

185
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:10,880
I was going to

186
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,920
give it to you while proposing.

187
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,680
But now...

00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,520
It's OK. I can wear it now.

189
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,280
Here you go.

190
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,760
We each keep one.

191
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,760
As Mu Bai Zhenren,

192
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,360
you can't even put on a necklace.

193
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,320
Let me help.

194
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:40,960
Cui...

195
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,000
Cui Chen.

196
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:42,720
Mr. Cui.

197
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,920
Do you know him?

198
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,040
Could you take him to the inn?

199
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,680
That's why you shouldn't get too close.

200
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,680
Once your passion is aroused,
the consequences will be disastrous.

201
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,040
Cui Chen cares about the common people.

202
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,120
If he knew the lotus seeds
were not all collected

203
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,880
after four petals had unfolded,

204
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,320
he wouldn't live any longer.

205
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,200
Cui Chen, I'm sorry.

206
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,880
Cui Chen.

207
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,520
Cui Chen.

208
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,240
I'm sorry, Cui Chen.

209
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,840
Did I scare you?

210
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,480
Yes, you did.

211
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,400
Take it off. It's uncomfortable.

212
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,800
No.

213
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,800
For the sake of your life,

214
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,720
I can't take it off.

215
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,360
Don't worry about me.

216
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,320
I have this, right?

217
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,640
I can resist for a while.

218
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,000
But you passed out just now.

219
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,080
Before I saw you,

220
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,000
I didn't know
the demon aura was so powerful.

221
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,160
I'm sorry.

222
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,880
I shouldn't have come to you.

223
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,960
It isn't your fault.

224
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,560
It's my problem.

225
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,840
Don't think too much.

226
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:10,720
Mr. Cui.

227
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,560
Am I that scary?

228
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,520
Miss Zhao, are you also hurt?

229
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,200
Shall I get a doctor

230
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,120
for you and Mr. Cui?

231
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,760
No, thanks.

232
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,520
Cui Chen is just happy to see me.

233
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,360
I'm playing with him.

234
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,280
Don't let me interrupt you.

235
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,640
The noodles are a bit bland.
I'll go get some pickles.

236
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,440
He ran fast.

237
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,400
Does he think that I'm out of my mind

238
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,480
and trying to do something to him?

239
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,960
Take it off. It's uncomfortable.

240
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,680
You can't take care of me in that.

241
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,160
Who says so?

242
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,040
Watch how I take care of you.

243
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,640
Shall I

244
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,440
hold that for you?

245
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,480
OK.

246
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,800
Shall I feed myself for you?

247
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,360
No.

248
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,600
Look, I can do it.

249
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,160
I'd better leave.

250
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,160
I'll only cause you trouble
if I stay here.

251
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,840
Where are you going
at this hour of the night?

252
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,080
Why don't you

253
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,520
crash here for the night?

254
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,880
You're going back tomorrow.

255
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,640
I didn't leave the mountain
to look for you.

256
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,240
I'm looking for a lotus seed.

257
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,440
I have the latest news about it.

258
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,680
It's right in Wanfang City.

259
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,080
(Wanfang City?)

260
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,600
(Is the lotus seed there?)

261
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,200
I must get the lotus seed
in Wanfang City.

262
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,920
(Cui Chen is powerful.)

263
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,440
(Even though he is injured,)

264
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,800
(I'm no match for him.)

265
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,840
(I'd better not meddle in it.)

266
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,600
You get some rest. I'm off now.

267
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,080
Hold on.

268
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,560
Since the Demons massacred the residents
of Wanfang City 100 years ago,

269
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,360
no one has ever seen it again.

270
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,000
I've heard that it's hidden
in a boundary,

271
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,880
no outsiders know its entrance.

272
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,520
Tantan, I'll be worried if you go alone.

273
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:41,720
Then...

274
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,600
Then...

275
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,720
Then we'll go two ways.

276
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,800
Let's keep in touch.

277
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,280
We'll meet
at the entrance of Wanfang City.

278
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,800
You'd better return
to the Qingyuan Sect.

279
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,280
Forget it. Don't worry about me.

280
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,520
Let's not meet up.

281
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,640
We'll see
who finds the lotus seed first.

282
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,160
Be good, Tantan.

283
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,000
No.

284
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,560
OK.

285
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,600
If you insist,

286
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,040
check in with me using this

287
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,080
every 30 minutes.

288
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,960
This is...

289
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm off now.

290
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,680
Where are you going
at this hour of the night?

291
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,560
I'll stay in another inn.

292
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,120
I'm afraid that if I stay here,

293
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,520
I can't help but get close to you
and hold you.

294
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,040
I can't make that mistake.

295
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,360
Gotta go.

296
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,080
When we find the lotus seeds,

297
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,240
I'll make it up to you.

298
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,080
I can't record it now,

299
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,200
but

300
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,600
I'll keep it in my heart.

301
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,520
Don't go back on your word.

302
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,800
I'll keep it in my heart too.

303
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,360
Why are you here？

304
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,200
Have you been following me
since we were parted

305
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,720
at the foot of the mountain?

306
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,720
It's getting cold.

307
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,920
Go home with me.

308
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,840
I think I may not
have made myself clear enough,

309
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,800
so you get me wrong.

310
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,360
I'll say it again.

311
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,000
There's no way we can be together.

312
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,840
I thought we could be friends,

313
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,360
but it seems unlikely now.

314
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:18,360
Go.

315
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,000
Tantan, where are you?

316
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,120
Is something wrong?

317
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,040
Why don't you answer me?

318
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,400
Tantan, where are you?

319
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,480
Is something wrong?

320
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,360
Why don't you answer me?

321
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:00,760
Tantan,

322
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,560
opportunities are not given.

323
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,000
They're created.

324
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,080
Tantan,

325
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,240
from now on,
I'm the only man in your world.

326
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,240
Dude,

327
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,880
how many inns are there in the town?

328
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,320
Three including us.

329
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,280
Three?

330
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,680
Where's Tantan?

331
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,120
Room charge.

332
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,000
Please give a message to my friend.

333
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,080
Tell him I have an errand to run.

334
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,440
Ask him to wait for me here
for a few days.

335
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,000
OK.

336
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:11,800
Sir.

337
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,960
This is a note

338
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,000
from your friend, Mr. Xie.

339
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,320
Where is he?

340
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,920
He left. He already paid for the room.

341
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,960
Mr. Cui, I've got an emergency at home.

342
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,640
I'm sorry I couldn't say goodbye.

343
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,880
When did he leave?

344
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,360
Last night.

345
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,920
(Tantan is my priority now.)

346
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,000
(I'll ask about the lotus seeds later.)

347
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,400
I see.

348
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,760
Good morning.

349
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,520
Morning.

350
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,160
Tantan, what's wrong?

351
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,160
I just woke up. I must look ugly.

352
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,560
I don't want you to see me.

353
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,600
It's OK.
I like you just the way you are.

354
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,120
Get up, or you'll get bored.

355
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,240
I'm hungry now.

356
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,160
I'd like something to eat.

357
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,720
Sit down.

358
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,040
I've made congee. Here.

359
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,840
I want to eat the ribs you make.

360
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,200
Ribs?

361
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,120
The ribs you made at Hu Meng's inn.

362
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,160
OK, I'll learn.

363
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,600
But it's my first time cooking.

364
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,760
It may not taste that good.

365
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,000
Just tell me if you don't want to cook.

366
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,560
Why do you lie to me?

367
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,720
I've seen you cook a lot of good dishes

368
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,080
in Yunlai Inn.

369
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
(What's going on?)

370
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,360
(Does Tantan mistake me for...)

371
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,640
Dabai.

372
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,080
Dabai.

373
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,440
What were you thinking?

374
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,200
What did you call me?

375
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,120
Dabai.

376
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,480
Everyone calls you Bai.

377
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,760
I'm going to call you Dabai.

378
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,320
That makes me special.

379
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,560
Do you know my real name?

380
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,600
Do you think I'm a fool?

381
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,760
Of course I know.

382
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,120
Your real name is

383
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,960
Qiu Yuebai.

384
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,600
Tantan, since you know my real name,

385
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,520
how can you forget to call me Qiu?

386
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,720
And you promised me

387
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,960
you'd think of me whenever you sneeze.

388
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:51,920
Really?

389
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,360
But don't you like the name Dabai?

390
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,720
Qiu is better.

391
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,360
Sit down.

392
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,440
Then,

393
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,520
I'll call you Qiu from now on.

394
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,160
OK.

395
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,960
Go make some ribs.

396
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,760
Wait for me.

397
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,280
Don't run.

398
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,440
It's ready. Come and eat.

399
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,480
She is...

400
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,680
She's here to serve you.

401
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,960
I don't need anyone to serve me.

402
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,640
I can take care of myself.

403
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,080
Besides, I have you.

404
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,960
Tantan, I hired her to serve you.

405
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,480
If you don't let her do her job,

406
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,160
she'll be upset.

407
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,120
And she'll be fired.

408
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,120
Is that so?

409
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,760
All right, then.

410
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,000
Did he send you?

411
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,200
The Demon Lord said

412
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,000
he doesn't care
about how you use the love venom

413
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,120
or who you use it on.

414
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,160
But he hopes you can

415
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,960
find the remaining lotus seeds
as soon as possible.

416
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,920
Don't complicate matters
lest it would jeopardize his plan.

417
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,840
Does he distrust me so much

418
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,440
that he sends you to spy on me?

419
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,040
I don't dare
to disobey the Demon Lord's orders.

420
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,000
Do you dare to disobey me?

421
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,400
The Demon Lord knows
you won't accept it.

422
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,760
He sent me to tell you,

423
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,000
don't forget your duty.

424
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,960
Don't forget your duty either.

425
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,240
Take good care of Tantan,

426
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,840
or you know what I will do.

427
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,400
Young Master,

428
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,800
I've accompanied you
for almost 100 years,

429
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,680
but I can't compare with a woman

430
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,720
you've only known for a few months.

431
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,560
Is it because of that face?

432
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,560
I can have it too.

433
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,040
If I see that face again,

434
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,880
I'll kill you.

435
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,000
I'm glad you like it.

436
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,480
Don't get cut.

437
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,120
Let me do it.

438
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,440
Tantan.

439
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,280
Leave it.

440
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,040
What if your hands get cut?

441
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:42,800
Let me see.

442
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:43,960
You...

443
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,120
Yueying doesn't seem to like me.

444
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,200
It doesn't matter, Tantan.

445
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,000
Sit.

446
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,680
What matters is I like you.

447
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,480
Since when have you changed?

448
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,000
You're good at saying sweet things now.

449
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,240
I can't help it.

450
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,200
Let's eat. The food's getting cold.

451
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,520
What's wrong?

452
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,600
I'm bored of eating these every day.

453
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,120
I want to eat the noodles I had

454
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:25,960
when I first met you.

455
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,000
Do you remember?

456
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,160
Noodles?

457
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,880
You haven't forgotten, have you?

458
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,800
How could I forget?

459
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,200
But I don't think they sell it here.

460
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,680
Are there stores and snack bars?

461
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,920
Tantan, you've just recovered.

462
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,320
You can't...

463
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,000
Dabai.

464
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,920
Don't use my health as an excuse

465
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,800
to stop me from going out.

466
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,000
I'm so bored.

467
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,280
I'm afraid you'll catch a cold.

468
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,080
I'm not that weak.

469
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,640
Please, let me go out.

470
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,120
Please.

471
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,160
I'm just going out for a while.

472
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,400
A while.

473
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,560
Tantan, promise me.

474
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,400
We'll come back immediately
after we have the noodles.

475
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,000
OK.

476
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,600
I'll do whatever you say
as long as you let me go out.

477
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,760
Come on.

478
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,720
Hurry up.

479
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,240
Go.

480
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,600
Slow down.

481
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,960
Take a look. It's delicious.

482
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,120
Miss, have a look.

483
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,880
Where's Cui Chen now?

484
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,360
He left Changluo Town.

485
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,480
I don't know where he is now.

486
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,080
Keep an eye on him
in case he suddenly shows up.

487
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:39,680
Yes.

488
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,600
Young Master, we've arrived.

489
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,680
As you requested,

490
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,800
I've booked the whole restaurant.

491
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,840
Tantan, we're here.

492
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,480
[Sanhe Restaurant]

493
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,360
Dabai, you did forget.

494
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,600
We ate at a roadside noodle stall,

495
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,840
not a restaurant.

496
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,280
Of course I remember.

497
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,840
But there's no noodle stall.

498
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,720
Who says so?

499
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,800
It's over there.

500
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,400
Come.

501
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,040
Please leave.

502
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,480
Excuse me.

503
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,280
Have you seen

504
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,640
an 18-year-old girl?

505
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,000
About this tall.

506
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,840
She has big eyes and is pretty.

507
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,200
I didn't see her.

508
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,240
Noodles are ready.

509
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,080
Please enjoy.

510
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,800
Thanks.

511
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:31,760
Here.

512
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:33,720
Thanks.

513
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,240
Well,

514
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,280
let me test you again.

515
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,120
Do you remember

516
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,560
what you did to my noodles?

517
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,840
Seriously? How can you forget this?

518
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,720
I'm just kidding.

519
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,640
You're pulling a long face.

520
00:28:59,120 --> 00:28:59,640
No.

521
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,200
I just feel sorry.

522
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,360
I even forgot
about the first time we met.

523
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,640
It doesn't matter.

524
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,400
I'll tell you if you forgot.

525
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,160
But next time when I test you,

526
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,200
don't forget.

527
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:11,880
OK.

528
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,920
The answer is this,

529
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,240
coriander.

530
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,440
OK. I remember it now.

531
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,040
I won't forget.

532
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,440
I have two other

533
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,200
particular favorites.

534
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,800
You used to buy them for me.

535
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,240
Go buy them now.

536
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,640
If you make a mistake,

537
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,320
I won't talk to you anymore.

538
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:37,760
I tell you what,

539
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,600
let me stay with you
and Mo Yan buy them for you.

540
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,440
You're not sincere at all.

541
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,640
Fine,
let's not talk to each other again.

542
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,240
OK, I'll go buy them for you.

543
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,600
But Mo Yan will stay with you.

544
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,080
No.

545
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:56,840
Be good.

546
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:01,760
Mo Yan.

547
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,080
Yes.

548
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:02,680
Keep an eye on her.

549
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,160
Yes.

550
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,960
Why don't you have some too?

551
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,480
Would you move over a bit?

552
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,400
I can't eat with you staring at me.

553
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:33,680
There.

554
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:34,920
Stand there.

555
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,880
Fine, I'll leave if you don't move.

556
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,000
Sir,

557
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,160
you haven't paid for the noodles.

558
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:00,680
Here you are.

559
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:02,760
Sir,

560
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,120
which is better?

561
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,160
This is better.

562
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,080
Is this?

563
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:07,640
Have a taste.

564
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,200
How much is this?

565
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,240
Excuse me, have you seen

566
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,400
an 18-year-old girl?

567
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,800
About this tall. Big eyes.

568
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:12,960
I haven't.

569
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,720
Excuse me,

570
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,440
have you seen an 18-year-old girl?

571
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,440
About this tall. Big eyes.

572
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,160
I want two bags.

573
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,280
I have no idea.

574
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,240
Sir,

575
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,920
where is the girl I was with?

576
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,040
Over there.

577
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,400
Have you seen an 18-year-old girl?

578
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,120
About this tall.

579
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,640
Big eyes. Very pretty.

580
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,600
No.

581
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,520
Mo Yan.

582
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,200
Dabai, here.

583
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:56,880
Tantan.

584
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:58,680
Go.

585
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,120
Let go of me!

586
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:10,920
Let go of me!

587
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,080
Let go.

588
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,760
What are you doing?

589
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,280
Why don't you let me go to Dabai?

590
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,640
You were almost hit by a carriage.

591
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,320
I...

592
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,040
Dabai.

593
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,480
Qiu.

594
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,120
I was going to you.

595
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,040
But Mo Yan stopped me.

596
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,120
Because I saw...

597
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,880
Alright. You've had noodles.
Don't be upset.

598
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:33,600
Let's go home.

599
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:34,800
No.

600
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,280
I haven't been out in a long time.

601
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,120
I haven't had enough fun.

602
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,520
Be good, will you?

603
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,840
I've got important business
to attend to.

604
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,960
I'll take you to a better place
next time.

605
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,280
No.

606
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:49,800
Be good.

607
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,240
Sir, have you seen

608
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,360
an 18-year-old girl?

609
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,160
About this tall. Big eyes.

610
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:57,880
Very pretty.

611
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,040
I don't know.

612
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,600
Tantan.

613
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,280
Tantan, walk slower.

614
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,120
Tantan.

615
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,080
Tantan, I'm sorry.

616
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,720
I finally went out.

617
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,000
I haven't had a good time yet,

618
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,760
and you took me back in a hurry.

619
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,800
Tantan, I'm sorry.

620
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,760
It's my fault.

621
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,680
Something came up
at the Seven Nights Inn.

622
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,800
I have to rush back.

623
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,400
But I promise you, next time.

624
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,720
Next time, let's stay out all day, OK?

625
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,840
Who knows
if you'll break your word again?

626
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,360
I swear, I won't.

627
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:01,520
Tantan,

628
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,520
don't be upset.

629
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,230
I bought two of your favorite foods.

630
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:18,560
Alright.

631
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,750
Since you still remember my favorites,

632
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:22,710
I'll forgive you.

633
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,190
Dabai.

634
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,440
Tantan.

635
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,000
Didn't you agree to call me Qiu?

636
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,840
Why do you call me Dabai again?

637
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:39,520
I didn't notice.

638
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,480
I just blurted it out.

639
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,400
If you don't like me calling you Dabai,

640
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,710
I'll call you Qiu.

641
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,190
Well.

642
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,750
I'm eating the candied haws.
