Report my whereabouts
to Zhao Tantan at all times,

no hiding or deceiving.

Rule Two:

00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,550
Work hard on alchemy and give
the elixirs to Tantan for selling

28
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,190

00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,000
Since you left,

189
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,230
I've come to realize

190
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,790
I used to think too optimistically.

191
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,680
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

192
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:26,000
So, I'm working here to earn
the traveling expenses

193
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,150
for the imperial examination.

194
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,440
What about the other scholars?

195
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,480
They've also found good jobs.

196
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,710
We're all grateful to you.

197
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,320
This meal is on me.

198
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,710
No.

199
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,000
Cui Chen has money.

200
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,240
Yeah.

201
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,560
It's not easy to earn money.

202
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,360
Keep your money

203
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,920
for the journey
to the imperial examination.

204
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,120
You helped me.
I can still afford a meal.

205
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,360
Don't worry.

206
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,830
The food here is different from before.

207
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,120
It's delicious now.

208
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,880
We'll eat here,

209
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,000
but I'm not hungry now.

210
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,560
We'd like some rooms first.

211
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,590
- This way, please.
- No need.

212
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,480
I've asked Mo Yan
to prepare a luxury suite.

213
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,950
Let's go to the Qiye Inn.

214
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,240
No, there is no need.

215
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,920
Don't be angry, Qiu.

216
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,390
It's not that I don't like the Qiye Inn.

217
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,440
I just...

218
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,510
We just don't need it.

219
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,320
We won't stay for too long.

220
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,240
Mr. Qiu, don't bother.

221
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:23,750
Look at you guys.

222
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,590
You have to make it sound so offensive.

223
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,830
Mr. Qiu is hospitable

224
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,920
because he treats you as friends.

225
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,440
But then again,

226
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:35,510
friends won't make a fuss
about such trifles.

227
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,320
Right?

228
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:37,830
Of course.

229
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,070
I've got things to do. Help yourself.

230
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:42,800
Qiu.

231
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,680
Qiu.

232
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,000
I wish it could be the same as before.

233
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,120
What do you mean?

234
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,560
What was so good before?

235
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,480
It's already happened.

236
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,560
Give him some time to process it.

237
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,800
What are you so worried about?

238
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:06,120
By the way, there's something strange
going on in Yunlai Town.

239
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,150
There's a tavern
called the Shihua Pavilion.

240
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,150
The owner is famous

241
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,150
and her popularity is still rising.

242
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,070
The strangest thing is

243
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,270
she looks a lot like you.

244
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,710
Me?

245
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,560
When I first came to Yunlai Town,
a lot of people gathered around me.

246
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,880
Did they mistake me for someone else?

247
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,120
No wonder I found it so strange.

248
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,800
Our relationship has been made public.

249
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,190
There's no need to tiptoe around.

250
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,390
Who's tiptoeing around?

251
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,440
I just wanted to give you a scare.

252
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,920
Well, Dabai.

253
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,510
Instead of sensing the lotus seeds,

254
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,950
you used your spiritual power
to sense my footsteps.

255
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,710
What a waste.

256
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,440
We've only been apart for a while.

257
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,480
Do you miss me?

258
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,880
Don't push it.

259
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,920
I might make you vanish without a trace.

260
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,680
I surrender.

261
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,950
Let me go.

262
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:14,590
Let me go.

263
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,070
Good boy.

264
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,070
Dabai.

265
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,920
I want to go to the Shihua Pavilion

266
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,680
and meet the person who looks like me.

267
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,560
Okay.

268
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,040
[Shihua Pavilion]

269
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,950
Trust me.

270
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,830
If you want to relax,
you have to come here.

271
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,150
- Really?
- Yeah.

272
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,680
Then I must check it out.

273
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,830
Come on, let's go.

274
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,590
We've walked too far today.

275
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,560
I'm tired.

276
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,390
Let's find a place to rest later.

277
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,390
Did you have a good time today?

278
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,360
We've had a great time.

279
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,440
Sir. Miss...

280
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,320
Miss.

281
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,750
Please come inside.

282
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:05,920
Please come inside.

283
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,630
Please take your seats

284
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,360
and enjoy the food and drinks
on the table.

285
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,480
Let me know if you need anything.

286
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,750
- Thank you.
- Okay.

287
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,750
Straight down three thousand feet.

288
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,800
A foot of silk is like unmelted snow.

289
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,390
Snow.

290
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,390
Snow...

291
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:34,710
Drink.

292
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,070
Three cups of wine.

293
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:37,710
Yeah, drink.

294
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,240
The wine smells good.

295
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,320
We've been drinking like this,

296
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,680
but no one's asked us for money.

297
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,190
Could it be free?

298
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,000
Well, have you thought of anything?

299
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,950
Wait, I got it.

300
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,510
Snow is beaten by plum blossoms
with a whiff of fragrance.

301
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,950
Fragrance...

302
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,680
[Self-service:
Ten taels of gold per person]

303
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,150
Fragrance...

304
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,360
You can't answer that, can you?

305
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,440
Turns out the owner is here.

306
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,440
My apologies.

307
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,440
Would you like to play with us
for two rounds?

308
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:11,800
The owner?

309
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,920
I'm not the owner.

310
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:14,560
You guys go ahead.

311
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,040
Since you're here.

312
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,480
It's not up to you, right?

313
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,120
Yeah.

314
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,590
Madam, let's just play for one round.

315
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,070
All right. I'm not afraid.

316
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,440
There is a maiden fair.

317
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,000
Fair girls change fast.

318
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,920
Well, is there a problem?

319
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,480
Never mind. Let's continue.

320
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,150
Fast changes bring chances.

321
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,390
Changes...

322
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,800
More chances from more friends.

323
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,880
Friends light up life's sky.

324
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,000
I got this.

325
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,480
The sky sends thunder
to punish the sinners.

326
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,590
Looks like she's not the owner.

327
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,040
But she looks exactly like her.

328
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,830
It's no fun. I'm done.

329
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,240
Sir, would you like
to play a round with me?

330
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,480
Of course.

331
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,480
My junior fellow disciple
failed at the word 'sky'.

332
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,510
I'll start from that.

333
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,710
If I win, it's on the two of us.

334
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,630
If I lose, it's on me.

335
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,710
Mr. Cui, please.

336
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,070
The sky spinning and the tide turning,
came back the emperor's dragon-carriage.

337
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:27,920
Carriage?

338
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,480
It's from the Song of Eternal Sorrow.

339
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,800
This poem is not obscure,

340
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,190
but the word 'carriage'

341
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,510
is a hard nut to crack.

342
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,040
Yes, it's not easy.

343
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,800
The carriage door
is adorned with fruit vines.

344
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,710
It's Ms. Lian.

345
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:59,510
She's talented indeed.

346
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,560
She actually answered that.

347
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,680
Ms. Lian is here.

348
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,240
She is good.

349
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:14,680
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

350
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,800
Vine by vine, life's moments intertwine.

351
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,190
Below the intertwined clouds,
a wild goose flies.

352
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,830
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

353
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,070
Impressive.

354
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:29,800
Yeah.

355
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,000
Bravo!

356
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,040
Great.

357
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,040
Geese in the sky and fish in the water.

358
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:42,120
On the water's surface,
the breeze blows away the flowers.

359
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,830
Flowers bloom and fall,
which we can't stop.

360
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,630
Stop receiving rewards and attendants.

361
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,040
The attendant beauty of the night
can no longer be enjoyed.

362
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:59,240
Enjoy the night whispering about love.

363
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,510
That's great.

364
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,680
There's a deeper meaning in these poems.

365
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,230
It's like they're a conversation
through the poems.

366
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,080
They're perfect for each other
in terms of talent and appearance.

367
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,510
Time's up!

368
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,510
It's a tie.

369
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,150
Mr. Cui. I'm Lian Rong
from the Shihua Pavilion.

370
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,800
I'm Cui Chen.

371
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,150
They are so much alike.

372
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,560
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

373
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,800
Is your name Lian Rong?

374
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,510
It's beautiful.

375
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,630
Look at me.

376
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,320
Don't I look just like you?

377
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,350
Could you be my twin sister?

378
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,320
You're joking, Miss.

379
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,840
I'm an only child with no sisters.

380
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,990
The world is vast, and full of wonders.

381
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:56,270
But a poetic genius like Mr. Cui

382
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,150
is truly rare.

383
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,390
I'm flattered, Miss Lian.

384
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,560
I'm tired. I wanna go back.

385
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:10,680
Let's go.

386
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,560
Are they leaving?

387
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,720
Why is she leaving?

388
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,680
Why is she leaving?

389
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,110
You're joking, Miss.

390
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:33,040
I'm an only child with no sisters.

391
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:35,320
The world is vast, and full of wonders.

392
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,630
But a poetic genius like Mr. Cui

393
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,440
is truly rare.

394
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,630
Listen to it.

395
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,510
Is that what you called

396
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,840
seduction?

397
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,600
You handled it well.

398
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,720
You've made progress.

399
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,470
I'll take that as a compliment.

400
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,720
But the thing is,

401
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,230
although Lian Rong looks like me,

402
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,080
I think she's more attractive.

403
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,870
Look.

404
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,750
Listen to me.

405
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:06,920
She is not only as literate as Dabai,

406
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,680
but she even owns a tavern.

407
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,960
She's not like me. I have nothing.

408
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,630
What if Dabai...

409
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,270
It surprised me

410
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,560
that being in a relationship

411
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,270
can cure your overconfidence.

412
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:22,270
Stop it.

413
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,510
It's expensive. Don't drop it.

414
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,440
If you drop it,

415
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,560
- I'll...
- What?

416
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,440
Come on, have a try

417
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,600
of my make-up skills.

418
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,680
Stop it, please.

419
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,600
Don't attack my weak point.

420
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,840
I'm warning you,

421
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,800
if I kick the bucket,

422
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:42,150
no one will dare to give you advice.

423
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,840
Well,

424
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:50,870
don't think too much. Just be yourself.

425
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:55,800
You only care about your own beauty
and just fence with me.

426
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,200
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

427
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,600
Dabai.

428
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,990
Are you mad at me?

429
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,750
I don't have time to be mad.

430
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,320
I...

431
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:30,110
I want to discuss something with you.

432
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:31,680
Go ahead.

433
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,800
Since we don't have any news

434
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,390
about other lotus seeds,

435
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,440
why don't we

436
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,800
go back to the Qingyuan Sect first

437
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,630
and bring back the lotus seeds we have?

438
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,200
It may not be the right time to go back.

439
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,870
The Qingyuan Sect is far away.

440
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,350
Once there is news
about the lotus seeds,

441
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,150
we won't be able to make it there

442
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,440
and we'll miss the chance.

443
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,230
We'd better wait here for news.

444
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,270
Do you want to stay here

445
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,840
because of Lian Rong?

446
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,870
Don't let your imagination run wild.

447
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,150
I don't have any feelings

448
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,600
for Lian Rong.

449
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,960
But it doesn't mean
that she doesn't have any.

450
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:13,110
Tantan, in my heart...

451
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,040
I don't want to hear anything romantic.

452
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,470
Why don't you do something practical?

453
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,230
Are you talking about

454
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,200
the energy of love?

455
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,990
I'm talking about
taking me out for delicious food.

456
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,150
Let's go.

457
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,150
I want one of these. Buy it for me.

458

Sir, I'll have one.

459

What color do you want, Miss?

460
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,270
White.

461
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:47,990
Okay.

462
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,270
How much is it?

463
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,560
Two cents, Mister.

464
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:51,720
Here.

465
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:52,840
Thank you, Mister.

Cotton candy.

470
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,230
Take a look.

471
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,560
What color do you want?

472
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,800
I'll have a red one.

473
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:05,750
Okay.

474
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,510
Here you go.

475
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,110
Dabai, hold this for me?

476
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,150
Cotton candy.

477
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,920
Cotton candy.

Do you want some cotton candy?

No.

480

Little girl.

481
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,560
Your eyes are affectionate, and there is
a reddish color between your eyebrows.

482
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:23,200
It must be a sign of love.

is written by me, a love expert.

It took me a lot of time
and effort to write it.

489

I don't need it.

490
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,600
I'm here to read other books.

491
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,510
All right, feel free to look around.

00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:45,990
I just saw a stall

selling dried durian over there.

495
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,600
Can you buy a bag of it for me?

496
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:49,960
Two bags.

497

Take your time.

Yes.

I just saw you over there with Cui Chen.

How did you get here in a flash?

536
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,560
No, I've been here the whole time.

I thought it was something rare.

I wrote it randomly
when I first came to Yunlai Town

556
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,270
and had no money.

557

I didn't expect
they are still selling it.

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,800
Return.

00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,600
It's not suitable for you.

560
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,870
I've read it carefully.

561
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,960
The author's name is Butterfly.

562
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:33,230
Don't try to fool me again.
I won't fall for it.

563
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:44,990
First of all, a woman dolls herself up
for the man who loves her.

564
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,960
Cui Chen, you're back.

565
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:37,630
You've been working hard lately.

566
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:41,440
I'll play some music for you

567
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,080
so that you can relax.

568
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,750
(To conquer a man's heart,)

569
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,320
(you have to conquer
a man's stomach first.)

570
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,510
(It makes so much sense.)

571
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,750
What's this?

572
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,990
It's called clay pot cooking
on the stove,

573
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:00,040
abbreviated as clay pot.

574
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,440
It's ready.

575
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,560
The water is boiling. We can eat it.

576
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,800
Don't we need to take the pot off?

577
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:06,920
There is something you don't understand.

578
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,560
The clay pot

579
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,720
should be kept on the fire all the time.

580
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,150
That way, you'll be able

581
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,920
to eat hot food the whole time.

582
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,800
We can also add new ingredients to it,

583
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,840
and you won't have to wait.

584
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,320
Try it.

585
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:32,680
It's good.

586
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:42,990
It's delicious.

587
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:45,270
I have a talent for cooking.

588
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,750
I'll make it more often for you.

589
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:47,870
What's this

590
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,870
called again?

591
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,110
- Well...
- Clay pot.

592
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,110
Right. Clay pot.

593
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:55,320
But,

594
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:58,870
it's a little hard to pronounce it.

595
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,230
Why don't we just call it hot pot?

596
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,870
What do you think, Dabai?

597
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,390
It's good. Let's call it hot pot.

598
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,110
(If she wants to do such things,)

599
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,560
(just let her do it.)

600
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:42,320
(However, I'm a little curious)

601
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,560
(about what she will do next.)

602
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,000
[I'll meet you by the lotus pond.
Lian Wen]

603
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,600
Why isn't my food ready?

604
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,800
It's too slow.

605
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,680
Sir, here are your noodles.

606
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,750
Thank you.

607
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,320
Sir.

608
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,040
Have you seen this person
in the portrait?

609
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:06,040
No.

610
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,440
Have you seen this girl in the portrait?

611
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,320
- No.
- No.

612
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:10,390
Her name is Tantan.

613
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:11,440
No.

614
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,440
No.

615
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,150
No one has seen her.

616
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,230
Thank you.

617
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,470
Sir, here are your noodles.

618
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,560
Well,
we've asked over a thousand people,

619
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,750
and none of them have seen Tantan.

620
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,040
What if she never came to Yunlai Town?

621
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,040
No hurry.

622
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,080
There are so many people
coming and going here.

623
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,470
I'm sure we can find her.

624
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,320
Look how busy we are.

625
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,840
Do you still have time to chat?

626
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,390
We've been working for so long.

627
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,230
We have to find out where Tantan is.

628
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:38,840
Yeah.

629
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:40,920
We've earned money,

630
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,150
but what if Tantan is living
on the streets,

631
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,440
eating poorly?

632
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,920
But you can't stop working.

633
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,390
You can write a high-reward notice

634
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,350
and post it at the door.

635
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,600
People will come with clues.

636
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,720
But we don't have money.

637
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,470
If we can find Tantan, I'll pay for it.

638
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:00,870
Mr. Crab, you're generous.

639
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,080
You're the best boss I've ever seen.

640
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,990
Stop flattering me and get to work.

641
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:13,390
I'd be surprised if you can find her
with such a portrait.

642
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,920
Wanna a steamed bun?

643
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,630
It's hot.

644
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:16,720
Be careful.

645
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,320
Xueyi.

646
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,040
Xueyi.

647
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:19,680
Here.

648
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,560
Miss, take a look.

649
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,080
Have a taste of it.

650
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,080
It's good.

651
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,990
Look.

[Crab Noodle Restaurant]

653
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,510
I heard that their noodles
are really delicious.

654
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,630
Crab Noodle Restaurant?

655
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,040
Is there also a Crab Noodle Restaurant
in Yunlai Town?

656
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,800
Could it be a fake?

657
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,800
I don't know.

658
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:46,600
Let's buy a bowl of noodles

659
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,040
and let Uncle Zi Meng taste it.

660
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,200
Okay.

661
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,150
I'll go queue up.

662
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:52,840
Qiu Yuebai?

663
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,440
Are you also here for noodles?

664
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,230
I'm just passing by.

665
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,320

came from the west.

666
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:58,440

00:31:58,990 --> 00:31:59,470
Hu merchants?

668
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,230
What do they sell?

669
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,510
Things like ivory, gemstones, and glaze.

670
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,150
Some peculiar stuff.

671
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,510
Would you like to come with me?

672
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,920
Let's go too.

673
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:10,230
But what about the noodles?

674
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,350
We won't get our turn

675
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,470
for another hour.

676
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,560
Let's go take a look.

677
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,960
Girls all like jewelry.

678
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,230
Let's go.
