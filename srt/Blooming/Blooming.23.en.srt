[Episode 23]

16
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,480
Love venom.

17
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,960
I thought it would make Tantan
fall in love with me,

18
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,320
but now it seems like a joke.

19
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,840
It did make Tantan
forget about Cui Chen,

20
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,440
but it didn't make Tantan

21
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,630
forget everything about them.

22
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,680
What she's saying and doing
are all their memories!

23
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,120
What about me?

24
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,160
Am I just a substitute?

25
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,920
Although Tantan

26
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,640
still has some memories
of her and Cui Chen,

27
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,440
she'll forget over time.

28
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,120

I want to marry Tantan now.

39
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,160
Right now.

What's more,

41
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,240
deal with Cui Chen,

00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,440
but don't kill him.

00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,080
Yes.

doesn't work as well as you want.

You are...

52
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,960
I work for Mr. Zi Meng.

53
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,840
I'm Apan, a little toad.

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,920
I'm here to deliver

55
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,400
the location information
of a lotus seed to you.

56
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,440
The one in Wanfang City?

57
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,880
No, the last lotus seed.

58
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:42,840
Where is it?

59
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,600
It's not far from here,
ten miles to the west,

60
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,040
in a dilapidated tailor shop.

61
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,800
Mu Bai Zhenren, I can take you there.

62
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,880
Not now. I have to find Tantan.

63
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,880
Don't worry, I'll send people
to find Miss Tantan

64
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,360
and let you know as soon as I have news.

65
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,120
It's just that we finally have information
about the lotus seed,

66
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,240
if you don't go now

67
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,520
and let someone else get hold of it,

68
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,240
I'm afraid

69
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,600
it'll be a big problem.

70
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:02,920
But...

71
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,800
Don't hesitate. Just come with me.

72
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,640
(This little toad is so strange.)

73
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,680
Come with me first.

74
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,440
Okay, let's go now

75
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,320
and get this over with.

76
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,800
Okay. Please come with me.

77
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,760
We're almost there.

78
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,200
Come.

00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,800
This place is decorated beautifully.

83
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,840
Do you like it?

84
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,360
In the eyes of others,
I'm the pride of the world.

85
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,640
I can have anything I want.

86
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,640
But since I met you,

87
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,680
I've realized what I really want.

88
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,560
Qiu.

89
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,000
Don't say anything. Listen to me.

90
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,320
Only with you

91
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,360
can I feel the beauty of life.

92
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,360
We looked for lotus seeds together,

93
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,640
fought monsters together,

94
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:48,920
and saved people together.

95
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,600
There are always wonderful things
happening when I'm with you.

96
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,280
It's like a dream.

97
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,560
Tantan.

98
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,400
Will you marry me?

99
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:05,880
It's not right.

100
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,480
It's not right.

101
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,360
The proposal shouldn't be like this.

102
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,280
What's wrong?

103
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,920
Dabai, the place

104
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,080
shouldn't be here.

105
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,240
It should be at the back side
of the mountain of the Qingyuan Sect.

106
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,400
We also need flowers, candles,

107
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,440
and a heart-shaped arrangement
of fireworks.

108
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,920

109
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,720
Uncle Zi Meng, Meng and the others.

110
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,720
They all should be there.

111
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,600
Okay.

112
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,600
Tantan,
I'll give you everything you want.

113
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,200
But please promise me

114
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,240
you'll marry me now.

115
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,080
Can we get married now?

116
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,200
Get married?

117
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:41,880
Okay?

118
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,000
No.

119
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,760
We can't get married so soon.

120
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,400
Meng said

121
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,800
a girl can't say yes
right away to a proposal.

122
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,840
I need to think about it carefully
before making a decision.

123
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,760
Dabai, give me some time.

124
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,040
Dabai.

125
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,920
I'll give you the answer
after I think it over.

126
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,200
Don't be in a hurry, Dabai.

127
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,160
Dabai.

128
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,000
Dabai.

129
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,200
Don't call me Dabai anymore!

130
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:09,720
I...

131
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,960
Do you want flowers and candles?

132
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,960
Fine, I'll go and buy them
for you right now!

133
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,200
What else do you want?

134
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,360
What else do you want?

135
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,080
I...

136
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,760
The Qingyuan Sect.

137
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,320
The Qingyuan Sect, right?

138
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,200
Fine, I'll take you back now!

139
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,760
Let's go!

140
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,640
Dabai!

141
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,280
Qiu, calm down.

142
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,160
Calm down.

143
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,000
I want you to marry me now.

144
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,150
Right now!

145
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,240
Tantan, are you okay?

146
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,440
Tantan, please.

147
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,640
Please marry me now.

148
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,360
Okay?

149
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,720
Marry me now.

150
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,840
Without you, every second is painful.

151
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,520
Qiu, I'm sorry.

152
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,400
I don't know my words

153
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,640
would make you so sad.

154
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,360
Let's get married.

155
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,560
Really?

156
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,160
Anyway, I'm not going to

157
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,240
marry anyone else but you.

158
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,000
Okay.

159
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,120
Get up.

160
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,200
Get up.

161
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,280
Come on.

162
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,280
Get in here!

163
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,960
Go to prepare for the wedding now.

164
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,400
Yes.

165
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,600
Wedding?

166
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,840
Mu Bai Zhenren.

167
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,440
Mu Bai Zhenren, this is the place.

168
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,480
I'll leave then.

169
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,680
Since you're here, let's go in together.

170
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,360
Pretty girls.

171
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:02,680
Let's go.

172
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,240
Sister, look how handsome this man is.

173
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,760
Would you like to be our husband?

174
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,480
Mister, we'll serve you together,

175
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,640
how is that?

176
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,760
Who are you?

177
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,520
We can be whoever you want us to be.

178
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,880
Come on.

179
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,200
Come on.

180
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,880
Put it over there.

181
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,640
Be careful.

182
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,880
Remember to hang the lanterns too.

183
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,200
This way.

184
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,440
Slowly.

185
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,800
Don't let it get knotted.

186
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,040
Tidy it up and hang it over there.

187
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,960
Okay.

188
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,240
Tantan.

189
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,760
I've been waiting for you.

190
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,040
What took you so long, Cui Chen?

191
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,160
It's been hard
being away from you these days.

192
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,440
Cui Chen.

193
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,880
Did you buy the candied haws I wanted?

194
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,520
Cui Chen.

195
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,600
Who's there?

196
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,960
Plans have changed. You can leave first.

197
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:22,720
Yes.

198
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,320
Who are you?

199
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,760
It doesn't matter who I am.

200
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:31,920
The important thing is

201
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,080
Zhao Tantan will marry Qiu Yuebai soon.

202
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:35,800
It's impossible.

203
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,400
You're with them.

204
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,640
Why should I trust you?

205
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,720
You must know this thing.

206
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,520
The wedding hall

207
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,480
is decorated with joy and happiness.

208
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,920
Today here,

209
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,480
Zhao Tantan of the Qingyuan Sect

210
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,560
will marry Qiu Yuebai
of the Seven Nights Inn.

211
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,560
It's a match made in heaven.

212
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,720
Mo Yan's opening line is so corny.

213
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,320
I'll take it.

214
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,360
Mo Yan,
let's go straight to the ceremony.

215
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,680
No need for formalities.

216
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,240
Tantan.

217
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,440
The red cloth can't be unveiled
before we're officially married.

218
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,320
Where are Xueyi and the others?

219
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,560
Didn't you promise me

220
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,680
you'd bring them all here?

221
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,080
Why haven't they come yet?

222
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,040
Could anything happen to them?

223
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,800
No. I have to ask them.

224
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,720
Tantan.

225
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,120
Maybe they got delayed on the way.

226
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,720
Don't worry. We can hold another wedding
when we get back to the Qingyuan Sect

227
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,160
and invite them all.

228
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:18,960
Let's continue.

229
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,720
Okay.

230
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,040
It's a deal. They all have to come.

231
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,280
Including my friends
from the back side of the mountain

232
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,960
and my master.

233
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:25,880
They'll come.

234
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,120
Go on.

235
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,800
First bow to heaven and earth.

236
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,960
Second bow to your ancestors.

237
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,280
Third bow to each other.

238
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,640
Who's there?

239
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,640
What's going on out there?

240
00:14:59,280 --> 00:14:59,800
Nothing.

241
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,320
We need to bow to each other.

242
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,480
Third bow to...

243
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,720
Run!

244
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,640
Tantan.

245
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,000
Tantan, what happened to you?

246
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,640
Who are you?

247
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,760
Why are you running

248
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,120
my wedding with Qiu?

249
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,600
Don't you remember me?

250
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,320
I'm your senior.

251
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,040
I'm Dabai.

252
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,000
You're lying.

253
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,960
My Dabai is Qiu.

254
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,720
Qiu Yuebai, what have you done?

255
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,280
Why doesn't she remember me?

256
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,200
Tantan.

257
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,640
He's an intruder.

258
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,880
Just ignore him.

259
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:47,920
Qiu!

260
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,880
No need to chase them.
Tantan will be back.

261
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,240
Young Master.

262
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,160
Demon Lord.

263
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,480
You've disobeyed me again and again.

264
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,400
Do you have no respect for me?

265
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,760
Cui Chen is a cultivator.

266
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,080
I'm doing this

267
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,320
to eliminate your enemy.

268
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,640
I've told you

269
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,360
he's the key to finding the lotus seeds.

270
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,120
I can find the lotus seeds without him!

271
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,640
Just remember

272
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,320
I want Cui Chen alive,

273
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,280
and I also want all the lotus seeds.

274
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,280
If you can't find all the lotus seeds,

275
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,800
I'll destroy the woman
you've been unable to marry.

276
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,160
Don't hurt her.

277
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,680
It's up to you.

278
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,000
I promise I'll find the lotus seeds.

279
00:16:59,280 --> 00:16:59,960
Tantan.

280
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,240
I'm sorry.

281
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,560
I should have realized it
when you didn't contact me

282
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,200
the first time.

283
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:24,960
What's this?

284
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,960
What did Qiu Yuebai do to you?

285
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,000
Where am I?

286
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,320
Who are you?

287
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,480
What have you done to me?

288
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,480
Tantan.

289
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,360
Don't come closer!

290
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,400
You'd better let me go.

291
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,600
Otherwise, the entire Qingyuan Sect

292
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,680
won't spare you.

293
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:11,760
Tantan.

294
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,280
What are you talking about?

295
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,960
I'm Mu Bai Zhenren of the Qingyuan Sect.

296
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,160
I'm your senior, Cui Chen.

297
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,720
Who is "Mu Bai"?

298
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,040
I've never heard of it.

299
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,880
Do you remember Xueyi?

300
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,400
Do you know Xueyi?

301
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,160
I also know you two often communicate
by pigeon whistle.

302
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,480
How do you know that?

303
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,680
Why don't you use the pigeon whistle
to ask Huai Meng, Xueyi,

304
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,200
Zi Meng and Hu Meng to come here?

305
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,920
They'll tell you who I am.

306
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,520
Do you even know them?

307
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,720
You can try it.

308
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,800
Tantan sent me a message.

309
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,040
What?

310
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,120
Did she find the lotus seeds?

311
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,920
No.

312
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,800
She told me she was captured by a thief

313
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,240
and locked up in a run-down cabin.

314
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,480
She asked us to rescue her.

315
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,800
What should we do?

316
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,360
Could she be dead?

317
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,240
No, I can't live without her.

318
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,040
Gosh.

319
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,200
What are you panicking about?

320
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,840
Since she can send you a message,

321
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,360
it means she's safe for now.

322
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,200
Well, I'll go find Uncle Zi Meng.

323
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,040
You go find Hu Meng.

324
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,680
Then let's rescue Tantan together, okay?

325
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:49,800
Let's go.

326
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,920
Why haven't Xueyi and the others come?

327
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,280
Don't come over!

328
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,120
Tantan!

329
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,680
Do you remember this?

330
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,520
[Zhao Tantan's Love Rules]

331
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,520
Zhao Tantan's Love Rules.

332
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,920
[Swore by the disciple
of the Qingyuan Sect, Cui Chen]

333
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,840
Didn't I write this for Dabai?

334
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,520
Why is it signed by Cui Chen,
a disciple of the Qingyuan Sect?

335
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,080
Tantan, Cui Chen is Mu Bai Zhenren.

336
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,440
That's Dabai.

337
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,200
That's me.

338
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,520
You're talking nonsense.

339
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,560
Dabai is a nickname

340
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,640
for my fiancé, Qiu Yuebai.

341
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,880
What does it have to do with you?

342
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,320
Qiu Yuebai has replaced

343
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,840
all your memories of me with him.

344
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,400
Dabai is me.

345
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,720
It's always been me.

346
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,200
It has nothing to do with him.

347
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,480
You're lying!

348
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,200
Tantan.

349
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,440
Xueyi!

350
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,160
Hu Meng!

351
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,040
Tantan!

352
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:37,960
Save me!

353
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:38,960
Save me!

354
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,880
The bad guy's in there.

355
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,000
He's trying to catch me.

356
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,080
I'll see

357
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,160
who has the guts to...

358
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,720
Cui Chen?

359
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,960
Senior Mu Bai?

360
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,800
What are you talking about?

361
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,880
He's the bad guy who wants to catch me.

362
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,240
Bad guy?

363
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,360
Put on your shoes.

364
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,640
It's cold, you'll catch a cold
if you go barefoot.

365
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,720
Xueyi, he's a bad guy.

366
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,960
Tantan, what happened to you?

367
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,880
How can he be a bad guy?

368
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,240
Do you know him?

369
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,120
Of course. He's Senior Mu Bai.

370
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,760
Tantan, you...

371
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,120
Are you becoming like Uncle Zi Meng?

372
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,240
Have you lost your memory?

373
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,960
Tantan, do you remember

374
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,040
who your destined partner is
that Mr. Su told you?

375
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,280
I remember. It's Dabai.

376
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,480
No,
he doesn't like me calling him Dabai.

377
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,920
He wants me to call him Qiu.

378
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,880
How could it be him?

379
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,640
Well,

380
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,840
do you remember
who gave you the tangram?

381
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,480
Qiu gave it to me.

382
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,640
Tantan, what about the toad coat?

383
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,160
My toad coat for you.

384
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,760
It's also from Qiu.

385
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,320
Uncle Zi Meng,
how could you forget that?

386
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,600
Gosh.

387
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,320
Tantan, do you remember the red candles

388
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:45,920
when he proposed?

389
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,120
What about
the Perfect Girlfriend Guideline?

390
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,360
And Senior Mu Bai's confession to you?

391
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,080
The Light of Qingyuan.

392
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,240
You're the Light of Qingyuan.

393
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,760
Yeah, the red candles for the proposal.

394
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,680
- Have you forgotten all this?
- Do you not remember, Tantan?

395
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,560
Think about it.

396
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,960
Think about it, Tantan.

397
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,120
Tantan, think again.

398
00:22:59,160 --> 00:22:59,880
Think about it.

399
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,600
Well...

400
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,160
What's wrong with her?

401
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,240
What's going on?

402
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,400
Let's go.

403
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,080
Let's go.

404
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,360
How's her?

405
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,800
I never thought Qiu Yuebai
would be so ruthless.

406
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,280
He actually poisoned Tantan.

407
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,080
Poison?

408
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,760
What kind of poison?

409
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,600
According to Tantan's condition,

410
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,800
I think
she's been poisoned by love venom.

411
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,520
Love venom?

412
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,760
What's love venom?

413
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,360
The poisoner used his own blood

414
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,320
to feed the toxic worm.

415
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,080
The poisoned person's memories
of their true love

416
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,000
will be replaced by the poisoner.

417
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,840
Is that why Tantan
doesn't remember Cui Chen?

418
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,520
That's not the deadly part.

419
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,600
You have to know that the toxic worm

420
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,400
feeds on the flesh and blood
of the poisoned person.

421
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,720
If we don't send Tantan back
to Qiu Yuebai,

422
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,160
the toxic worm
will keep sucking her blood.

423
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,200
I'm afraid...

424
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,680
Huai Meng.

425
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,720
Cure Tantan now.

426
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,080
But,

427
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,600
I don't know how to cure
this kind of poison.

428
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,840
What should we do?

429
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,080
If this continues,

430
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:10,880
Tantan's blood

431
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,640
will be drained by that worm.

432
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,600
Uncle Zi Meng, you know everything.

433
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,800
There must be a way, right?

434
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,720
Cui Chen, don't worry.

435
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,400
I have the Strange Tales
in the Secular World.

436
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,640
I'll find it for you.

437
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,080
Tantan!

438
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:27,440
Tantan!

439
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:27,960
Tantan!

440
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:28,960
Are you alright?

441
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,400
Gosh, the poison
is starting to attack her veins.

442
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,520
If we don't detoxify her now,

443
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,080
I'm afraid Tantan will...

444
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:35,880
No.

445
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,320
Tantan can't die.

446
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,520
I don't care what you do.

447
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,400
You have to save Tantan today.

448
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:40,760
Otherwise,

449
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,880
I will break up with you!

450
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,600
Xueyi!

451
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,520
Now is not the time to be childish!

452
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,840
The only person who can save Tantan

453
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,080
is Qiu Yuebai.

454
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,040
Doesn't that mean we have to

455
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,560
take Tantan back to the devil's lair?

456
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,960
But there is no other way.

457
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,560
If we don't do it,

458
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,440
Tantan might...

459
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,480
She will soon...

460
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:55,560
She will...

461
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:57,480
Tantan!

462
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:57,920
Tantan!

463
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,520
Tantan!

464
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:02,760
I'm sorry.

465
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,200
To keep you alive,

466
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,280
I have to do this.

467
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,000
Don't you care about Tantan's life?

468
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,280
Is this how you win Tantan's heart

469
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,080
by playing dirty?

470
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,320
As long as I can keep her by my side,

471
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,080
I'll move her one day.

472
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,360
Is it fair to Tantan?

473
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,560
Have you cared about her feelings?

474
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,960
You don't need to reason with me.

475
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,200
Stay out of my business.

476
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,840
Give Tantan to me.

477
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,840
If you really want her to be good,

478
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,600
you have to rely on me to save her.

479
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,840
Qiu Yuebai, what do you want?

480
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,640
Tantan is dying because of you.

481
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,160
If Cui Chen hadn't taken her away,

482
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,160
she wouldn't be like this now.

483
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,480
I've never seen

484
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,760
such a shameless person like you!

485
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:37,680
Xueyi!

486
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,560
Let go of me!

487
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,800
The important thing is to save Tantan.

488
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:40,920
Qiu Yuebai.

489
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,240
I've brought Tantan to you.

490
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,240
Save her now.

491
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,000
Look at your faces.

492
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,600
You don't look like you're begging me.

493
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,200
Tantan is also the one you love.

494
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,280
Why do you have to be so hard on us?

495
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,680
Since you call me shameless,

496
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,560
I'll just be shameless.

497
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,360
What do you want?

498
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,800
Make him kneel down.

499
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,120
Qiu Yuebai!

500
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,560
Don't push it!

501
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,920
I'm not pushing anything.

502
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,280
I'm trying to save a life.

503
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,440
- Senior Mu Bai!
- Cui Chen!

504
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,960
I've known your sincerity.

505
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:35,800
Stay

506
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,560
and attend my wedding with Tantan.

507
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:24,800
Da...

508
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,280
Qiu.

509
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,920
I missed you so much.

510
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,800
I finally see you again.

511
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,280
I missed you too.

512
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,760
We're getting married tonight.

513
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,160
No one can stop us.

514
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,960
It's been hard for you these days.

515
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,280
Where do you want to go
after the wedding?

516
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,640
As long as I'm with you,

517
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,040
anywhere is fine.

518
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,600
Tantan.

519
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,600
Let's get started.

520
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,840
Qiu, today is our wedding day.

521
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,920
Who's crying?

522
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,120
It's Xueyi.

523
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,840
She's so happy
that we're getting married.

524
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,840
These are tears of joy.

525
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I knew it.

526
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,800
That's my best friend, Xueyi.

527
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,560
She always said
that strange man was Dabai.

528
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,840
I thought she didn't want us
to be together.

529
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,680
Wait, I have to see

530
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,520
how hard she is crying.

531
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,680
It's not just Xueyi.

532
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,960
I've invited all your friends here.

533
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:28,760
Tantan.

534
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,920
After the wedding,

535
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,760
we'll have a nice chat with them.

536
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,800
Let's get married first.

537
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,280
All right.

538
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,280
Go on.

539
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,000
First bow to heaven and earth.

540
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,550
Second bow to your ancestors.

541
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,430
Third bow to each other.

542
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,680
Tantan, are you sure he's your Dabai?

543
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,040
Tantan!

544
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,120
Don't listen to her.

545
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,840
I'm your Dabai.

546
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,800
Qiu Yuebai.

547
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,040
You used love venom on her.

548
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,360
Otherwise, Tantan wouldn't have
agreed to marry you.

549
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,040
If you don't want to attend my wedding,

550
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,120
please get out.

551
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,400
Qiu.

552
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,040
Qiu.

553
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,520
What does she mean by "love venom"?

554
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,520
She's talking nonsense.

555
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,720
Why don't you ask him?

556
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,280
Cui Chen, tell Tantan

557
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,480
if I'm Dabai,
the one she's in love with.

558
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,680
Cui Chen.

559
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,080
Say it.

560
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,400
Tantan.

561
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,280
Your Dabai is...

562
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,160
Cui Chen, I've found it.

563
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,000
I've found the way to cure her.

564
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,920
Take Tantan away.

565
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,080
Qiu, why are they like this?

566
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,240
Why don't they want us to be together?

567
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,480
Don't be afraid.

568
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,040
I'm here.

569
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,040
Tantan, he's a bad man.

570
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,400
Don't trust him.

571
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:02,840
Yes.

572
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:03,800
Tantan.

573
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,720
It's Cui Chen who shares
those beautiful memories with you,

574
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,720
not Qiu Yuebai.

575
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,120
Tantan.

576
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,280
Tantan.

577
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,640
Do you have a necklace around your neck?

578
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,520
It's our love token.

579
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,480
They are parts of a tangram.

580
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,120
I made it myself,

581
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,520
and I gave it to you in Changluo Town.

582
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,120
Do you still remember?

583
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,720
Is this the tangram you made?

584
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,240
Tantan!

585
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,120
Take her away.
