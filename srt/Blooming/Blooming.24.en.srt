Go.

20
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,920
To detoxify the love venom,

21
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,480
we must draw the toxic worm
out of the victim.

22
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:27,960
How to do that?

23
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,880
Find the victim's true love.

24
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,040
Use their blood to continuously lure

(Why haven't you contacted me?)

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,760
(Are you in danger?)

(I'll ever say to you.)

00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,400

74

in the world.)

(If I could,)

77
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,760
(I'd trade my life for yours.)

78
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,600

or the most severe trials,)

I'm sorry.

How could I forget you

89
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,560
and marry another man in your presence?

90
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,160
Tantan,

91
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,080
I'm hungry.

92
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,280
Make me a hot pot.

93
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,640
We're almost out of food.

94
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,120
Hurry up.

95
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,760
Come on.

96
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,880
It smells so good.

We're here.

is this the hot pot you mentioned?

99
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,120

Let me highly recommend

103
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,760
my newly developed
minced garlic and sesame oil sauce.

104
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,240

Come on, eat!

106
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,800
It smells so good.

107
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,120
I'll break my rule
and have some food to celebrate.

108
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,560
Come on.

I want meat.

112
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,160
Any shrimp balls?

113
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,160
Isn't this garlic?

114
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,520
Try this. It's good.

115
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,600
Here.

116
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,640
Here.

117
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,520
It's tasty.

118
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,720
So delicious.

119
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,240
Be careful.

120
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,760
Be careful. It's hot.

121
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,720
This chicken gizzard is good.

122
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,640
Have some more.

123
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,480
Here you are.

124
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,160
OK.

125
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,960
Give it to Cui Chen. He loves it.

126
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,600
Uncle Zi Meng,

127
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,400
is there any information

128
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,440
about the location of the entrance
to Wanfang City in your book?

129
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,120
All I know is that the entrance

130
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,000
is hidden in a dense forest.

131
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,040
I don't know anything else.

132
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,720
My little toads can't get in either.

133
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,400
Where are the fish balls?

134
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,120
It seems difficult to find the way.

135
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,640
And you.

136
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,000
What's the hurry?

137
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,440
You're just getting better.

138
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,000
It's not too late
to wait until you've recovered.

139
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,200
OK. I'll listen to you.

140
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,040
Tantan has learned to care for others.

141
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,600
What a surprise!

142
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,160
You guys!

143
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,080
What's wrong with you?

144
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,720
Why don't you keep your mouth shut?

145
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,960
You always...

146
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,040
What's wrong with you?

147
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,160
And you!

148
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,240
What's wrong with you?!

149
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,000
- Don't waste food.
- Anyone else?

150
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,480
That's too much.

151
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,640
This isn't even enough for me.

152
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,200
What have I done to you?

153
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,000
The food isn't even enough for me
and you're still wasting it.

154
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,600
Shame on you.

155
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,680
Shame.

156
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,680
Shame on you!

157
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,600
Let's eat.

158
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,320
Come on.

159
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,320
It isn't cooked.

160
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,000
Give me this.

161
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:26,720
Tantan.

162
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:28,960
Look.

163
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,240
That one.

164
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,000
That's Altair.

165
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,440
Where is it?

166
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,560
Over there.

167
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,600
The one next to it is the Vega.

168
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,760
Give me your hand.

169
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,840
Where is your Demon Curb Chain?

170
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,720
It's broken.

171
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,840
Broken?

172
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,560
Isn't the demon aura triggered
only when your passion is aroused?

173
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,320
Who aroused your passion
when I wasn't with you?

174
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,160
Qiu Yuebai set a trap for me.

175
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,280
I mistook her for you.

176
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,160
So I...

177
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,120
So I...

178
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,480
OK.

179
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,840
So you mistook her for me?

180
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,040
What did she do to arouse your passion?

181
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,480
Tell me, now!

182
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,320
She...

183
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:15,920
Say it!

184
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,280
She touched...

185
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,200
Be clear!

186
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,040
She, Huai Meng!

187
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,080
Huai Meng!

188
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,720
What's up?

189
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,280
What's up, bro?

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,560
Want to see the stars?

191
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,880
Want to see the stars?

192
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,840
See what?

193
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,160
Tantan,

194
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,720
Cui Chen must have been tricked.

195
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,880
He thought that woman was you.

196
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,680
We all know well
about Qiu Yuebai's tricks.

197
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,480
He could tell the fake Lian Rong

198
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,400
from Lian Wen.

199
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,800
Why couldn't he tell that woman from me?

200
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,560
Xueyi,

201
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,160
go tell him right now,

202
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,720
I'm going to break up with him.

203
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,960
Really?

204
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,160
Really.

205
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,280
Go.

206
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,720
You're not my bestie if you don't go.

207
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,800
Go, quickly.

208
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,360
Well...

209
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:07,880
Alright.

210
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,680
Xueyi.

211
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,120
Listen to me,

212
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,400
do as I tell you.

213
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,640
Huai Meng.

214
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,760
How is it going?

215
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,560
Come on.

216
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,120
Xueyi!

217
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,000
No, I...

218
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,800
I, you...

219
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,200
What am I supposed to say?

220
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,000
Say whatever you want.

221
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:28,600
I...

222
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,400
Uncle.

223
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,360
What's up?

224
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,440
Got it.

225
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,440
You understand?

226
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,480
Do you understand?

227
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,520
How's it going?

228
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,720
I just saw Tantan.

229
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,080
I said, "You're so upset.

230
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,440
Why doesn't Cui Chen come to coax you?"

231
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,240
She said, "I won't be mad at him

232
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,440
even if he doesn't coax me.

233
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,520
I won't break up with him

234
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,480
just because he doesn't coax me."

235
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,760
Interesting.

236
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,440
Did she really say that?

237
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,760
A slip of the tongue. Ouch.

238
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,280
I would know even if you didn't tell me.

239
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:00,920
Naive.

240
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,240
(Seriously? Why hasn't he come yet?)

241
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,200
(Does he really think
I'm breaking up with him?)

242
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,040
(What should I do?)

243
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,600
(Do I have to go to him?)

244
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,480
(What should I do?)

245
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,520
Someone panics
after she asks for a breakup herself.

246
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,520
Exactly.

247
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,960
Senior Mu Bai is such an honest man.

248
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,640
What if he takes it seriously?

249
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,240
He can't be that stupid, right?

250
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,080
Very likely.

251
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,200
After all, he is straightforward

252
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,960
and only understands
the apparent meaning.

253
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,280
Stay back.

254
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,600
Don't say anything. I know.

255
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,440
What do you know?

256
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,400
I know you've forgiven me

257
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,480
because you love me so much.

258
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Since you're not mad anymore,

259
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,680
let's set out tomorrow
to look for the lotus seeds.

260
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,800
It doesn't feel right.

261
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,200
What did Xueyi tell you?

262
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,160
Xueyi?

263
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,920
Uncle Zi Meng told me.

264
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,960
He said

265
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,120
you're reluctant to leave me.

266
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,560
Even if I don't coax you,

267
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,000
you'll eventually come round.

268
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,200
Xueyi, come out!

269
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,600
What's wrong, Tantan?

270
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,320
What's wrong?

271
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,040
Xueyi.

272
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,480
What did you tell him?

273
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,040
I...

274
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,880
Meng told me to say that.

275
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:53,560
I...

276
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,600
I told her not to mention
the breakup thing.

277
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,800
Just tell him you're mad
and the consequences will be serious.

278
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,760
I said what Meng told me to say.

279
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,160
What did you say?

280
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,400
No.

281
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,440
No, you...

282
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,000
You said a lot of things.

283
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,440
You mentioned breakup

284
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,720
and no breakup.

285
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,000
You also said

286
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,640
Cui Chen needs a lesson,

287
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,800
I'm free to play,

288
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,880
and I should put it nicely.

289
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,600
So I had to tell Uncle

290
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,640
that Tantan loves Cui Chen.

291
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,600
But if,

292
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,000
if he doesn't coax you,
you'll break up with him.

293
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:24,960
No, Uncle.

294
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,120
What did you say exactly?

295
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,240
How come
you distorted the meaning completely?

296
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,200
I don't want you to fight.

297
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,000
I just said

298
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,040
what's on your mind, right?

299
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,040
One,

300
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,640
two,

301
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,240
three,

302
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,720
four! All of you lied to me!

303
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,240
Well...

304
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,760
The most important thing
about apologizing is sincerity.

305
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,920
Learn from Huai Meng.
He's the most experienced.

306
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,400
Yes, Cui Chen.

307
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,880
Huai Meng apologizes to Xueyi

308
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,200
1,800 times a day.

309
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,320
He's very experienced.

310
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:58,840
I...

311
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,280
I don't apologize that much.

312
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,120
- Don't you?
- I...

313
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,720
You piss me off every day.

314
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,520
You were just complaining
about my lack of focus.

315
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,720
You, you always...

316
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,280
You talk...

317
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,960
You know the way you talk.

318
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,200
I was wrong.

319
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,110
See, that's sincerity.

320
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:23,920
Look.

321
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,640
Xueyi, my beloved,

322
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,040
I was wrong.

323
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,560
I shouldn't have let your crystal heart

324
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,560
suffer the slightest hurt.

325
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,400
I shouldn't have

326
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:39,560
Well...

327
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,880
let your unparalleled face

328
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,880
show the slightest bit of sadness.

329
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,080
Xueyi, I was wrong.

330
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,160
If everything was to start over again,

331
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,880
I would give anything.

332
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,560
I was wrong.

333
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,000
Bro, did you see?

334
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,560
Show some sincerity.

335
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:08,920
This...

336
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,280
Keep this washboard.

337
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,320
You're on your own.

338
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,520
She's coming. Get on your knees.

339
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,440
Come on.

340
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,960
Wish you good luck.

341
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,160
Huai Meng, here.

342
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,840
I don't need this,

343
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,320
but Xueyi does.

344
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,600
Well...

345
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,840
Have you forgiven me?

346
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,840
It's not that easy.

347
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,440
Say it.

348
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,720
Yeah. Get to the point.

349
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,360
Go ahead. Say it.

350
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,200
Hurry up. Say it.

351
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:08,920
Hurry.

352
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,600
The woman

353
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,760
I love most in the world, Zhao Tantan,

354
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,680
I shouldn't have

355
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,640
let your crystal heart

356
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,160
suffer the slightest hurt.

357
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,800
I shouldn't have
let your unparalleled face...

358
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,240
Sadness.

359
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,400
Show the slightest bit of sadness.

360
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,400
If I

361
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,000
could get a chance to start over...

362
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,680
Enough.

363
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,280
Cut it out. It's so sappy.

364
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,480
Tantan, I'm sorry.

365
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:55,110
For the sake of your sincerity,

366
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,840
I forgive you.

367
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,190
Really?

368
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,040
Tantan.

369
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,320
Stop him.

370
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,480
Cui Chen.

371
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,080
Tantan.

372
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:08,760
Leave.

373
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,800
Tantan.

374
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,440
Cui Chen.

375
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,560
Tantan.

376
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,120
Cui Chen.

377
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,440
Tantan.

378
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,240
Tantan.

379
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,480
Uncle went missing again.

380
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,640
What's going on?

381
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,280
Last night, Uncle was studying

382
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,720
how to enter Wanfang City.

383
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,320
I was too sleepy, so I went to bed.

384
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,720
But when I woke up,

385
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,240
Uncle was missing.

386
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,280
You knew

387
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,200
he has senile dementia,

388
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,920
how could you let him sneak away?

389
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,800
Enough. It's already happened.

390
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,040
Don't blame each other.

391
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,560
Well, Tantan,

392
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,520
you and Cui Chen go to the entrance
of Wanfang City first.

393
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,680
The rest of us will find Uncle Zi Meng.

394
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,600
Tantan,

395
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,160
you guys go do your business.

396
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,760
The three of us

397
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,960
will bring Uncle back safely.

398
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,040
When you find him,

399
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,280
put this on him.

400
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,360
That way we can

401
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,480
track him at all times.

402
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,400
Bro, you're so considerate.

403
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,320
Let's go.

404
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,040
Hurry.

405
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:01,840
Xueyi,

406
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,760
wait for me.

407
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,040
We should get going too.

408
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,040
After you.

409
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,880
Why?

410
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,040
Feng Bao?

411
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,840
Tantan.

412
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,680
I was going home.

413
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,760
I thought I'd met bandits,

414
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,160
not expecting it to be you.

415
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,440
Didn't you go back to the Qingyuan Sect?

416
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,160
Why are you in the forest?

417
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,080
We've got information
about a lotus seed.

418
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,720
So we came down to look for it.

419
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,760
Lotus seed?

420
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,600
Where?

421
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,800
In Wan...

422
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,320
In a mysterious ancient city.

423
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,120
Uncle Zi Meng said
it might be around here.

424
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,800
You mean

425
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,280
Wanfang City?

426
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,280
How do you know?

427
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,560
Wanfang City was a paradise for spirits.

428
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,520
It was destroyed over 100 years ago.

429
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,480
After it was rebuilt,

430
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,720
its defenders built a hidden barrier
to prevent more attacks.

431
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,920
So ordinary people can't find it.

432
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,960
No wonder we couldn't find it.

433
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,960
It's OK. I know where it is.

434
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,480
I'll take you there.

435
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,520
OK. Let's go.

436
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:45,880
Hurry up.

437
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,360
If Wanfang City is so secluded,

438
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,560
how do you know its entrance?

439
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,280
The city is full
of rare and precious herbs.

440
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,240
I do business with the spirits there.

441
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,560
It's only natural that I know.

442
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,880
Do you know a man called Xie Yu?

443
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,720
We're old family friends.

444
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,680
Is that all?

445
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,520
He said he's your fiancé.

446
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,560
Cui Chen, you're being aggressive.

447
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,600
Don't you trust me?

448
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,400
If so, let's part ways here.

449
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,720
No.

450
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,160
Don't.

451
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:14,800
My...

452
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,840
My senior thinks a bit too much.

453
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,800
Don't take it to heart.

454
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,840
Look.

455
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,360
Look.

456
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,760
I always wear the necklace you gave me.

457
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,120
How could I not trust you?

458
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,000
(Why does it look so familiar?)

459
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,360
(It seems that there are more secrets
to be unraveled in Wanfang City)

460
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,320
(other than the lotus seed.)

461
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,360
What are you waiting for?

462
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,800
Why don't you explain?

463
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,120
Say you mean no harm.

464
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,520
I'm sorry, Miss Feng Bao.

465
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,040
I shouldn't ask
about your personal affairs.

466
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,600
Please forgive me.

467
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,320
Feng Bao, please forgive us.

468
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,280
Would you take us to Wanfang City?

469
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,800
Please.

470
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,560
Please.

471
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,640
OK.

472
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:02,840
Let's go.

473
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,360
Go.

474
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,520
Feng Bao, don't be offended.

475
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,320
Cui Chen is a cautious man,

476
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,400
that's all.

477
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,600
It's not personal.

478
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,880
Don't take it to heart.

479
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,800
Tantan, do you really trust him?

480
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,360
Of course I trust him.

481
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,760
But you seem to hold ill feelings
against him.

482
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,880
Do you know each other before?

483
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,160
No.

484
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,000
I just don't like
his sanctimonious manner.

485
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,240
Why do you stop?

486
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,320
We've arrived at Wanfang City.

487
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,280
Why does this tree look so familiar?

488
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,360
Do you recognize it?

489
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,680
It looks familiar.

490
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,480
But I can't remember
where I've seen it before.

491
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,080
Does this tree have something to do

492
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,080
with the entrance to Wanfang?

493
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,960
At noon, the world is clear and bright.

494
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,000
Under the laurel tree,
flowers contend for beauty.

495
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,600
Open.

496
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,160
Follow me.

497
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,000
I'll go first.

498
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,120
It's OK. Don't worry.

499
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,720
[Wanfang Residence]

500
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,720
Is this Wanfang City? It's so cool!

501
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,880
It's nothing.

502
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,800
100 years ago, the city

503
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,200
was much more prosperous than it is now.

504
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,080
I think the residents all respect you.

505
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,160
Something comes to my mind.

506
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,200
What's it?

507
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,040
I just...

508
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:51,470
I feel familiar with this place.

509
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,080
I feel like I've been here before.

510
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:55,080
Tantan, you guys have a look around.

511
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,270
I have an errand to run.

512
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,470
Let's meet in front of the biggest mansion
in the east of the city later.

513
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:00,550
OK.

514
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,240
(Come and have a look.)

515
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:03,950
(Don't touch it if you pay for it.)

516
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:05,840
Dabai,

517
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,950
do you feel the scent of the lotus seed?

518
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:12,470
No.

519
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,200
Then what should we do next?

520
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,880
We'd better take a stroll

521
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,000
and see how the wind blows
before we make a plan.

522
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,230
OK.

523
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,360
Are you OK?

524
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,160
Are you hurt?

525
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,160
I'm fine.

526
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,400
Mom, hurry up.

527
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,000
We'll be late for the sacrificial rites.

528
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,720
Sacrificial rites?

529
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,480
I'm sorry.

530
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,320
What sacrificial rites?

531
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,840
I'm sorry that my son offended you.

532
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,480
It's OK.

533
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,000
Are you going to the sacrificial rites?

534
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,960
We'll be late, Mom. Let's go!

535
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,320
Let's go.

536
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,480
I'm so sorry.

537
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,000
Go.

538
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,200
Dabai,

539
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,080
perhaps we can

540
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,960
find out something
from the sacrificial rites.

541
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,960
Shall we go there too?

542
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,080
OK.

543
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:50,920
Let's go.

544
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,880
This way.

545
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,120
It's right.

546
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,320
Uncle Zi Meng!

547
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,280
I can't find it.

548
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,880
Uncle Zi Meng.

549
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,760
Why are you running around?

550
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,200
Uncle, I've been looking for you.

551
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,280
I'm so worried.

552
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,200
Who are you?

553
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,720
Have you two...

554
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,640
Cut the crap, Uncle.

555
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,120
It's me, Huai Meng.

556
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,000
Huai Meng?

557
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,600
I know Huai Meng.

558
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,680
The little pigeon likes you, right?

559
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,400
You scared me.

560
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,960
You were just kidding me.

561
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,840
So who are you?

562
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,840
Huai Meng,
what's Uncle Zi Meng talking about?

563
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:38,600
Well,

564
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,440
Uncle, let's play a game.

565
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,160
I'll play the doctor
and you play the patient.

566
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,040
Whoever plays it well gets a prize.

567
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,480
I'm good at playing patients.

568
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,960
Ready? Go!

569
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,200
Doctor, I don't have much time left.

570
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,560
I only have a few days.

571
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,360
You're the best.

572
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,200
Open your mouth.
The doctor has a pill for you.

573
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,480
Bravo.

574
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,560
Here's your prize.

575
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,120
Put this on.

576
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,280
Does it look good?

577
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,120
It's pretty.

578
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,520
Go over there and play.

579
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,080
- Don't go too far.
- Really.

580
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,000
It's pretty.

581
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,640
Huai Meng, what's wrong
with Uncle Zi Meng?

582
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,280
His senile dementia is getting worse.

583
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,320
We can't let him

584
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,880
go anywhere alone from now on.

585
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,240
We must keep a close eye on him.

586
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:19,800
Then,

587
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,120
are we going to meet up with Tantan?

588
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,480
We'd better take him back
to the Qingyuan Sect.

589
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,760
He won't be much help

590
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,880
even if we meet up with Tantan.

591
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,600
I agree.

592
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,480
I'll tell them.

593
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,360
OK.

594
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,160
Let's take Uncle back.

595
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:35,840
Let's go that way.

596
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,000
Uncle, come on.

597
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,760
Just follow me.

598
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,560
I mean that way.

599
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,280
- This way.
- Come on.

600
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,120
There's food here.

601
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,200
- Follow me.
- Is it this way?

602
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,120
Weird. Why didn't I get a response?

603
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,080
[Spirit Tablet of Feng Zhai]

604
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,150
Isn't he the one in Changluo Town...

605
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,080
Xie Yu.

606
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,510
I didn't expect him
to be from Wanfang City.

607
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,430
The late Lord tried his best

608
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:22,310
to preserve the foundation of our city.

609
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:27,750
After he died, he turned into a boundary
to protect us

610
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,160
so that those who survived

611
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,800
could recuperate,

612
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,190
rebuild the new city, and live happily.

613
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:40,240
Now, let's invite the Lady of Wanfang

614
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:43,230
to lead us in laying flowers
for the late Lord

615
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:46,160
and our deceased ancestors

616
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,680
to pay tribute to their souls.

617
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,120
Feng Bao?

618
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:45,920
[Feng Mansion]

619
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,920
This must be the mansion

620
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,560
in the east of the city
Feng Bao mentioned.

621
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,080
She said she was an apothecary.

622
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,480
It turns out she is the Lady of Wanfang.

623
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,480
I thought she was my good friend.

624
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,880
Since Feng Bao is the Lady of Wanfang,

625
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,920
she should know
there is a lotus seed in the city.

626
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,200
In that case,

627
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,840
why would she bring us in?

628
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,680
I don't care.

629
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,040
Let's go ask her directly.

630
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:05,880
Go.

631
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,480
Please come in.

632
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,280
Please.

633
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,120
Mr. Xie.

634
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,640
Tantan, you're here.

635
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,160
Why didn't you tell us
you're the Lady of Wanfang?

636
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,400
I didn't mean to keep it from you.

637
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,120
- Sorry.
- I...

638
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,080
It's the rule of Wanfang City.

639
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,720
All the people of the city

640
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,200
are not allowed
to reveal their identities to outsiders

641
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,600
so as not to be disturbed.

642
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,480
Feng Bao concealed her identity

643
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,880
because of this rule.

644
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,200
I hope you understand.

645
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,520
So the people
of Wanfang City are all liars.

646
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,560
Tantan,

647
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,640
that's not true.

648
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,320
You heard it at the sacrificial rites.

649
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,640
Over 100 years ago,
the Demon Lord massacred our people.

650
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,600
To ensure the safety of the people,

651
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,080
my father turned into a boundary
after he died

652
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,560
to hide the whole city.

653
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,560
Since then, we've had a rule

654
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,240
forbidding people

655
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,720
to disclose their identities.

656
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,800
As the Lady of Wanfang,
I have to abide by it.

657
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,040
Feng Bao, I'm sorry.

658
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:24,600
I...

659
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,360
It doesn't matter.

660
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,720
Those who don't know about the past

661
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,960
don't understand
why our city must be hidden.

662
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,720
Wanfang was once a paradise

663
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,680
and a sanctuary for spirits.

664
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,640
The newly built city

665
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,120
is not half as prosperous as before.

666
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,480
At that time, the city was rich
in spiritual herbs

667
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,520
and spiritual stones.

668
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,880
People lived a carefree life.

669
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,520
But one day,

670
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,880
the Demon Lord
suddenly attacked our city

671
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,520
and made it a ghost city overnight.

672
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,800
The late Lord,

673
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,600
my father, Feng Zhai,

674
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,120
was killed in the war.

675
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:13,760
Thankfully,

676
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:16,590
under his protection

677
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,800
and Xie Yu's leadership,

678
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,960
we've rebuilt our city

679
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,070
over the last 100 years.

680
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,800
To honor the memory of our people

681
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,000
and my father who died in the war.

682
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,280
Every year on August 15th,

683
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,110
we hold sacrificial rites in the square,

684
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:32,960
just like today.

685
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,720
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

686
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,040
I didn't mean to hide it.

687
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:43,360
I just didn't know how to tell you.

688
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,440
Give me a hug.

689
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,880
We are good friends.

690
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,440
Have you forgotten?

691
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,800
Tantan, I'm really happy

692
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,160
that you came back with me.

693
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,640
Then let's collect
the lotus seeds together,

694
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,080
liquidate the Demon Lord,
and take revenge for you.
