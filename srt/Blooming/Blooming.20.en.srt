We've caught him.

(I've caught you.)

22
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,160
- What a generous meal!
- This time,

23
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,240
thanks to Tantan and Mu Bai Zhenren,

24
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,560
we were able to
thwart the rat spirit's plot

25
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,840
and restore
the healthy dietary environment.

26
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,600
Be my guest.

27
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,440
Stay here for a few more days.

28
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,560
I'll treat you to food and entertainment.

29
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,160
Great.

30
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,480
Good.

31
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,440
Great.

32
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,320
I'll listen to her.

33
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,200
We're going back to the Qingyuan Sect
in the morning.

34
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,720
We'd better not stay.

35
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,400
Then take us back with you.

36
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:30,680
You...

37
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:31,800
No problem.

You guys.

39
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,360
Don't you leave me.

40
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,920
You still have plenty of work to do.

41
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,240
What work?

42
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,120
I'm going to merge the restaurant

00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,920
- Come on.
- Cheers.

Do you need me to dress your wound?

00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:10,760
Don't bother.

58
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,240
No big deal.

00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,160
Today is a good day.

Don't you want to stay with me

00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,480
Tantan.

66
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,640
Don't bother.

67
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,160
Don't move.

68
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,200
It seems not to be an unrequited love.

69
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,520
Are they attached to each other?

70
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,480
Don't you think the moon tonight

71
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,920
looks like the moon
on the day we got together?

72
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,440
Yeah, it really does.

73
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,360
I'll never forget
that Double Seventh Day.

74
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,560
Do you remember

75
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,200
what you said to me that day?

76
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,160
Yes, I do.

77
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,720
I said, "From now on,

78
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,160
you stay where you are.
I'll protect you."

79
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,800
The heaven will grow old
if it has sentiments.

80
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,800
Why don't we live in the moment
and love bravely?

81
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,960
I finally understand it now.

82
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,240
I've straightened out my thinking too.

83
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,480
It doesn't help

84
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,120
to dwell on the past.

85
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,280
So I've decided not to be hard on myself

86
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,240
or on you.

87
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,200
Tantan,

88
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,560
I swear.

89
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,560
You're the most real being in my heart.

90
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,640
If my self-righteous protection

91
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,080
gave you the wrong idea,

92
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,880
I apologize to you.

93
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,320
Cui Chen, listen to me.

94
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,520
You listen to me first.

95
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,960
Since I met you,

96
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,120
my world has gained a meaning again.

97
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,360
I'm not alone anymore.

98
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,000
When you said you were leaving me,

99
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,280
do you know how sad I was?

100
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,240
I don't think

101
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,720
things can't be changed.

102
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,070
But every day in the future,

103
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,160
I'll only love you.

104
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,160
You're not a substitute for anyone.

105
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,040
You're a one-of-a-kind being.

106
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,590
If you don't feel like forgiving me now,

107
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:44,840
it doesn't matter.

108
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,880
But at least don't push me away,

109
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,480
OK?

110
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,200
It's so touching.

111
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,920
Is that how young people are in love?

112
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,040
So Mu Bai Zhenren
would also be lovesick.

113
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,600
Why doesn't Tantan say yes?

114
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,640
I'm going to cry.

115
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,000
OK.

116
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,200
What did you say?

117
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,480
I said, OK.

118
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,000
I forgive you.

119
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,080
Tantan.

120
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,520
Do you mean it?

121
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,240
Watch what you do.

122
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,120
You're the respectable Mu Bai Zhenren.

123
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:57,920
Behave.

124
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,200
I'm Mu Bai Zhenren, so what?

125
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,360
Cui Chen.

126
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,760
Cui Chen, what's wrong with you?

127
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:34,720
Senior Mu Bai.

128
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,720
What's wrong with you, Cui Chen?

129
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,480
What's wrong?

130
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,520
Hurry, help him.

131
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,120
Let's get back to the restaurant.

132
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,760
What's going on?

133
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,960
Slow down.

134
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,960
I have no idea.

135
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,120
Young Master, it's all set.

136
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,760
As soon as they hit the road tomorrow,
we'll take action.

137
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,520
Get several more men.

138
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,840
Cui Chen must die.

139
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:49,520
Yes.

140
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,440
Don't hurt Tantan.

141
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,280
Young Master, rest assured.

142
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,160
Provided they set out,

143
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,200
Cui Chen will never make it back
to the Qingyuan Sect alive.

144
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,160
Leave.

145
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:57,720
Yes.

146
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,160
Be careful.

147
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,000
Senior Mu Bai, are you OK?

148
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,560
Slow down.

149
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,280
What happened to Senior Mu Bai?

150
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,920
I have no idea.

151
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,000
He can't even stand up.

152
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,000
Be careful.

153
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:11,920
I'm OK.

154
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,600
Seriously?

155
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,040
Do you call that OK?

156
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,360
Your face is pale.

157
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,120
Is it because of the rat spirit?

158
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,520
I'm going to get even with him.

159
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,280
No.

160
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,160
It's OK. It has nothing to do with him.

161
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,160
I'll be fine
after regulating my breathing.

162
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,040
Really?

163
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,800
There's a spare room upstairs.

164
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,080
Take Mu Bai Zhenren there.

165
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:29,880
Yeah.

166
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,480
Let's go.

167
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,640
It's OK. I can walk by myself.

168
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,520
Cui Chen.

169
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,120
I just didn't eat enough.
My legs are a bit weak.

170
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,560
Why are you so stubborn?

171
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,240
Go.

172
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,160
Come on.

173
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,560
Slowly.

174
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,720
What's wrong, Uncle?

175
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,680
Aren't you feeling well?

176
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,640
I'm fine.

177
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,080
Then why do you

178
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,160
look so worried?

179
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,400
You're not a fool.

180
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,640
Someone's in trouble.

181
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,360
Who is it?

182
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:11,320
I've looked up the Xilan Flower Curse.

183
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,080
Is...

184
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,440
Is Cui Chen really going to die

185
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,120
because of the curse?

186
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,880
If he dies,

187
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,600
it would be a silver lining.

188
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,840
When a person like Cui Chen
under the Xilan Flower Curse

189
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,360
has his passion aroused,

190
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,520
a petal will unfold on his forehead.

191
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,880
Once it unfolds,

192
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,640
his attainments, consciousness and body

193
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,800
will be greatly depleted.

194
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,040
When all five petals unfold,
he'll degenerate into a demon.

195
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,520
Cui Chen is the best cultivator
in the world.

196
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,080
If he becomes a demon,

197
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,840
he'll be the greatest scourge
to the world.

198
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,400
Well, then,

199
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,960
is there any solution?

200
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The Seven-Leaf Lotus.

201
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,320
There's no other way.

202
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,200
The Seven-Leaf Lotus?

203
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,680
A petal will unfold
when his passion is aroused.

204
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,640
So this petal...

205
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,520
Zhao Tantan, have a heart.

206
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,520
He's in such bad shape,

207
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,120
and you're still indulging in fantasy.

208
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,480
What are you doing?

209
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,600
You're sick.

210
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,920
Don't fill your head with nonsense.

211
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,840
You may steal a horse

212
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,440
while I may not look over the hedge.

213
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,120
Stop talking nonsense.

214
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,240
You should close your eyes now

215
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,360
and get some rest.

216
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,320
Did I hurt you?

217
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,200
It hurts here.

218
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,120
Take a closer look.

219
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,360
Look. Get closer.

220
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,000
Sleep with me for a while.

221
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,920
You liar!

222
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,560
I'm not lying. It really hurts.

223
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,760
What?!

224
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,640
Say it again!

225
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,480
It won't change
no matter how many times I say it.

226
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,680
The person with a grudge
would sacrifice their own strength

227
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,920
to cast the Xilan Flower Curse.

228
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,280
Those who are cursed
mustn't have their passion aroused.

229
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,280
Once they do, a petal will unfold
between their eyebrows.

230
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,400
When all five petals unfold,

231
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,760
they'll degenerate into demons.

232
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,560
How many times do you want to hear it?

233
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,280
One petal for each evocation of passion.

234
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,800
It doesn't seem right.

235
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,080
Didn't Cui Chen come back

236
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,920
with a petal on his head?

237
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,680
He already had two when they broke up.

238
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,560
Who made Cui Chen bloom?

239
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,680
Master, stay...

240
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,720
Stay calm.

241
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,600
I can't believe
they cast such a curse on Cui Chen

242
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,160
and let Tantan
suffer an undeserved blow.

243
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,520
But what's it got to do with Tantan?

244
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,640
Tantan is the one who made him blossom.

245
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,240
Look at him.

246
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,960
Why don't you squirt water on him?!

247
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,440
I'm sorry.

248
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,240
But

249
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,320
they already broke up.

250
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,480
From now on,
don't pause until you finish.

251
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,400
Well, Master,

252
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,800
don't worry too much.

253
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,920
He only has two petals now.

254
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,680
If we stop him
from arousing his passion,

255
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,000
we can still cut loss in time, right?

256
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,440
Yes, that makes sense.

257
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,040
What's there to worry about?

258
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,080
By the way, everyone,

259
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,760
don't tell them about the demon thing.

260
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,320
When Cui Chen and Tantan come back,

261
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,920
I'll make a plan.

262
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,520
Now that they've broken up,

263
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,840
we must stop them
from getting back together.

264
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,920
But do we have to do this to them?

265
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,600
Is love or life more important?

266
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,280
By the way, in case...

267
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,120
I mean in case.

268
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,760
In case the worst happens,

269
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,160
is there anything

270
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,720
that can remove his demonic nature?

271
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:36,720
Yes.

272
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,520
What?

273
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,320
The Seven-Leaf Lotus.

274
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,680
There's no other way.

275
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,320
How many lotus seeds have they found?

276
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,560
Tantan has three.

277
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,440
Tantan has three.

278
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,400
Two in the library.

279
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,520
Five. Two more to go.

280
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,400
Well,

281
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,680
Zi Meng, please ask your little toads

282
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,560
to gather more information
about the lotus seeds.

283
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,400
When Tantan and Cui Chen

284
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,400
started to look for the seeds,

285
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,640
I already did.

286
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:55,800
But...

287
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:07,200
[Crab Noodle Restaurant]

288
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:11,920
Tantan,

289
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,760
tell my son when you get back

290
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,240
that his father has made a fortune

291
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,840
and doesn't have to
live on selling crab cream.

292
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,520
OK.

293
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:20,720
Tantan,

294
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,200
tell Master

295
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,280
when I'm free,

296
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,800
I'll go back to see him.

297
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,000
OK.

298
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,920
One more thing,

299
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,200
don't forget to tell Sha

300
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,680
I miss her so much.

301
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,800
I miss her porridge.

302
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,080
Enough.

303
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,200
Aren't you going back in a while?

304
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,480
Stop bothering me.

305
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,320
Don't disturb our date.

306
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,680
Let's go.

307
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,680
Have a safe trip.

308
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,440
Be safe.

309
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,960
A grown girl can't be kept at home.

310
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,040
Mission aborted.

311
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:46,800
No way.

312
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,600
Go get them.

313
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,680
This is the Demon Lord's order.

314
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,360
All units, attention!

315
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,480
All units, attention!

316
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,320
Gosh.

317
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,240
All units, attention!

318
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,320
The internal mobilization meeting
of the Qingyuan Sect

319
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,400
will now begin.

320
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,440
Master,

321
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,640
do you want the whole sect to know it?

322
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,600
Come on.

323
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,640
As you know,

324
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,680
I've told you

325
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,040
how serious this is.

326
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,840
I declare that from now on,

327
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,440
the Reunion Preventing Plan
is officially launched.

328
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,440
All of you, pull yourselves together.

329
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,840
Cui Chen and Tantan

330
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,560
will be monitored on a 24-hour shift.

331
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,200
If anything unusual happens,
stop it immediately.

332
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,000
Yes, Master.

333
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,040
No problem, Master.

334
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,640
OK. Whatever you say.

335
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,840
And don't tell anyone

336
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,120
about this,

337
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,160
especially Xueyi.

338
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,680
Huai Meng,

339
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,880
you mustn't tell her.

340
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,640
If you tell her,
you're telling the whole sect.

341
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,160
You're right, Master.

342
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,520
And you, Hu Meng?

343
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,760
I don't agree with this plan.

344
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,280
Well...

345
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,840
But I won't stop you.

346
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,680
Why don't you agree?

347
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,200
You'll know when you're in love.

348
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,840
To love but miss out

349
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,320
is the saddest thing

350
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,440
in the world.

351
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,400
Slow down.

352
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,040
Is it fun?

353
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,200
Not at all.

354
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,320
You're always trying to bully me.

355
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,240
Someone's following us.

356
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:25,760
Really?

357
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,240
Let's go check out.

358
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,320
We have the lotus seeds with us.

359
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,600
Don't complicate matters.

360
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,640
Let's go back to the Sect first.

361
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,200
OK.

362
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,600
(I must get the lotus seeds
before they return)

363
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,920
(to the Qingyuan Sect.)

364
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,720
May heaven bless us.

365
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,360
Cui Chen and Tantan didn't make up.

366
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,040
[Qingyuan Sect]
May heaven bless us.

367
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,480
Cui Chen and Tantan didn't make up.

368
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,040
You should learn from me.

369
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,240
May heaven bless us.

370
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,520
May heaven bless us.

371
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,120
I don't think
Master's wish will come true.

372
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,160
Even so, we must make it come true.

373
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,960
Tantan, I'm doing this for your good.

374
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,480
Gosh, what should I do?

375
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,800
I don't want anything to happen to them,

376
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,960
but I want them to be together.

377
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,880
If only Tantan would bring me food

378
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,000
when she comes back!

379
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,880
Gosh, Uncle,

380
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,160
you're getting off the subject.

381
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,720
They are back!

382
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,920
They are back!

383
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:16,720
Are they back?

384
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,760
Tantan and Senior Mu Bai are back.

385
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,800
- What should I do?
- They are back.

386
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,600
Is this a new welcoming ceremony?

387
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,040
No, we...

388
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,600
Huai Meng,
you're keeping secrets from me.

389
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,240
They're back.

390
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,200
They're back.

391
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,120
Master!

392
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,120
We're back!

393
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,680
Master!

394
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,000
You...

395
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,280
Master.

396
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,640
Master.

397
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,280
Master.

398
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,560
Master.

399
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,000
Your master

400
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,680
fainted with joy.

401
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,360
The road has been cleared.

402
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,000
Cui Chen and Zhao Tantan have returned

403
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,120
to the Qingyuan Sect
with the lotus seeds.

404
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,520
Everything's on schedule.

405
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,400
The seven lotus seeds
are almost collected.

406
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,320
Anyone getting in Cui Chen's way

407
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,200
must be wiped out.

408
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,200
Yes!

409
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,880
Young Master, don't!

410
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,840
Let him in.

411
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,640
Young Master.

412
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,120
You're dismissed.

413
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,320
Yes.

414
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,480
It's my personal affair
to kill Cui Chen.

415
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:46,920
Why did you stop me?

416
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,840
Personal affair?

417
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,560
Leaving Cui Chen's profound attainments

418
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,760
and extraordinary spiritual power aside,

419
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,600
his ability alone
to sense the lotus seed scent

420
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,920
makes him worth keeping.

421
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,280
So what?

422
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,840
Without Cui Chen,

423
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,840
I can still find the lotus seeds
through my Seven Nights Inn.

424
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,560
Idiot!

425
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,840
I've been waiting for over 100 years.

426
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,000
Now are you trying

427
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,840
to jeopardize my plan for a woman?

428
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,040
Tantan is my plan.

429
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,960
Cui Chen only sees her as a substitute.

430
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,520
If they get married,

431
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,520
I won't stand a chance.

432
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,280
Shut up!

433
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,520
I need him
to collect the seven lotus seeds.

434
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,400
Do you know that?!

435
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,320
Over the last 100 years,

436
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,160
I've given you nothing.

437
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,800
But don't worry.

438
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,840
As for Zhao Tantan,

439
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,160
I'll fulfil your wish when it's done.

440
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,320
Right now,
we must focus on the big picture.

441
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:45,960
Understand?

442
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,280
Master, are you OK?

443
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,840
We miscalculated in the end.

444
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,320
Why are they together again?

445
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,080
How can they be together again?

446
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,400
But this is the first time
Tantan has fallen for someone.

447
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,560
Are you really going to break them up?

448
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,320
Do you think

449
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,720
I don't want them to be together?

450
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,320
Think about it.

451
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,840
Cui Chen is such a talent.

452
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,960
If he degenerates into a demon,

453
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,920
how could he face it?

454
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,200
And Tantan,

455
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,160
if she knew she was the culprit

456
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,080
behind Cui Chen's degeneration,

457
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,840
how could she live with it?

458
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,480
And how could we explain to the world?

459
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,440
So, the plan must be carried out.

460
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,640
Listen to me.

461
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,280
You ask Hu Meng and Huai Meng

462
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,840
to keep an eye on them

463
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,960
at all times.

464
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:38,720
What for?

465
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,520
Blow out the flame of love!

466
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,000
What are you waiting for? Go.

467
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,520
OK.

468
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,240
Hot.

469
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,480
If the other juniors

470
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,480
know I'm peeping here,

471
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,640
I'll be disgraced.

472
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,520
I'd better leave.

473
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,640
Sha, what's up?

474
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,040
Well,

475
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,600
you are not married yet.

476
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,760
You shouldn't be together at night.

477
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,000
Master said so.

478
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,400
Tantan, come with me.

479
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,680
Hurry up.

480
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,920
Sha,

481
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,840
let me stay a little longer.

482
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,160
I'll leave after the foot bath.

483
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,160
No.

484
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:49,880
Go.

485
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:50,880
Listen to me.

486
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,800
Leave. It's time to go to bed.

487
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,400
Let's go.

488
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,280
Go back.

489
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:54,880
Go to sleep.

490
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,600
Hurry.

491
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:56,920
Leave.

492
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,800
Go back to bed.

493
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,760
Forget about the foot bath.

494
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,640
We can do it tomorrow morning.

495
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,840
Stop looking. Leave.

496
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,360
Why isn't Cui Chen here?

497
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,400
I thought we had a date.

498
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,440
Gosh!

499
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:46,640
Hands off!

500
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:47,880
Well.

501
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:48,880
Well.

502
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:49,720
Well.

503
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,360
Well.

504
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,480
Master said

505
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,680
you're not married yet.

506
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,200
You mustn't be together

507
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,120
unaccompanied.

508
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,120
No way.

509
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,600
Why does Master

510
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,800
have so many rules suddenly?

511
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,680
Is he afraid of the pig

512
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,000
eating his beloved cabbage?

513
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,080
No. I'm going to see him.

514
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,240
Forget it, Tantan.

515
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,120
Master must have his concerns.

516
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:09,840
Next time, let's meet in some place

517
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,320
with more people.

518
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:11,920
Good.

519
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,240
Pig,

520
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,720
the cabbage is gonna head off.

521
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,320
No, you're the pig.

522
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,400
I'm the cabbage!

523
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,400
I'm Master's favorite cabbage.

524
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,480
Master.

525
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,240
Master.

526
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,280
Who is it?

527
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,600
Who is it?

528
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,760
You guys are...

529
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,800
I'm Qifang, Master.

530
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,080
I'm Xianfang, Master.

531
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,760
Master.

532
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:04,840
Qifang.

533
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,640
Xianfang.

534
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,120
You're finally back.

535
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,240
Master!

536
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,600
I miss you so much!

537
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,000
It's great.

538
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,280
Let me take a good look at you.

539
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,560
You've lost weight.

540
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,400
Master, this is the current fashion

541
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,480
in stature.

542
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,320
You're too old-fashioned.

543
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,120
Really?

544
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:20,800
Master.

545
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,040
I'm tired.

546
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,080
I'm tired and skinny.

547
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,800
I'm burnt-out
at counting money every day.

548
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,760
You're doing business?

549
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,960
Business is good.

550
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,240
I can't believe
I've trained two business geniuses.

551
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,720
I'm proud of you.

552
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,800
Master, we're not that great.

553
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,760
We only have a few dozen restaurants.

554
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,440
Look at you.

555
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,080
You've got a glib tongue.

556
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,920
You've brought presents.

557
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,000
What's that?

558
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:45,960
Master, look.

559
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,040
I've got all kinds

560
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,640
of good food and fun things here.

561
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,200
Whenever I saw something good,

562
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,120
I always thought of getting it for you.

563
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,120
Have a taste.

564
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,760
No hurry.

565
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,440
Master,

566
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,160
I've got what we need most

567
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,280
for the Qingyuan Sect.

568
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,720
Lotus seeds?

569
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,120
Money!

570
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,440
Yeah.

571
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,520
Money is what we need most.

572
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,160
There's more here.

573
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,640
Great. This is Master's favorite.

574
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,120
When Tantan gets married,

575
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,280
you can give this to her as a dowry.

576
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:15,400
you can give this to her as a dowry.

577
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,600
Do you also know

578
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,680
they are together?

579
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,480
Yeah.

580
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,120
The other day,
in front of our noodle restaurant,

581
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,400
they were...

582
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,280
Dear family,

583
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,760
dear friends,

584
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,000
welcome to my

585
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,400
acknowledgment banquet.

586
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:35,800
Good.

587
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,480
- Good.
- Great.

588
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,200
I've finally got a break.

589
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:41,680
Good.

590
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,640
- Good!
- Great!

591
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,400
Hereby I declare,

592
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,560
from now on, your rents are all on me.

593
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,120
Tantan,
when you collect rents next time,

594
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,520
come to me directly.

595
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,200
Tantan.

596
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,360
Where is Tantan?

597
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,000
Tantan.

598
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,600
Xueyi.

599
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:58,640
Where is Tantan?

600
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,760
She just told me

601
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,320
she's going on a date
with Senior Mu Bai.

602
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,280
She asked me to bring her present over.

603
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,280
What?

604
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:05,880
No.

605
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,080
No, they...

606
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,560
Where did they go?

607
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,520
The back woods, I suppose.

608
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,360
Where are you going?

609
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,080
I...

610
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,240
Why have you been secretive lately?

611
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:16,960
I'm telling you,

612
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,360
you're not going anywhere

613
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,640
until you tell me the truth.

614
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,200
Cui Chen, let's play "Hold Your Laugh".

615
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,280
OK.

616
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,760
I'll go first.

617
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,480
Look.

618
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,600
Once upon a time, there was a corn girl

619
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,520
who was going to marry a corn man.

620
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,200
As a result,

621
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,920
on the night of their wedding,

622
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,760
the corn man found that his bride

623
00:31:59,120 --> 00:31:59,840
had turned into popcorn.

624
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,320
So he asked, "Who are you?"

625
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,640
The corn girl said,

626
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,680
"Honey, I'm your corn girl.

627
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,880
Tonight is our wedding.

628
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,240
So I got a new haircut."

629
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,920
You have no sense of humor.

630
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,080
Your turn.

631
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:26,800
My turn.

632
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,120
Come on.

633
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,240
You're cheating!

634
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,240
You're cheating!

635
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,280
What are you doing?

636
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,360
Cheating!

637
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,640
Hold on!

638
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,920
Hold on.

639
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,080
Hold on.

640
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,800
Tantan.

641
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,120
Meng.

642
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,440
What are you doing here?

643
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,560
Did Master

644
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,960
send you too?

645
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,960
What does Master want exactly?

646
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,600
Do we have to be married

647
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,920
to stay together?

648
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,960
If you are deep in love,

649
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,800
I don't think
you should hold off your wedding

650
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,720
lest you would regret it.

651
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,960
Regret it?

652
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,920
What I'm saying is...

653
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,080
I get it.

654
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,800
You're afraid that we would

655
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,880
repeat you and Zhu Yan's error.

656
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,200
Don't worry.

657
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,520
We'll be fine.

658
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,000
We don't know which will come first,

659
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,360
tomorrow or an accident.

660
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,400
Whatever you want to do, do it now.

661
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,800
I just want

662
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:48,040
a good date with Cui Chen.

663
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,360
Look.

664
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,200
Master always sends you guys
to disturb us.

665
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,400
Annoying.

666
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,840
Don't complain about Master.

667
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,600
He must have his reasons.

668
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,760
Okay, I'll listen to him.

669
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,680
I'll stay away from you.

670
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,240
I'll stay away from you, Cui Chen.

671
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,120
Away from you.

672
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,520
Away.
