Zhu Yan!

Zhu Yan.

Don't come over!

00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,270
Zhu Yan.

21
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,440
Little fox.

22
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,520
I've been looking for you for years.

23
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,550
Look at the way I am now.

25
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,550
If there's a chance to choose,

26
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,880
I wouldn't choose to meet you.

27
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,750
It's okay. I found the lotus seed.

28
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,520
It can purify you.

29
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,110
The lotus seed?

30
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,550
No!

31
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,670
Don't hurt him!

32
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,080
Please, don't hurt him.

Tantan.

36
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,160
Please.

37
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,800
Please save him. I'm begging you.

38
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,800
Is he a human or a spirit?

39
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,080
He's a human.

40
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,830
It's my fault.

41
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:00,190
If he hadn't saved me in the woods,

42
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,670
he wouldn't be like this now.

43
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,160
Please save him.

00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,670

00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:11,800
I...

47
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,320
- Okay.
- Tantan.

48
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,480
Cui Chen, if we do this,

49
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,720
the lotus seed might be destroyed,

50
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,600
and the Seven-Leaf Lotus
may never be reborn.

51
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,350
Tantan, what's the motto
of our Qingyuan Sect?

52
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,880
To save all living beings
and uphold justice.

53
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,070
Zhu Yan is one of them.

54
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,670
If we don't save him today,

55
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,920
how can we live up
to the title of cultivators?

56
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,480
How can we be called
the light of Qingyuan?

57
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,320
Cui Chen, you're right.

58
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,390
Let's save him.

59
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:49,950
Thank you.

60
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,720
There's something I have to tell you.

61
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,510
Zhu Yan is a mortal.

62
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,390
Once the evil energy in his body
is dispelled,

63
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,270
he may age

64
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,440
rapidly

65
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,550
or even die.

66
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,950
Hu Meng, what are you doing?

67
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,040
Tantan, I've tried so hard
to get this lotus seed,

68
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,640
so that I can be with him.

69
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,830
I can't accept such a result.

70
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,200
He can't die!

71
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,000
Hu Meng!

72
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,000
Look carefully.

73
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,070
The evil energy in Zhu Yan
has surpassed his humanity.

74
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,110
If you do nothing about it,

75
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,880
he'll only harm more people.

76
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,600
Zhu Yan.

77
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,350
The evil energy in him is too strong.

78
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,040
I can't dispel it alone.

79
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,760
When I first touched the lotus seed,

80
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,760
I established my foundation.

81
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,510
The second time I touched it,
I reached the Virtuoso Phase.

82
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,160
Could it be that every time I touch
the lotus seed...

83
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,760
Cui Chen, give me the lotus seed.

84
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,920
I like you.

85
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,000
Will you be with me?

86
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,550
I...

87
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,830
If you like me too,

88
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,070
everything is not a problem.

89
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,000
(Why do I see such scenes)

90
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,200
(every time I touch the lotus seed?)

91
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,790
Hu Meng, trust me.

92
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,510
Zhu Yan.

93
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:34,830
Zhu Yan.

94
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,950
Hu Meng.

95
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,550
My little fox.

96
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,720
Don't cry.

97
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,720
Take a look in the mirror.

98
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,000
The mirror?

99
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,510
You still have it.

100
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,480
It's the only thing you left me.

101
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,230
You told me...

102
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:04,200
Carry this mirror with you from now on.

103
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,040
Think of it as me.

104
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,790
When you look in the mirror,

105
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,640
I'll be looking at you.

106
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,920
So, no matter where I go

107
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,670
and what I do,

108
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,320
I always carry it with me.

109
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,880
What happened to you?

110
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,600
Why did you become like this?

111
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:30,270
I wanted to achieve immortality
and extend life.

112
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,760
I thought that way,

113
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,230
I could stay with you forever.

114
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,590
I didn't expect...

115
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,910
I didn't expect
to fall into demonic cultivation

116
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,670
and destroyed myself.

117
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:51,840
It's all my fault.

118
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,400
If I hadn't insisted on leaving you,

119
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:58,320
you wouldn't be like this now.

120
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,640
My little fox.

121
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,590
It's not your fault.

122
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:08,550
Well, I can see you

123
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,080
and hear your voice.

124
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,110
It's enough for me.

125
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,710
I'm old,

126
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,200
but you've come back to me.

127
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,840
You can say
that we've grown old together, right?

128
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,280
Little fox, don't cry.

129
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,590
You must stay alive and live well.

130
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,320
Listen to me.

131
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,110
I promise you. If there's a next life,

132
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,230
I'll still be your little fox. Alright?

133
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,110
I'll make roast chicken for you,

134
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,150
and you'll make a bronze mirror for me.

135
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,880
We'll hold hands like this

136
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:55,590
and go to the most beautiful place.

137
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,760
Don't leave me!

138
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,320
Zhu Yan.

139
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:41,790
Hu Meng is still inside.

140
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,470
Will she do something stupid?

141
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,710
Cui Chen, I'm gonna check on her.

142
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,920
I'll go with you.

143
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,240
Forget it.

144
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,880
Let's give Hu Meng some space.

145
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,000
Zhu Yan told her to live well.

146
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,070
She won't do anything stupid.

147
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,560
You don't understand.

148
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,750
You don't know how important

149
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,360
a relationship is to a girl.

150
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,390
I must go check on her.

151
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,480
Hu Meng.

152
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,560
I thought

153
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,920
I had a long life ahead of me.

154
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,880
I never expected that it just ended

155
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,920
at the moment he left.

156
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,070
How can you say that?

157
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,480
You're not just living for yourself now.

158
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,000
You're also living for him.

159
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,480
Didn't you promise Zhu Yan

160
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,590
to be his little fox in the next life?

161
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,750
If he loses his memory,

162
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,270
you'll be the one to find him.

163
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,510
If I hadn't been so stubborn,

164
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,070
we wouldn't have missed so many years.

165
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,560
Hu Meng, since you've done him wrong,

166
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,920
shouldn't you do as he told you?

167
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,320
Okay.

168
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,560
(Sometimes, when you miss someone,
it would be a lifetime.)

169
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,830
(So, if you love someone,)

170
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,800
(you must tell him.)

171
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,950
Qiqiao Pavilion?

172
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,440
What kind of place is this?

173
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,950
How dare they kill people in public?

174
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,830
There wasn't this place when I left.

175
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:47,800
That's strange.

176
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,000
Don't be rash.

177
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,360
We don't know what's going on there.

178
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,070
Yeah. It doesn't look like
a simple place here.

179
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,320
It might be dangerous to go in.

180
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,190
Listen to me.

181
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,040
Okay, I'll listen to you.

182
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,830
Tantan.

183
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,120
You're actually taking advice now.

184
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,560
Don't talk nonsense.

185
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,360
I'm not.

186
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,270
Maybe I know what they're doing.

187
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,000
It should be related to the lotus seed.

00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,830
I'm not sensing
the scent of the lotus seed.

189
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,480
I can feel

190
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:21,070
that the Qiqiao Pavilion is...

191
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:22,710
I'm hungry.

192
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,240
- Uncle, hurry up.
- Tell us.

193
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,480
Tell us now.

194
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,590
I'm still thinking.

195
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,040
I can't just...

196
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,710
- Come on.
- You're always like this.

197
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,510
Well, I need to think about it
one by one.

198
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,480
The dishes are all here.

199
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,360
Let's eat.

200
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,750
Miss Meng.

201
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,150
I'm sorry to cause you trouble.

202
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,800
You've also helped me a lot.

203
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,440
It's what I should do.

204
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,360
Are you not eating?

205
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:55,390
Have a bite.

206
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,480
Fine, I'll eat then.

207
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:00,320
All you think about is eating.

208
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,560
Hurry up and tell us.

209
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,590
All right.

210
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,150
You know,

211
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,710
the Qiqiao Pavilion

212
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
is an underground black market.

213
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,040
You can trade jewelry there,

214
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,630
magic instruments,

215
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,480
and even information.

216
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,000
You mean

217
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,950
there might be information
about other lotus seeds.

218
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,120
Definitely.

219
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,680
And it's better than

220
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,360
that guy's...

221
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,510
His

222
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,680
chain of inns.

223
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,680
They know a lot of things.

224
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,070
Okay, let's go now.

225
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:35,630
Come on.

226
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,000
Sit down.

227
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,800
Why?

228
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,710
You can go,

229
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,070
but I'm afraid you won't make it back.

230
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,560
What do you mean?

231
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,920
Well, the people in the Qiqiao Pavilion

232
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,630
are black-hearted,

233
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,000
and it's full of tricks there.

234
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,750
With your mediocre skills,

235
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,560
you can't do anything

236
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:51,560
but cause trouble for Cui Chen.

237
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,510
I won't cause him trouble.

238
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,920
I'm a real cultivator now.

239
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,190
Besides,

240
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,150
if it's really that dangerous
as you say,

241
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,070
how can I let Cui Chen go alone?

242
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,800
Am I right, Cui Chen?

243
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,270
I think he's right.

244
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,560
I'll go alone.

245
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,480
No way.

246
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,590
It's non-negotiable.

247
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,800
Xueyi, Huai Meng, keep an eye on her.

248
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,270
Yeah, he'll be distracted
if you go with him.

249
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,710
Okay, Senior Mu Bai.

250
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,480
Xueyi, you traitor!

251
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,120
Come here.

252
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,360
Come here.

253
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,000
Don't.

254
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,480
Cui Chen.

255
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,680
Look, they're ganging up on me.

256
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,040
You're not helping me.

257
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:29,880
Tantan.

258
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,440
Why do I feel that you're acting cute?

259
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,240
I...

260
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,240
I'll kick your ass.

261
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,070
Is it good?

262
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,240
Forget it.

263
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,710
- Miss Meng.
- Miss Meng.

264
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,120
Mr. Qiu.

265
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,150
Go find the owner of the Qiqiao Pavilion

266
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,920
and tell him Cui Chen has a lotus seed.

267
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,000
What are you doing here?

268
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,440
Shouldn't you be taking care of Hu Meng?

269
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,750
Huai Meng said she's fine.

270
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,270
She just needs to take the medicine,
drink some water,

271
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,710
and have more rest.

272
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:30,120
Then go back and get some sleep.

273
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,150
You've been here all night.

274
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,150
Your eyes are red.

275
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,190
I'm afraid you would leave without me.

276
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,070
Did you really stay here all night?

277
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,560
Where are you going?

278
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,560
To make some porridge for the patient.

279
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,830
I'll go with you.

280
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,480
(I'll see if you can get rid of me.)

281
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,480
(I wonder where Qiu is.)

282
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,480
(I haven't seen him this morning.)

283
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,440
(A focused man)

284
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,040
(is truly charming.)

285
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:15,800
It's done.

286
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:18,920
What?

287
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,560
The porridge for Hu Meng is ready.

288
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,560
Send it to her.

289
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:36,350
You're not going to the Qiqiao Pavilion
without me, are you?

290
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,510
It's possible.

291
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:40,630
No way!

292
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,840
You have to take me with you.

293
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,150
The medicine Huai Meng gave her
has been added to it.

294
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,150
Send it to her now.

295
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,200
Okay, but don't go without me.

296
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:56,990
I know.

297
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,720
Don't forget to practice later.

298
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,320
Hu Meng.

299
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,230
Didn't Huai Meng tell you to rest more?

300
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,390
Why are you up again?

301
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,350
I'm a golden fox.

302
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,440
I recovered long ago.

303
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,270
Come here.

304
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,560
Sit down.

305
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,390
You still have to drink this.

306
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,270
Cui Chen made it.

307
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,390
He never made it for me.

308
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,470
Why are you looking at me?

309
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,230
Do I have something on my face?

310
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,110
Do you like him?

311
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:35,990
Yes.

312
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,350
But why are you suddenly asking this?

313
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,870
Does he know it?

314
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,200
No.

315
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,150
But he and I are

316
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:48,560
destined to be together.

317
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,200
He should know it.

318
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,230
What do you mean by 'should'?

319
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,990
If you're not sure, just let him know.

320
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,150
Love expert, please start your lesson.

321
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:09,230
First, flirt with him bravely.

322
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,920
If he doesn't show any aversion,

323
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,680
confess your love to him.

324
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,510
If he rejects you,

325
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,630
then act innocent.

326
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,080
I'm sorry.

327
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,920
It's my fault to fall in love with you.

328
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:20,990
Show me.

329
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,600
I can do that.

330
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,870
Here, take this for me.

331
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,840
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

332
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,320
Take it.

333
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:37,510
Then leave reluctantly,
while looking back from time to time.

334
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,920
I can do that too.

335
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,510
Take a step forward,

336
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,270
and look back three times.

337
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,150
Oh, my God.

338
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,600
Am I doing it wrong again?

339
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,920
Then what?

340
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,510
If he catches up with you,

341
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:57,320
it's a perfect ending.

342
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,630
If he doesn't,
you continue to pursue him

343
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,800
until you get him.

344
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,150
And then?

345
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,200
Remember, persistence is key.

346
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,110
Okay!

347
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,080
I'm going then.

348
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,560
Tantan.

349
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,390
Go get him.

350
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,870
Don't be like me,

351
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,960
regretting it after losing him.

352
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,150
What are you thinking about?
Practice your swordsmanship.

353
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,920
Come on. One, two, three.

354
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,080
They look perfect together
from any angle.

355
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,040
I envy her.

356
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,920
I wish I had someone
to practice swordsmanship with me.

357
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,350
Xueyi, you're a pigeon.

358
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,630
Can you even hold a sword?

359
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:02,200
Let alone practice it with others.

360
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:02,960
That's hilarious.

361
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,560
They're up there.

362
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:09,840
Uncle.

363
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,870
Xueyi left.

364
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:11,720
How?

365
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,390
She stomped her feet and left.

366
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:12,800
Go after her.

367
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,630
Xueyi!

368
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,350
Xueyi!

369
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,350
Don't.

370
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,040
Don't.

371
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,040
You...

372
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,040
Why are you angry?

373
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,200
Do you not know why I'm angry?

374
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,080
I...

375
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:27,560
Forget it.

376
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,600
Well,

377
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,390
everything is my fault, all right?

378
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,560
What do you mean by that?

379
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,350
Just pretend I'm not mad.

380
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,630
No.

381
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,510
Well,

382
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,200
don't you want to
practice swordsmanship?

383
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,390
I'll teach you how to wield a sword.

384
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:47,040
It's not about that!

385
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,150
Then what is it about?

386
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,630
You're a blockhead.

387
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:50,840
I don't want to talk to you.

388
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:52,680
Xueyi!

389
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,560
Women are complicated.

390
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,040
When they say yes, it means no.

391
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,840
When they say no, it means yes.

392
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,960
Is it that complicated, Uncle?

393
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,960
I've been studying them for 5,000 years.

394
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,390
What's your conclusion?

395
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,200
I haven't fully understood them.

396
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,390
But what should I do?

397
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,990
There is an easy solution.

398
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,510
Take her to the market

399
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:19,200
and buy her whatever she likes.

400
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,920
- Is it that simple?
- Yes, it is.

401
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:24,560
I got it.

402
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,350
I'm going right now.

403
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,630
Run.

404
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:31,960
That's great.

405
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,680
There will be another love story

406
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,200
in my
Strange Tales in the Secular World.

407
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:52,080
The consequence
of the Xilan Flower Curse.

408
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:56,040
I forgot something important.

409
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,110
(Hu Meng said
I should flirt with him bravely.)

410
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:01,720
(What is flirting?)

411
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,110
(How brave should I be?)

412
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:06,840
(It's hard.)

413
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,800
Your face has made no mistake.

414
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,390
Why are you doing this to it?

415
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:10,960
Wipe your sweat.

416
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,680
(Flirt with him bravely.)

417
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,510
(Flirt with him bravely.)

418
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,630
(Bravely...)

419
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:21,630
(Bravely?)

420
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,920
- I have something to tell you.
- I have something to tell you.

421
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,320
What do you want to tell me?

422
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,110
It's about the Qiqiao Pavilion.

423
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,840
It's not important.

424
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:35,920
I have something to tell you.

425
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,470
Go ahead.

426
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,080
I'm your destined partner!

427
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,200
Was I too direct?

428
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,320
Did I scare him?

429
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,840
Is it that hard for him to accept

430
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,350
that we are destined partners?

431
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,630
That's not right.

432
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,840
He's got a poker face.

433
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:02,270
Even if he's happy on the inside,

434
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,510
he still looks like this.

435
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,040
But,

436
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,680
he has no reaction at all.

437
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,040
That doesn't feel right.

438
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,750
Why don't you say something?

439
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,270
The most important thing now
is to find the lotus seed.

440
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,470
We'll talk about other things later.

441
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:37,230
As for the Qiqiao Pavilion,
there's no room for negotiation.

442
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,200
You can't go.

443
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,080
I must go.

444
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,510
There's no room for negotiation, either.

445
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:49,560
(I'll see how you can escape from me.)

446
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:51,920
Xueyi.

447
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:52,750
You...

448
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,040
You...

449
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:56,560
Well...

450
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:58,750
Just take whatever you like.

451
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:00,350
I'll buy you everything.

452
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:01,920
You said it.

453
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,110
Yes.

454
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:04,990
Don't regret it.

455
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:06,630
I won't.

456
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:07,600
As long as...

457
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,720
As long as you're not mad at me.

458
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,990
Forget it. I won't buy anything.

459
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:13,920
No.

460
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,080
Wait!

461
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:16,750
Stop!

462
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:17,270
Well...

463
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,470
You have to buy something.

464
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,440
Uncle said

465
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,920
you'll be happy if I buy things for you.

466
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,990
Come on,
Uncle Zi Meng is 5,000 years old,

467
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,560
and he's still single.

468
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,150
How can you trust what he says?

469
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:30,990
Xueyi!

470
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:32,750
Xueyi!

471
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:34,390
Stop there!

472
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,680
What do you want?

473
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:42,110
Just tell me you like me.

474
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,390
Is it that hard?

475
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:46,470
What a blockhead.

476
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,040
Stop following me.

477
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:00,150
Sit down and eat. I won't leave for now.

478
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,270
I don't believe you.

479
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,630
Sit down.

480
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,040
Well, are you afraid I'll poison you?

481
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,200
I'm afraid you'll put
sleeping drugs in it.

482
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:20,200
That's what you would do.

483
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,560
I can't do that.

484
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,800
Well,

485
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,960
it was a long time ago.
You're still bringing it up.

486
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,600
Besides, you didn't

487
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,630
eat the porridge.

488
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:30,560
I didn't,

489
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:33,150
but it still caused harm here.

490
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,110
Stop!

491
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:47,960
Stop!

492
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:48,990
Stop!

493
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,270
Can you put your shoes on properly?
You're too rash.

494
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,150
Well,

495
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,040
if you think I'm rash,

496
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,680
just take me with you wherever you go.

497
00:27:59,230 --> 00:27:59,630
Just like...

498
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:02,110
Like when you saved me.

499
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,440
Not this time. It's too dangerous.

500
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,350
Be good.

501
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,230
Come back.

502
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:12,110
I...

503
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,150
Don't move!

504
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:24,800
Well,

505
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,390
these are gifts for you.

506
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:29,080
We came late last night.

507
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:29,720
So,

508
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:30,720
we didn't give them to you.

509
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:35,040
There is a gift for me
when you're together.

510
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,800
Zi Meng, Hu Meng!

511
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,560
There are gifts for you!

512
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,390
Though you look silly,

513
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:43,270
you're better than Tantan.

514
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:44,920
Yeah.

515
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,750
Some people are just unsophisticated.

516
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,320
Being unsophisticated is not scary.

517
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,560
Look at Huai Meng.

518
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:54,470
What's scary
is to pretend not to hear it.

519
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,230
How does that saying go?

520
00:28:56,870 --> 00:29:00,200
You can never wake up a person
who pretends to be asleep.

521
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,750
Where's Uncle Zi Meng?
Why isn't he up yet?

522
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,960
I just went to his room
to give him the gift,

523
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,680
but he's not there.

524
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,320
Didn't you call him last night?

525
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,320
No.

526
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,680
Oh, no.

527
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,110
I got angry yesterday and went out.

528
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,350
I forgot about Uncle Zi Meng.

529
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,350
Where did he go?

530
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,800
Xueyi, don't worry.

531
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:17,840
He's a 5,000-year-old toad.

532
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:19,150
He's been forgetful lately.

533
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:20,840
I'm afraid
he might not find his way back.

534
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,960
What are we waiting for?
Go find him.

535
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:22,840
- Go find him.
- Let's go.

536
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:24,600
Tantan.

537
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:25,680
I have an urgent matter.

538
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,560
It's urgent.

539
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:26,990
Xueyi!

540
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:27,600
My goodness.

541
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:29,440
Hu Meng!

542
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,560
Mr. Cui, what's going on?

543
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:32,750
Zi Meng is lost.

544
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,470
I just saw Zi Meng resting under a tree.

545
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:36,960
I see. I'll go find him.

546
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:37,840
Wait, Mr. Cui.

547
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:40,840
Mr. Cui.

548
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,510
[Visiting Card]
This visiting card will get you

549
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,800
into the Qiqiao Pavilion.

550
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:44,960
Did you disappear for two days

551
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,510
to get this card?

552
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:47,870
Yes.

553
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:49,390
Thank you.

554
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:49,960
Wait.

555
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,320
I have a request.

556
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,720
The Qiqiao Pavilion is very dangerous.

557
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,150
Don't take Tantan with you.

558
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,110
Don't worry, I won't take her.

559
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:58,390
Thank you.

560
00:29:59,320 --> 00:29:59,870
Bring Zi Meng back.

561
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:02,920
Uncle!

562
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,080
Uncle!

563
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:05,990
Uncle!

564
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,870
Where are you, Uncle?

565
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,510
Uncle Zi Meng!

566
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,390
Uncle Zi Meng!

567
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,630
Uncle Zi Meng!

568
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,750
Uncle Zi Meng!

569
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,320
Uncle Zi Meng?

570
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,440
Uncle!

571
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:17,990
Uncle Zi Meng!

572
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:19,920
Uncle Zi Meng!

573
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,720
Uncle Zi Meng, wake up!

574
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:24,110
Huai Meng!

575
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,200
He's here!

576
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,320
Coming!

577
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:26,680
He's here!

578
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:27,960
Take a look at him.

579
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,920
Is he all right?

580
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,630
He's fine.

581
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:36,320
He just fell asleep.

582
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,150
What are you doing here?

583
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,680
How can you say that?

584
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,600
Where have you been all night?

585
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,510
We've been looking for you.

586
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,680
I had nothing to do.

587
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,800
I took a walk around and dozed off.

588
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,040
Xueyi, what's wrong?

589
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,110
I thought Uncle Zi Meng was lost.

590
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,040
I was really scared.

591
00:30:59,200 --> 00:30:59,920
It's okay, honey.

592
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,230
I'm fine.

593
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,080
Don't cry.

594
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,230
Look how well I am.

595
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:03,720
Look, Xueyi.

596
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,840
We've found him.

597
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,230
Don't cry. Good girl.

598
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,390
Oh, the smell of love.

599
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,080
Where's Cui Chen?

600
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:16,270
He went that way.

601
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,440
He left without me.

602
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,750
Take care of Uncle Zi Meng.

603
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,040
I'll go find Cui Chen.

604
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:32,870
Where's Tantan?

605
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,110
Where's Tantan?

606
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:34,990
She went that way.

607
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:35,470
That way.

608
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,440
Let's go, Uncle.

609
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:39,870
Let's go.

610
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:41,990
You're back.

611
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,510
Feng Bao.

612
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:50,870
What are you doing here?

613
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:52,470
You can't go into the Qiqiao Pavilion.

614
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,720
Mind your own business.

615
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,510
Don't forget, I'm the Lady of Wanfang.

616
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:57,750
You're just a guard.

617
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,080
You've been observing for two days.

618
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:02,390
Don't you know
how dangerous it is inside?

619
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,680
Have you been following me?

620
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:04,510
Yes.

621
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,150
You...!

622
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,870
Everyone wants to collect
all seven lotus seeds

623
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,320
to summon the power of the universe.

624
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,750
Why would they give you
the information about the lotus seeds?

625
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,510
What are you gonna give them
in exchange?

626
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:19,600
Feng Bao, it's been over 100 years.

627
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:21,080
Go home.

628
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,750
Where is it?

629
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,680
My father and sister are gone.

630
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:28,680
But I...

631
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,080
I

632
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,960
and the people of the city
have been waiting for you.

633
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,840
I've been guarding the city for you
for over 100 years.

634
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,230
It's time for you to go back

635
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,510
and take on your responsibilities
as the Lady of Wanfang.

636
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:55,800
Lian...!

637
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,040
You saw her.

638
00:32:59,150 --> 00:32:59,870
She's still alive.

639
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,200
My sister is still alive.

640
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,990
Feng Bao, come to your senses.

641
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,200
She perished in both form and spirit

642
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,230
over a hundred years ago.

643
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:08,270
That's why I must collect
all seven lotus seeds.

644
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:10,680
I want my father and my sister
to come back alive!

645

[Qiqiao Pavilion]

646
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,600
The visiting card.

647
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:24,270
The visiting card?

648
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,870
Where did you come from?

649
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:28,870
How dare you come here
without knowing about the visiting card?

650
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,800
I'm here for business too.

651
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,040
Why won't you let me in?

652
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,350
You're quite arrogant.

653
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,270
Didn't you ask around before you came?

654
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,840
Anyone who dares to intrude into
the Qiqiao Pavilion

655
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,600
without a visiting card must die!

656
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,150
Hold on.
