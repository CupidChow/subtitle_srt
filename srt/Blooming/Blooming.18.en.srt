worked his butt off.

190
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,040
He even caught a cold
and couldn't get out of bed.

191
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,560
Uncle.

192
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,400
But no one's been to see him.

193
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:51,880
Uncle.

194
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,760
What?

195
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,440
Shouldn't we defend Cui Chen...

196
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,240
Morning.

197
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,120
What are you doing here at this moment?

198
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,360
Didn't you say he caught a cold
and couldn't get out of bed?

199
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,800
Cold.

200
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,400
Poor kid.

201
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:15,640
Cui Chen.

202
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,320
Cui Chen.

203
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,080
Look.

204
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:18,880
What's wrong?

205
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,080
Why did you come at such a bad time?

206
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,000
What happened?

207
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,320
Gosh.

208
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,760
Cui Chen, you made me speechless.

209
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,480
Could the new quilt
really attract the spirit?

210
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,160
I don't know. Give it a try.

211
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,560
Cui Chen.

212
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,600
Cui Chen.

213
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:53,840
Cui Chen.

214
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,520
Tantan.

215
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,000
Don't leave me, Cui Chen.

216
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:56,680
Tantan.

217
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,680
Don't leave me.

218
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,760
What's that smell?

219
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,080
Herbal ointment.

220
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,280
The spirit made you sleep just now.

221
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,480
It was a white mist.

222
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,880
It escaped through the door.

223
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,680
How dare it stab me in the back?!

224
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,320
Go!

225
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,440
Hurry.

226
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,400
Cui Chen is running
after the white mist.

227
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:23,680
Go.

228
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,440
Tantan.

229
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,040
Cover it with your toad coat.

230
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:12,320
This is...

231
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,680
Quilt?

232
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,000
Could a quilt become a spirit
these days?

233
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,040
As far as I know, it's a succubae.

234
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,720
Probably, it's a cotton spirit.

235
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,400
Reaching a certain level,

236
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,640
it can weave itself into a quilt,

237
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,080
so that the cotton gathers
and won't fall apart.

238
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,520
You're bullying me!

239
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,320
What kind of immortal is this?

240
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,360
Immortal?

241
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,440
This little thing
is 300 years old at most.

242
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,080
In terms of seniority, I'm her ancestor.

243
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,040
You're bullying me!

244
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,360
What's going on here?

245
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,160
Has the cotton shrunk in water?

246
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,760
Stop crying.

247
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,040
Stop crying.

248
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,800
I was trying to help you,

249
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,080
but you treat me badly.

250
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,280
You're so mean!

251
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,160
Look, you've hurt me badly!

252
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,240
Though children speak the truth,

253
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,240
you should speak from your conscience.

254
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,920
Look, the whole town can't wake

255
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,760
from a long sleep because of you.

256
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,680
You call this helping them?

257
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,840
I'm trying to be nice.

258
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Why are you scolding me?

259
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,640
You're injured.

260
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,920
Let me apply medicine to your wound, OK?

261
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,760
Come with me.

262
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,600
Come on.

263
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:41,840
Little girl,

264
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,400
my name is Qiu Yuebai. What's your name?

265
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,760
Bai Diezi.

266
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,560
Bai Diezi.

267
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,280
What did you mean when you said

268
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,480
you were helping them?

269
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,520
They said it themselves.

270
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,080
They can't get out of their quilts
in the morning.

271
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,160
When they get home at night,
they flake out in bed.

272
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,480
They wish they could stay in bed
all day.

273
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,640
Some adults suffer from sleeplessness.

274
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,880
They can't sleep
even though they want to.

275
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,680
So I feel sorry for them.

276
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,360
I let them have what they want
and sleep all the time.

277
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,760
It seems that
we should really thank you.

278
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,760
What's this?

279
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:22,800
No.

280
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,120
Don't touch it.

281
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,600
Little girl, this is so beautiful.

282
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,280
May I have a look at it?

283
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:31,960
No.

284
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,240
No way.

285
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,000
May I have a look at it?

286
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,600
Lotus seed.

287
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:45,600
Well...

288
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,080
No wonder she can

289
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,160
put the whole town to sleep.

290
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,240
It turns out she has a lotus seed.

291
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,400
Baby girl,

292
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,920
who is so good

293
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,600
and can knit a quilt
at such a young age of 300 years old?

294
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,720
You're amazing.

295
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,600
Come on, let me look at...

296
00:13:59,600 --> 00:13:59,960
No.

297
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:01,640
Fine.

298
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,880
Bai Diezi,

299
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,480
where did you get this lotus seed?

300
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,200
I found it
when I was playing by the lotus pond.

301
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,200
Isn't it pretty?

302
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,080
Cutie pie,

303
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,680
this lotus seed is very important to me.

304
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,960
Would you give it to me?

305
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,960
I'll trade this for it, OK?

306
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,600
Tacky!

307
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,720
This is my second favorite thing.

308
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,160
The wimpy kid doesn't know what's what.

309
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,280
I won't give it to you anyway.

310
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,800
Kid,

311
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,240
give us the lotus seed,

312
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,880
or I'll beat you up.

313
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,280
Come on. Beat me up!

314
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:41,640
You...

315
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,920
I'm not afraid of you!

316
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,240
Wimpy kid.

317
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,160
Little girl.

318
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,400
Do you want to fly with me?

319
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,800
What's fun about flying? I can fly.

320
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,560
Wimpy kid who's never seen the sky.

321
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,120
Little girl,

322
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:56,920
I can...

323
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,800
Huai Meng, come out!

324
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,640
Say, what does it take us

325
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,880
to get the lotus seed?

326
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,040
You play with me.

327
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,080
You play with me!

328
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,960
Throw the hankie.

329
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,840
Throw the hankie.

330
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,080
Tantan, why don't you come and catch me?

331
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,840
Tantan, come and catch me.

332
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,640
Bai Diezi,

333
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,720
we've been playing with you all night.

334
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,680
It's light already.

335
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,800
Why don't you leave us alone?

336
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,920
No. I want to play.

337
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,640
Honey, we can't play anymore.

338
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,560
Last night,

339
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,120
I've been playing your son.

340
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,080
Let's stop playing.

341
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,400
I've missed my beauty sleep.

342
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,160
You...

343
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,880
You play with me.

344
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,960
The kid is a tough nut to crack.

345
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,720
Listen to me, your...

346
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,440
Don't touch it.

347
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,080
Bai Diezi,

348
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,240
I'm super good at playing chess.

349
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,520
What's fun about chess?

350
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,760
It's boring when adults play chess.

351
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,600
Bai Diezi.

352
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,200
Sandbag!

353
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,680
I saw kids playing with sandbags,

354
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,120
but they wouldn't play with me.

355
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,800
Let's play with Tantan, OK?

356
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,160
OK.

357
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,960
Come on.

358
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,480
I'm joining you.

359
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,960
You're so boring.

360
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,440
I don't want to play with you.

361
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,120
Sir.

362
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,120
Sachets.

363
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,880
Sachets for sale.

364
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,560
Here you are.

365
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:41,960
Look,

366
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,800
after you take back
your spiritual power,

367
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,360
everyone is back to their normal lives.

368
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,040
It's great, isn't it?

369
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,400
I want this.

370
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,800
Do you want this?

371
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,400
How much for one?

372
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,080
Two coins.

373
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,920
It's OK. Give me.

374
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,880
Here you are.

375
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,280
Be careful. It's hot.

376
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,680
I want a string of candied haws.

377
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,280
Bai Diezi,

378
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,480
you've got a drumstick in your hands.

379
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,520
Can you still eat the candied haws?

380
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,600
Yes, I won't get stuffed.

381
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,080
Really?

382
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,320
I'll get some.

383
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,000
Sir, two strings.

384
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:09,920
OK.

385
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,600
How much for one string?

386
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,800
Two coins.

387
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,080
OK.

388
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:12,800
Bai Diezi,

389
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,600
since Yuebai bought you candied haws,

390
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,840
could you give this to us?

391
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,150
No.

392
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:24,350
Yuebai, she's bullying me again.

393
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,800
She's just kidding.

394
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,480
Here you are.

395
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,000
Tantan.

396
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,080
Tantan, have a try.

397
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,080
It's sweet.

398
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,440
Look at this happy family.

399
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,920
They're all good-looking.

400
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,880
It's too late to be envious.

401
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,000
Besides,

402
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,840
we can't be born again.

403
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,720
Shut up if you can't speak properly.

404
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,520
How do you like it? Is it sweet?

405
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,200
Yes.

406
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,760
It's all over your lips.

407
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,960
Tantan, it's fun over there.

408
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,960
Let's go over there.

409
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,040
Tantan, let's go.

410
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:06,920
Ignore him.

411
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:08,960
Let's go.

412
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,720
It's fun over there.

413
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:14,920
Tantan.

414
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,560
How long are you going to be mad at me?

415
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,320
Tantan, don't mind him.

416
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:20,960
Let's go.

417
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,000
Don't leave me

418
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,080
or go with this bad man.

419
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:25,600
What a heartless woman.

420
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,040
Look at this cheating woman.

421
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,160
She's already had a daughter.

422
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,000
No. Let me explain.

423
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,720
It's not what you're thinking.

424
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,040
The little girl is crying.

425
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,320
You stalked me?

426
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,800
Let me explain.

427
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:44,920
Don't go.

428
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,160
There, there. Don't cry.

429
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,320
You guys go first.

430
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,440
Give us a minute.

431
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,200
Don't go.

432
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,720
Here you are.

433
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,360
Thanks.

434
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:58,760
Tantan.

435
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,600
Let's bury the hatchet.

436
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,080
What happened before was my fault.

437
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,400
Your fault?

438
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,520
What was your fault?

439
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,760
Putting a tracker on me

440
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,040
or using me as a substitute?

441
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,280
I admit

442
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,080
that when I first met you,

443
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,400
I thought you were Lian Wen.

444
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,600
But the more I spend time with you,

445
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,120
the more I realize

446
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,440
that you two are completely different.

447
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,360
Every day I'm with you,

448
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,080
I've never thought of you as her.

449
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,760
I swear.

450
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:35,760
I don't believe it.

451
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,400
Tantan,

452
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,000
I'm sorry.

453
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,000
It was all my fault.

454
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,000
I can't change what happened.

455
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,040
But let bygones be bygones.

456
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:57,920
At present,

457
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,240
in the future,

458
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,640
you're the only one in my heart.

459
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,840
You're the only one

460
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,760
I love, Zhao Tantan.

461
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,680
Tantan, this piece of tangram
is too lonely.

462
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,560
Would you reunite it with the other six?

463
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,080
It's not that easy

464
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,480
to reunite the tangram.

465
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,360
We'll see after we get the lotus seeds.

466
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,160
OK.

467
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,520
As long as you forgive me,
I'll do whatever you want.

468
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,480
Walk slowly.

469
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,400
Be careful.

470
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:52,920
Here.

471
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:53,840
Yeah.

472
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,480
Naughty girl, you scared me.

473
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,040
Yuebai, were you upset

474
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,520
because of Tantan?

475
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,320
Why do you know everything?

476
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,960
Because I care about you.

477
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,040
You're the best to me.

478
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:20,760
Really?

479
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,560
Yuebai, how I wish you and Tantan

480
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,800
were my parents!

481
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,000
I've never seen them.

482
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,120
Bai Diezi, it's OK.

483
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,480
Now you have me, right?

484
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,160
In fact, I've also
lost my mom since I was a child.

485
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,720
We're fellow sufferers.

486
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:41,840
It's OK.

487
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,640
Yuebai,

488
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:44,760
let me help you.

489
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,440
Help me?

490
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,040
How do you do that?

491
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,760
I'll steal Tantan for you.

492
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,360
You two can be my dad and mom.

493
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,240
That way, we both have a family.

494
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,520
You're full of wicked ideas.

495
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,600
Wanna play a little longer?

496
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,440
Yes.

497
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:01,880
Go.

498
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,200
Be careful.

499
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,160
Walk carefully.

500
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,080
Uncle,

501
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,480
how do I coax a little girl?

502
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,000
I can manage with older ones.

503
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,600
But I don't have any experience
with little girls.

504
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:23,920
Ask him.

505
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,160
Uncle,

506
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,400
my Xueyi is different from Tantan.

507
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,960
She's smart, kind and gentle.

508
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,520
She's easy to coax.

509
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,080
Not Tantan. I'm talking about Bai Diezi.

510
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,240
Bai Diezi?

511
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,880
She is little indeed.

512
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,040
I tell you what,

513
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,880
I'll look it up
in the Strange Tales in the Secular World,

514
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:42,800
OK?

515
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:00,840
Here it is.

516
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,240
(To make a child happy,)

517
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,000
(use food.)

518
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,520
(It should be tasty)

519
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,080
(as well as cute and pretty.)

520
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,080
Bai Diezi.

521
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:12,720
Bai Diezi.

522
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,640
It's time for breakfast.

523
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,520
Why is it you?

524
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,080
Where is Yuebai?

525
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,200
Why is your voice hoarse?

526
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,320
Don't touch me.

527
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,960
I know you don't like Yuebai.

528
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,640
So I don't like you either.

529
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,040
I'm going to find Yuebai.

530
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:31,960
Look.

531
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,960
Why don't you eat?

532
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,840
It will get cold.

533
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,280
(How can I be bribed so easily?)

534
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,680
(I'm going to help Yuebai.)

535
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,120
(Piggy buns, when Yuebai and Tantan
become my parents,)

536
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,320
(I'll come back to eat you.)

537
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,240
This is a piggy bun.

538
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,160
Don't you like it?

539
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,120
This is a little hedgehog bun.

540
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,360
Since you don't like them,

541
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,280
I'd better give them to someone else.

542
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:03,800
No.

543
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,320
I'll give them to Uncle Zi Meng.

544
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,200
Here.

545
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,040
Yuebai hasn't brushed my teeth,

546
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,640
washed my face and combed my hair yet.

547
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,800
I can't eat now.

548
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,040
Go get him for me.

549
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,480
You don't need him. I can help you.

550
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,880
Come on.

551
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,560
(The second step
of coaxing a little girl,)

552
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,600
(make her pretty by all means.)

553
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,840
Can you do it or not?

554
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,440
If you can't, go get Yuebai.

555
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,280
I'm in a rush to have breakfast.

556
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,920
Don't doubt me. I can make it.

557
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,080
I can do much better than Qiu Yuebai.

558
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,000
What's wrong?

559
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,600
Yuebai, Tantan,

560
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,280
he's so clumsy.

561
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,520
He made my hair ugly.

562
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,480
I didn't.

563
00:25:59,200 --> 00:25:59,640
It's OK.

564
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,600
Let's ignore this clumsy man,

565
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,280
OK?

566
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:03,920
OK.

567
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,760
Yuebai, would you brush my hair?

568
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,080
OK.

569
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,440
Go.

570
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,400
Go.

571
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,680
Tantan, I want to eat
while having my hair combed.

572
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,640
Clumsy.

573
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,000
OK.

574
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,400
You clever little thing.

575
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,080
Why do you have so many ideas?

576
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,800
Is it flying high?

577
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,680
It's high.

578
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,120
I want it to be higher.

579
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:27,720
Higher?

580
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,880
Bai Diezi, I'll give it to you.

581
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:29,920
You mustn't lose it.

582
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,880
Let me try.

583
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,560
Ready?

584
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,240
This.

585
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,400
Here.

586
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,040
- Cui Chen.
- What's this?

587
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:40,800
Peaches.

588
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,840
(Tantan doesn't like Yuebai.)

589
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,080
(I must find a way to help him.)

590
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,760
Let's clean these peaches.

591
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:52,800
Tantan,

592
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,720
don't you want my lotus seed?

593
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,400
Bai Diezi, why are you talking

594
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,680
about the lotus seed suddenly?

595
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,560
Don't get us wrong.

596
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,880
We do

597
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,880
want this lotus seed.

598
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,960
But we also like you

599
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,080
and want to play with you.

600
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,600
I know you are good to me.

601
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,000
I like you too.

602
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,000
Yuebai likes you too.

603
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,440
If you agree to be with Yuebai,

604
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,880
I'll give you the lotus seed as a gift.

605
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,400
That way the three of us

606
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,880
will be together all the time.

607
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,800
Bai Diezi, listen to me.

608
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,080
You're a little girl.
You don't know about relationships.

609
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,800
You can't be with someone
just because you want to.

610
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,720
Adults always make simple things

611
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,800
complicated.

612
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,160
We've had so much fun these days.

613
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,040
I want Yuebai to be my father
and you to be my mother.

614
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,040
That would be great!

615
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,320
Bai Diezi,

616
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,520
I can be your father too.

617
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,040
Yes, you can.

618
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,040
Look, good girl.

619
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,000
I didn't care for you in vain.

620
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,160
But you can only be my godfather.

621
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,080
I didn't tell her to say that.

622
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,520
Yeah. It has nothing to do with Yuebai.

623
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,760
It's my own idea.

624
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,440
Am I not as good to you
as Qiu Yuebai is?

625
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,760
No bad guy is as good as my father.

626
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,880
You just can't.

627
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:22,960
Why can't I?

628
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:23,960
Today I must let you...

629
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,880
Enough.

630
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,880
Why are you arguing with a kid?

631
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,640
I think it's a good idea.

632
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,840
An innocent child
is the best judge of human nature.

633
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,000
She knows who's good to her.

634
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,040
That's right.

635
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,800
Isn't a godfather a father?

636
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,040
Senior Mu Bai,
why are you so calculating?

637
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,680
An innocent child is easy to be fooled.

638
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:42,720
Mr. Qiu,

639
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,120
you don't think that if you
use the lotus seed as a threat,

640
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,680
Tantan will give in, do you?

641
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,000
Mr. Qiu, how could you do that?

642
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,240
Xueyi, cut it out.

643
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,160
Why can't I say it?

644
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,920
Don't talk bad about Yuebai!

645
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:55,560
Don't!

646
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,120
Enough.

647
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,000
Stop arguing.

648
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:58,920
Come here.

649
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,120
Bai Diezi, listen to me carefully.

650
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,240
I just think of Yuebai

651
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,280
as a friend.

652
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,520
It won't change.

653
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,240
If you must

654
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,960
ask me to be with him,

655
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,320
I won't accept your lotus seed.

656
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,360
Tantan.

657
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,040
Tantan.

658
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,600
Tantan.

659
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,040
Tantan, don't go.

660
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,160
What's wrong with Qiu Yuebai?

661
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,000
How could he use a child?

662
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,480
Exactly.

663
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,400
Bro, I'm telling you,

664
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,960
you're in trouble.

665
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,080
If you don't get the lotus seed,

666
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:34,680
then

667
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,240
Tantan won't make up with you.

668
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,280
But Bai Diezi was right about one thing.

669
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,720
Adults always make things complicated.

670
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,480
As long as Tantan likes Cui Chen,

671
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,400
whether he gets the lotus seed or not,

672
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,240
Tantan will make up with him.

673
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,400
Is it really that simple?

674
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,760
It won't be that simple.

675
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,400
Believe me,

676
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,920
Qiu Yuebai won't stop so easily.

677
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,120
Gosh.

678
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,360
Uncle,

679
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,360
how many women have you dated
in your 5,000 years of life?

680
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,160
Properly speaking,

681
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,680
I've had about 50 true loves.

682
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,200
Why are you asking me this?

683
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,440
Gosh, Uncle,

684
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,440
I know you too well.

685
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,600
Bro, don't be afraid.

686
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,680
You mustn't give up on Tantan.

687
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,880
Don't let her go easily.

688
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,120
Go straight to her

689
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,080
and say what's on your mind.

690
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,080
You know what,

691
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,880
though she likes you now,

692
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,640
she may dislike you

693
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,040
and be disappointed in you at any time.

694
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,040
Who hasn't been in a relationship?

695
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,960
But I agree with you on this.

696
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,360
The best defense is offense.

697
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,680
Let's be patient, OK?

698
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,000
A long delay means many hitches.

699
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,600
He must act fast.

700
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,520
Bro, you must listen to me and Hu Meng.

701
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,120
You must listen to me.

702
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,880
- Listen to us.
- Listen to me.

703
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:40,960
Listen to us.

704
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,960
I'm telling you, he must listen to us.

705
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,520
Do you know
how many times I've been dumped?

706
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,120
You deserve it.

707
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,520
What's wrong?

708
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,480
Something on your mind?

709
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,080
I'm sorry.

710
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,680
Did I wake you up?

711
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,520
No.

712
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,160
I woke up when I turned over.

713
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,160
You're worrying about something.

714
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,160
Why don't you tell me?

715
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:30,960
I may give you some advice.

716
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,600
Actually, it wasn't me.

717
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,880
It's a friend of mine.

718
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,200
Classic beginning.

719
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:43,800
No.

720
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,680
She's really a friend of mine.

721
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,400
OK, a friend of yours.

722
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,200
Then what?

723
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,360
This friend of mine

724
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,160
met someone earlier.

725
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,520
A man?

726
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,920
At first,

727
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,480
she thought this guy was nasty.

728
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,600
He had better magic arts than her,

729
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,600
better perception than her,

730
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,880
and constantly bullied her.

731
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,640
But then she realized

732
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,240
that whenever she was in danger,

733
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,120
that guy always stepped forward.

734
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,520
He seemed to be good to her.

735
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,160
Then...

736
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,960
Then they got together.

737
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,720
But...

738
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,240
But they broke up afterwards?

739
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,680
Because I...

740
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,960
No, the friend of mine.

741
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,720
She realized one day

742
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,400
that all that guy had done for her

743
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,480
was because she looked like

744
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,760
his ex-girlfriend.

745
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,200
Then she started quarreling with him.

746
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,640
But it didn't work out.

747
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,440
Does it bore you?

748
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,240
No.

749
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,200
I'm not bored.

750
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,320
So,

751
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,960
do you still like him?

752
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:08,670
I...

753
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,440
I suppose so.

754
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,710
How could you trick me?

755
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,960
I didn't.

756
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,000
Sit down.

757
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,320
Let me give you some real advice.

758
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,750
What did he tell you?

759
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:33,520
He said he never thought of me
as a substitute.

760
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,080
But I don't feel good about it.

761
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,880
I feel jealous.

762
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:41,880
You feel jealous
because you don't trust him.

763
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,040
Because he isn't doing the right thing.

764
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,160
You'd better forget about the man

765
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,230
who treats you like a substitute.

766
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,880
Such kind of man
doesn't deserve to live.

767
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,440
OK.

768
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,520
Don't be mad.

769
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,480
Don't be mad.

770
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,720
I recalled my best friend.

771
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,640
She sacrificed her life

772
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,800
because of a man.

773
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,480
I won't allow you
to make the same mistake.

774
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,480
By the way,

775
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,960
I always carry this jade pendant
with me.

776
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,240
It means a lot to me.

777
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,360
I want you to have it.

778
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:21,680
No.

779
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,800
It's precious to you.

780
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,440
I can't take it.

781
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,080
Don't you consider me a good friend?

782
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,320
I do.

783
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,960
Then put it on.

784
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,240
Thank you.

785
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,200
Tantan,

786
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,360
have you ever considered other men?

787
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,440
Other men?

788
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:52,680
Like

789
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,600
Qiu Yuebai?

790
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,320
I've been observing him
over the past few days.

791
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,600
I think he has a good character
and career.

792
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,840
And he risked his life

793
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,120
to save you in the quicksand pit.

794
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,880
Above all,

795
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,960
I think he loves you with all his heart.

796
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,040
But, I...

797
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,480
But I don't love him.

798
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,720
You can spend more time
bonding with him.

799
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,160
You can try to accept him.

800
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:20,840
I...

801
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,560
Don't rush into any decisions.

802
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,640
Think it over.
