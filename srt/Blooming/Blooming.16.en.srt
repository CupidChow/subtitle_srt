[Episode 16]

16
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,190
Qiu Yuebai?

17
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:43,800
Are you here for noodles too?

18
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:45,590
I'm just passing by.

19
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,680
A group of Hu merchants
came from the west.

20
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,800
I’m going to visit them.

21
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,680
Would you like to come with me?

22
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,080
Let's go.

23
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,400
But what about the noodles?

24
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,510
We won't get our turn

25
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,630
for another hour.

26
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,720
Let's go and have a look.

27
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,120
Girls all like jewelry.

28
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,400
Let's go.

29
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,360
- Hurry.
- Go.

30
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,630
If you don't bring this soup to Cui Chen,

31
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,910
it'll boil away.

32
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,440
He already ate what I cooked yesterday.

33
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,110
I still have a lot left.

34
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,320
Would you like to try it?

35
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,160
You're such a diligent
and perfect girlfriend.

36
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,630
You made two pots of porridge a night.

37
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,720
Cui Chen just said he's not feeling well

38
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,830
and wants to sleep early.

39
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,600
I think

40
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:42,520
as a cultivator
with such profound attainments,

41
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,240
if he's not feeling well,

42
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,270
it must be because

43
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,240
the wound he got at the Qiqiao Pavilion
hasn't recovered yet.

44
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,240
So I adjusted my recipe.

45
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,550
I hope it'll help him to recover.

46
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,630
I can't stand you being lovey-dovey.

47
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,830
I'm going to bed.

48
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,190
Have some porridge first.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,750
No, thanks.

50
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,600
It stinks of love.

51
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,190
How long will it take to get there?

52
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,600
Where are you going to meet?

53
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,520
We're almost there.

54
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,520
Who's that?

00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,080
This...

Senior Mu Bai?

57
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,670
No way.

58
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,750
He is with Tantan at the Yunlai Inn.

59
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,800
It can't be him.

60
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,960
I'm a pigeon.

61
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,320
With my clairvoyance,

62
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,000
how could I mistake him
for someone else?

63
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,910
Tantan.

64
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:35,880
Tantan.

65
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,670
Tantan.

66
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,550
Tantan.

67
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,390
Why are you here?

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,600
What's going on?

69
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:42,630
Well...

70
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,800
Tantan, do you know
where Senior Mu Bai is?

71
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,160
In his room.

72
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,390
He said he wasn't feeling well,

73
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,390
so he went to bed early.

74
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:52,550
Well...

75
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,880
Tantan,

76
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,240
we just saw

77
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,000
Senior Mu Bai

78
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,520
flying over to a lotus courtyard.

79
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,190
It must be a mistake.

80
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:01,960
It's true.

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,600
We even asked around.

82
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,750
Guess who I saw?

83
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,190
Who?

84
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,000
The owner of the Shihua Pavilion

85
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,910
who looks just like you.

86
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,550
Tantan.

87
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,350
- Tantan.
- Tantan.

88
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,320
Well...

89
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,230
You stay here.

90
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,550
You have to look after Uncle Zi Meng.

91
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,510
You stay. I'll go.

92
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,480
No.

93
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,230
Xueyi.

94
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,600
You must be careful.

95
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,880
I know.

96
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,720
Xueyi.

97
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,270
Tell me if anyone bullies you.

98
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,550
I'll beat them up.

99
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,040
Watch me...

100
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,760
Chill out.

101
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,480
Tantan, Mr. Cui must have his reason

102
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,760
to come here late at night.

103
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,720
I believe in Cui Chen's moral quality

104
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,790
and his loyalty to me.

105
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,510
I'm sure he won't fool around.

106
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,480
Whatever it is,

107
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,550
he shouldn't have come out

108
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,390
to meet another girl at midnight
without telling you.

109
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,350
There must be something
he can't tell me.

110
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:14,950
I think the courtyard
is quite secretive.

111
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,830
Possibly,
Lian Rong invited Mr. Cui over.

112
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,110
What does Lian Rong have

113
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,950
to tell Senior Mu Bai privately?

114
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,040
A man and a woman meet secretly
in the middle of the night.

115
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,350
I'm going to see

116
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,880
what they are talking about.

117
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,350
I asked you to come here alone.

118
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,160
I hope you don't mind.

119
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,880
Please cut to the chase.

120
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,000
Sir, don't you think I look familiar?

121
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,350
What do you mean?

122
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,000
I often dream of Mr. Cui.

123
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,640
In my dreams, we're very close.

124
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,040
But the girl with you

125
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,390
looks just like me.

126
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,270
So I dare not tell you everything

127
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,160
for fear of jeopardizing
your relationship.

128
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,110
You say we are very close.

129
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,550
How close we are exactly?

130
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,110
I want to know

131
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,480
what's your relationship with that girl.

132
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,600
She is my junior.

133
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:25,720
What a coincidence.

134
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,720
In my dreams,

135
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,480
we are also a senior and a junior.

136
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,720
I often dream about practicing with you

137
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,230
in a mountain where there is a pond.

138
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,640
We've discovered a secret place
in the back of the mountain.

139
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,880
Sir, you've planted
a pond of lotuses for me.

140
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,320
Have you forgotten?

141
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,440
You said I couldn't run away

142
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,790
if I wore it.

143
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,350
Red string.

144
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,320
Lotus pond.

145
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,950
I think I've seen them before.

146
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,320
Once you put the destiny string on,

147
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,950
you can't run away.

148
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,390
(Why is this red string)

149
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,510
(exactly the same
as the one in my dream?)

150
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,040
(Wasn't that my dream?)

151
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,110
(But why did I dream)

152
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,760
(about Cui Chen and this woman?)

153
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:35,160
In my dreams,
we often sneak down the mountain,

154
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,920
catch demons,

155
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,720
and pick lotus seedpods together.

156
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,880
But you don't have that thing

157
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,510
on your forehead in my dreams.

158
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,200
I remember you told me

159
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,600
that you would always be there for me

160
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,600
and never betray me.

161
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,480
Even if the whole world opposed me,

162
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,200
you would still be there for me.

163
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,110
But why are you so cruel to me
in the end?

164
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,880
Enough. Stop it.

165
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,670
So these are not my dreams, right?

166
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,720
These are our past.

167
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,040
Tantan,

168
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,920
wait for a while.

169
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,320
Let's see what Mr. Cui will do.

170
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,600
You invited me over

171
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,320
and told me about your dreams.

172
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,000
What do you want me to do?

173
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,880
Take me away.

174
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,150
We can start over.

175
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,230
Tantan.

176
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,400
Tomorrow we'll return
to the Qingyuan Sect together.

177
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,840
The little spirits in the Lotus Realm

178
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,590
will be happy to see you.

179
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:17,840
OK.

180
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,110
I haven't seen them for a long time.

181
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,000
Red lotus flowers
bloom gracefully in the water.

182
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,670
Don't you remember?

183
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,350
I've lost my memory.

184
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,790
I can't remember many things.

185
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,400
And my memory is fragmented.

186
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,320
Tantan, given Mr. Cui's reaction,

187
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,590
was Lian Rong telling the truth?

188
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,080
They...

189
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,790
They did have a relationship.

190
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,840
And they were very close.

191
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,320
More than that.

192
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,230
In my opinion, Lian Rong

193
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,960
is the woman Cui Chen used to love.

194
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,110
Didn't you see them

195
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,350
hugging each other?

196
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,080
Would you stop?

197
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,760
I can't believe it.

198
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,030
Lian Rong looks exactly like me.

199
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,960
She knows so much
about the Qingyuan Sect.

200
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,080
And she...

201
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,200
She also has a thing for Cui Chen.

202
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,080
I think Cui Chen

203
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,200
is using you as a substitute.

204
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:50,110
Tantan, I didn't mean
to call you a substitute.

205
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,520
Tantan,

206
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,350
though it's not right for Mr. Cui
to meet someone he loves

207
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,350
behind your back,

208
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:56,840
I believe

209
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,520
he has real feelings for you.

210
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,760
Tantan, no matter what happens,

211
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,110
I'm on your side.

212
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,350
Tantan.

213
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:10,960
There, there.

214
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,320
Don't be sad.

215
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,880
You've done a good job tonight.

216
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,960
Master said
you could proceed to step two.

217
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,280
Put him at ease.

218
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,110
Everything is under my control.

219
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,550
Be careful and stick to the plan.

220
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,150
If Cui Chen gets suspicious
and the plan fails,

221
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,440
the consequences will be severe.

222
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,440
What will happen?

223
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,030
Will he kill me?

224
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:37,880
Don't go too far.

225
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,280
Have a guess.

226
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,510
This time, how sincere

227
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,190
is your master to Zhao Tantan?

228
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,120
It's none of your business.

229
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,320
Mind your own business.

230
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,150
Remember,
don't hurt Miss Zhao by mistake.

231
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,590
Cui Chen has profound attainments.
Be careful.

232
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,480
Did you say that
on behalf of your master

233
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,750
or yourself?

234
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,920
Look out for yourself.

235
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,510
Why are you up so early?

236
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,240
You stayed up late cooking soup.

237
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,510
Why don't you get more sleep?

238
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,240
Did you sleep well last night?

239
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,360
I slept well
after eating the soup you cooked.

240
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,750
My stomach was warm all night.

241
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:50,920
So,

242
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,480
is it my soup

243
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,590
or Lian Rong's sweet talk
that tastes better?

244
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,590
Do you want me to help you recall

245
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,630
where you were last night?

246
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,320
Yes, I went to see Lian Rong last night

247
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,070
and investigate something in passing.

248
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,590
What kind of thing?

249
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,240
I haven't found out about it.

250
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:24,750
But I'll let you know

251
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,320
as soon as I find out.

252
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,440
You must trust me.

253
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,560
Trust?

254
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,240
How can I trust you?

255
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,560
Was the so-called investigation

256
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,750
the passionate hours
you spent with Lian Rong?

257
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,120
Were you in the courtyard last night?

258
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,190
Yes, I saw you clearly

259
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,560
and heard you loud and clear.

260
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,800
Who took you there?

261
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,630
Qiu Yuebai?

262
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,270
He had nothing to do with it.
Don't change the subject.

263
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,070
Do you know Lian Rong for a long time?

264
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:59,070
No.

265
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,000
So...

266
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,150
Are you saying

267
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,950
what Lian Rong said last night
was a lie?

268
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:07,680
No either.

269
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,630
Neither this nor that.

270
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,000
What are you hiding from me?

271
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,680
I haven't found out what's going on yet.

272
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,630
Lian Rong's purpose
and identity are unclear.

273
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,480
It's dangerous for you
to get involved too early.

274
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,920
Give me a few more days.

275
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:20,880
Trust me.

276
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,880
I'll give you
a satisfactory explanation.

277
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,040
Fine.

278
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,800
Let me ask you one last question.

279
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,510
Go ahead.

280
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:39,440
If I ask you to leave Yunlai Town
with me

281
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,360
and never see Lian Rong again,
will you agree?

282
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,510
Give me one last day.

283
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,950
This isn't just about my past.

284
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,270
It's about you, too.

285
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,120
You've already answered me.

286
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,560
Xueyi,
let's go back to the Qingyuan Sect.

287
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,360
Tantan, what's going on
between you and Cui Chen?

288
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,190
Nothing.

289
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,360
You must have a misunderstanding.

290
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,880
The worst thing in a relationship

291
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,950
is to break up
whenever you disagree with each other.

292
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:10,510
Meng,
there's something you may not know.

293
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,590
I've asked Qiu Yuebai

294
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,190
about what happened last night.

295
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,240
Tantan, listen to me.

296
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,070
If you decide to be together,

297
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,510
you must trust each other.

298
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:19,920
How can you walk away

299
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,070
without a word saying?

300
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,360
At least
give him a chance to explain.

301
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,390
I gave him a chance

302
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,440
to explain yesterday.

303
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,070
He didn't appreciate it.

304
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,880
Perhaps he doesn't feel the need.

305
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,390
Tantan, listen to me.

306
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,830
He is true to you.

307
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,270
If you walk away now,

308
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,270
you'll regret it.

309
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,830
I won't regret it.

310
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,480
Would my true love lie to me
over and over again?

311
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:43,830
But Cui Chen has blossomed

312
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,320
since he met you, Tantan.

313
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,750
Who knows if he's bloomed

314
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,750
because of me or my face?

315
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,630
Gosh.

316
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,070
Uncle,

317
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,040
what is Tantan talking about?

318
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,830
I don't understand a word.

319
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,630
I don't either.

320
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,120
Tantan.

321
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,240
Tantan, something happened.

322
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,920
Cui Chen is running away with Lian Rong.

323
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,200
How do you know?

324
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,320
The news has got about.

325
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,390
It says that Lian Rong,
the owner of the Shihua Pavilion,

326
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,350
sold her property cheaply for love

327
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,560
and is going to elope with Cui Chen

328
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:09,920
to live a life of leisure.

329
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,870
Mr. Cui,

330
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,750
what are you doing here?

331
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,840
Lian Rong, you've sold

332
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,150
your property so quickly.

333
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,630
Have you long planned to elope with me?

334
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,800
Thanks to the help of my regular guests,

335
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,150
I was able to get rid of it quickly.

336
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,080
In that case, let's hit the road.

337
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,750
Let's go south.

338
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,200
I hear it's like spring
all the year round there.

339
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,110
I've always wanted to go there.

340
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,800
No, let's go back to the Qingyuan Sect.

341
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,960
Tantan, they're selling their property.

342
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,440
They even asked the Seven Nights Inn
to value it.

343
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:47,800
Well.

344
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,150
They have their own lives.

345
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,630
It's none of my business.

346
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,350
Hu Meng,

347
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,470
do you have to be on Cui Chen's side?

348
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,440
As an outsider,

349
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,350
I'm not in a position
to judge your relationship.

350
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,840
But Tantan,

351
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,350
before you leave,

352
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,560
I hope you'll think it over.

353
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,230
Let's put the fact
that you and Lian Rong are not related

354
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,510
but look the same aside.

355
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,990
It's not the first time
we've come to Yunlai Town.

356
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,680
How come we've never

357
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,840
heard of Lian Rong before?

358
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,320
Isn't it too early

359
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,630
to meet your master?

360
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,040
That's true.

361
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,150
I once had a junior sister

362
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,110
who looked exactly like you

363
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,990
and even had a temper a bit like yours.

364
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:30,600
But...

365
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,150
But I hurt her.

366
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,870
Then she left deeply hurt.

367
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,040
I've been looking for her.

368
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,320
But I hadn't heard from her
for over 100 years

369
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,560
until

370
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,600
I met you.

371
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,960
Not to mention the fact
that you guys unexpectedly found out

372
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,720
about Lian Rong
and Cui Chen's secret meeting.

373
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,390
It's just too much of a coincidence.

374
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,680
What do you mean?

375
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:03,320
I'm worried that Cui Chen is in danger.

376
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,350
Lian Wen,

377
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,920
will you forgive me?

378
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,350
Cui Chen, I will forgive you.

379
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,630
Wherever you go, I'll go with you.

380
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,750
We'll never be apart again.

381
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,390
It's none of my business
if he's in danger.

382
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,320
You guys get out. I want to be quiet.

383
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:35,560
You go out first.

384
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:36,840
Leave.

385
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:40,680
Tantan.

386
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,750
Stop talking.

387
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,390
I said I want to be quiet.

388
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,080
Why are you so hard on yourself?

389
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,150
I'll take you to him right now

390
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,150
and ask for an explanation.

391
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,200
Why do you expose yourself so soon?

392
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,470
You do know a lot about me and Lian Wen.

393
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,840
Your tempers are a bit alike, too.

394
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,960
You've also learned about her tastes.

395
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,720
Still, you narrowly lost to me.

396
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,040
Very clever, Mu Bai Zhenren.

397
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,470
You're after
more than the lotus seed, right?

398
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,350
You know much about me and Lian Wen.

399
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,990
Who told you?

400
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,080
Have a guess.

401
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,320
Cui Chen,

402
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,320
am I not pretty?

403
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,270
Why don't you come and lie with me?

404
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,440
You can't fool me
with the illusion trick.

405
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,110
Help me, Cui Chen.

406
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,960
Kill her!

407
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,600
Kill her!

408
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,470
Kill her!

409
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,630
Help me.

410
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,350
There's an evil aura.

411
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:13,110
Tantan,

412
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,870
first Lian Rong, now the evil aura.

413
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,990
The situation is complicated in there.

414
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,150
Is it worth risking your life
for this liar?

415
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,920
No matter
what feelings Cui Chen has for me,

416
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,230
even if we're just fellow disciples,

417
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,720
I can't sit by

418
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,110
and watch him in danger.

419
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:50,750
Mr. Cui.

420
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,630
Cui Chen.

421
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,390
Cui Chen.

422
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:03,870
Cui Chen.

423
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,040
There's something wrong with Lian Rong.

424
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,560
Don't let her fool you.

425
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,720
Cui Chen.

426
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,350
Can't you hear me?

427
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:09,960
Are you cold?

428
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,080
Cui Chen, can you hear me? Cui Chen.

429
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,720
Cui Chen!

430
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,720
Kill her!

431
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,230
Kill her!

432
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:31,990
Kill her!

433
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,960
Master.

434
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,720
Kill her!

435
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,320
Cui Chen!

436
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,630
Kill her!

437
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:41,750
How could the Qingyuan Sect

438
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,230
take a lotus spirit as its disciple?

439
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,840
The guardian of the Seven-Leaf Lotus

440
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,720
is in league with a lotus spirit!

441
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,350
The Seven-Leaf Lotus is lost

442
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,630
must be because
you collude with the lotus spirit

443
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,870
to take it for your own
and plague the world.

444
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:54,750
Today,

445
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,350
the Qingyuan Sect
must give us an explanation!

446
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,470
Give us an explanation!

447
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,350
The guardian of the Seven-Leaf Lotus
and the lotus spirit?

448
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,720
Who are you exactly?

449
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,990
I'm your Lian Wen.

450
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:05,800
Cui Chen.

451
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:06,800
Cui Chen.

452
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,270
Lian Wen?

453
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,040
This Lian Rong seems to be fake.

454
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,630
Mr. Cui loves Lian Wen the most.

455
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,350
You look exactly like Lian Wen.

456
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,750
No wonder Mr. Cui cares a lot about you.

457
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,600
So, even if it starts over,
you'll still kill me.

458
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,270
Shut up!

459
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:26,840
Tantan!

460
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,200
Kill her!

461
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:44,600
Cui Chen!

462
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,840
Why did you lie to me, Cui Chen?

463
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,350
I never want to see you again.

464
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,920
Cui Chen!

465
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:53,840
Tantan.

466
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,320
Cui Chen!

467
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,720
Zhao Tantan.

468
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:31,600
I never thought
that after all these years,

469
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,600
Cui Chen still couldn't forget
this face.

470
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,390
Shut up!

471
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,200
You're just impersonating Lian Wen.

472
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,320
Does it matter whether I'm real or not?

473
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,510
What you saw in the illusion
was all true.

474
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,320
So, is my face working?

475
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,270
Is Cui Chen good to you?

476
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:54,150
You don't deserve this face!

477
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:14,990
Tantan.

478
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,080
Tantan!

479
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,040
Qiu!

480
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,720
How is Qiu?

481
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,560
Gosh, it's weird.

482
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,680
I heard you had a fierce fight.

483
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,350
Why is Mr. Qiu only slightly injured?

484
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,680
Perhaps she was too injured

485
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,270
to strike a deadly blow,

486
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:04,920
so I escaped narrowly.

487
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:18,390
Qiu, luckily you are not seriously hurt.

488
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,350
Otherwise, I'd be sorry.

489
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,630
I won't let you get hurt.

490
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,750
I was hurt because

491
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:24,920
I was unaware of my strength.

492
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,110
It has nothing to do with you.

493
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:29,840
Thanks, Qiu.

494
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,920
You're still kindly consoling me.

495
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,600
I don't know what to say.

496
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,150
Tantan.

497
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:35,680
I...

498
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,040
You're apologizing all the time.

499
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,150
Do you regard me as an outsider

500
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,470
instead of a friend?

501
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,440
No. How could I...

502
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:41,270
I'm just kidding.

503
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,270
By the way, I have good news for you.

504
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,990
I've got a tip-off
from the Seven Nights Inn.

505
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:49,320
The trace of a lotus seed
has been found in Changluo Town.

506
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,750
I asked Mo Yan to double-check.

507
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,350
There is indeed a lotus seed
in the town.

508
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,390
OK, I'll tell them.

509
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,800
You get some rest.

510
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,320
Huai Meng,

511
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,390
I'll leave Qiu to you.

512
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,990
Don't worry. I'll take care of him.

513
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:24,920
Tantan, are you OK?

514
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,470
Why do you still care?

515
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:28,960
Tantan,

516
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,320
you saw what happened.

517
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:35,870
I approached her to expose her plot.

518
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,110
So, you knew there was a problem
with Lian Rong

519
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,110
from the beginning?

520
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,320
Then why did you hide it from me?

521
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,630
Am I

522
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,270
just an untrustworthy junior to you?

523
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,040
It happened so fast.

524
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,510
She knows too much about my past.

525
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,470
The conspiracy
is much bigger than I thought.

526
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,080
I couldn't let you risk your life.

527
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,720
You were afraid
I would find out about you and Lian Wen.

528
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,840
I was afraid you'd misunderstand.

529
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,920
You were afraid I'd know
that every time you bloom,

530
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,840
it's because of my face

531
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,230
which is exactly the same as Lian Wen's.

532
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,040
Absolutely not.

533
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,840
Dare you say
it has nothing to do with this face?

534
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,320
Let's break up.

535
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:25,960
Tantan.

536
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,390
Yes.

537
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,680
You and Lian Wen look alike.

538
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:33,080
But I can tell Tantan from Lian Wen.

539
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,510
100 years ago,

540
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:38,230
I owed a lot to Lian Wen.

541
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,960
But now I'm in love with you,

542
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,840
with Zhao Tantan.

543
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,320
Then tell me,

544
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,630
did you get the first petal

545
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,190
because of Zhao Tantan?

546
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,480
Though I don't know

547
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,910
what the Xilan Flower Curse is,

548
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:09,840
at least I know

549
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,480
that you bloom because of my face.

550
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,760
As long as

551
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,430
you don't see my face again,

552
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,080
you'll be safe forever.

553
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,840
Breaking up is the best choice
for both of us.

554
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:28,510
Tantan.

555
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:33,150
Tantan.

556
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,120
Tantan.

557
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,480
Listen to me!

558
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:36,720
