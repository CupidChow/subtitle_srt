00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,070
He's horrible when he's angry.
I'm scared.

193
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,150
Why does his anger scare you so much?

194
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:40,560
Is it because...

195
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,150
I do like him.

196
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,440
The Marriage Tripod may hear you.

197
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,150
It'll get angry.

198
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,920
What are you doing?

199
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,480
How could a magic instrument get angry?

200
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,680
I'm going to ask Su Zhinan

201
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,800
how he interpreted my divination stick.

202
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,750
Why isn't my destined love

203
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,750
the one I love?

204
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,880
No, I'm going now.

205
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,270
Tantan, wait for me.

206
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,360
Tantan.

207
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,880
Tantan, what's wrong?

208
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,630
Mr. Su,

209
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,360
I want a clear explanation now.

210
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,040
Why is it
that my destined love is Qiu Yuebai,

211
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,630
but I like someone else?

212
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,560
Your destined love is Mu Bai Zhenren.

213
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,390
Your divination is
autumn dew turns into frost since tonight;

214
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,710
the moon viewed at home is more bright.

215
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,680
Yeah.

216
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,510
Autumn refers to Qiu, moon refers to Yue
and frost refers to Bai.

217
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,680
Isn't it Qiu Yuebai?

218
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,920
The point of the divination is Bai.

219
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,070
I know.

220
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,000
Qiu Yuebai. Bai!

221
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:38,880
Zhao Tantan,
your destined love is Mu Bai.

222
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,360
Mu Bai?

223
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,440
OK. I see.

224
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,040
Tantan.

225
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:51,950
Tantan.

226
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,360
Tantan.

227
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,680
It's OK.

228
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,150
They don't know you were mistaken.

229
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,270
Only the three of us know.

230
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,710
I swear I won't tell anyone.

231
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,120
Tantan.

232
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,000
We'll definitely keep your secret.

233
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,120
Am I the kind of person

234
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,390
who would be bothered by such a thing?

235
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,880
My No. 800 rule:

236
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,190
as long as I'm not embarrassed,

237
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,440
embarrassment can't catch up with me.

238
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,120
What bothers me is...

239
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,120
What?

240
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:22,190
Do you think Cui Chen likes me or not?

241
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,120
Who knows?

242
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,270
I think he does.

243
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,830
Why?

244
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:29,800
Just

245
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,630
a hunch.

246
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,320
He looks at you differently.

247
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,880
But I get the feeling

248
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,270
that he doesn't care about

249
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,320
the whole destined love thing.

250
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,150
He didn't even ask.

251
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,830
I don't know what's on his mind.

252
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,360
I have an idea.

253
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,710
What idea?

254
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,830
Yeah, what's your idea?

255
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,120
Greatness in simplicity.
Take the initiative.

256
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,510
Tantan, you've changed.

257
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,320
Since you got off the mountain,

258
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,750
I don't understand a word you've said.

259
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,830
Silly you.

260
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,880
What I'm saying is,

261
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,800
don't stay in your room and guess.

262
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,360
Go to see Huai Meng,

263
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,920
grab him by the ear and ask him,

264
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,150
"What's on your mind?

265
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,360
Do you like me or not?"

266
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,590
Is it that simple?

267
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,070
You should do that too.

268
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,710
OK, I'll go now.

269
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,920
What are you doing here?

270
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,510
Manqian, Miss Zhao,

271
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,950
Master wants to see you.

272
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,710
Mr. Su.

273
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,440
This is...

274
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:39,800
Lu Yi.

275
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:41,630
Lu Yi?

276
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,360
Is Lu Yi dead?

277
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,070
His body was found on the road

278
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:46,880
from Yunzhou City to Yunlai Town.

279
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,190
What about Hu Meng?

280
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,510
We only found Lu Yi.

281
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,120
We didn't find any traces of Hu Meng.

282
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,240
Oh, we also found this,

283
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,510
the brocade box
used to keep the lotus seed.

284
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,120
It does smell of the lotus seed.

285
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,440
Cui Chen, does Hu Meng
have anything to do with Lu Yi's death?

286
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,070
A woman who sneaked

287
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,710
into the Qionghua Sect
to steal the lotus seed.

288
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,750
Who else could it be but her?

289
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,270
Lu Yi was greedy,

290
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,710
but he didn't deserve to die.

291
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,360
She may have stolen the lotus seed,

292
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,270
but she has never hurt anyone.

293
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,360
Say no more.

294
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,190
Tantan, don't be afraid.

295
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,800
It's OK, Tantan.

296
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,560
Come here. I'll teach you
how to do an autopsy.

297
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,880
The spell attack

298
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,510
on his forehead was fatal.

299
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,590
Did Hu Meng kill him?

300
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,000
No.

301
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,320
The spell that killed Lu Yi

302
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,880
originated from the Qionghua Sect.

303
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,360
Is there a traitor in your sect?

304
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,240
That's impossible.

305
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,120
Since the loss of the lotus seed,

306
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,800
the movement of all disciples in the sect

307
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,000
has been strictly monitored.

308
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,680
No one has any time to commit the crime.

309
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,190
It seems that the only way to find out

310
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,920
who killed Lu Yi is to find Hu Meng.

311
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,320
But it at least proves that

312
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,710
Hu Meng didn't kill him.

313
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:11,920
Tantan,

314
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,950
I was dogmatic just now.

315
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,240
It's OK.

316
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,440
Your former fellow disciple
was murdered.

317
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,880
It's only natural
that you get emotional.

318
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,270
Besides, given our relationship,

319
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,480
you don't have to worry about it.

320
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,750
I've found out.

321
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,320
Hu Meng and her lover Zhu Yan

322
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,480
used to live

323
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,510
in Zhu Village near Yunlai Town.

324
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,390
The body was found in Yunlai.

325
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,880
It seems that Hu Meng has gone
to Zhu Village.

326
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,510
Let's leave for the village tomorrow.

327
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:55,440
Tantan.

328
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,390
Wait.

329
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,710
Tantan, walk on the log.

330
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,120
OK.

331
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,070
Mr. Qiu, why are you so careless?

332
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,150
Are you OK?

333
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:38,120
I'm OK.

334
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:39,240
I'm OK.

335
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,710
By the way, why are you following us?

336
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,320
We're going to deal with the golden fox.

337
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,320
You can do nothing to help.

338
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,920
I'm a quasi-disciple.

339
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,190
Shouldn't I follow my master?

340
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,440
That way I can protect her.

341
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:53,750
Do you need him to protect you?

342
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,440
Tantan, I'm not completely useless,

343
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:01,950
right?

344
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:04,390
Cui Chen.

345
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:04,990
Cui Chen.

346
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,230
Cui Chen.

347
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:09,870
Cui Chen, what do you think?

348
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,040
I think we'd better proceed
with the disciple admission ritual

349
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,600
and review the sect rules.

350
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,470
Tantan.

351
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,080
Xueyi.

352
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,870
Xueyi, slow down.

353
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,560
Xueyi.

354
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:42,040
Xueyi, slow down.

355
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,040
What are you doing?

356
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,600
What's wrong?

357
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,080
Why are you annoyed?

358
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,920
Even if you're annoyed,

359
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,150
you shouldn't have run off to Tantan

360
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,270
without saying a word.

361
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,110
If the crab spirit hadn't told me,

362
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,840
I wouldn't have known where to find you.

363
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,560
Why would you look for me?

364
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,440
Don't you get along well

365
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,150
with that swiftlet spirit?

366
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,270
Go look for her.

367
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:05,680
I...

368
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,680
You're being unreasonable.

369
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,200
I was just giving her medicine.

370
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,840
Don't make blind conjectures, will you?

371
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:12,960
You're still denying it.

372
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,080
No.

373
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,870
No, I...

374
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,990
I can't catch up...

375
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,440
Xueyi.

376
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,680
Young people are obsessed

377
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,750
with such boring things.

378
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:25,920
I wonder why.

379
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,270
Boring.

380
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:29,510
I'm...

381
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:38,000
[Post]

382
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,750
Here. Drink.

383
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:46,470
OK.

384
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:47,630
Here.

385
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,200
Tantan.

386
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,510
Xueyi.

387
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:04,390
Xueyi.

388
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,150
Thanks, Qiu.

389
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,840
Cui Chen, come and sit.

390
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,150
OK.

391
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,990
So, did you find anything along the way?

392
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:23,840
No.

393
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,630
And I've been pissed off.

394
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,270
What about you?

395
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,870
No.

396
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,630
I guess we'll have to look for Zhu Yan
in Zhu Village.

397
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,720
Cui Chen, I think

398
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,600
everyone here is weird.

399
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,390
There are all kinds of people

400
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,150
staying here.

401
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,320
Be careful with your lotus seed.

402
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,270
Xueyi, it was hot on the way.

403
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,720
Drink some water to cool down.

404
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,470
Don't you know how to honor the master?

405
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,600
Cui Chen, have some water.

406
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:09,200
OK.

407
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,720
Xueyi, Huai Meng, Uncle Zi Meng!

408
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,510
Robbery!

409
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,040
Xueyi.

410
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,600
Robbery!

411
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:22,270
Robbery.

412
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,790
Isn't it late for you

413
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,190
to put on masks now?

414
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:28,840
It's OK, boss.

415
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,000
We're masked men.

416
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,390
They won't remember.

417
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,510
Yeah.

418
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,190
Give me the lotus seed!

419
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:35,960
In your dreams.

420
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,240
Then don't blame us for being rude.

421
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:39,390
Fine.

422
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,360
Come on. Show me what you've got.

423
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:22,760
Cui Chen!

424
00:21:59,270 --> 00:21:59,840
Tantan.

425
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,000
Qiu!

426
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,150
Let go of me!

427
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:11,240
I'm going to kill you!

428
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,960
Little girl, you've got a nerve.

429
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,550
Cui Chen, hang in there!

430
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,360
Tantan.

431
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,910
Cui Chen, hang in there!

432
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,910
I can still hold on.

433
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,080
Tantan, move your hands.

434
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:49,000
They'll be busted if it falls.

435
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,190
I won't let you stay in there alone.

436
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,240
Get your hands off.

437
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,790
Cui Chen!

438
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,880
Let go of me!

439
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:05,910
Let go of me!

440
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,080
Let go!

441
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,150
Be careful.

442
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,840
Cui Chen, are you OK?

443
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,600
Why are you avoiding me?

444
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:34,960
I'm looking

445
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,880
for a way out.

446
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,000
You idiots!

447
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,270
Get Tantan out of there!

448
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,510
Have you found it?

449
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,080
Still looking.

450
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,030
It's hot.

451
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,120
It won't work.

452
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,310
Spiritual power doesn't work here.

453
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,120
No.

454
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:50,760
Stop!

455
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,720
- What are you doing?
- Stop yelling.

456
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,430
- What are you doing?
- Cui Chen.

457
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,310
I don't buy it.

458
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,390
I'll scream if you take more off.

459
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,080
Cui Chen,

460
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,790
lay down your dignity, OK?

461
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,790
I'm not taking it off!

462
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:58,310
Take it off.

463
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:00,670
It's so hot.

464
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:01,270
Fine. I'll do it myself.

465
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,120
- I'll do it myself.
- OK. Do it.

466
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,720
Don't look. Turn around.

467
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:08,720
Mo Yan!

468
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,120
Young Master.

469
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:12,880
Where did you get the magic instrument?

470
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:13,910
Why can't you even lift it?

471
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,640
Where did you get the magic instrument?

472
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,000
Why can't you even lift it?

473
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,430
I'm telling you,

474
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,240
if anything happens to Tantan in there,

475
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,030
I'll kill you first.

476
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,000
I'm telling you,

477
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,150
if anything happens to Tantan in there,

478
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,080
I'll kill you first.

479
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,190
I stole this.

480
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,000
Sir, don't worry.

481
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,390
I'll try the other way

482
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,240
and get them out.

483
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:00,480
Cui Chen, what are you doing?

484
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,670
I'm afraid you're cold.

485
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:48,960
Cui Chen, cold.

486
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,910
Mo Yan!

487
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:11,600
You have ten minutes to lift it.

488
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,550
Otherwise, you can drop dead.

489
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,760
You have ten minutes to lift it.

490
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,000
Otherwise, you can drop dead.

491
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:20,480
You...

492
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:24,390
Unbelievable.

493
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:35,760
Kids, what are you playing?

494
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,360
Uncle Zi Meng,

495
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,670
do you know how to lift the bell?

496
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,030
It's easy.

497
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,240
You make a circle

498
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,120
and hold hands.

499
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:45,550
They you sing,
"Little bunny, open the door.

500
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:47,120
No, I won't.

501
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,360
Mommy hasn't come back."

502
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,600
Then you hit the apex
of the bell with a spell.

503
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,190
And it opens.

504
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:53,480
Is it that simple?

505
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,720
No, it isn't.

506
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,760
You must sing with a lot of emotion.

507
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,430
"Little bunny,

508
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,720
open the door."

509
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,430
Then you hit it.

510
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,760
Hit the apex and it opens.

511
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,480
I have to teach you everything.

512
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,030
This tea...

513
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,150
Yeah. It seems to have been drugged.

514
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:18,960
Yeah. I remember.

515
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,190
Little bunny,

516
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:24,600
open the door.

517
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,640
No, I won't.

518
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,190
Mommy hasn't come back.

519
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:30,270
Little bunny,

520
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:32,480
open the door.

521
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,670
No, I won't.

522
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,600
Mommy hasn't come back.

523
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,880
Little bunny...

524
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,600
Leave.

525
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,430
Let's go.

526
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,030
Cui Chen, you rascal
who twists the knife in the wound!

527
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,720
Qiu, don't get him wrong.

528
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,000
He was just afraid I would be cold.

529
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,760
Tantan, are you OK?

530
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,080
I'm fine. What about you?

531
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,960
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

532
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,600
How did you lift the bell?

533
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,720
Where are the bandits?

534
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,360
Fortunately, Mo Yan arrived in time

535
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,640
and drove them away.

536
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:26,510
Really?

537
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,190
Or what do you think?

538
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,430
Qiu, Cui Chen didn't mean any harm.

539
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,430
Don't get him wrong.

540
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,760
Mo Yan, thank you.

541
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,480
Let's go check on them.

542
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,390
Uncle.

543
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,030
Xueyi.

544
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:04,760
Xueyi.

545
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,030
Uncle.

546
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,000
(Would Uncle Zi Meng expose me
when he wakes up?)

547
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,040
Are you OK?

548
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,840
I think we've been drugged.

549
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,640
Bai, you...

550
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,640
Where's the crab roe noodles
you promised to buy me?

551
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,720
(Fortunately,
Uncle Zi Meng forgot about it.)

552
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:30,120
Uncle, we've already left Yunzhou.

553
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,240
You can't eat the crab roe noodles
for a while.

554
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,550
Liar.

555
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,510
You liars.

556
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,960
Tantan, did you and Senior Mu Bai

557
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,240
really hold each other?

558
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,480
Keep your voice down.

559
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,600
Got it.

560
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,640
Tantan, did you hear

561
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,270
Senior Mu Bai's heartbeat?

562
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,190
I did hear the heartbeat,

563
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,310
but not his.

564
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,720
It was mine.

565
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:07,310
You've had skin-to-skin contact.

566
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,150
Doesn't that prove you like each other?

567
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,030
Don't touch me.

568
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,360
Tantan, why are you blushing?

569
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,030
Did you...

570
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:29,960
Zhao Tantan, you little pervert!

571
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:32,430
What's wrong?

572
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,600
Qiu, are you OK?

573
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,240
I stretched my wound again.

574
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:35,760
Well...

575
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,910
Huai Meng, come and take a look.

576
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:38,760
OK.

577
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,880
Be careful.

578
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,720
Let me take a look.

579
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,190
Mr. Qiu, give me your hand.

580
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:44,960
I'll check your pulse.

581
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:45,880
No.

582
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,640
I'm fine.

583
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,880
Qiu, how did you get hurt?

584
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,670
I wanted to help Tantan.

585
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,910
But I'm not good at martial arts.

586
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,640
Unbelievable.

587
00:31:58,790 --> 00:31:59,270
Here.

588
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,480
This is my toad coat.

589
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,360
It's invulnerable
to weapons, water, and fire.

590
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:05,910
Why didn't you

591
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:07,390
ask for my help earlier?

592
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,670
Uncle,

593
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,270
we all passed out earlier.

594
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:12,550
We were willing but unable to help.

595
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:13,310
Yeah.

596
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,240
When did that happen?

597
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:15,360
- Let's go.
- Well,

598
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,390
- just tell me.
- You know what,

599
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,080
you're showing signs

600
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,480
of senile amnesia.

601
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,000
How could you forget it again?

602
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,670
How did we pass out?

603
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,030
Tantan.

604
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,960
I want to tell you something.

605
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,840
Xueyi, would you give us a minute?

606
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,150
OK, then.

607
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,430
Xueyi, come here.

608
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:38,030
Xueyi,

609
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,270
what are they talking about?

610
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,190
He said he had something to tell Tantan.

611
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,190
He wouldn't let me listen.
He's secretive.

612
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,840
Qiu, what do you want to tell me?

613
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,670
I really like you.

614
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,600
I like you too.

615
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,760
Next time, it's my turn to save you.

616
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,790
I don't just like you.

617
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,270
I fall for you.

618
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:08,510
Look.

619
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:10,000
They are walking so fast.

620
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,030
We should catch up with them.

621
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:11,600
Gotta go.

622
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:12,120
Tantan.

623
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:12,960
Xueyi!

624
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,670
Xueyi, wait for me!

625
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,360
Mr. Cui, why are you stopping me?

626
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:24,550
You didn't take my words seriously,
did you?

627
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,550
You're just her senior.

628
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,270
Do you also like her?

629
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,840
I'll tell you again.

630
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,150
Anyone who plays tricks behind my back,

631
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:34,720
I won't let them off easily.

632
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,080
The mountain moon doesn't know
my worries.

633
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,790
By the clear water,
flowers fall off silently.

634
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:48,910
Meaning?

635
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:52,510
It means you and your beloved

636
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,000
don't seem to be decreed by destiny.

637
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:58,150
It indicates unrequited love.

638
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,270
(I never believe in destiny.)

639
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:08,030
(I only believe in myself.)

640
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:32,920
[Zhu Village]

641
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,200
Excuse me.

642
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,120
Could you tell me where Zhu Yan lives?

643
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,600
I only asked her a question.

644
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:57,880
Why did she run away?

645
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,400
She must know Zhu Yan,

646
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,950
or she wouldn't be so terrified.

647
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,470
Judging by her response,

648
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,030
Zhu Yan must be around here.
