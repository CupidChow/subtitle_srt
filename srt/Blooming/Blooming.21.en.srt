There you are.

21
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,400
Here is a thing,

22
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,040
our master has been asking others

23
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,640
to hint that I should marry Tantan.

24
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,480
I know that he is protecting Tantan

25
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,240
and wants me to acknowledge her.

26
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,400
So,

27
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,200
I want to propose to Tantan.

28
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,080
Great.

29
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,240
Great.

00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,880
What do you want to do?

00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,640
I want to propose to Tantan.

32
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,560
Great.

33
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,520
Great.

34
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,600
I've been waiting for this day
for a long time.

35
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,760
It's a good thing.

36
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,560
Do I need to do anything?

37
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,680
No.

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,760
You got me. What are you afraid of?

39

You don't need to do anything.

40
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,080
I've got a perfect proposal plan

41
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,480
for you.

42
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,560
Well,

43
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,400
after what you said to Cui Chen,

44
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,480
will he propose to me?

45
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,080
Are you looking forward to it?

46
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,520
Of course.

47
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,560
Even if there is an accident tomorrow

48
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,280
and you are forced
to be separated forever,

49
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,280
are you still looking forward
to this proposal?

50
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,280
Why are you so pessimistic?

51
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,360
We're good now.

52
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,000
Why do you always bring up accidents?

53
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,080
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,680
I shouldn't have said that.

55
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,280
You don't have to apologize.

56
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,360
I know you're doing it for my good.

57
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,560
In fact,

58

even if Cui Chen and I
have to be separated forever tomorrow,

59
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,440
I'll always remember how happy I am

60
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,240

What?

00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,320

- What?
- What?

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,920
Yesterday morning.

71
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,920
Huai Meng went to the market
to get flowers.

72
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,280
It's been six hours.
The flowers are withered.

73
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,920
But he hasn't brought them to me.

74
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,480
He must have fallen in love
with someone else.

75
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,080
He won't.

76
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,440
We should trust him.

77
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,080
Maybe...

78
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,240
Maybe he went to pick herbs
for Uncle Zi Meng.

79
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,160
It's impossible.

80
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,600
I saw the flowers he picked.

81
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,200
It's not medicinal.

82
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,400

89
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,400
I don't know.

00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,440
I'm here!

91
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,160
What's the matter?

92
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,680
Tell us,

93
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,880
are you proposing to another girl?

94
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,600
No.

95
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,760
Uncle asked me to prepare this.

96
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,520
He said
it's for his grandson's proposal.

97
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,920
Well,

Huai Meng, you're thoughtful.

102
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,920
Are these for me?

103
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,840
Good for you, Huai Meng.

104
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,440
That's very thoughtful.

105
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,560
But now is not the time
to talk about it.

106
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,200

- Who?
- Who?

110
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,800

No, it's Cui Chen.

do it to Tantan.

114
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,280
Me?

115
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,560
Are you saying he is going to
propose to me?

116
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:41,920
I didn't say that.

117
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,840
Is Cui Chen going to propose to me?

118
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,280
No.

119
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,280
Uncle, didn't you say

120
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,960
your grandson and daughter-in-law

121
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,440
are me and Xueyi?

122
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,080
Why do you like being a grandson?

123
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,120
Don't worry.

124
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,000
I'll arrange your wedding in person.

125
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,480
But...

126
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,600
How can Cui Chen propose to Tantan?

127
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,040
What do you mean by that?

128
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,080
Why can't he propose to me?

129
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,480
Do we have to wait for you

130
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,560
to propose to Xueyi first?

131
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,000
Tantan, what are you talking about?

132
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,080
No, Tantan.

133
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,520
That's not what I meant.

134
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,360
I...

135
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,680
All right.

136
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,800
I'm in a good mood today.

Because Cui Chen
is going to propose to me.

138

He's going to propose to me!

139
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,640
Propose to me!

140
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,880
Come on!

141
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,000

Look how happy she is.

146
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,000

00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,920

148
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,240
You know what,

149
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,560
if the tangram is missing a piece,

150
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,120
I'll make a new one.

159
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,160
I've been doing what you asked me to do.

160
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,160
Do what?

161
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,240
To propose to Tantan.

162
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,440
Don't get excited.

163
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,440
Although we haven't been together
for a long time,

164
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,800
I love Tantan very much.

165
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,640
You two can't be together.

166
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,480
Why?

167
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,680
Do you think I'm not qualified
to take care of Tantan?

168
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,720
No.

169
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,640
Don't worry.

170
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,280
I will take good care of Tantan

171
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,000
and I won't let her get hurt.

172
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,200
No! You can't be together!

173
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,880
Why not?

174
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,120
You're beautiful.

175
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,120
Am I a fairy?

176
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,360
Of course.

177
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:08,920
Can I

178
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,320
capture Cui Chen's heart?

179
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,280
Yes.

180
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,760
Is this one better

181
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,480
or the one on me better?

182
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,440
This one looks better.

183
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,000
I think this one looks better.

184
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,200
This one is better.

185
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:21,760
This one.

186
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,040
Never mind.

187
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,240
I look good in everything.

188
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,600
According to the plan,

189
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,440
Cui Chen will show up one hour later

at the back side of the mountain.

191
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,080
Tantan, you're absolutely beautiful.

192
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,760
Why are you sighing?

193
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,480
I...

194
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,080
Don't mind them.

195
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,030
Take a look at me.

196
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,240
Is there anything I should change?

197
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,640
I haven't finished my work.

198
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,520
I'm going to work.

199
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,920
Cui Chen is going to propose to me.

200
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,840
Put some makeup on me.

201
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,920
Don't get too excited
when you see Cui Chen.

202
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,640
Marriage is a big deal.

203
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,920
You must think about it carefully
before answering him.

204
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,720
She won't think about it.

205
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,600
Right, Tantan?

206
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,240
You know me the best.

207
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,440
Put some makeup on me.

208
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,560
Take a look.

209
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,640
Slow down.

210
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,360
Are we almost there?

211
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,360
We're almost there.

212
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,120
I'm too nervous.

213
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,200
What should I do?

214
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,040
What should I do?

215
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,960
What should I do?

216
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,720
I'm too nervous.

217
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,600
I'm too nervous

218
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,680
I can't look.

219
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,080
- I can't look!
- One, two, three.

220
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,720
I can't look!

221
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,600
Well, I...

222
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,600
I'll take a look there.

223
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,280
I'll take a look there.

224
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:42,720
Tantan!

225
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,240
Be serious.

226
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,520
- Uncle.
- You have to think ahead

227
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,320
whether Cui Chen will kiss you

228
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,840
or hug you first.

229
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,040
You should be mentally prepared.

230
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,960
Uncle!

231
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,480
Don't say that.

232
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,560
I'll be embarrassed.

233
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,560
I don't think so.

234
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,800
That's what you're thinking.

235
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:02,680
Tantan.

236
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,160
Tantan.

237
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,280
Later,

238
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,440
Cui Chen is going to propose to me.

239
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,640
Am I not dreaming?

240
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,360
- No.
- No.

241
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,360
Am I not dreaming?

242
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,200
When will he arrive?

243
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,280
Why isn't he here yet?

244
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,360
He'll be here soon.

245
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,360
Don't worry.

246
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,680
The moments seem long for you.

247
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,240
Lend me a hand.

248
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,680
Do you want me
to scatter flowers for you?

249
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,280
Okay.

250
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,640
Okay.

251
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,560
The one who has been cursed

252
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,040
must not fall in love again
in this life.

253
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,520
If he does, one petal will bloom.

254
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,840
When five petals bloom,

255
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,760
the cursed one will turn into a demon,

256
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,040
and never have peace.

257
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,200
Have you found Senior Mu Bai?

258
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,880
No.

259
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,480
I'll find him myself.

260
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,520
No matter where he is,

261
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,560
I'll find him.

262
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,120
He said he would propose to Tantan.

263
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,440
How can he stand her up?

264
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,640
What's the matter with him?

265
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,440
No.

266
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,280
No, Xueyi.

267
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,920
He must have been delayed.

268
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,880
Look, it's raining.

269
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,640
Why don't we take Tantan back first?

270
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,400
What's the matter with you guys?

271
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,320
Can't you see how upset Tantan is,

272
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,880
and how much she looked forward
to this proposal?

273
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,880
Xueyi.

274
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,760
Listen to Huai Meng.

275
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,640
Meng, why are you also...?

276
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,560
Why are you all looking at me?

277
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,960
I'm fine.

278
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,160
Go back.

279
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,840
It's going to rain.

280
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,840
What about you?

281
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,920
I'll go back too.

282
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,720
But Cui Chen...

283
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,440
It's fine.

284
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,960
I know my way around here.

285
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,280
I'll go back on my own.

286
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:56,960
But...

287
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,480
But...

288
00:11:59,240 --> 00:11:59,880
But...

289
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,720
I'm fine.

290
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,280
If you don't go back,

291
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,080
I'll go off.

Don't go.

329

Master.

330
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,120
I have to leave the mountain.

331
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,840
What?

332
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,560
Are you breaking up with Tantan?

333
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,560
I have to find
the remaining two lotus seeds

334
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,240
and use the Seven-Leaf Lotus
to summon the power of the universe

335
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,160
and lift the Xilan Flower Curse.

336
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,640
Okay.

337
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,960

It's you who should hurry back.

I don't know

341
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,440
how long we can keep it from her.

342
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,240
(Tantan, after I collect
all the lotus seeds,)

343
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,600
(I'll give you a perfect proposal.)

344
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,560
Cui Chen.

345
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,120
Tantan.

346
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,200
Tantan.

347
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,840
Tantan.

348
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,480
Tantan.

349
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,040
Tantan.

350
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,240
Tantan.

351
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,560
Master, where's Cui Chen?

352
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,400
Cui Chen...

353
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,520
Where is he?

354
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,080
Senior...

355
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,720
Senior Mu Bai has things to do.

356
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,480
That's right. He has things to do.

357
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:58,920
Yes.

358
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,200
He has things to do.

359
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,880
What things?

360
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,350
What things?

361
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,280
Well,

362
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,160
the snake spirit
he defeated a hundred years ago

363
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,200
showed up again.

364
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,240
Yes.

365
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,200
I sent him to the south last night.

366
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,310
That's why he didn't get a chance
to say goodbye to you.

367
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,640
Really?

368
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,440
Really.

369
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,310
Don't you believe me now?

370
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:22,960
It's not that I don't believe you.

371
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,280
It just seems a bit strange.

372
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,640
Couldn't he at least say goodbye to me
before leaving?

373
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,680
Yeah. Why is that?

374
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,160
Why didn't he say goodbye?

375
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,080
Well...

376
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,480
This snake spirit is no ordinary spirit.

377
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,400
When I was a little fox,

378
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,880
all the spirits were afraid of him.

379
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,520
Until Mu Bai Zhenren defeated him,

380
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,840
but I heard
he didn't catch his true body.

381
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,280
Who says he didn't?

382
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,680
Last time...

383
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,760
What are you doing?

384
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,080
I just want to see the difference

385
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,680
between a toad's face and ours.

386
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,440
Don't interrupt.

387
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,880
Uncle Zi Meng,

388
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,520
what were you trying to say?

389
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,880
Yeah, what were you trying to say?

390
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,240
I was going to say

391
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,200
that the pig spirit
makes great pancakes.

392
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,000
Uncle.

393
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,400
Why can't you remember anything

394
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,760
but eating?

395
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,280
Uncle Zi Meng, think again.

396
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,760
I'm sure you'll remember.

397
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,360
Tantan, you should have some rest.

398
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,360
Let's go.

399
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,240
Yes, let her rest.

400
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,360
Let her rest.

401
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,680
I'll stay and take care of Tantan.

402
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,280
I'll leave her to you guys.

403
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,000
Take good care of her.

404
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,040
Let's go, Master.

405
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,440
Let's go.

406
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:34,960
Xueyi.

407
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,920
They are suspicious.

408
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,840
They must be keeping something from me.

409
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,720
The reason why Cui Chen didn't show up

410
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,560
is definitely not as simple as they said.

411
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,160
Does Huai Meng
also keep things from me?

412
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,240
He's in cahoots with them.

413
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,680
How dare he keep things from me?

414
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,760
He's doomed.

415
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,520
Well, go sound Huai Meng out.

416
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,040
I'll check other places.

417
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,600
Okay, I'll force him to tell me.

418
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,000
Okay.

419
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,360
[Courier Hostel]

420
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,400
This hostel is pretty good.

421
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,520
Yes, it's the best along the road.

422
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,440
Let's come here again next time.

423
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,000
Okay.

424
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,240
I had a good night's sleep yesterday.

425
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,360
So did I.

426
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,520
Your dishes are all served.

427
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,360
I'll have a bowl of vegetarian noodles.

428
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:31,920
Okay.

429
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,800
(There are two lotus seeds left.)

430
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,360
(Where are they?)

431
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,760
(Zi Meng said)

432
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,600
(he would send little toads
to find them.)

433
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,920
(I don't know when there will be news.)

434
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,880
Do you mind sharing the table?

435
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,000
No. Have a seat.

436
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,840
Sir, what would you like to drink?

437
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,080
Waiter,
have you seen this person before?

438
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,600
No.

439
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,320
Are you sure?

440
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,240
Yes.

441
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,800
I've been working here for years.

442
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,600
I may not have other skills,

443
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,040
but I'm good at recognizing people.

444
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,240
If I say I haven't seen her,
I definitely haven't.

445
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,600
Let me know if you need anything.

446
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,320
Feng Bao?

447
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,000
Have you met her?

448
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,680
Yes. This is Miss Feng.

449
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,920
She saved my junior,

450
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,400
and we traveled together for a while.

451
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:31,920
Where is she?

452
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,080
We parted in a place

453
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,600
called Changluo Town.

454
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,920
She is probably picking herbs
around there.

455
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,400
Herbs?

456
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,320
Don't you know what she does?

457
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,880
She never tells me
what she is doing outside.

458
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,120
What's your relationship with Miss Feng?

459
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,040
She is my fiancée.

460
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,400
I haven't heard from her
for a long time.

461
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,920
I'm afraid she might be in danger,

462
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,160
so I came out to find her.

463
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,120
She should still be picking herbs
around there.

464
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,280
I'll go with you and look for her.

465
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,600
How can I trouble you?

466
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,320
She saved my junior.

467
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,200
Consider it repaying a favor.

468
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,160
Thank you.

469
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,080
My name is Xie Yu.

470
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,160
I'm Cui Chen.

471
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,120
Have a seat.

472
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,280
What are you doing?

473
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,960
Sha asked us

474
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,560
to pack up all the belongings
of Senior Mu Bai.

475
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,800
Pack up?

476
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,000
Why?

477
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,160
We don't know.

478
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,120
She only said

479
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,480
Senior Mu Bai may not come back

480
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,440
for a long time.

481
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,400
No.

482
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:38,680
No.

483
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,600
Cui Chen will be fine.

484
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,360
I'm going to ask about it.

485
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,080
Xueyi, have you found out anything?

486
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,920
Huai Meng has changed.

487
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,920
What do you mean?
What did Huai Meng say?

488
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,440
He won't tell me.

489
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,040
He said it would be over if he did.

490
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,200
He can't tell me anything.

491
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,320
We agreed that we'd never hide anything
from each other.

492
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,240
It's only been a short time,

493
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,040
and he's changed his mind.

494
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,080
All right.

495
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,920
Be good.

496
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:07,640
Tantan.

497
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,200
Tantan!

498
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,000
Where are you going? Wait for me.

499
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,040
Are they having a fight again?

500
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,480
It's just a couple's game. I get it.

501
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,000
Master!

502
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:22,680
Master!

503
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,320
Master,
are you keeping something from me?

504
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:26,800
Master.

505
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,120
Master.

506
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:30,560
Tantan!

507
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,560
Tantan, what are you doing here?

508
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,440
Where's Master?

509
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,080
Tantan, you've just recovered.

510
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,080
Don't run around.

511
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,400
- Go back and rest.
- Sha!

512
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,040
What is Master doing?

513
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,560
Nothing.

514
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,600
Your lotus seeds are placed properly.

515
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,040
I'm not asking about the lotus seeds.

516
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,520
Is Master in there?

517
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,520
He's in seclusion for cultivation.

518
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,360
He can't be disturbed.

519
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,440
Is he in seclusion for cultivation?

520
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,280
I've never seen him in seclusion

521
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,320
since I was a child.

522
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,320
Why does he go into seclusion
as soon as Cui Chen left?

523
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,680
You're only 18 years old.

524
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,440
Master has lived for hundreds of years.

525
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,720
How would you know everything?

526
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,440
Fine.

527
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,600
Let's just say I'm young and ignorant.

528
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,360
I've never seen Master
cultivating himself.

529
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,280
Let me see it today.

530
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,080
No.

531
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:13,720
Master!

532
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,520
Master!

533
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,800
Master.

534
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,240
Master.

535
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,800
Xueyi, go get Huai Meng here.

536
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,520
Okay.

537
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,040
He was just fine.

538
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,560
Why did he faint suddenly?

539
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,680
How is he?

540
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,320
He is fatigued.

541
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,240
He fainted because of the rapid consumption
of his spiritual power.

542
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,640
I've given him some medicine.
Don't worry.

543
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,480
But he can't overwork anymore.

544
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,400
I'll get some medicine for him
to replenish his vitality.

545
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,920
Give it to him later.

546
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:55,920
Take care of him.

547
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,360
Thank you.

548
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:03,840
Sha.

549
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,320
What is Master doing?

550
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,280
How much are you keeping from me?

551
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,640
Tantan, we did keep something from you.

552
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,440
But it's all for your good.

553
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,000
I don't need you to do this for my good.

554
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,400
I just want to know the truth.

555
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,800
What is Master doing?

556
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,040
What are you doing?

557
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,000
Did something

558
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,880
happen to Cui Chen?

559
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,640
Sha, just tell Tantan the truth.

560
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,240
Though she looks tough,

561
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:31,840
you don't know

562
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,640
how many times she cried in private.

563
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:39,880
Tantan.

564
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,040
Cui Chen is fine.

565
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,560
Really?

566
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,720
Then where is he?

567
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,120
He...

568
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,480
Master.

569
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,040
You can leave first.

570
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,320
Let Master rest.

571
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,560
Sha, I'll take care of Master.

572
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,040
Can you do that?

573
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,560
Master has been taking care of me.

574
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,040
Now it's my turn to take care of him.

575
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,760
Okay.

576
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,480
Let's go, Xueyi.

577
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,640
Master.

578
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,560
Master.

579
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,960
How many things
are you keeping from me?

580
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,240
Gosh!

581
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,480
You scared me, Tantan.

582
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,960
I'm almost done with the medicine.

583
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,280
Go back first.

584
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,440
I know everything.

585
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,320
What do you know?

586
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,440
Cui Chen didn't go

587
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,840
to fight the snake spirit.

588
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,160
He left because he didn't
want me to be sad, right?

589
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,120
Gosh.

590
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,000
Tantan, Cui Chen

591
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,560
didn't want it to be like this, either.

592
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,440
I know.

593
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,040
You're doing this for our good.

594
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,080
I just need to know he's okay.

595
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,560
Gosh. I knew

596
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,560
you wouldn't be devastated

597
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,960
after knowing it.

598
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,680
You don't know

599
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,320
how hard it is for me

600
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,880
to keep this secret these days.

601
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,520
Tantan, it's not easy for you,

602
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,720
but as long you're not with Cui Chen

603
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,280
during this time,

604
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,880
the Xilan Flower on his forehead

605
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,120
won't bloom.

606
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,200
If it doesn't bloom,

607
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,440
he won't turn into a demon.

608
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,360
Then you two...

609
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:40,960
Wait!

610
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,840
Are you saying the Xilan Flower
on his forehead

611
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,840
will only bloom for me

612
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,200
and he'll turn into a demon?

613
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,480
Tantan!

614
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,440
Tantan!

615
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,080
Slow down, Tantan!

616
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,440
Tantan!

617
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,120
Gosh.

618
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,680
Oh, no.

619
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,280
Do you know it?

620
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,000
Master.

621
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,360
Master.

622
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,720
Will Cui Chen turn into a demon
because of me?

623
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,360
It's the Xilan Flower Curse.

624
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,320
One petal will bloom
when he falls in love.

625
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,960
After the five petals bloom,

626
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,640
he'll turn into a demon.

627
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,000
Is there

628
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,680
no other way?

629
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,800
The Seven-Leaf Lotus.

630
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,360
The Seven-Leaf Lotus is the only cure.

631
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,600
There's no other way.

632
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,240
However...

633
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,400
The Demon Curb Chain

634
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,440
can suppress his demonic nature

635
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,360
and delay the blooming time.

636
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,320
Master, is this what you've been
working on these days?

637
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,440
Yes.

638
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,680
But I'm too old to finish it.

639
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,000
It was close.

640
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,320
This close.

641
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,960
It's okay. I'll finish the rest.

642
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,320
No.

643
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,160
You need to continuously
transmit spiritual power

644
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,800
into the Casting Tripod
to make the Demon Curb Chain.

645
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,680
I borrowed some lotus seeds
from the secret vault

646
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,720
and could barely make it.

647
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,760
You can't do this.

648
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,600
Master.

649
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,920
I've changed since I left the mountain.

650
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,320
Besides, I found those lotus seeds.

651
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,800
Maybe they'll listen to me.

652
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,520
Tantan.

653
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,400
Master.

654
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,000
Cui Chen is blooming because of me.

655
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,840
I have to do this for him.

656
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,840
Okay.

657
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,680
Take Huai Meng with you. Be safe.

658
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,160
Okay.

659
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,280
Young Master.

660
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:56,680
Come in.

661
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,080
Cui Chen left the mountain,

662
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,360
but Zhao Tantan didn't go with him.

663
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,320
She is staying on the mountain.

664
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,760
I heard that Cui Chen
was going to propose to her,

665
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,840
but he didn't show up.

666
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:11,920
She got caught in the rain.

667
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,360
Huai Meng is there. Tantan will be fine.

668
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,400
Take this to the Qingyuan sect

669
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:21,920
and give it to Tantan.

670
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,600
Yes.

671
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,240
Where's Cui Chen?

672
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,440
He's heading towards Changluo Town

673
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,640
with a man.

674
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,280
Changluo Town?

675
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,240
Yes.

676
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,560
And this time he left the mountain.

677
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,120
His body seems to have some problems.

678
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:34,760
What do you mean?

679
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,200
I haven't found out yet,

680
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,840
but it seems that his spiritual power
has been damaged.

681
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,000
Continue with our plan.

682
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,440
But the Demon Lord...

683
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,520
I see.

684
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,840
(He has the scent of the lotus seed,)

685
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,280
(but the lotus seed isn't here.)

686
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,760
(There must be some close connection)

687
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,440
(between him and the lotus seed.)

688
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,400
Mr. Xie, you and Miss Feng

689
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,720
don't seem like ordinary people.

690
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,360
Where do you live?

691
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,280
Sorry, our clan
is naturally inclined to solitude.

692
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,400
Except for Feng Bao, we rarely communicate
with the outside world.

693
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,120
So...

694
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,440
I was abrupt.

695
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,920
Mr. Cui, how long will it take
to get to Changluo Town?

696
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,560
Mr. Cui.

697
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,400
Mr. Cui!

698
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,520
Cui Chen.

699
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:43,720
Dabai.

700
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:50,760
Tantan.

701
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:51,960
Dabai.

702
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,080
Tantan.

703
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,840
Cui Chen.

704
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:04,920
Tantan.

705
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:05,920
Dabai.

706
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,560
Dabai, I know it.

707
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,520
You did the right thing.
I don't blame you.

708
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,080
We're both the Light of Qingyuan

709
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,760
who should uphold justice.

710
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,800
How can we be a hindrance to each other?

711
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,520
If we are together,

712
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,560
we should support each other

713
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,400
and face everything together.

714
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:15,160
But you shouldn't leave like this.

715
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,920
Let's meet, all right?

716
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,560
Master and I have made

717
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,160
a Demon Curb Chain for you.

718
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,040
After I give it to you,

719
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,520
I'll never see you again,

720
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,840
until the Xilan Flower Curse is lifted.

721
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,800
Is that okay?
