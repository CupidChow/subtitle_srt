[Episode 17]

16
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,120
I told you not to hurt Zhao Tantan.

17
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm no match for Cui Chen,

18
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,280
so I had to pretend
to launch a sneak attack

19
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,680
on Zhao Tantan,
the one he cares most about,

20
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,720
to disturb his mind

21
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,560
and kill him when he shows weakness.

22
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,600
A sneak attack?

23
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,400
I took your hit.

24
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,120
Do you think I can't tell
your murderous intent?

25
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,360
Young Master, she's the emissary
of the Demon Lord.

26
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,000
If anything happens to her
at the Qiye Inn,

27
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,200
we'll have to answer for it.

28
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,440
Just do your job well.

29
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,760
Don't try to do anything else.

30
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,800
If you sabotage my plan again,

31
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,160
even the Demon Lord can't save you.

32
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,440
Don't forget your mission.

33
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,920
If you're too preoccupied
with your love affair,

34
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,520
when the Demon Lord
holds you accountable,

35
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,440
you'll end up worse than me.

36
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,360
Apply this. It'll heal quickly.

37
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,120
What do you mean?

38
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,160
Are you pitying me?

39
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,880
Why did you have to kill Zhao Tantan?

40
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,160
I just can't stand her face.

41
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,640
Therefore, Changluo Town

42
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,320
is surrounded by forests.

43
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,960
It's a secluded place,

44
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,920
but for cultivators,

45
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,760
it's an ideal place for cultivation.

46
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,280
When we...

47
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:43,760
My goodness.

48
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,280
When the little animals
like us cultivate together...

49
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,800
Does your hand hurt?

50
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,520
Of course, there are also plants.

51
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,440
There are also plants.

52
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,360
When the little animals
cultivate together,

53
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,760
we have to decide

54
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,760
[Bai]
when and where

55
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,920
to cultivate

56
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,520
and which animals to cultivate with.

57
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,800
Including plants, of course.

58
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,160
It's very important.

59
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,480
You know what,

60
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,880
I was born in Changluo.

61
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,240
back when I was a tadpole.

62
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,160
Zi Meng.

63
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,040
Uncle Zi Meng.

64
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,240
Since you know Changluo so well,

65
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,560
let's set off tomorrow.

66
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,120
That's a good decision.

67
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,600
But I forgot where Changluo is.

68
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,000
Tantan.

69
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,480
Let me think about it.

70
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,640
Do you have time?

71
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,640
Let me think about it.

72
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,120
I think it's

73
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,920
to the east of Changku Town.

74
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,120
- It's to the west of Changku.
- Uncle.

75
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,480
Let's go back to your room
and think about it.

76
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,120
- Take your time.
- Wait, I just remembered.

77
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:30,680
No.

78
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,200
It's okay if you can't remember now.

79
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:32,680
Let's go.

80
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,000
I'll go back with you.

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's okay if you can't remember now.

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,400
Let's go.

83
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:35,840
Tantan.

84
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,520
No matter what happens,
give him a chance.

85
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,520
Hear what he has to say.

86
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,240
It's right there...

87
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,280
Let me tell you.

88
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,960
Tantan, listen to me.

89
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,160
No matter what you say,

90
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,560
it can't change what I saw today.

91
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,800
Cui Chen, from today,

92
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,240
you're just my senior,

93
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,680
and I'm just your junior.

94
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,040
I think it's simpler

95
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,480
and better for both of us.

96
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,800
- It's not what you think.
- Cui Chen.

97
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,960
We're going to Changluo tomorrow
to look for the lotus seeds.

98
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,120
You don't need to come with us.

99
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,320
Let's slip up. It'll be more efficient.

100
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,320
Tantan.

101
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,560
Tantan.

102
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,000
Liar.

103
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,680
Liar!

104
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,560
Tantan, I'm sorry.

105
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,200
I'm sorry for causing you so much pain.

106
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,480
I don't know since when

107
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,120
I started to think about you
all the time.

108
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,680
I really

109
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,640
like you a lot.

110
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,400
From today, you just stay where you are,

111
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,720
and I'll protect you.

112
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,280
You guys are just in time.

113
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,160
I've told Cui Chen

114
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,320
that we'll split up
to look for the lotus seeds.

115
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,640
Go and pack your things.

116
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,360
We're leaving tomorrow.

117
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,760
Cry if you want to.

118
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,560
I want a hug too.

119
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,760
Uncle, stop looking. Let's go.

120
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,080
Sit down.

121
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,080
Tantan, what happened to you?

122
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,080
Why are you so sad?

123
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,160
If you want to talk,

124
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,080
Xueyi and I are here listening.

125
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,720
If you don't want to say anything,

126
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,960
we'll be here for you quietly.

127
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,840
Cui Chen.

128
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,200
I think I'm not the one who he loves.

129
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,360
Cui Chen.

130
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,280
How dare he

131
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,520
use you as a substitute?

132
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,000
I'll kick his ass.

133
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,240
Don't make it worse.

134
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,120
Let them solve their own problems.

135
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,640
Miss Zhao told Cui Chen,

136
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,440
"We're going to Changluo tomorrow
to look for the lotus seeds.

137
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,640
You don't need to come with us.

138
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,760
Let's slip up. It'll be more efficient."

139
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,720
Tell me again how Tantan drew a line

140
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,320
between her and Cui Chen.

141
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,240
"No matter what you say,

142
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,680
it can't change what I saw today.

143
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,840
Cui Chen, from today,

144
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,040
you're just my senior,

145
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,120
and I'm just your junior.

146
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,720
I think it's simpler

147
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,560
and better for both of us."

148
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,600
Young Master, you've asked me
to repeat it three times.

149
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,880
Should I repeat it again?

150
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,480
No need.

151
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,480
When I'm in a bad mood,

152
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,070
you can say it again.

153
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,560
You can leave.

154
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,240
Tantan, you're not the type
to drink down sorrow.

155
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,360
I'm not sorrowful.

156
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,080
I just like to drink.

157
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,800
It's not a bad thing to be sorrowful.

158
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,760
If you don't have sorrow in life,

159
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
how boring that would be.

160
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,280
That's not true.

161
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,680
I want to be happy in my life.

162
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,440
I don't want to be sorrowful
or miserable.

163
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,000
In fact, when you purified Zhu Yan,

164
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,120
I could see

165
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,960
that Cui Chen has been protecting

166
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,280
and doesn't want you to get hurt.

167
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,600
I think he cares a lot about you.

168
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,360
Me?

169
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,920
He only cares about Lian Wen.

170
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,920
I'm just his junior who benefit

171
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,880
from my resemblance to Lian Wen.

172
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,200
Tantan.

173
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,720
You know what,

174
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,280
since Zhu Yan left,

175
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,560
I've been regretting it all the time.

176
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,400
But he's gone.

177
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,240
No amount of regret can change it.

178
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,760
Sometimes, when you miss the chance,

179
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,120
it becomes a lifelong regret.

180
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,320
Your love is beautiful,

181
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,120
which is why you can't forget it.

182
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,960
But what regrets do I have?

183
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,360
Did I misunderstand them,

184
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,120
or is what I said not true?

185
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:44,960
Yes.

186
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,600
But you can

187
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,520
give him a chance to explain.

188
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,320
Only with mutual trust

189
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,200
can a relationship last.

190
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,200
Trust him?

191
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,800
What has he done

192
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,600
that deserves my trust?

193
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,080
Are you going to ignore him forever?

194
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,240
I'm not ignoring him.

195
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,280
He's my senior,

196
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,920
and only my senior.

197
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,720
There was nothing between us before,

198
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,000
and there won't be anything between us
in the future.

199
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,640
Our only connection

200
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,320
is my face

201
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,360
which reminds him
of his past from time to time

202
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,160
and makes him blossom.

203
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,520
So it's better for us to break up.

204
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,320
Tantan.

205
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,920
Stop drinking.

206
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,200
Go back to sleep.

207
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,760
I want to drink some more.

208
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:33,520
My goodness.

209
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,240
My goodness.

210
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,000
Slow down.

211
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:35,960
My goodness.

212
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,480
Bro.

213
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,640
I must praise you.

214
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,240
You're a real man.

215
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,040
Cui Chen, I'm so moved.

216
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,560
Back in the day, I also threw up

217
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,480
all over the street for a swan.

218
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,040
My goodness.

219
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,720
Do you want to get Tantan back?

220
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,000
Senior, help me.

221
00:12:59,280 --> 00:12:59,920
Help me.

222
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,680
I don't know what to do

223
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,160
I love Tantan a lot.

224
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,800
I want to take care of her

225
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,240
and protect her.

226
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,560
I made her angry.

227
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,320
She doesn't want me anymore.

228
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,440
It's all my fault.

229
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,240
It's all my fault.

230
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:17,800
It's way too mushy.

231
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,520
I can't stand it.

232
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,360
I can't stand it.

233
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,240
You sapling, what do you know?

234
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,720
Cui Chen, listen to me.

235
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,120
If Tantan is mad at you,

236
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,240
it means she still cares about you.

237
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,000
That's a good thing.

238
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,560
Uncle, just get to the point.

239
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,560
What should he do now?

240
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,360
Let me think about it.

241
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:32,880
Let me think about it.

242
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,240
Well, Cui Chen,

243
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,120
you should coax her day and night.

244
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,640
Be cheeky and bold.

245
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,520
You have to coax her.

246
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,560
It works well on women.

247
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:53,880
Good morning.

248
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,360
Good morning.

249
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:54,720
Good morning.

250
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,280
Good morning

251
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,200
Good morning.

252
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,080
Tantan.

253
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,600
I saved these buns for you.

254
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,160
Have some.

255
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,000
Thank you.

256
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,040
Huai Meng and Uncle Zi Meng
haven't come down yet.

257
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,200
I'll go and urge them.

258
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,000
Why is it you?

259
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:17,760
Where is he?

260
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,760
Who are you looking for?

261
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,440
Cui...

262
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,080
No need to urge us.

263
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,760
Here we are.

264
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,560
What are you doing?

265
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,600
It's delicious.

266
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,920
(Cui Chen, I'll give the toad coat
back to you.)

267
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,400
(We're leaving.)

268
00:14:59,160 --> 00:14:59,800
(Take care.)

269
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,920
My goodness, it's hot.

270
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,240
It's too hot.

271
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,400
I'm thirsty.

272
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,280
It's so hard to find
the lotus seeds in Changluo.

273
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,360
It seems being a heroine is not easy.

274
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,520
You finally know

275
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,760
it's not easy to be a heroine.

276
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,680
I won't do it. You can do it yourself.

277
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,960
All right, just drink quickly.

278
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,680
Rest for a while.

279
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,040
We'll be leaving soon.

280
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,760
You saw her. She's still alive.

281
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,120
My sister's alive.

282
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,240
Xueyi, slow down!

283
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,560
Xueyi!

284
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,480
- Xueyi!
- Xueyi!

285
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,240
Don't move.

286
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,560
What's going on?

287
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,640
Why is my spiritual power not working?

288
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,360
Don't move.

289
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:58,720
Don't move.

290
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,840
The spiritual power
will only make it worse.

291
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,880
Let's figure out another way.

292
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,160
Well...

293
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,560
What's this gurgling thing?

294
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,120
Why does she keep sinking?

295
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,720
Don't be afraid, Xueyi.

296
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,600
I'm here, Xueyi.

297
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,560
Don't be afraid.

298
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,000
Huai Meng, pull her up with your branch.

299
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,480
Okay.

300
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,880
I'm scared! Help me!

301
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,120
Xueyi, grab it.

302
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,520
Xueyi, grab it.

303
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,320
Grab it tight, Xueyi.

304
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,080
Tantan!

305
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,000
Tantan!

306
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,320
Xueyi, are you all right?

307
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,240
I'm fine.

308
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,960
Xueyi, how are you feeling?
Are you hurt?

309
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:30,560
No.

310
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,000
Let me take a look.

311
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,800
Does it hurt?

312
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,880
You scared me.

313
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,760
Tantan, give me your hand.

314
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,520
Are you okay?

315
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,760
I'm fine.

316
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,240
What did you pour in there?

317
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,520
Just a jug of wine.

318
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,600
This place used to be

319
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,840
a battlefield full of death.

320
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,480
The fallen soldiers

321
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,240
turned into a pit of quicksand
filled with grievances,

322
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,520
and it would appear
around the 15th every month.

323
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,920
So, I poured a jut of wine
to honor their souls.

324
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,110
Then the grievances dissipated.

325
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:07,800
Is the spiritual power
no longer effective

326
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,600
also because of the grievances?

327
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,350
Yes.

328
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,110
Tantan.

329
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,320
Cui Chen has been here for a while.

330
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,240
He's there.

331
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,760
By the way, why are you alone

332
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,400
in the middle of nowhere?

333
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,240
I'm going to Changluo Town
to look for a person

334
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,840
and happen to see you in danger.

335
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:37,840
Why don't you join us?

336
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,200
We're also going to Changluo Town.

337
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,440
Okay.

338
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,880
She did save your life,

339
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:45,600
but

340
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,320
how do you know
if she's up to something?

341
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,240
Don't worry.

342
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,560
We can look out for each other
with one more person.

343
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,640
I forgot to introduce myself.

344
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,840
My name is Feng Bao.

345
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,000
F-e-n-g.

346
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,280
B-a-o.

347
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,800
Feng Bao.

348
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,000
You have a beautiful name.

349
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,760
My name is Zhao Tantan.

350
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,680
Let me introduce my friends to you.

351
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,400
Let's go.

352
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,320
Xueyi, let's go.

353
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,640
Come on.

354
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,600
Let me introduce them to you.

355
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,960
This is Xueyi.

356
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,080
This is Huai Meng.

357
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,520
Zi Meng.

358
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:26,920
Qiu Yuebai.

359
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,360
Hu Meng.

360
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:32,760
Nice to meet you guys.

361
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:33,640
Nice to meet you.

362
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,000
Nice to meet you.

363
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,520
Tantan.

364
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,720
Well,

365
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,200
Cui Chen can sense
the scent of the lotus seeds.

366
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,320
I don't think we can do this
without Cui Chen.

367
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,800
I think you're right.

368
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,440
But since we have information
about the lotus seeds,

369
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,280
let's not trouble outsiders.

370
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,040
All right.

371
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,920
I'll go pick some wild fruits

372
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,960
and be back later.

373
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,880
I'll go with you.

- Mr. Qiu.
- Tantan.

376
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:16,840
This place is sparsely populated.

377
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,160
In case of danger, I'll go with you.

We can see her from far away.

What kind of danger can there be?

380
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,240
Besides, I wanna ask you
for business advice.

Do you have to ask me now?

382

Yeah.

411
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,760
I had a dream about you last night.

How about I tell you about it?

Don't touch them.

These are bloodvine flowers.

426

It's poisonous when it touches the skin.

427

How can you say that?

437
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,120
You told me to coax Tantan cheekily.

438
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,240
Now she thinks I'm oily.

439
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,360

There's nothing wrong with what I said.

But when you do it too far,

444
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,320
it does make you look oily.

00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,520
My goodness. Uncle.

00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,560
Can you stop giving useless hindsight?

Are we in a ghost town?

458
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,400
It used to be less prosperous
than Yunzhou,

459

but the streets were still bustling.

460

00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,480
Given the situation in Changluo Town,

562
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,360
I guess the pharmacy
has closed for a while.

563
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,080
The owner might be sleeping.

564
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,480
Let's come back tomorrow.

565
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,520
Okay.

566
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,880
Do you think
there is a night market here?

567
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,320
Do you also like night markets?

568
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:48,960
Well,

569
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,520
there are so many delicious food
and fun things in the night market,

570
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,680
affordable and various.

571
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,360
After I walk from one end
to the other, I'll be full.

572
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:56,680
You know what,

573
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,640
I can eat ten strings of candied haws
at a time.

574
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,600
Let's go over there.

575
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:08,720
Let's go.

576
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,040
My sister and I

577
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,320
also like to go to the night market.

578
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,240
Why are the stalls closing?

579
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,960
This town is so weird.

580
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,120
What's going on?

581
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,920
[Zhou's Silk Shop]

582
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,000
This shop is still open.

583
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,120
Let's check it out.

584
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:31,520
Come on.

585
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,480
Come back tomorrow.

586
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,320
Come...

587
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,280
Tomorrow?

588
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,040
Yes.

589
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,320
When will you open tomorrow?

590
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,480
When I wake up.

591
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,160
Sir.

592
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,200
You can't run a business like this.

593
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,560
You don't open during the day,

594
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,040
even you do, you close
after a short while.

595
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,320
There is nothing I can do.

596
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,720
Everyone in our town is like this.

597
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,480
There is a smell.

598
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,600
- It's a sour smell.
- Come back tomorrow.

599
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,400
Sir!

600
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,720
It's a sour smell.

601
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,640
There must be something wrong.

602
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,320
Why is there a strange smell?

603
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,360
Something's wrong.

604
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,440
Let's go.

605
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,280
Why is it the sour quilt again?

606
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,440
You're too sleepy
to remember the important thing.

607
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,720
You'll go to the neighboring town
tomorrow at noon

608
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,200
to deliver the new clothes to Mr. Wang.

609
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,600
You have to get up early.

610
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,720
All right.

611
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,360
Is our town

612
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,120
cursed?

613
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,000
Everyone is sleepy every day.

614
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,720
We have to sleep under

615
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,200
such a sour quilt,

616
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,360
so that we can wake up.

617
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,080
If we use a new quilt, we can't wake up,

618
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,000
and then we can't do business.

619
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,680
Stop saying it.

620
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,040
If this is heard,

621
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,960
you might never wake up again.

622
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,120
It's not that scary.

623
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,960
Go to sleep.

624
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,720
All right.

625
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,520
Are you okay?

626
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,720
It just occurred to me.

627
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,520
I think the people
in Changluo Town are sleepy

628
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,600
because of the quilts.

629
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,280
Well, let's come back tomorrow

630
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,280
and buy two new quilts from this shop.

631
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,720
Buy new quilts?

632
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,480
The owner just said

633
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,080
that sour quilts make them energetic,

634
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,880
and new quilts make them sleepy.

635
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,080
Tantan wants to test it

636
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,760
and see what's wrong with the new quilt.

637
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,720
Yes, that's what I'm thinking.

638
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,000
According to the owner's wife,

639
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:56,840
how long

640
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,560
and how well they sleep

641
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,400
seem to be related to the quilt,

642
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,480
and new quilts make them sleep longer.

643
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,560
So I'm thinking it must
have something to do with the quilt.

644
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,040
Come on.

645
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:10,960
Feng Bao, let's go.

646
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:11,480
Let's go.

647
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,320
Why does it take you so long?

648
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,040
Are you growing it?

649
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,400
We gave you so much money.

650
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,760
Why are you sleeping?

651
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,880
What?

652
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,480
I quit!

653
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,200
Don't disturb my sleep.

654
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,120
Where are you going?

655
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,400
Thank you.

656
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,000
He's gone too far.

657
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,080
What's wrong?

658
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,720
The waiter was mean to me.

659
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,200
He said he won't cook for us

660
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,760
and he's going to sleep.

661
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:44,920
Where is he?

662
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:45,760
Where is he?

663
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,440
I'll kick his ass.

664
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:47,680
Wait.

665
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,960
Don't you think it's strange?

666
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,800
Why does he always want to sleep?

667
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:52,760
Tantan.

668
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,320
I don't care.
I'm going to another place.

669
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,280
I can't stay
in this shabby place any longer.

670
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,480
We can't leave now.

671
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,160
All the shops are closed.

672
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,000
Did you find anything?

673
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,520
We've decided

674
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,640
to buy two new quilts tomorrow.

675
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,560
Why is that?

676
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,240
You'll find out then.

677
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,480
All the shops here

678
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,000
are only open for a few hours a day.

679
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,080
Everyone looks tired

680
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,120
and sleepy.

681
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,120
There's something strange
about Changluo Town.

682
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,000
Yeah.

683
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,440
My goodness.

684
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,360
Oh, right, there's a spell

685
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,280
that absorbs normal people's energy

686
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,640
and cultivators' spiritual power.

687
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,440
It's called...

688
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,520
What?

689
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,000
My goodness.

690
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:31,960
What is it called?

691
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,880
What is it called?

692
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,000
Uncle Zi Meng.

693
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,760
- Xueyi.
- Why are you being like this again?

694
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,560
He has this old problem.

695
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,560
Just get used to it.

696
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,640
Tantan.

697
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,440
What should we do now?

698
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,000
Let's wait for them to take the bait.

699
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,160
Where's Cui Chen?

700
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,840
Why isn't he here
to take care of Tantan?

701
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,360
Where's Cui Chen?

702
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:49,800
Where's Cui Chen?

703
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,440
There is someone who remembers me.
I'm back.

704
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,760
- Tantan
- Can anyone bring me some water?

705
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,200
Tantan.

706
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,600
Cui Chen.

707
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,320
That's all I can teach you

708
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,600
about the romantic ways
to win your girl back.

709
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,160
Sapling.

710
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,080
What?

711
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,120
You two finish this mission together.

712
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,480
No problem.

713
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,680
Cui Chen.

714
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,880
Do you know what's the most important thing
about being romantic?

715
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,200
It's the atmosphere.

716
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,560
When the dark clouds clear up,

717
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,480
and the full moon peeks out a little,

718
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,400
then you ask Tantan out. Understand?

719
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,000
Got it.

720
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,280
Good.

721
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,960
If you drink some wine

722
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,120
and get slightly drunk,

723
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,680
with tears in your eyes,

724
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,600
you can take the chance and hug...

725
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,520
Are you leaving?
Do you really understand?

726
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,720
It's finally done.

727
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,040
Why haven't the clouds dispersed?

728
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,120
My goodness.

729
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,560
Bro, I think the dark clouds

730
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,800
won't clear up for a while.

731
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,840
Why don't you go back to your room
and have some rest?

732
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,440
I'll tell you when the moon is full,

733
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,760
and then you can ask Tantan out

734
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,040
and drink with her. How is that?

735
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,160
Thank you, my bro.

736
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,440
You're welcome.

737
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,440
I'm leaving. See you later.

738
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,240
See you later.

739
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,000
Qiu.

740
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:46,680
Tantan.

741
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,320
Did Feng Bao ask you to come here too?

742
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,160
Yes.

743
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,960
Where is she?

744
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,840
I don't know.

745
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,560
Did the people working here decorate it?

746
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,240
They are thoughtful.

747
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,760
I was wrong about them this morning.

748
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:12,480
Tantan.

749
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,360
We rarely have such a chance.

750
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,560
Why don't we have a drink?

751
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,120
Okay.

752
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:16,760
Come on.

753
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:16,960
Come on.

754
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,040
My goodness, bro.

755
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,360
I've looked everywhere,

756
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,360
but I can't find Tantan.

757
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,640
She can't be here.

758
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,760
If she finds out

759
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,640
what we prepared...

760
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,280
Cui Chen is indifferent to you,

761
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,280
and you still care about it.

762
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,440
Tantan, I know
I shouldn't say this right now,

763
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,320
but I care about you.

764
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,320
Qiu.

765
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,520
No matter what relationship
I have with Cui Chen,

766
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,800
you're always my friend.

767
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,120
I know.

768
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,240
I care about you as a friend.

769
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,640
It's good enough

770
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,080
that we can drink and chat together.

771
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:54,680
Thank you.

772
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:58,960
Well...

773
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:00,960
Bro.

774
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,880
Since we've found her,

775
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,760
I'm gonna leave first.

776
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:05,840
Tantan.

777
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,120
Although the love between Hu Meng
and Zhu Yan is lamentable,

778
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,440
at least Zhu Yan is a faithful man.

779
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,960
Hu Meng's love for him is not wasted.

780
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,310
Cui Chen, on the contrary,

781
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:16,640
is full of righteousness and morality,

782
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,200
yet he treats love so casually.

783
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,230
You don't deserve this.
