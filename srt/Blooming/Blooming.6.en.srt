00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,640
OK. Go upstairs and get changed quickly.

194
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,230
OK.

195
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:29,760
Go ahead.

196
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,160
This way.

197
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,520
Go upstairs.

198
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,550
Miss, are you ready?

199
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,350
Yes.

200
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,670
Look,

201
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,320
the clothing quality here is poor.

202
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,200
There's a piece missing here and there.

203
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,030
Miss, the gentlemen
have arrived downstairs.

204
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:52,880
Let's go downstairs.

205
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,440
Really?

206
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:53,760
Yes.

207
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,320
Go.

208
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,080
Hurry.

209
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,550
Doodads and gadgets.

210
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,550
Sachets.

211
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,400
Zhao Tantan!

212
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,640
Thanks, sir.

213
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,400
Come on.

214
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,470
Come with me.

215
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:03,910
Come on.

216
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:04,790
Come on.

217
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,230
One more drink.

218
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:06,760
I can't.

219
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:07,840
Don't say that.

220
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,150
You can. Here.

221
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,550
Take it easy.

222
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,280
One more drink.

223
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,080
No.

224
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,350
Sir.

225
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,710
Are you OK?

226
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,200
Look.

227
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,150
He didn't drink much
before he collapsed.

228
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,670
Tell that girl to drink less.

229
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,320
She's supposed to entertain the guests
instead of drinking.

230
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,670
She has drunk it all by herself.

231
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,710
Who's going to pay the bill?

232
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:26,840
Yes.

233
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,670
Yes.

234
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:28,710
Miss, you...

235
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,550
What are you doing?

236
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,400
Miss.

237
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,760
Miss.

238
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,790
Miss.

239
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,470
What are you doing?

240
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,080
It's fate that makes us meet.

241
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,880
You're a good drinker.

242
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,150
Let's drink cross-cupped wine.

243
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,350
Yeah.

244
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,080
Yeah.

245
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,590
Cross cups.

246
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,110
Cross cups.

247
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:48,840
Cross cups...

248
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,470
We drink cross-cupped wine like this.

249
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,000
Great.

250
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,150
Sweet Dumpling!

251
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,000
Go change your clothes quickly.

252
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,280
Sir.

253
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,150
What did you say?

254
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,000
The fun tavern serving delicacies

255
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:21,880
is actually...

256
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,110
That's it.

257
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,670
It's the kind of place

258
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,790
where you sell yourself

259
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,150
to make money for others.

260
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,320
Yunzhou is a strange place.

261
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,030
You can neither get food in a hotel

262
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,400
nor drink decently in a tavern.

263
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,670
Let me remind you again.

264
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,350
Yunzhou isn't one of those towns

265
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,520
and villages you've been to.

266
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,080
There are numerous evil people.

267
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,280
What's this?

268
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,550
The maltose birdie you wanted.

269
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,110
It's broken.

270
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,640
It's OK. I can still eat it.

271
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,710
Sweet.

272
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,110
Try it.

273
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:02,760
Tantan.

274
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,670
Mr. Cui.

275
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,640
Qiu.

276
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,880
Finally, I found you.

277
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,760
What are you doing here?

278
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,520
Oh, you know what,

279
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,110
I was in such a mess.

280
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,230
I didn't even have a chance
to contact you.

281
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,320
I thought

282
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,640
after I arrived in Yunzhou,

283
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,710
I would find a place to stay
and then write to you.

284
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,710
I heard from Mo Yan

285
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,230
that you might be in Yunzhou.

286
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,400
I just wanted to take my chances.

287
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,230
And I did find you.

288
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,230
You're so well-informed.

289
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,320
You caught up with us quickly.

290
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:26,880
Yes.

291
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,200
I wanted to inform you

292
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,670
as soon as I heard about the lotus seed.

293
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,000
Have you found the seed?

294
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,760
Not exactly.

295
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:33,840
Mo Yan told me

296
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,400
the seed could be in Yunzhou.

297
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,790
But we still need Mr. Cui

298
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,080
to feel its exact location.

299
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,200
Sweet Dumpling,

300
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,670
have you felt it?

301
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,520
No.

302
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,350
It doesn't matter.

303
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,030
I'll ask Mo Yan to look for it again.

304
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,320
OK, then. I haven't had enough fun yet.

305
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,080
Haven't you?

306
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,880
Don't run around again.

307
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,910
We have to find a place to stay,

308
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,760
if you may excuse us.

309
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:09,230
Gotta go.

310
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,030
Hold on.

311
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,080
Guys,

312
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,400
my Seven Nights Inn has a branch

313
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,230
in Yunzhou.

314
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,670
Why don't you stay there?

315
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,080
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

316
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:17,320
I...

317
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,710
I was afraid Mr. Cui would mind.

318
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:22,710
(That look in his eyes...)

319
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,440
(He's too embarrassed to admit it.)

320
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,880
How could he?

321
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:30,030
Look, Mu Bai Zhenren is straightforward

322
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:30,910
and open-minded.

323
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,030
How could he mind that?

324
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:32,280
Look.

325
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:32,750
I...

326
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,800
We'll take it as a yes
if he doesn't deny it.

327
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,510
My future disciple,

328
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,270
your future master and her senior
are going to stay at your inn.

329
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,440
As for the charge...

330
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,190
It's free of charge. Let's go.

331
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:46,680
Come on.

332
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:47,360
Go.

333
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,240
Tantan.

334
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,150
Aren't you hungry?

335
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,710
I'll take you
to eat the best food in Yunzhou.

336
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,360
Mr. Qiu, keep the rooms.

337
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,880
We'll be there tomorrow. See you.

338
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,440
Well...

339
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:58,710
We're gonna get going.

340
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,000
Tantan.

341
00:12:59,360 --> 00:12:59,830
Mr. Cui.

342
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,120
Sir.

343
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,040
What's the rush?

344
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,040
Sir,

345
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,390
I've got news that

346
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,920
Cui Chen came across the servants
of the Er Mansion abducting scholars.

347
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,560
He's now heading to Yunzhou

348
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,750
for the Lotus Festival.

349
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,510
I'm afraid our plan would go wrong.

350
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:20,560
Unbelievable.

351
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,440
Instead of looking for his lotus seed,

352
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,270
Cui Chen is fond of meddling
in others' business.

353
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,150
It's OK. Don't mind him.

354
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,070
I'd like to see

355
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:32,360
if the former guardian
truly lives up to his name.

356
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,390
What about the Er Mansion?

357
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,950
Go around and inspect it.

358
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,120
Make sure nothing goes wrong.

359
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,560
Yes. Got it.

360
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,590
Cui Chen, don't let me down.

361
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:46,830
By the way,

362
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,830
is Zhao Tantan with him?

363
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:50,880
Yes.

364
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:56,630
The show has just begun.

365
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,320
[Seven Nights Inn]

366
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,040
Sir.

367
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:15,800
Sir.

368
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,390
Sir!

369
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,590
I thought you were deaf.

370
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,630
[Open at 11 p.m.]
Check in. Three rooms.

371
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:29,950
Put it down.

372
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,440
Sorry, we're not open yet.

373
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,510
Check-in time is after 11 p.m.

374
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:37,920
No rooms are available now.

375
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,680
Come back after 11 p.m.

376
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,800
11 p.m.?

377
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,560
Why is that?

378
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,150
It's our characteristic.

379
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,320
Also,

380
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,510
please don't touch my stuff.

381
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,320
That's not negotiable.

382
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,920

Sir,

00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,320
are you so blatant

547
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,110
You dare to talk back, don't you?

548
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,440
I can still fight.

549
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:26,470
Don't run!

550
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,230
Stop!

551
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:28,470
You stop.

552
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:28,920
Stop.

553
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,200
Zhao Tantan, I'll fight it out with you.

554
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,390
Don't be stupid.

555
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,630
She is here.

556

Zhao Tantan.

557
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,630
I'm here.

558

Nothing.

573
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,750
It's weird.

574
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,870
I think
I saw Mo Yan passing by just now.

575
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,440
Next time when they show up,

576
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,320
you don't have to bother Mo Yan.

577
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,720
Do you want me to bother you?

578
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:32,960
Am I not better than Mo...

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,470
I didn't kick you.

583
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,230
Don't blame it on me.

584
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:39,840
You've got it wrong.

585
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:43,110
I want to tell you about my guidebook.

Is the Goose Mansion so famous
in Yunzhou?

591
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,510
Yeah.

593
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,200
The Er Mansion has two features:

594

its view

595
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,350
and its owner, Mr. Er.

596

Mr. Er

597
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,040
is more of a bully

598
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,840
than a squire.

599
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,270

600
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,440

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:12,560

609

614
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,440
The Lotus Festival
seems not to be simple.

615
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,800
It has attracted so many cultivators.

616
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,110
Interesting.

617
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,440

Hello, fellow cultivators.

619

Are you here

620
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,150

621
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,040
That's right.

622

What is this Festival all about?

623

Don't you know?

624
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:53,440
You must come from an unknown sect.

Hold on.

628

Stay low.

635
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,150
Mu Bai Zhenren is also here.

636
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,470
We must come up with a plan.

637

Let's go.

638
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,200
Go.

639
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,960
They're so weird.

640
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,870
Why did they run away
on hearing your name?

641
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,840
The Lotus Festival
is getting more and more interesting.

642
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,960
[Seven Nights Inn]
I've just seen a few cultivators

643
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,040
from various sects walking by.

644
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,390
They're very secretive
about the Festival held in the Er Mansion.

645
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,150
What do you think the reason is?

646
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,080
Mr. Goose is abducting scholars

647
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,990
and throwing the Lotus Festival.

648
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,390
I think there's vast conspiracy.

649
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:47,600
Qiu said the lotus seed is in Yunzhou.

650
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:48,920
Do you think the Festival

651
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,270
is related to the lotus seed?

652
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,390
I mean there's a chance.

653
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,440
There's a chance

654
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,440
that during this trip,

655
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:58,750
we get the lotus seed back
from numerous experts

656
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:02,350
after having driven the golden fox away.

657
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,470
Do you think Master will be thrilled?

658
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:05,870
Of course.

659
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:07,840
If you can take back the seed

660
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,270
from the sects,

661
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,440
Master will be impressed.

662
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:13,840
It's definitely my duty

663
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,390
to take back the lotus seed,

664
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,390
only that...

665
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,990
only that the experts of the other sects

00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,870
we from the Qingyuan Sect

762
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,390
should be very important guests, right?

763
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,630
Having ignored worldly affairs
for years,

764
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,720
we can't necessarily
compare to a small unknown sect.

765
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:26,230
I don't believe it.

766
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:42,920
I'm Zhao Tantan from the Qingyuan Sect.

767
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,510
These two gentlemen...

768
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,080
OK. Maybe you didn't hear me clearly.

769
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,390
I'll say it again.

770
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,110
I'm Zhao Tantan from the Qingyuan Sect.

771
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:01,720
Stay back!

772
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,750
Are you kidding me?

773
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,390
Why do you let the nameless sect in

774
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,720
but refuse to let us in?

775
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,750
I dodge.

776
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,510
Tantan.

777
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,350
Tantan, look there.

778
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,480
[No entry
for the Qingyuan Sect and dogs.]

779
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,040
What kind of rule is that?

780
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,870
Do you geese want to be cooked?

781
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,440
Go.

782
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,080
Go away.

783
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:31,750
Go away.

784
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:32,750
Go.

785
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,390
- Go away.
- Get out of here.

786
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,350
We're bullied by geese.

787
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,470
As a great cultivation sect,

788
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,230
Qingyuan is actually looked down upon
by the Goose Mansion.

789
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,470
Tantan, chill out.

790
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:47,110
Qiu, don't misunderstand.

791
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:49,440
We rarely get this kind of treatment.

792
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,200
I was wondering who was yelling here.

793
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:54,390
Who is it?

794
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,720
It turns out to be the Poor-yuan Sect.

795
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,550
I've heard that Mr. Er

796
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:05,310
is a very generous man.

797
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,190
It isn't a bad idea
to apply for a servant job here.

798
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,080
Would you do it?

799
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:08,960
I wouldn't.

800
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,030
Then who should do it?

801
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,030
Fellow cultivators,

802
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,510
we didn't catch the golden fox
last time.

803
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,360
But I found that...

804
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,960
Just tell us what you found.

805
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,390
Tantan, you can't say.

806
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,760
Say.

807
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,510
Cui Chen, there's nothing we can't say.

808
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,550
If they know this...

809
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,670
Believe me. It's OK.

810
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,790
Don't change the subject.

811
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,670
Tell us quickly.

812
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:52,910
But this is a public place.

813
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,000
There are too many people.

814
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:56,640
Shall we find a quiet place?

815
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,840
A quiet place?

816
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:15,190
We knocked them out easily.
It isn't fun.

817
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,270
Are they alright?

818
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:18,190
The sleep spell will only
keep them unconscious for a few hours.

819
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,190
No harm.

820
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:22,550
But we've only got two invitations.

821
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,600
What should we do?

822
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,840
The Er Mansion is dangerous.

823
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,030
Mr. Qiu,

824
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,720
why don't you
return to the inn for a rest?

825
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,240
Qiu,

826
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,640
why don't you go back first?

827
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,030
You don't know magic arts.

828
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,760
You may get into danger.

829
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,480
OK, I'll do as you wish.

830
