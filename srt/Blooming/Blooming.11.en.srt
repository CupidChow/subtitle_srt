[Episode 11]

16
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,270
Is the gold here also yours?

17
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:48,870
Lemon spirit?

18
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,230
Yes.

19
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,040
I'm a lemon spirit.

20
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,910
You really are a lemon spirit.

21
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,800
You tricked me.

22
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,510
This is called 'All is fair in war.'

23
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,040
I was just a lemon

24
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,000
without life.

25
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,110
But luckily, I grew on a spiritual land,

26
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,750
then I gradually developed
a human form.

27
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,160
However, due to my special nature,

28
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,750
I emit an acidic smell,

29
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,390
and those who smell it become jealous

30
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,880
and even engage in fights.

31
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,360
Because of this,

32
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,830
the people around me
gradually distanced themselves from me.

33
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,190
Become jealousy

34
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,830
and engage in fights.

35
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,390
Did you hear that?

36
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,910
Senior Zou just said thank you to me.

37
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,880
To both of us.

38
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,630
Yes.

39
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,910
Did she say that to you?

40
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,440
Don't flatter yourself.

41
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,960
Senior Zou said thank you to me.

42
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,440
Look how smug you are.

43
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,720
Can you be less cheeky?

44
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,470
Stop staring at her.

45
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,630
You're drooling over her.

46
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,320
Me?

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,270
I haven't mentioned
the way you looked at Qiu Yuebai.

48
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,030
We were just acting.

49
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,800
Acting?

50
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,800
I think you're trying to make it real.

51
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,520
Turns out it's because of
the lemon's acid.

52
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,110
No wonder

53
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,360
I've been feeling strange lately

54
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,000
and getting jealous at times.

55
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,910
I also feel...

56
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,440
So, those who are close to you

57
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,110
will be affected by your acidic nature

58
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,110
and get jealous and competitive.

59
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,720
That's not entirely the case.

60
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,440
If the person
doesn't have similar thoughts,

61
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,390
there won't be an impact.

62
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,440
(Bai looks cute when he's asleep.)

63
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,750
(It won't work if the person
doesn't have similar thoughts.)

64
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,470
(Then I was affected because...?)

65
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,830
Go on.

66
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,360
Later, I heard that the medicine
of Central Plains is advanced,

67
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,360
so I came here to improve my nature.

68
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,160
I didn't expect

69
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,910
that I would end up
at the Qionghua Sect.

70
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,550
Can a lemon spirit join
the Qionghua Sect?

71
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,910
I cast a spell on Mr. Su that day

72
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,160
and hid it from him.

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
With Mr. Su's spiritual power,

74
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,190
do you think he couldn't tell it?

75
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,110
I don't know.

76
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,390
But since I joined the Qionghua Sect,

77
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,910
he has treated me well

78
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,720
entrusted me with important tasks.

79
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,160
I was all alone before.

80
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,440
The Qionghua Sect

81
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,510
and Mr. Su

82
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,550
are warm presences for me.

83
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,000
I swore to serve him with all my heart

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,920
without any other thoughts.

85
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,160
But as time went on,

86
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,070
I began to think of him

87
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,670
in a way I shouldn't have.

88
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:41,920
I know

89
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,480
that in his eyes,

90
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,760
I'm just a capable assistant.

91
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,480
I often remind myself

92
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,880
that due to my nature,

93
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,270
there is no chance for us
to be together.

94
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,720
To be honest, I thought

95
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,270
as long as I can stay by his side,

96
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,350
I would be content.

97
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,760
But that day, he said
that all beings are equal,

98
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,920
which gave me hope again.

99
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,270
So, I put my nameplate

100
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,390
into the Marriage Tripod.

101
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,040
We all fear

102
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,320
disappointment after having hope.

103
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,920
The night before
the Gathering of Fated Marriage,

104
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,200
Mr. Su decided to send me away,

105
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,670
and I couldn't stay by his side anymore.

106
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,110
I didn't want others to see me sad,

107
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,200
so I came here alone.

108
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,790
It's all my wishful thinking.

109
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,110
If you gave me hope,

110
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,920
why did you let me down?

111
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,790
I was just

112
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,270
a carefree lemon.

113
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,070
Why turn me into a spirit

114
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,760
and give me feelings?

115
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,000
Now I end up like this.

116
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,390
Oh, no, what should I do?

117
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,720
My goodness.

118
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,510
You melted a whole box of gold.

119
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,920
How many tears have you shed?

120
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,790
Looks like you really care about

121
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,510
Mr. Su.

122
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,320
I'm sorry.

123
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,110
You came at such an opportune time.

124
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,600
I had to put the blame on you.

125
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,390
It's okay.

126
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,440
Wait,

127
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,350
did you make

128
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,920
the Marriage Tripod leak
with your tears?

129
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:29,200
Oh my, you must have felt really awful.

130
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,830
Now that we know the truth,

131
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,230
let's go see Mr. Su.

132
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,160
I...

133
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:35,880
I dare not.

134
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,230
Why not?

135
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,830
Are you afraid
he'll ask you for compensation?

136
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,000
She's a lemon spirit.

137
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,950
If Mr. Su finds out the truth,

138
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,950
do you think he'll keep her with him?

139
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,950
Whether Mr. Su minds it or not,

140
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,670
she's been in charge of
the treasury vault.

141
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,830
You must come forward

142
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,230
and give an explanation
to the Qionghua Sect.

143
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,880
I understand.

144
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,000
I've been here for so long,

145
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,070
but I've never faced

146
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,550
Mr. Su and my fellow disciples
with my true identity.

147
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,920
It's unfair to them.

148
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,270
Besides, it concerns the reputation
of the Qingyuan Sect.

149
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,510
I should step forward.

150
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,600
Aren't you afraid
that Mr. Su will handle it impartially

151
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,000
and expel you from the Qionghua Sect?

152
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,390
Then you won't have any chance

153
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,440
to be by his side.

154
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,550
I didn't expect Senior Zou to be...

155
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,510
Stop calling her that.

156
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,790
She's a lemon spirit

157
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,200
who orchestrated the whole thing,
melting gold

158
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,440
and destroying the Marriage Tripod.

159
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,390
She doesn't deserve
to be in the Qionghua Sect!

160
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,320
- That's right.
- That's right.

161
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,360
- Yeah.
- She should have been kicked out
long ago.

162
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,510
Are you done?

163
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,320
She never hurt you guys.

164
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,480
How can you say that?

165
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,000
Everyone.

166
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,560
We've found out the truth
about the theft of the gold.

167
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,750
The gold melted

168
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,000
because of Zou Manqian's negligence.

169
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,390
It has nothing to do with
these cultivators from the Qingyuan Sect.

170
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,560
Here, on behalf of the Qionghua Sect,

171
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,630
I'd like to apologize to Miss Tantan,

172
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,440
Mu Bai Zhenren,

173
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,830
and Mr. Qiu.

174
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,240
I have decided

175
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,480
that this matter
won't be revealed to the public.

176
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,440
It will be settled
within the Qionghua Sect.

177
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,040
May I ask how you want to resolve it?

178
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,590
Zou Manqian is a lemon spirit.

179
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,830
Her acidic nature

180
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,390
will only bring more disasters.

181
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:10,950
That's right.

182
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,880
Zou Manqian is a thief,
and she framed others.

183
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,480
We can't keep such a person
in the Qionghua Sect.

184
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,510
Listen to me.

185
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,070
Zou Manqian is certainly at fault,

186
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,270
but she's admitted it.

187
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,240
Do you have to be so aggressive?

188
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,440
Tantan and I have forgiven her.

189
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,750
There's no need to bring it up again.

190
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,440
I can give you two boxes of gold
for Miss Zou.

191
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,440
Is it okay?

192
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,680
It's
the Qionghua Sect's internal affairs.

193
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,680
You have no right to interfere.

194
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,630
- That's right.
- Yeah.

195
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,510
That's right.

196
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:35,750
Enough.

197
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,630
Regarding the theft of the gold,

198
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,040
Zou Manqian was negligent
and shifted the blame onto others.

199
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,880
She should be punished severely.

200
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,750
But you've seen her contribution

201
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,070
to the Qionghua Sect over the years.

202
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:46,590
Her faults are offset by her merits.

203
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,150
Let's end this matter here.

204
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,270
Master.

205
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,320
I've decided.
There's no need to say more.

206
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,070
I'll take Zou Manqian
to the reflection room

207
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,560
where she'll reflect on her mistakes.

208
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,080
[Qionghua Sect]

209
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:06,680
Master.

210
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,830
Mu Bai Zhenren has arrived.

211
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:09,950
Mr. Su.

212
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,710
Mu Bai Zhenren, please.

213
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,070
Okay.

214
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,040
Mr. Su, I'm here

215
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,270
for the treasury vault.

216
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,070
Tantan and I were too rash,

217
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,000
and I apologize to you for that.

218
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,880
You don't have to apologize.

219
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,800
But when you broke into
our treasury vault,

220
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,440
it wasn't for

221
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,120
any of the treasures, right?

222
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,480
No wonder you're the leader.

223
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,390
Tanta and I came here

224
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,920
for the lotus seed.

225
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,040
That was also my guess.

226
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,510
The lotus seed of the Seven-Leaf Lotus

227
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,920
belongs to the Qingyuan Sect

228
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,240
and it should be returned to you.

229
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,680
Before you came,

230
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,070
I've ordered my disciples to bring it.

231
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,800
Thank you, Mr. Su.

232
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,070
If I had known earlier

233
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,150
that you are such a magnanimous man,

234
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,070
Tantan and I wouldn't have
wasted all this time

235
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,920
and caused you so much trouble.

236
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,590
As for the gold in the vault,

237
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,240
Manqian did it wrong

238
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,070
and made you suffer injustice.

239
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,560
Miss Zou has admitted her mistakes.

240
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,750
She is brave.

241
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,750
She's a good girl, but unfortunately...

242
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,000
You already knew

243
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,320
that Miss Zou is a lemon spirit.

244
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
All beings are equal.

245
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,360
What does it matter
whether I know or not?

246
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:21,390
Master.

247
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:22,680
Master.

248
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:23,750
What's wrong?

249
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,000
The lotus seed is missing.

250
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:26,880
What?

251
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,320
Mr. Su seems quite nice.

252
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,630
Why is he so mad this time?

253
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,000
Besides, you shed tears because of him.

254
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,590
How could he treat you like this?

255
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:49,950
If it wasn't for him,

256
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,480
I would have been expelled
from the Qionghua Sect by now.

257
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,000
Are you saying

258
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,070
he is protecting you?

259
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:01,590
Manqian.

260
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,320
What's going on?

261
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,590
The lotus seed is missing.

262
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,070
Because of the gold incident,

263
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,070
everyone in the sect suspects you.

264
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,360
Master sent me here.

265
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,680
Mu Bai Zhenren and him are waiting
in the treasury vault.

266
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,590
Hold it back.

267
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,270
The lotus seed

268
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,040
has been in this box all these years.

269
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,390
No one has ever touched it.

270
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,880
If it wasn't for this time

271
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,190
If it wasn't for this time,
to get the lotus seed for Mu Bai,

272
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,190
I wouldn't have known it was lost.

273
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,070
When Tantan and I first entered
the treasury vault,

274
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,510
we felt a strong scent
of the lotus seed.

275
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,320
Now, there is only

276
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,120
a faint scent of it left.

277
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,000
Master.

278
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,800
Senior Zou has arrived.

279
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:57,750
I didn't take it.

280
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,830
I don't know when it was stolen

281
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,750
and who did it.

282
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,920
But the treasury vault
is a forbidden place,

283
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,070
and the treasure has been kept
by Senior Zou.

284
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,680
Even when the disciples went in and out

285
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,710
to move things,

286
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,320
they did it
under Senior Zou's supervision.

287
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,040
Besides,
Senior Zou is different from us.

288
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,120
We're human beings.
You're a lemon spirit.

289
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,360
We're too species.

290
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,150
What's more, that lotus seed
isn't an ordinary item.

291
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,390
Anyone who gets it

292
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,390
can use it to increase spiritual power.

293
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,440
Am I right?

294
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,590
Since I joined the sect,

295
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,510
I have been diligent

296
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,590
and never coveted anything
from the sect.

297
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,390
It was an accident
that the gold disappeared.

298
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,000
But I had nothing to do
with the loss of the lotus seeds.

299
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,270
Could it be that your tears

300
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,000
melted the lotus seeds too?

301
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:37,630
You...

302
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,630
You're making baseless accusations.

303
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,920
Where's the evidence?

304
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:47,630
Mr. Su.

305
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:48,830
Are you mute?

306
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,070
Can't you say something?

307
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,240
It's our sect's business.

308
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,590
You have no right to interfere.

309
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:52,880
You...!

310
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,710
Are you the one

311
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,190
who conspired with her

312
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,320
to steal the lotus seed?

313
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:57,750
Shut up!

314
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,680
Finding out the truth needs evidence,

315
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,880
not speculation.

316
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,440
Anyone who breaks the rules again
will be punished.

317
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,000
Miss Zou doesn't have

318
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,240
the scent of lotus seed on her.

319
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,150
Why should we believe you?

320
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,630
I think we should tie her up

321
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,190
and search her all over.

322
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:15,880
Do you know who he is?

323
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:19,880
He's the famous Mu Bai Zhenren.

324
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,800
With his relationship
with the lotus seed,

325
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,120
what he said can be trusted.

326
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,560
Mr. Su, what do you think?

327
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,070
Of course, I believe
Mubai Zhenren's words.

328
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,190
But if we don't find the lotus seed,

329
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,950
she's still a suspect.

330
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,710
That's easy.

331
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,070
Check all the disciples
of the Qionghua Sect

332
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,510
one by one.

333
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,950
What nonsense
are you talking about, old man?

334
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,150
Except for Zou Manqian,

335
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,750
everyone in the Qionghua Sect
is an honest cultivator.

336
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,190
Except for you, a lemon spirit,

337
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,750
who else would covet the lotus seed?

338
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:49,630
Show.

339
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,150
Thank you for teaching
my incompetent disciple a lesson.

340
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,480
But it couldn't have been
one of our disciples.

341
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,390
They don't know about the lotus seed.

342
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,630
Even if they obtained it,

343
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,070
their spiritual power would change,

344
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,590
and I would surely know.

345
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,950
The disciples of the Qionghua Sect
couldn't have done it.

346
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,240
Zou Manqian couldn't have done it.

347
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,480
The participants of the gathering

348
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,440
couldn't have found

349
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,440
the treasury vault so easily.

350
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,360
Then the only one left is...

351
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,190
- Hu Meng.
- Hu Meng.

352
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,390
No wonder

353
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,040
I haven't seen her these days.

354
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,000
Turns out she ran away
after stealing the lotus seed.

355
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,950
We even helped her in Yunlai Town.

356
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,440
Who's Hu Meng?

357
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,270
The relationship lecturer
hired from outside for the gathering.

358
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,120
What kind of
relationship lecturer is that?

359
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,150
You're just making things more difficult

360
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,070
to charge exorbitant fees.

361
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,710
What's more, she's a golden fox.

362
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,440
She's very cunning.

363
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,590
How could this happen?

364
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,120
Lu Yi!

365
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,510
Wasn't he just here?

366
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,880
Go find him!

367
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,360
- Yes.
- Yes.

368
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,070
Wait,

369
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,590
find Hu Meng too,

370
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:51,950
and bring them to me.

371
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:52,680
Yes.

372
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,710
I'm sorry for what happened

373
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,560
in our sect.

374
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,510
On behalf of the Qionghua Sect,
I apologize to the Qingyuan Sect

375
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,950
and Mu Bai Zhenren.

376
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,390
Give me three days.

377
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,950
I'll find out the truth.

378
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,560
You don't have to say that, Mr. Su.

379
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,150
It's our lack of consideration

380
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,150
that allowed her to use us.

381
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,920
When I catch her, I'll make her suffer.

382
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,840
[Qiye Inn]

383
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,270
Tantan, don't be sad.

384
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:17,950
Eat something.

385
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,070
I'm not in the mood.

386
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,240
The lotus seed is lost.

387
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,070
It's the first time
I've cooked something myself.

388
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,880
Eat a little for my sake.

389
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,120
What happened to your hands?

390
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,070
It was my first time, and I was clumsy.

391
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,000
I'll do it better next time.

392
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,830
Thank you, Qiu.

393
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,120
Bai, how is it?

394
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,360
Mr. Su said

395
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,040
the two of them disappeared.

396
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,590
There's no trace of them
in the whole city.

397
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,680
He's sent people to find them
in every direction.

398
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,590
What should we do?

399
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,120
Mr. Su said
he will send more people soon

400
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,120
and expand the search range.

401
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,240
He told us to wait for his news.

402
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,150
Within three days,

403
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,590
he'll give us an answer.

404
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,040
Are we gonna do nothing

405
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,150
and wait around?

406
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,470
I've sent Mo Yan

407
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,960
to inquire about it
at the Qiye Inns across the country.

408
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,990
Qiu, you're thoughtful indeed.

409
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,440
Doesn't Uncle Zi Meng have

410
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,470
a team of little toads

411
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,110
who gather information
and record events for him?

412
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,200
They're good at it.

413
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,630
I bet they're better than your Qiye Inn.

414
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,560
I've sent them out.

415
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,840
Uncle Zi Meng.

416
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:24,870
That's impressive.

417
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:30,800
Wait.

418
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,350
What?

419
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,320
I'm hungry, and no one's eating it.

420
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:34,720
I made it for Tantan.

421
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,800
Eat banana.

422
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,110
The banana is...

423
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,510
I made it for Tantan.

424
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,270
I'm your future senior master.

425
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,630
Your future master won't mind it.

426
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:05,110
I'm glad you didn't eat it.
It's not good at all.

427
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:06,510
You need to improve your skills.

428
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,920
Be grateful to have something to eat.

429
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,080
Why do you have so many opinions?

430
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,320
Qiu.

431
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,680
I'm sorry.

432
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,470
If you cook for me next time,

433
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,110
I'll drink every drop of the soup.

434
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,560
I've lost my appetite. It's too salty.

435
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,350
Why do you have so many problems?

436
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,150
That's tense.

437
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:34,840
Oh, the jealousy.

438
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,600
Why aren't you in the reflection room?

439
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:50,200
I'm here to apologize and bid farewell.

440
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,200
But I've never wanted

441
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,920
to expel you from the Qionghua Sect.

442
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,680
I lied to you

443
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,150
and brought shame to the Qionghua Sect.

444
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,920
I feel too ashamed to stay here.

445
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,440
Manqian.

446
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,800
Actually, since the first time

447
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,600
I saw you,

448
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,990
I knew your identity.

449
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:26,510
Master.

450
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,800
These are the new disciples
we recruited.

451
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,270
(Why is there an acidic smell?)

452
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,080
(A lemon spirit?)

453
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,630
My wife is pregnant,

454
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,600
and she feels sour in her stomach.

455
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:50,990
We don't know what to do.

456
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,200
I heard from my mom

457
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,440
that she had the same problem
when she was pregnant with me.

458
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,750
Then she ate sour plums

459
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,110
and felt better.

460
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,390
From today on,

461
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,110
buy some plums every day

462
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,110
and deliver them
to Zou Manqian's room on time.

463
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:06,470
Yes.

464
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,200
(Why is there such a silly person?)

465
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,920
I wanted to use plums
to change your nature

466
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,960
and reduce the impact on others

467
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,680
due to your acidity.

468
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,390
But I didn't expect...

469
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:24,990
I like you.

470
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,560
Since I joined the Qionghua Sect,

471
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:34,680
you've been taking good care of me,

472
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,990
which gave me fantasies
that I shouldn't have.

473
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,200
I even want to...

474
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,960
I want to be with you forever.

475
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,920
I know it's impossible.

476
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,920
I thought...

477
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,720
As long as I don't say it,

478
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,720
I could be with you.

479
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,510
But my love for you has grown
day by day,

480
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,720
and I'm overwhelmed by it.

481
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,600
Today, I finally said it.

482
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,750
Now, I realize

483
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,560
I have to do this

484
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,230
before I give up.

485
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,110
I'll voluntarily leave the sect
tomorrow.

486
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:23,510
Manqian!

487
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:27,920
Well,

488
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,750
I'll let the gold incident pass.

489
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,390
Don't talk about leaving again.

490
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,800
I'll let you keep guarding
the treasury vault

491
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:39,390
as a way to make amends.
Are you willing to do it?

492
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,320
Yes.

493
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,720
[Marriage Stick]

494
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,320
Are you thinking about a boy?

495
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:04,630
Forget about me.

496
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,960
Look at yourself.

497
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,630
It's rare for you to smile like this.

498
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:11,040
Did you...

499
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,350
Don't overthink it.

500
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,040
It's not what you think.

501
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:17,470
But Mr. Su asked me
to stay and help him.

502
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,350
You've finally melted

503
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,600
half of such a big iceberg.

504
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,110
Keep it up.

505
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,320
What about you?

506
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,270
Me?

507
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,560
What about me?

508
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:34,080
I saw it. Don't hide it.

509
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,350
It's about your destined one, right?

510
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,960
Lu Yi is gone. Who is gonna
to interpret the stick for me?

511
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,840
I don't have to know,

512
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:49,680
but I just feel uncomfortable

513
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,870
when there is something unsolved.

514
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,200
Mr. Su.

515
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,440
Our Master

516
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,040
is an expert on stick interpretation.

517
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,110
He's accurate.

518
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,040
[Dew turns into frost since tonight.
The moon at home is more bright.]

519
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,680
Interpret it.

520
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,350
My friend, is this
how you ask a favor from someone?

521
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,270
If it weren't for the problems

522
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,230
within your Qionghua Sect,

523
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,110
would I need you to read the stick?

524
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,390
It's my mismanagement

525
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,440
that gave room for a traitor like Lu Yi

526
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,390
who used our business to make money.

527
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,510
All right.

528
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,560
It scared me

529
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,270
that you're apologizing

530
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,350
so formally.

531
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,350
I don't know
what Zou Manqian likes about you.

532
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,080
I'll interpret the stick.

533
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:54,720
Okay.

534
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,080
Your stick says,

535
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:03,150
'Dew turns into frost since tonight.
The moon at home is more bright.'

536
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,800
The 'dew' here refers to the White Dew season,

537
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,080
which is autumn.

538
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,920
No way.

539
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,440
It's Qiu and Bai,
[*Qiu means autumn; Bai means white.]

540
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,720
and Yue.
[*Yue means the moon.]

541
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,150
Could it be...

542
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,320
The key point of this stick

543
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,990
is the character 'Bai'.

544
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,630
No way.

545
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,870
How am I gonna face him?

546
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,800
I'm his master.

547
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:34,270
Zhao Tantan, your destined one is...

548
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:35,630
I know.

549
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:40,920
(How is it possible?)

550
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,470
(How could it be?)

551
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,510
(How could it be Qiu?)

552
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:55,110
Well,

553
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,510
could it be that Mr. Su made a mistake?

554
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,680
That's impossible.

555
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,320
Mr. Su is one of the best
stick interpreters

556
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,920
in the cultivation world.

557
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,390
Most cultivators are no match for him.

558
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,800
All right.

559
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,720
I know you like him.

560
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,630
We can't say anything bad about him.

561
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,510
No, he's really that good.

562
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,800
All right.

563
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,350
Your master is great.

564
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,750
But what should I do?

565
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,040
He's my disciple.

566
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,470
What's wrong with that?

567
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,960
You don't have the problem

568
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,080
that we have.

569
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,560
But Bai said

570
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,870
the Qingyuan Sect doesn't allow

571
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,680
disciples of different ranks
to be together.

572
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,840
Since he hasn't become your disciple,

573
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,870
then don't take him.

574
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,680
No.

575
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,320
Our relationship

576
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,840
is not that kind of relationship

577
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,270
that you and Mr. Su have...

578
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,630
Well,

579
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,230
do you have someone else in your heart?

580
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,040
What are you talking about?

581
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,510
I've never liked anyone in my life.

582
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,630
Really?

583
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:15,470
Real...

584
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:16,630
Really.

585
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,230
It's true.

586
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,560
Stop looking at me.

587
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,630
I know I'm pretty,

588
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:28,920
but stop looking at me.

589
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,230
Cheers, Mr. Su.

590
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,840
Mr. Cui, what are you gonna do?

591
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,320
I don't know
what the Xinlan Flower will bring.

592
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:47,750
In order not to involve her,

593
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:49,440
I'll pretend I don't know anything.

594
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:52,750
But Tantan is a good girl.

595
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,510
I know that.

596
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:58,470
What about you?

597
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:00,960
What can I do?

598
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,800
There's a gap between us

599
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,680
that can't be crossed.

600
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:08,350
Well, Mr. Su, you can interpret sticks,

601
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,750
but you're trapped in it.

602
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,270
There's a saying,
'A healer doesn't heal himself.'

603
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,680
Though I know my destiny,

604
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:17,750
I can't change
my unfortunate fate of love.

605
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,440
Cheers.

606
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,470
I've specially prepared a meal for you.

607
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:30,560
It's been hard for you guys
in the last few days.

608
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,870
(Is it really him?)

609
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,350
Tantan.

610
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,150
Come over and eat.

611
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,350
I...

612
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,080
I'm not feeling well.

613
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,630
You guys eat. Don't worry about me.

614
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,230
What's wrong?

615
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,040
Your face is red.

616
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,270
Your head is a little hot.

617
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,270
Are you not feeling well?

618
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,600
I'm fine.

619
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,720
You guys eat first. Don't mind me.

620
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,470
Let's eat.

621
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,120
[Dew turns into frost since tonight.
The moon at home is more bright.]

622
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:30,320
How could Qiu be my destined partner?

623
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,150
It's so annoying.

624
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,870
I wish Xueyi was here to talk to me.

625
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,270
Tantan.

626
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,270
Tantan.

627
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,870
I have something to tell you.

628
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:08,840
(Does he also know)

629
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,720
(that we're destined to be together?)

630
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,440
(Oh, no, how are we gonna
face each other?)

631
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,960
(It's so embarrassing.)

632
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,390
Tantan.

633
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,150
Tantan?

634
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,720
What do you want to say?

635
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,040
I said I have something to tell you.

636
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,200
Do you have to tell me now?

637
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,840
Before
the Gathering of Fated Marriage...

638
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,600
(The Gathering of Fated Marriage.)

639
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:39,470
(Why does he mention that?)

640
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,720
(Could it be about destined partners?)

641
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,390
I thought about it.

642
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,320
No matter how complicated the rules are,

643
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:45,560
as long as you take me as your disciple,

644
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,840
I'll be satisfied.

645
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,560
Well,

646
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,150
I have something to do.
I'll leave first.

647
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,440
Wait.

648
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:52,320
Tantan.

649
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,800
- Don't chase after me!
- Tantan!

650
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,800
What's happening?

651
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,870
I don't even dare to go back to my room.

652
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,870
Zhao Tantan,
you're too much of a coward.

653
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:04,990
Xueyi?

654
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:05,630
Tantan.

655
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,320
Tantan.

656
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:07,920
Xueyi!

657
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,270
I'm here.

658
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,110
Tantan.

659
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,230
You're finally here.

660
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,560
[Marriage Stick]

661
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,470
You're destined to be together.

662
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,990
No one can separate you two.

663
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,750
It's destiny.

664
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,040
You're destined to be together.

665
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:43,960
What?

666
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,440
Is your destined partner

667
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,200
someone I don't know?

668
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,390
Can you keep it down?

669
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,560
It feels good. Keep doing it.

670
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,200
Who's it?

671
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,510
Qiu Yuebai.

672
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,600
The one you cooed to me,

673
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,390
just the one...

674
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,920
The one who wants to be your disciple?

675
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,230
How embarrassing.

676
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:18,750
How can I be a destined couple
with my disciple?

677
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,270
If it gets out,

678
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,920
how am I gonna be the light of Qingyuan?

679
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,390
I've read something similar in a novel.

680
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,630
It's about a love story

681
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:28,150
of a stupid master
and a warm-hearted disciple.

682
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,390
But it's pretty good.

683
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,040
I've told you many times

684
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,630
to stop reading such novels.

685
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:35,990
It'll make you stupid.

686
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:36,510
Who is becoming stupid?

687
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:37,470
Me? I'll leave then.

688
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,630
Don't.

689
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,870
What should I do if you leave?

690
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,200
Come on, believer.

691
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,110
Tell me what's bothering you.

692
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,720
Although it's the master
of the Qionghua Sect

693
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,840
who interpreted my marriage stick,

694
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,350
I've never liked anyone.

695
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:03,110
I don't even know

696
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,750
what it feels like to like someone.

697
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:08,150
Do we really like each other

698
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:11,150
as a man and a woman?

699
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,230
I'll tell you how it feels
to like someone.

700
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,680
It's like eating candy one moment

701
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,750
and drinking vinegar the next.

702
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,270
Which novel did you read that from?

703
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,230
My novel...

704
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:24,920
Who said I read it from a novel?

705
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,600
No way.

706
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,440
I just left not long ago,
and you have someone you like.

707
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,230
It happens fast when you like someone.

708
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,600
Tell me who he is.

709
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,630
Is he handsome? Is he tall?

710
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:49,560
He's the one you brought back
to the back side of the mountain.

711
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,510
The one I brought back?

712
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,270
Oh my God, it's Huai Meng!

713
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:02,990
You...

714
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,230
When did you...?

715
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:11,470
How can you be sure you like him?

716
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,630
Look, I didn't know at first.

717
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,720
But when I saw him, my heart raced.

718
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,200
It was pumping fast.

719
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,510
Then I wanted to talk to him,

720
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,630
but every time I opened my mouth,

721
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,390
I got snippy.

722
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:23,600
What are you doing here?

723
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:24,920
I...

724
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,960
I'm tired of flying and taking a rest.

725
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,350
Smell it.

726
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,630
You've got a muscle strain.

727
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,080
Lift your little arm.

728
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,040
I'll apply the medicine for you.

729
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:56,470
You...

730
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,990
It's none of your business.

731
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,800
What's wrong?

732
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,510
It seemed to be true.

733
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,040
If that's the case,
why are you still hesitating?

734
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,600
Just be together with Qiu Yuebai.

735
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,990
It's not Qiu.

736
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,800
It's...

737
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:15,840
Your face is red.

738
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,430
Your head is hot.

739
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,360
Are you not feeling well?

740
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,320
Who is it?

741
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:30,270
It's Bai.

742
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,430
Aren't you two enemies?

743
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:39,080
That was a long time ago.

744
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,190
We've been getting along better lately.

745
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:46,190
But I don't like him the way you said.

746
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,600
Besides, I'm destined
to be with Qiu Yuebai.

747
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,400
Do you have any other way

748
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,120
to confirm my feelings?

749
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,270
There's another way.

750
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,400
What is it?

751
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:00,400
Remember.

752
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,750
When another woman approaches him,

753
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:04,990
your heart gets...

754
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:05,640
It's like...

755
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,400
It's like...

756
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,270
It's like...

757
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:12,880
It's like

758
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:13,910
this.

759
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,560
Got it?

760
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:18,750
Yes.

761
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:20,910
Stop staring at her.

762
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:22,950
You're drooling over her.

763
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,880
Why am I thinking of him again?

764
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,640
Don't tell me
you're thinking of Senior Bai again.

765
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,750
Is there really something
going on between you two?

766
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,670
No.

767
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,840
Last time, it was because of

768
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,880
Zou Manqian's acid.

769
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,910
Trust me. That must be the reason.

770
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,470
Well,

771
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:54,430
have you ever got jealous
because of Qiu Yuebai?

772
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:00,990
I don't think so.

773
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,120
It's okay. We have one last method.

774
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,710
The last one will definitely work.
