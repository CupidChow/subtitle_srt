=Episode 9=

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,712
(I Will Become His Majesty's Woman)

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,480
Someone!

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,280
Chief Wu is harassing me!

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,840
Everyone else avoids me.

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,240
Yet you boldly approach me.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,200
Because I know
you're a good man, my lord.

9
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,120
From the first time you helped me,

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,720
I knew you are a good man.

11
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,880
All you ever show

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,640
is just to make others fear you

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,160
and keep a distance.

14
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,400
Because you fear others getting close.

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,720
You fear those you care about
leaving you eventually.

16
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,960
(Let's escape together!)

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
(I'll protect you.)

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,920
(Run. Live well.)

19
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,968
My lord,

20
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,800
am I right?

21
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,000
Nonsense.

22
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,720
Thank you, my lord.

23
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,640
Remember our agreement.

24
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,720
Ru Yi, are you still mad?

25
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,240
Everything
I told those people was a lie.

26
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,840
Don't be petty.

27
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,320
Petty?

28
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,720
I heard what you just told them.

29
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,440
You agreed to poison Ling Yun, right?

30
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,000
Didn't you say
you would never bully Ling Yun again?

31
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,200
I'll go tell her now.

32
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,680
Ru Yi, wait.

33
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,600
I'd never dare harm Ling Yun.

34
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,240
My words to Chengxi Palace people

35
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,280
were all an act.

36
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,440
I pretended to agree,

37
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,320
so Consort Wan's faction

38
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,000
would go easier on me.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,480
I'd never hurt Ling Yun.

40
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,440
Trust me.

41
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,080
I-I swear to heaven.

42
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,600
I will never harm Ling Yun.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,040
If I break this oath,

44
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,840
may lightning strike me dead.

45
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,520
May I rot in the imperial harem

46
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,160
as a Servitude Bureau slave forever.

47
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,400
Your oath makes no sense.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,280
If lightning kills you,

49
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,160
how would you serve as a slave forever?

50
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,840
So you believe me?

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,320
Today's chamber pots
aren't scrubbed yet.

52
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,240
Could you help me scrub them?

53
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,200
Cui Wei,

54
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,928
I've done enough chores for you lately.

55
00:02:44,928 --> 00:02:45,840
Come on.

56
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,120
Ru Yi, please.

57
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm injured right now.

58
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,520
Help me this once.

59
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,720
When my butt heals,

60
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,240
I'll scrub yours. Okay?

61
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,000
Just help me.

62
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,840
If I don't finish today,

63
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,080
the matrons will scold me.

64
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,760
Please help me.

65
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,000
Keep your promise, okay?

66
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,600
I-I swear.

67
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,360
Do your own chores from now on.

68
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,880
This is the last time I help.

69
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,392
- How did this happen?
- How did this happen?

70
00:03:23,392 --> 00:03:24,448
- Yes.
- Exactly.

71
00:03:24,448 --> 00:03:25,588
How did this happen?

72
00:03:25,588 --> 00:03:27,456
- When did this happen?
- She was fine yesterday.

73
00:03:27,456 --> 00:03:28,320
How could this be?

74
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,904
- This is horrible.
- Yes.

75
00:03:31,904 --> 00:03:34,040
She was fine when I saw her.

76
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,440
How could she be like this?

77
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,360
I have no idea.

78
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,000
Do you know what happened?

79
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,960
No.

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,984
Ru Yi.

81
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,584
Ru Yi?

82
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,536
Ru Yi?

83
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,120
Ru Yi.

84
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,264
Ru Yi.

85
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,112
Ru Yi!

86
00:04:09,844 --> 00:04:10,752
Ru Yi.

87
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,200
So tragic.

88
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,640
- Chengxi Palace's men came last night.
- Was she framed?

89
00:04:29,716 --> 00:04:30,836
How tragic.

90
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,040
Who did this?

91
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,120
Ru Yi was gone before bedtime.

92
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,280
We found her dead this morning.

93
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,200
Consort Wan has arrived.

94
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,680
After entering the Servitude Bureau,

95
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,840
you even forgot basic etiquette?

96
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,480
Seize her.

97
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,320
How did Ru Yi offend you?

98
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,280
Why did you kill her?

99
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,480
How dare you question me?

100
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,784
Shun Xi,

101
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,520
cut her tongue out.

102
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,600
Yes, Your Highness.

103
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,480
Abusing a maid

104
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,600
and disregarding lives,

105
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,640
you act wildly
in Fourteen Bureaus' territory.

106
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,800
Aren't you afraid Chief Wu
will punish you?

107
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,520
Still talking tough before you die?

108
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,480
Do it.

109
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,840
I'll take responsibility.

110
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,240
Consort Jing has arrived.

111
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,080
Consort Wan, what are you doing?

112
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,560
This shameless maid attempted
to harm Concubine Zhao

113
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,600
and framed me days ago.

114
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,320
She deserves to be taught a lesson.

115
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,360
Do it.

116
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,240
Why don't you do it?

117
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,960
Who dares?

118
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,520
I was present
at the Spring Banquet that day.

119
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,600
If I recall correctly,

120
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,880
His Majesty pardoned this maid's life

121
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,280
and sent her here.

122
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,600
Today, you make
such a grand display here,

123
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,080
baying for blood.

124
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,400
His Majesty wants her to live,

125
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,800
yet you demand her death.

126
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,880
Could it be

127
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,080
that you want to defy
His Majesty's decree?

128
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,680
(Consort Jing,)

129
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,600
you saved my life.

130
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,680
Should the day come

131
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,720
when you need my help,

132
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,600
I will spare no effort

133
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,480
to repay your grace.

134
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,560
I just happened to pass by today,

135
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,200
witnessed this affair,

136
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,880
and spoke the truth.

137
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,280
Every life,

138
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,560
inside or outside the imperial harem,

139
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,040
belongs to His Majesty.

140
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,680
If gratitude is owed,

141
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,760
thank His Majesty for sparing your life.

142
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,600
Only His Majesty determines our fates.

143
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,280
I shall never forget your edification.

144
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,496
(Only His Majesty has the right)

145
00:07:30,496 --> 00:07:32,051
(to decide life and death for all.)

146
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,520
(I must find a way
to gain His Majesty's favor.)

147
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,760
They claim Ru Yi took her own life,

148
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,480
violating palace rules.

149
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,680
So she can only be dumped
in a mass grave.

150
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,160
Life is unpredictable.

151
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,880
Just like this cruel
spring chill in March.

152
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,320
Ru Yi was so kindhearted,

153
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,320
yet heaven subjected her
to such cruelty.

154
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,160
Where is divine justice?

155
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,040
I'll seek a chance to beg mercy for you.

156
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,480
Leave the palace while you can.

157
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:45,984
No.

158
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,160
I will stay.

159
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,840
Didn't you ask me

160
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,360
who I truly am?

161
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,760
Today, let me tell you.

162
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,160
I am Consort Wan's death warrant.

163
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,840
She murdered my parents.

164
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,520
I survived countless horrors

165
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,040
just to seek vengeance against her.

166
00:09:05,824 --> 00:09:06,848
Now,

167
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,880
she has taken my only friend Ru Yi

168
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,080
from me too.

169
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,520
From this day forth,

170
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,520
I will use any means,

171
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,320
even losing my soul,

172
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,760
to see Consort Wan

173
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,240
torn limb from limb.

174
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,040
But she's an imperial consort.

175
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,600
How can you challenge her?

176
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,360
I will become His Majesty's woman.

177
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,904
(I'll make everyone
respect me, fear me,)

178
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,440
(and bow before my authority.)
