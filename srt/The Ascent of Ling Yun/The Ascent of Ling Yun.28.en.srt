=Episode 28=

3
00:00:13,427 --> 00:00:15,840
(I Was Just Your Blade Before)

4
00:00:15,988 --> 00:00:17,856
(Yongxiu Palace)

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,144
Bi Da?

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,360
What brings you here?

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,600
I came to see
whether you're still alive.

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,040
I know you still hold resentment.

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,880
If it could bring you joy,

10
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,640
I'd do anything.

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,200
Did someone send you medicine today?

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,280
How are you?

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,200
I'm perfectly fine.

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,280
Why ask this suddenly?

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,200
Did Consort Jing send you
to investigate?

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,296
No.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Since you're fine,

18
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,464
I'll take my leave.

19
00:00:54,592 --> 00:00:55,616
Bi Da.

20
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,800
Stop serving Consort Jing.

21
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,760
All these years,

22
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,560
she's only treated you

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,400
as a puppet for her own comfort.

24
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,120
Her possessiveness over you
is unnatural.

25
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,880
If this continues,

26
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,680
you'll be destroyed by her.

27
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,640
Don't you see?

28
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,736
Are you done?

29
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,680
Her shackles on you

30
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,760
and weaponizing you will never end.

31
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,800
The blood on your hands will only grow.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,920
Ling Yun,

33
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,000
by what authority

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,120
or position do you say this to me now?

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You used to be

36
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,800
His Majesty's woman,

37
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,080
commanding me as a master.

38
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,120
Now, you're nothing.

39
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,400
Why should I listen to you?

40
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,040
They'll deceive you,

41
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,600
use you, and manipulate you.

42
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,600
But I'm your sister.

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,200
Of course, I don't want you...

44
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,080
Enough!

45
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,424
What sister?

46
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,440
Before,

47
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,480
I could be your blade.

48
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,600
Now,

49
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,080
why can't I be Consort Jing's blade?

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,640
Did Wu Linfu truly say that?

51
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,480
I wouldn't dare deceive you.

52
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,160
That's more like it.

53
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,360
Alright.

54
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,520
Go collect your reward.

55
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,032
Thank you, Your Highness.

56
00:02:28,192 --> 00:02:29,160
Wu Linfu

57
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,240
requests audience.

58
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,416
Come in.

59
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,800
Greetings, Your Highness.

60
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,128
Rise.

61
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,936
Your Highness,

62
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:44,960
the medicine

63
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,120
was sent by Noble Lady Mu.

64
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,760
And Ling Yun is fine.

65
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,000
She is fine,

66
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,520
yet I am not.

67
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,200
Why would you say that?

68
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,520
Dispose of Noble Lady Mu.

69
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,344
Your Highness,

70
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,920
Noble Lady Mu currently
enjoys imperial favor.

71
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,800
Acting too overtly

72
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,120
might ruin your plans.

73
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,360
I truly don't understand

74
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,840
what she could possibly be after
by working so hard

75
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,400
to win His Majesty's favor?

76
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,760
In this palace,

77
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,120
no woman doesn't want
His Majesty's affection.

78
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,040
It's different. Zhao Lian'er,
Consort Wan acted for the Zhao family.

79
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,000
Ling Yun seeks vengeance.

80
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,200
As for Noble Lady Mu,

81
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,200
she engages
in underhanded schemes daily,

82
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,240
showing no dignity.

83
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,760
What's her true aim?

84
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,056
I don't know.

85
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,600
I'm weary.

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,840
You may leave.

87
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,944
Yes.

88
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,120
Your Highness, shall I
summon the physician?

89
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,144
Unnecessary.

90
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,760
It's about my concern.

91
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,440
You are

92
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,720
still troubled over Noble Lady Mu?

93
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,360
Both Noble Lady Mu and Ling Yun

94
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,720
must die.

95
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,520
What are you trying to do?

96
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,120
Get up and eat.

97
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,360
Before, it was half-cooked rice,

98
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,400
barely filling,

99
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,400
so I endured it.

100
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,080
But this is completely raw.

101
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,800
How can this be eaten?

102
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,200
My duty is merely delivering meals.

103
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,800
This meal wasn't prepared by me.

104
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,120
If you don't want to eat,

105
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,840
then cook something yourself.

106
00:05:03,348 --> 00:05:04,768
(Fourteen Bureaus)

107
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,488
Chief Wu,

108
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,960
I need to talk to you.

109
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,928
De Gui,

110
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,160
what do you need?

111
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,760
My lord,

112
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,600
I know

113
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,000
you've been suffering lately.

114
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,600
So I must

115
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,000
speak frankly with you.

116
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,400
Tong An and I
entered the palace together as children.

117
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,720
We were the closest friends.

118
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,400
You grieve for Tong An's passing.

119
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,800
Actually, my sorrow runs deeper.

120
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,800
But I know

121
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,880
Tong An wasn't killed by you.

122
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,440
He chose death to protect you

123
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,800
after committing that act.

124
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,360
Before dying, Tong An asked me

125
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,520
to watch over you in his stead.

126
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,920
When someday you need assistance,

127
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,000
I'll walk through fire for you,

128
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,400
to honor Tong An's spirit.

129
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,104
De Gui,

130
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,240
we can't let Tong An's death be in vain.

131
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,880
There's a matter

132
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,000
I've been planning carefully.

133
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,640
I need your discreet help

134
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,088
to smuggle someone

135
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,440
into the palace to meet me.

136
00:06:19,603 --> 00:06:21,568
(Yongxiu Palace)

137
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,280
Your Ladyship,

138
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,376
you're finally awake.

139
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,560
I've prepared medicine and ginseng soup.

140
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,920
Please drink them now.

141
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,400
De Gui,

142
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,360
did His Majesty send you here?

143
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,080
No.

144
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,480
I was passing by

145
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,800
and wanted to see you.

146
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,200
How did you end up in such a state?

147
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,008
I'm fine.

148
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,520
How is Chief Wu lately?

149
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,440
He's been handling
Noble Lady Mu's affair for Consort Jing.

150
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,560
If he disobeys,

151
00:07:02,592 --> 00:07:03,600
Consort Jing

152
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,920
finds new ways to torture him.

153
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,480
Are you saying

154
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,400
Consort Jing tortures Chief Wu?

155
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,280
Exactly.

156
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,920
Or else she will torture you.

157
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,200
Oh my!

158
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,520
I spoke out of turn again.

159
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,960
(So)

160
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,280
(he's still trying to help me.)

161
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,400
(He's never changed.)

162
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,600
How are Noble Lady Mu

163
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,360
and His Majesty lately?

164
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,416
Somehow,

165
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,000
His Majesty had her background
secretly investigated.

166
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,440
It turns out she's not
from Shihezi as claimed,

167
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,040
but connected
to the southwest Prince Mu's Mansion.

168
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,720
That's all I know.

169
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,400
(The southwest Prince Mu's Mansion?)

170
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,440
(That's right.)

171
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,480
(Earlier, I heard she plays the yueqin.)

172
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,040
(More importantly,)

173
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,920
(in some southwestern regions,)

174
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,440
(married women
wear golden keys at their waists.)

175
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,536
Noble Lady Mu

176
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,200
is from the southwest
Prince Mu's Mansion?

177
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,000
The Prince Mu's Mansion

178
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,720
remains loyal to the previous dynasty.

179
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,600
Could it be she entered the palace

180
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,960
to assassinate His Majesty?

181
00:08:14,964 --> 00:08:17,480
(Fourteen Bureaus)

182
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,440
Chief Wu,

183
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,840
the person you requested is here.

184
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,360
Greetings, my lord.

185
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,088
You're Bi An?

186
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,560
Yes, I am.

187
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,560
Before the Fourteen Bureaus' Chief,

188
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,632
why don't you kneel?

189
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,880
Do you seek to die?

190
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,880
Greetings, my lord.

191
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,440
As a Bi family kinsman

192
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,896
and elder,

193
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,176
formalities are waived.

194
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,880
He did this just to show you

195
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,960
things are different in the palace.

196
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,280
You must learn
what's appropriate to say,

197
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,240
what's not,

198
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,120
what's appropriate to do,

199
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,520
and what's not.

200
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,640
Bi family kinsman?

201
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,832
You are...

202
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,240
I'm Bi Da.

203
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,320
Greetings, Your Majesty.

204
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,672
What's wrong?

205
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,720
I've noticed suspicious behavior
from someone.

206
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,400
So I took him into custody.

207
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,280
Later, during interrogations,

208
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,520
I discovered great secrets behind him.

209
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,680
I dare not handle it carelessly.

210
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,880
Your Majesty, I wished
to seek your judgment.

211
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,832
Bring him in.

212
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,400
Since you have
important matters to discuss,

213
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,040
I shall take my leave now.

214
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,176
Your Ladyship, please wait.

215
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,000
During the interrogation of that person,

216
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,280
I found connections between him

217
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,800
and Noble Lady Mu.

218
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,400
I believe

219
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,760
you should stay and hear this.

220
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,360
Your Majesty,

221
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,448
he's here.

222
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,560
Pay respects to His Majesty.

223
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,480
I'm Bi An.

224
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,360
Greetings, Your Majesty.

225
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:16,680
Rise.

226
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,680
Thank you, Your Majesty.

227
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,360
Your Majesty,

228
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,880
he is a kinsman
of the Bi family from Qiongzhou.

229
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,880
Years ago, the Bi family
suffered extermination.

230
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,640
Behind this extermination

231
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,680
lies a shocking secret.

232
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,360
A family extermination?

233
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,880
What's the secret?

234
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,304
Your Majesty,

235
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,280
the Bi family's extermination occurred

236
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,440
because the Bi family

237
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,480
adopted an orphaned girl.

238
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,040
The girl escaped
during the extermination

239
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,680
and remains missing.

240
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,640
A girl?

241
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,592
Yes.

242
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,040
Normally a mere girl

243
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,120
would be insignificant,

244
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,464
but

245
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,680
this girl's true identity...

246
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,680
Before His Majesty,

247
00:11:02,752 --> 00:11:03,760
you can't conceal facts.

248
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,768
Yes.

249
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,480
The true identity of that girl

250
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,240
is a lost princess
from the previous dynasty.

251
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,280
Princess from the previous dynasty?

252
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,544
Exactly.

253
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,880
Your Majesty,

254
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,240
I also discovered

255
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,480
this previous princess

256
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,960
actually

257
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,080
resides within the imperial harem.

258
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,560
Bi An,

259
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,560
do you still recognize
the previous princess?

260
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,480
I do.

261
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,040
She didn't leave the Bi family

262
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,960
until her teens.

263
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,960
If you see her now,

264
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,440
can you identify her?

265
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,440
Though I haven't seen her for years,

266
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,160
a child's core features

267
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,240
remain recognizable through growth.

268
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,720
So I could make
an approximate identification.

269
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,000
Consort Jing has arrived.
