00:00:06,323 --> 00:00:10,912
=The Ascent of Ling Yun=

2
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:13,376
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:13,376 --> 00:00:15,680
(You Wretch,
Daring to Harm Her Highness!)

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,800
Your Highness's coronation
is so magnificent.

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,160
The entire imperial harem
envies Your Highness today.

6
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,880
His Majesty is so devoted to me.

7
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,400
Zhao Lian'er and her ilk

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,080
will likely seethe
with jealousy all night.

9
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,520
In the imperial harem,

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,120
you hold His Majesty's most favor,

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,440
and you're unmatched.

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,800
They aren't worthy

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,960
to even dust off your shoes.

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,600
Lift the carriage.

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,240
Return to the palace.

16
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,680
Who do you think you are

17
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,040
to walk beside Her Highness?

18
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,280
Get to the back!

19
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,320
(Chengxi Palace)

20
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,440
Starting today,

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,240
you shall serve
as Chengxi Palace's cleaning maid.

22
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,300
Remember.

23
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,280
You can only do courtyard cleaning.

24
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,400
No entry to halls.

25
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,280
Learn the rules properly

26
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,320
and fulfill your basic duties.

27
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,720
I

28
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,920
was personally selected by Her Highness.

29
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,680
Why assign me to cleaning duty,

30
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,360
such a simple task?

31
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,760
What? Do you find it beneath you?

32
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,040
Chengxi Palace is the imperial harem's
most prestigious residence.

33
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,680
People are dying to get in.

34
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,200
Yet you show ingratitude?

35
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,120
Being a Chengxi Palace cleaning maid

36
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,360
is a fortune earned
through lifetimes of virtue.

37
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,480
Know your place

38
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,120
and do your duties.

39
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,640
If you break our palace's rules,

40
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,800
you'll forfeit your pathetic life.

41
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,832
Understood.

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,720
I heed your instructions.

43
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,608
Hmph!

44
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:13,216
(Chengxi Palace)

45
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,200
- We congratulate Your Highness on the coronation.
- We congratulate Your Highness on the coronation.

46
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,600
- For Your Highness,
- For Your Highness,

47
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,960
- may blessings flow endlessly,
- may blessings flow endlessly,

48
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,480
- imperial favor endure forever,
- imperial favor endure forever,

49
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,880
- joy persist through ages,
- joy persist through ages,

50
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,560
- and majesty bloom eternally.
- and majesty bloom eternally.

51
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,768
Be seated.

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,240
- Thank you, Your Highness.
- Thank you, Your Highness.

53
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,440
Congratulations.

54
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,360
The coronation ceremony is grand.

55
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,160
It truly reflects His Majesty's
unique favor towards you.

56
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,960
How we envy such distinction.

57
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,040
Your celestial beauty

58
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,440
ensures His Majesty's lasting affection.

59
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,400
Such fortune exceeds our humble hopes.

60
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,400
Your Highness's lasting youth

61
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,320
ensures endless favors.

62
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,880
Henceforth we must

63
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,800
rely on Your Highness's guidance.

64
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,200
Well said.

65
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,680
To retain imperial favor,

66
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,680
one must master beauty preservation.

67
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,760
- Greetings, Your Highness.
- Greetings, Your Highness.

68
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,120
- May endless fortune bless you.
- May endless fortune bless you.

69
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,520
Consort Wan, your management duty
over the Six Palaces must be exhausting.

70
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,240
Today I notice your complexion

71
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,920
appears distressingly haggard.

72
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,040
How fortuitous.

73
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,440
I recently acquired a divine elixir.

74
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,160
It's rumored

75
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,600
to smooth wrinkles
on aging women's faces

76
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,400
and restore gray hair to black.

77
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,760
Being youthful myself,

78
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,440
I do not need such a remedy.

79
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,448
Therefore,

80
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,400
I offer it as your coronation gift.

81
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,640
You're truly blood sisters.

82
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,680
Your own younger sister's thoughtfulness

83
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,720
outshines our humble gestures.

84
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,800
Your consideration touches me.

85
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,080
My beauty needs no artificial aid,

86
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,200
so spare your remedy.

87
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,200
Keep it for your own use.

88
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,760
Don't fault my concern.

89
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,880
Beauty fades swiftly,

90
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,080
and you are our senior.

91
00:04:18,336 --> 00:04:19,360
I merely

92
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,640
wish to help you
maintain imperial favor.

93
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,600
Please accept my sincere offering.

94
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,480
Greetings, Your Highness.

95
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,120
Please have some tea.

96
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,680
Ah! A worm!

97
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,544
Ah!

98
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,600
You wretch!

99
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,240
You dare scheme against me?

100
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,400
You fool,

101
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,680
breaking Concubine Zhao's gift.

102
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,960
Who permitted this clumsy fool to serve?

103
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,480
Your Highness.

104
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,640
Mercy, Your Highness.

105
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,800
I was sweeping under the trees earlier.

106
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,680
That worm might fall on my body.

107
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,040
And I didn't notice.

108
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,440
Your Highness, show mercy.

109
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,880
Please spare me.

110
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,520
I'm magnanimous.

111
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,960
So I won't hold it against you.

112
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,720
But it belonged to Concubine Zhao.

113
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,320
Shouldn't you apologize to her?

114
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,920
Please calm your anger.

115
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,120
I admit fault.

116
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,720
I beg your forgiveness.

117
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,280
Fine.

118
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,760
Want my forgiveness?

119
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,840
Kneel on the broken porcelain shards.

120
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,320
Let this be a lesson.

121
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,440
Concubine Zhao,

122
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,560
today marks my coronation ceremony.

123
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,160
How can we allow bloodshed?

124
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,240
Your name?

125
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,440
I'm Ling Yun.

126
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,680
You may leave.

127
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,640
Yes, Your Highness.

128
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,840
(Chengxi Palace)
One look from Her Highness

129
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,040
changes nothing.

130
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,200
Know your lowly status!

131
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,712
Jin Yu,

132
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,680
I dare not harbor such ambitions.

133
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,720
The entire palace knows

134
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,000
Her Highness trusts you most.

135
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,800
I'd never overstep.

136
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,880
I follow your lead absolutely.

137
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,320
Mark my words.

138
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,280
If you dare appear
before Her Highness unsummoned again,

139
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,400
I'll end you.

140
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,440
Go.

141
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,912
Go to the backyard.

142
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,120
Distribute the herbs to all.

143
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,472
Fail this task,

144
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,400
and I'll skin you alive.

145
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,240
This bundle is Zi Yan's.

146
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,640
This one's for Madam Yu.

147
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,160
And this is

148
00:07:00,224 --> 00:07:01,504
for Du Juan.

149
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,320
Why does my wound hurt so much?

150
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,440
The hair-washing herbs contain salt.

151
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,360
No wonder Jin Yu sent me to pack herbs.

152
00:07:16,308 --> 00:07:18,144
(Ling Yun)

153
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,160
This bundle is mine.

154
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,920
Why does it
smell different from others'?

155
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,584
Mine has been soaked

156
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,200
with Bone's Bane's sap.

157
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,120
(This poison's scent is faint.)

158
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,000
(Only a bloodhound nose
like mine could tell.)

159
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,008
(Jin Yu,)

160
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,120
(you keep blocking my path.)

161
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,840
(Now you're using such a poison on me?)

162
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,240
(Then don't blame me.)

163
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,464
Ya Rong,

164
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,872
are you ready?

165
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,992
Yes, Your Highness.

166
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,200
Your Highness.

167
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,000
It's today's hair-washing herbal bundle.

168
00:08:17,428 --> 00:08:22,144
(Consort Wan)

169
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,630
My lord.

170
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,480
How dare you show your face here?

171
00:08:38,592 --> 00:08:39,584
My lord,

172
00:08:39,584 --> 00:08:40,960
don't be angry.

173
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,040
You betrayed me first.

174
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,320
I merely used you to please Consort Wan.

175
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,360
We're even now.

176
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,960
Good at balancing, huh?

177
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,880
I just fear you still hold a grudge.

178
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,960
Look.

179
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,440
I brought a peace offering.

180
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,320
This is

181
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,480
the hair-washing herbal bundle
Jin Yu gave me.

182
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,240
I've been saving it for myself,

183
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,640
but I offer it to you respectfully.

184
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,920
- A gift?
- Yes.

185
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,560
It's my sincere gesture.

186
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,080
Keep it safely, my lord.

187
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,720
You are not planning
to frame me again, are you?

188
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,120
I swear,

189
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,960
this isn't a trap.

190
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,160
Do remember to use it tomorrow.

191
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,480
Tomorrow morning.

192
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,304
I take my leave.

193
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,920
Master,

194
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,800
something feels off about her.

195
00:09:41,939 --> 00:09:43,488
(Ling Yun)

196
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,560
Let's watch

197
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,320
what tricks she'll play.

198
00:09:53,076 --> 00:09:56,224
(Chengxi Palace)

199
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,040
Forgive me, Your Highness!

200
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,080
My hair...

201
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,160
My hair!

202
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,120
What's happening?

203
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,200
Ah!

204
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,400
What's wrong with my hair?

205
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,400
Investigate this!

206
00:10:41,952 --> 00:10:42,976
You wretch,

207
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,160
daring to harm Her Highness!

208
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,248
Take her away!

209
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,784
Move!

210
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,280
Enough.

211
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,160
Drag her away.

212
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,152
Flog her to death.

213
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,360
Your Highness, please!

214
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,800
Your Highness, have mercy!

215
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,496
You wretch!

216
00:11:10,496 --> 00:11:12,040
You dare plot against me?

217
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,000
Confess the truth.

218
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,960
Who ordered you?

219
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,584
Your Highness,

220
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,200
even with ten lifetimes' courage,

221
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,880
I would never dare harm you.

222
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,960
I truly don't know what happened.

223
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,400
Let alone taking orders.

224
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,800
I'm falsely accused.

225
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:24,960
I beg your fair judgment.

226
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,160
You vile wretch!

227
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,920
Facing death and still lying?

228
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,560
You prepared the herbal bundles.

229
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,000
You poisoned
Her Highness's herbal bundle

230
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,440
and ruined her hair.

231
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,040
You deserve death!

232
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,440
I merely distributed prepared bundles

233
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,640
according to the registry list.

234
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,360
If poison were added by me,

235
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,200
I'd inevitably be implicated.

236
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,480
Why would I commit such foolishness?

237
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,240
I beg Your Highness's fair judgment.

238
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,720
Your Highness,

239
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,760
this wretch is glib

240
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,760
and deceptive.

241
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,640
Please order

242
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,200
this insubordinate wretch's
immediate execution.

243
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,232
Jin Yu,

244
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,520
why are you so eager to kill me?

245
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,320
- Do you want to silence me?
- You...!

246
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,200
I, Wu Linfu,

247
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,040
pay respects to Your Highness.

248
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,192
Rise.

249
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,840
What brings you here, Chief Wu?

250
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,080
I discovered palace maid Ling Yun's
hair-washing herbal bundle

251
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,560
contained Bone's Bane.

252
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,880
Poisoning violates palace taboos.

253
00:12:17,216 --> 00:12:18,112
I dared not delay

254
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,072
and came to investigate.

255
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,000
Hmph!

256
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,960
You wretch.

257
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,800
You poisoned Her Highness

258
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,520
and even attempted to poison Chief Wu!

259
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,792
Jin Yu,

260
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,800
I merely regifted the herbal bundle

261
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,640
you gave me to Chief Wu.

262
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,640
If this constitutes poisoning,

263
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,440
then I'm merely bearing blame for you.

264
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,600
You wretch!

265
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,280
Daring to implicate me?

266
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,720
Your Highness,

267
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,080
Ling Yun frames me.

268
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,360
She poisoned you!

269
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,568
I beg your fair judgment.

270
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,680
I never poisoned anyone.

271
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,120
Your Highness and Chief Wu,
I beg your fair judgment.

272
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,560
It's easy to find out

273
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,600
who the poisoner was.

274
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,048
Chief Physician Zhang.

275
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,760
Greetings, Your Highness.

276
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,280
Your Highness,

277
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,080
identifying the poisoner is simple.

278
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,960
Bone's Bane's sap

279
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,280
has a distinctive odor

280
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,000
that attracts insects to devour it.

281
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,320
Moreover, it stains hands persistently.

282
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,800
Have both maids

283
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,760
dip their hands into an ant nest.

284
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,800
Whose hands get swarmed

285
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,840
and bitten

286
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,400
is the poisoner.

287
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,320
Bring the ant nest.

288
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,592
At once.

289
00:13:18,707 --> 00:13:20,576
(Chengxi Palace)

290
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,080
Both of you, hands in now.

291
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,600
I'd like to see

292
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,040
who dared poison me.

293
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,760
Your Highness,

294
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,840
you know well

295
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,480
I've always feared insects.

296
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,480
I'll undergo this test
to prove innocence.

297
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,000
Guards!

298
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,600
Force her hands in!

299
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,648
I... I...

300
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,680
(Fortunately, when swapping bundles,)

301
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,640
(I never directly touched the herbs.)

302
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,808
(Consort Wan)
(Jin Yu, since this is your scheme...)

303
00:14:27,808 --> 00:14:28,760
(Consort Wan, Ling Yun)

304
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,200
(Reap what you've sown.)

305
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,792
Your Highness,

306
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,000
clearly Jin Yu poisoned you.

307
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,768
Jin Yu?

308
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,080
It was you?

309
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,640
Why poison me?

310
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,880
No!

311
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,800
It wasn't me!

312
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,080
Your Highness, I'm innocent!

313
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,600
I'm innocent!

314
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,880
The evidence is irrefutable.

315
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,920
You dare claim innocence?

316
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,248
Guards!

317
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,960
Take this treacherous maid
to the Disciplinary Court

318
00:15:07,968 --> 00:15:08,960
to await punishment.

319
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,840
No one moves!

320
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,160
My servants

321
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,480
shall be disciplined by me alone.

322
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,600
No outsiders shall interfere.

323
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,736
I wouldn't presume.

324
00:15:16,768 --> 00:15:17,760
However...

325
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,440
After all, she serves at my palace.

326
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,280
Chief Wu, your authority
seems to be overreaching.

327
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,312
Guards!

328
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,680
Take Jin Yu away.

329
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,120
Apply 20 strikes.

330
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,080
Chief Wu,

331
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,960
I won't see you out.
