(The Way to Leave the Servitude Bureau)

4
00:00:21,267 --> 00:00:22,515
Give me some soap.

5
00:00:24,404 --> 00:00:25,280
Got it.

6
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,720
Ling Yun.

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,880
Madam wants

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,280
these clothes washed

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,160
before nightfall.

10
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,200
You'll never finish

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,360
if you don't stop being sluggish.

12
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,960
That's my own business.

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,480
Stay out of it.

14
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,376
Ling Yun.

15
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,040
I know Ru Yi's death

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,520
deeply upsets you.

17
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,720
But you can't

18
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,680
take your anger out on me.

19
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,800
Ling Yun.

20
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,080
Are you still holding a grudge

21
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,360
for how I mistreated you and Ru Yi?

22
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,160
I...

23
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,360
Ru Yi is gone.

24
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,520
Why bother bringing it up?

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,440
Given our current situation,

26
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,880
we should focus on our duties

27
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,880
and try to get out of this place.

28
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,768
That's what matters.

29
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,760
I have no mind for anything else.

30
00:01:20,852 --> 00:01:21,716
I left it here.

31
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,640
(Did this wretch)

32
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,160
(find a way to get out of here?)

33
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,480
(I'll see)

34
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,960
(what you're up to.)

35
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,472
Eunuch Tong An.

36
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,760
I knew you'd pass by here at this hour.

37
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm waiting for you.

38
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,320
Lady Ling Yun.

39
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,168
What brings you here?

40
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,600
Please help me.

41
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,824
Just this once.

42
00:02:02,432 --> 00:02:03,296
This is improper.

43
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,360
Smuggling items into the palace

44
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,320
is a grave offense.

45
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,160
If anyone finds out,

46
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,520
I'll be doomed.

47
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,960
I'm in a desperate situation right now.

48
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,496
Ru Yi

49
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,840
is gone.

50
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,320
If I don't get out
of the Servitude Bureau,

51
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,080
I'll die there too.

52
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,760
Please help me.

53
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,720
There are people around.

54
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,320
I'll be in trouble.

55
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,968
I swear.

56
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,080
Just this once.

57
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,160
If you can get me out of there,

58
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,280
I'll remember your kindness

59
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,680
and repay you.

60
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,600
You do sound desperate.

61
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,960
Considering your ties with my master,

62
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,568
I'll help you once.

63
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,872
Thank you.

64
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,016
(This wretch)

65
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,920
(actually found a way to escape.)

66
00:02:48,339 --> 00:02:50,176
(Fourteen Bureaus)

67
00:02:50,176 --> 00:02:51,264
Master.

68
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,040
Ling Yun gave me money just now.

69
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,600
It's...

70
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,400
Was it switched?

71
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,880
It was a bag of stones

72
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,960
to begin with.

73
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,280
Return this to her

74
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,680
in private.

75
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,760
Master.

76
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,232
Doesn't it count

77
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,320
as an illegal exchange?

78
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,920
You're getting talkative lately.

79
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,832
I spoke out of turn.

80
00:03:20,832 --> 00:03:21,880
Rest well, Master.

81
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,848
I'll take my leave now.

82
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,560
I'll make everyone respect me, fear me,

83
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,000
and bow before my authority.

84
00:03:34,624 --> 00:03:35,552
My lord.

85
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,024
Either help me

86
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,720
become His Majesty's women

87
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,720
and win his favor

88
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,752
or

89
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,320
from now on,

90
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,920
we sever

91
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,712
all ties.

92
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,624
This is going to be

93
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,680
an unknown path.

94
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,880
I don't wish to burden you.

95
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,440
Thank you.

96
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,920
I will never forget

97
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,200
your kindness.

98
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,480
Why do you need this pill?

99
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,800
I struggled

100
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,400
to acquire it outside the palace.

101
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,160
I have eyes in Chengxi Palace

102
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,480
and I learned that

103
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,560
Consort Wan had been seeking this pill.

104
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,320
She still resents me,

105
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,080
but if I offer her

106
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,080
this pill,

107
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,160
she'll surely be moved.

108
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,720
Then I'll beg for her favor

109
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,560
to leave the Servitude Bureau.

110
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,680
(Ling Yun.)

111
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,520
(Don't blame me.)

112
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,960
(I must seize the opportunity)

113
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,440
(to leave this awful place.)

114
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,760
Where is my brocade box?

115
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,040
Where is my brocade box?

116
00:05:30,048 --> 00:05:30,816
Stop.

117
00:05:31,616 --> 00:05:33,000
Did you take my brocade box?

118
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,048
Brocade box?

119
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,520
What brocade box?

120
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,440
I haven't seen it.

121
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,000
That box means everything to me.

122
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,880
Give it back.

123
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,720
What do you want?

124
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,480
You can't convict someone
without evidence.

125
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,160
You may not like me.

126
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,440
But you shouldn't frame me.

127
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,312
Give it back.

128
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,480
Chief Wu has abandoned you.

129
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,920
No one will protect you now.

130
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,960
How dare you be so arrogant?

131
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,400
With such insolence,

132
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,840
you shall rot in the Servitude Bureau.

133
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,160
I'll say it one last time.

134
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,680
Give me back the box now,

135
00:06:05,328 --> 00:06:06,528
and I'll let this matter drop.

136
00:06:06,528 --> 00:06:08,280
Didn't you hear me?

137
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,880
I'll also say it one last time.

138
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,600
I didn't take your worthless box.

139
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,472
But

140
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,080
seeing you panic over losing it

141
00:06:16,256 --> 00:06:17,680
does give me some satisfaction.

142
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,280
Cui Wei.

143
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,640
Nothing is as simple as it appears.

144
00:06:21,952 --> 00:06:22,912
If I deliver the pill

145
00:06:22,912 --> 00:06:23,840
in that box,

146
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,080
I will be released.

147
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,120
But if you do it,

148
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,600
you'll die.

149
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,920
Arrogant fool.

150
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,000
Spouting nonsense.

151
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,232
Cui Wei,

152
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,080
don't say I didn't warn you.

153
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,640
Staying here,

154
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,840
at least you'll survive.

155
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,000
And there's hope.

156
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,080
But if you insist on leaving,

157
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,600
then you're heading to your grave.

158
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,480
May you be free
from servitude in the next life

159
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,920
and live with integrity.

160
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,120
Move.

161
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,400
Ling Yun.

162
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,680
Cui Wei said

163
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,040
she'd ask for a decree

164
00:07:21,152 --> 00:07:22,120
to leave here today.

165
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,040
How is she

166
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,080
going to do that?

167
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,360
- If only we could
- Hurry up.

168
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,520
do the same.

169
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,952
Don't envy her.

170
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,880
Fortune and disaster are intertwined.

171
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,480
We'll see

172
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,680
how it ends.

173
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,872
Silence.

174
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,760
This is the Imperial Garden.

175
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,000
Be quiet.

176
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,600
His Majesty,
Consort Wan, and Consort Jing

177
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,640
are admiring flowers.

178
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,280
If you disturb them,

179
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,880
your heads will roll!

180
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,640
- Understood.
- Understood.

181
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,680
Consort Jing,

182
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,440
before I entered the palace,

183
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,200
my brother told me

184
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,080
to be friends with the fellow consorts

185
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,760
and serve His Majesty well.

186
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,240
I unintentionally

187
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,080
offended you a few days ago.

188
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,520
I beg for your forgiveness.

189
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,320
No offense taken.

190
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,640
I never dwell on trivial matters.

191
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,680
We both devote ourselves to
serving His Majesty.

192
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,400
We ask for nothing

193
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,880
as long as His Majesty is happy.

194
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,160
You're right.

195
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,488
Consort Wan.

196
00:08:23,488 --> 00:08:24,840
Consort Jing is magnanimous.

197
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,840
Let bygones

198
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,800
be bygones.

199
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,040
And your brother General Wansong...

200
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,320
Terrific.

201
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,280
He won

202
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,400
another battle at the border for us.

203
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,720
His troops returned a few days ago.

204
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,880
I've been contemplating

205
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,440
how to reward him.

206
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,680
Your Majesty,

207
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,120
I know little of state affairs,

208
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,480
but

209
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,680
it's been so long
since I last saw my brother.

210
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,080
May I ask

211
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,760
Your Majesty

212
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,280
to grant permission
for my brother to visit me briefly?

213
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,568
Alright.

214
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,880
Siblings tend to care for each other.

215
00:08:56,448 --> 00:08:57,480
I will host a banquet

216
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,680
in the Imperial Garden for your brother.

217
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,880
You two may see each other then.

218
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,320
Thank you, Your Majesty.

219
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,744
(Ling Yun.)

220
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,120
(Now you can't escape.)

221
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,880
Move aside.

222
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,960
Eunuch Shun Xi.

223
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,960
May I humbly

224
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,080
request your assistance?

225
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,944
Well,

226
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,280
look who it is.

227
00:09:36,512 --> 00:09:37,216
If it isn't

228
00:09:37,216 --> 00:09:38,920
the convicted servant
of Fragrance Bureau,

229
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,192
Cui Wei.

230
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,280
This is a small token of my respect.

231
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,760
Please kindly accept it.

232
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,280
I possess a treasure
to present to Consort Wan.

233
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,680
Her Highness will be delighted.

234
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,000
Please convey this request to her.

235
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,280
Her Highness is admiring flowers
with His Majesty.

236
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,600
How could she spare time for a convict?

237
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,920
Get lost.

238
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,640
Consort Wan.

239
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,840
Consort Wan!

240
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,320
- This is urgent.
- How dare you!

241
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,408
- Consort Wan!
- Silence her.

242
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:10,480
Consort Wan.

243
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,128
I have a treasure for you.

244
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:14,816
- Wu Linfu, take a look.
- I have a treasure for you!

245
00:10:15,347 --> 00:10:16,256
Understood.

246
00:10:16,256 --> 00:10:17,160
Consort Wan.

247
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,080
Drag her out.

248
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,944
Wait.

249
00:10:20,032 --> 00:10:20,992
Oh my.

250
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,240
Chief Wu.

251
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,960
This servant is raving

252
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,800
and I was just expelling her.

253
00:10:26,784 --> 00:10:27,840
State your business.

254
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,840
Chief Wu,

255
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,440
I'm offering Consort Wan a treasure.

256
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,480
She will be pleased.

257
00:10:32,512 --> 00:10:33,504
Is that so?

258
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,240
Then come with me.

259
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,760
May Your Majesty be well.

260
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,120
May Your Highnesses be well.

261
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,960
Why did you

262
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,960
bring this menial maid
before His Majesty?

263
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,024
Your Highness.

264
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,800
I shouldn't have,

265
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,000
but this maid claimed

266
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,360
to have a treasure for you.

267
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,160
I dared not dismiss her

268
00:11:04,448 --> 00:11:06,080
and allowed her to present herself.

269
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,200
A treasure?

270
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,040
For me?

271
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,760
Your Highness.

272
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,000
I heard you seek this object.

273
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,600
I've obtained it after great effort.

274
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,480
That's why I boldly came

275
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,720
to present this.

276
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,480
(The Asuji Pill?)

277
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,680
What's your name?

278
00:11:36,992 --> 00:11:38,080
I am Cui Wei,

279
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,640
a convicted servant.

280
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,920
I see. You may leave.

281
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,960
Has Your Highness forgotten something?

282
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,640
Your Highness,

283
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,160
I obtained this treasure for you

284
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,680
in hopes of being freed

285
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,360
from the Servitude Bureau.

286
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,600
I beg your mercy.

287
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,560
I know. Leave us alone now.

288
00:11:56,672 --> 00:11:57,640
Thank you.

289
00:11:57,728 --> 00:11:58,880
Thank you, Your Highness.

290
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,080
Wait.

291
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,480
I saw a pill in that box.

292
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,880
A pill from a maid

293
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,920
must be inspected even if it's precious.

294
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:09,760
How naive you are

295
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,880
to accept it so readily.

296
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,640
Your health matters most.

297
00:12:12,736 --> 00:12:13,720
Don't consume

298
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,000
unverified medications.

299
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,200
I'm also curious.

300
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,760
What pill could be so valuable

301
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,200
to earn your favor?

302
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,800
It's just a tonic pill.

303
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,080
I've been preparing tonic pills.

304
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,440
I only accepted this

305
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,960
to honor her goodwill.

306
00:12:30,912 --> 00:12:31,880
Consort Jing

307
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,160
knows herbalism.

308
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,280
Let her examine it for you.

309
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,960
Reward this maid

310
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,176
after we

311
00:12:38,176 --> 00:12:39,240
inspect the pill.

312
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,928
Lv He.

313
00:12:45,728 --> 00:12:46,600
Your Highness.
