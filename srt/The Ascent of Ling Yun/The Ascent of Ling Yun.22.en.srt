=The Ascent of Ling Yun=

2
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:13,312
=Episode 22=

3
00:00:13,427 --> 00:00:15,808
(Seeking Death's Release?
It's Not That Easy!)

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,040
Who are you?

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,320
Don't touch me!

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,160
Don't touch me!

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,080
Restrain her hands.

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,720
Chief Physician Zhang,

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,680
I want to know

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,120
what Consort Wan's ailment is.

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,360
Your Majesty,

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,600
Consort Wan's pulse
is forceless to the touch

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,520
and hollow if pressed.

14
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,840
This suggests
extended use of unknown medications

15
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,000
nearly depleting her vital energy.

16
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,920
Hence these pulse manifestations.

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,440
What exactly happened?

18
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,440
What unknown medications
has she been taking?

19
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,400
Tong An,

20
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,280
search her palace.

21
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,152
At once.

22
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,800
Greetings, Your Majesty
and Your Highnesses.

23
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,240
Your Majesty,

24
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,880
I know what caused
Her Highness Consort Wan's madness.

25
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,984
Her Highness isn't taking any medicine.

26
00:01:17,984 --> 00:01:18,848
Rather,

27
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,640
she's practicing forbidden blood art.

28
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,840
She baths in human blood

29
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,040
to vainly pursue immortality

30
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,200
and eternal youth.

31
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,040
Forbidden blood art?

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,800
To restore her beauty

33
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,240
and regain Your Majesty's favor,

34
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,120
Consort Wan
requires daily blood from maids

35
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,280
for her blood baths.

36
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,840
Two maids already

37
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,240
were bled dry and died horribly.

38
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,880
Please see clearly.

39
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,000
We beg Your Majesty to save our lives.

40
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,880
Do you know the penalty
for slandering a consort?

41
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,040
Where's your proof?

42
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,144
What Ling Zhu said

43
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,000
is true?

44
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,464
Heh.

45
00:01:58,976 --> 00:01:59,880
Ling Zhu,

46
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,720
serving my bath with your blood

47
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,160
is your greatest honor.

48
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,280
Your greatest honor!

49
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,240
Your Majesty, we found this
in Consort Wan's bathing chamber.

50
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,592
Heed my decree.

51
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,440
Consort Wan has doomed the harem

52
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,840
and slaughtered innocents.

53
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,120
She's stripped of

54
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,240
her title and rank

55
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,520
and cast to Cold Palace,

56
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,680
never to be pardoned!

57
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,072
Your Majesty,

58
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,640
I have more to report.

59
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,040
Speak.

60
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,160
I've discovered that

61
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,440
though claimed
as the Zhaos' eldest daughter,

62
00:02:41,696 --> 00:02:42,656
in truth,

63
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,040
Consort Wan was a Yangzhou courtesan
adopted by them.

64
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,920
They deceived the court

65
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,240
to plant her in the palace.

66
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,080
It's said

67
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,240
the forbidden art of blood-bathing youth

68
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,440
is secret knowledge
of Yangzhou courtesans.

69
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,496
Where's your proof?

70
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,200
Your Majesty,

71
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,056
here's the contract

72
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,840
from when Zhao Wansong purchased

73
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,240
Liu Yanluo, the top courtesan

74
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,520
of Cuiying House,
also known as Zhao Yanwan today.

75
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,800
How audacious the Zhao family is!

76
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,424
Heed my decree:

77
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,608
Zhao Wansong

78
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,840
is guilty of deceiving me

79
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,040
and is unforgivable!

80
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,000
Stripped of military rank,

81
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,840
he's now a commoner

82
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,480
with assets confiscated

83
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,000
and clan exiled to Ningguta.

84
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,360
As for Noble Lady Yun,

85
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,120
for exposing this deception,

86
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,400
she shall be promoted

87
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,120
to Concubine Yun.

88
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,720
Thank you, Your Majesty.

89
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,840
I shall remain ever prudent

90
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,920
and worthy of your favor.

91
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,560
Your Majesty,

92
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,480
I'm no Yangzhou courtesan.

93
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,840
I'm not a Yangzhou courtesan!

94
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,600
I'm Consort Wan!

95
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,240
Your Consort Wan,

96
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,360
Your Majesty!

97
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,080
Didn't you once
adore my unparalleled beauty?

98
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,080
Don't believe that wretch Ling Yun.

99
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,200
Don't believe that wretch Ling Yun!

100
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,120
Her slanders mean nothing, Your Majesty!

101
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,720
Your Majesty!

102
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,520
You Zhao sisters
monopolized imperial favor.

103
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,120
Now see how you've become.

104
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,240
How desolate it all is.

105
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,616
Consort Jing,

106
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,080
even if I've fallen from favor,

107
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,360
your gloating isn't warranted.

108
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,240
You're merely
His Majesty's deposed empress.

109
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,240
What right have you to mock me?

110
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,640
I've devoted myself
to fasting and Buddhist prayers

111
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,840
and abandoned my longing for favor.

112
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,680
Yet Concubine Yun proves formidable.

113
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,240
She unearthed evidence
from over a decade past.

114
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,840
She destroyed not only you

115
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,760
but also General Zhao
and the entire Zhao clan.

116
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,440
She's truly cunning in mind

117
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,480
and boundless in schemes.

118
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,440
That wretch Ling Yun

119
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,240
opposes me at every turn.

120
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,480
I want to tear her limb from limb

121
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,800
and cut her into pieces!

122
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,840
Pity,

123
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,520
you're confined to the Cold Palace,

124
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,880
never to leave again.

125
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,240
Every soul has vulnerabilities.

126
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,760
Want to counter Concubine Yun?

127
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,600
Lean in close.

128
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,840
I'll share a secret.

129
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,200
Are you here to gloat over me?

130
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,112
You've triumphed.

131
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,920
You're now His Majesty's
most favored woman.

132
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,640
His Majesty's favor

133
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,240
means everything to you.

134
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,856
But to me,

135
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,640
it means nothing.

136
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,960
Then why orchestrate all this?

137
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,640
Once you were Consort Wan,

138
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,920
aloft in supremacy,

139
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,960
wielding boundless power,

140
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,640
never bothering to look down.

141
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,640
Now you're Zhao Yanwan.

142
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,680
Still blind to my identity?

143
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,696
Who are you?

144
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,080
I've never met you before.

145
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,760
Do you recall

146
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,640
Bi Jiangchen and his wife?

147
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,800
Bi Jiangchen?

148
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,960
Do you recall now?

149
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,240
That's right.

150
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,584
Bi Jiangchen

151
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,520
was the External Procurement Office
official you murdered.

152
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,000
He recognized you
as a Yangzhou courtesan,

153
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,880
so you framed him with false charges

154
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,320
and slaughtered his entire family.

155
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,120
And I

156
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,720
am his daughter who barely escaped

157
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,120
that massacre!

158
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,240
So it's you.

159
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,040
All this is your retribution.

160
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,360
I was orphaned,

161
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,560
and my brother vanished.

162
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,520
For twelve years,
I've hidden my identity.

163
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,200
You know nothing of my suffering!

164
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,840
Each day I lived in terror.

165
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,240
Every moment, I craved
to crush your bones

166
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,320
and flay your skin!

167
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,640
At last I entered the palace

168
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,440
and brought you down!

169
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,120
All this talk

170
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,648
changes nothing.

171
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,440
Kill me now.

172
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,640
Seeking death's release?

173
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,320
It's not that easy.

174
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,680
Don't you want news of your brother?

175
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,016
What did you say?

176
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,640
My brother lives?

177
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,720
Where is he?

178
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,920
Tell me where he is!

179
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,240
Beyond the horizon,

180
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,960
yet before your eyes.

181
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,840
He's within these palace walls.

182
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,240
But you'll never know

183
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,640
his true identity!

184
00:09:30,163 --> 00:09:32,416
(Fourteen Bureaus)

185
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,648
(Qinglu Hall)

186
00:09:43,424 --> 00:09:44,384
My lord,

187
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,600
I beg urgent assistance.

188
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,440
What matter requires me?

189
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,280
Help me find someone.

190
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,440
My brother, Bi Da.

191
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,680
Your Highness jests,

192
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,240
or have I drunk too much?

193
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,960
How could your brother

194
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,760
be in the palace?

195
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,192
Consort Wan said

196
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,640
that he's within the palace.

197
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,080
She's an insider from the past.

198
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,416
She must've told the truth.

199
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,336
My lord,

200
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,040
I must find him.

201
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,080
Please help me find him.

202
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,840
Each time you seek me,

203
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,440
it's for favors.

204
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,440
Have you ever wondered

205
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,440
why I helped you?

206
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,120
Because we share a common enemy.

207
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,040
Isn't Zhao Yanwan also your enemy?

208
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,440
As Chief of the Fourteen Bureaus,

209
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,640
I make no enemies.

210
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,080
I've always performed my duties
strictly by palace rules.

211
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,640
Consort Wan

212
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,640
is only your enemy.

213
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,920
The palace has countless servants.

214
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,640
To search for someone

215
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,040
without clues would be like
fishing for a needle in the ocean.

216
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,800
Moreover, after all these years,

217
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,200
how can you be certain he's still alive?

218
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,640
What if he's long passed away?

219
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,640
Even with the slimmest chance,

220
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,160
I must find him.

221
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,160
If your brother

222
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,600
has become someone
beyond your recognition,

223
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,000
would you still accept him?

224
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,640
No matter what he's become,

225
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,640
I want him.

226
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,632
Why?

227
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,600
Because he's the only family

228
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,400
I have left in this world.

229
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,920
This is the registry
of all palace servants.

230
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,640
Your Highness may look yourself.

231
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,520
Zhao Yanwan has been confined
to the Cold Palace.

232
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,240
Your Highness has achieved your wish

233
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,560
and may rest easy now.

234
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,320
Don't seek me again.

235
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,568
Thank you.

236
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,840
Your kindness

237
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,640
will be remembered forever.

238
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,040
(You needn't look for him anymore.)

239
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,800
(He may not)

240
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,840
(want to see his sister.)
