=The Ascent of Ling Yun=

00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:13,312
=Episode 11=

3
00:00:13,491 --> 00:00:15,616
(I'll Discipline This Maid for You)

4
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,376
Consort Jing.

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,496
What do you think?

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,240
I am no expert to speak

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,352
about the pill.

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,840
Please summon

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,000
imperial physicians
for a proper examination.

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,520
Consort Jing, speak your mind.

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,000
Your Majesty,

12
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,560
this pill appears to be

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,040
a forbidden pill.

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,128
Forbidden pill?

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,840
I only seek to replenish vital energy.

16
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,600
Isn't it a tonic pill?

17
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,280
I have no idea, Your Highness.

18
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,320
I only knew you were seeking this,

19
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,800
so I presented it to you.

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,880
How dare you!

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,840
When did I seek a forbidden pill?

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,160
How dare you slander me?

23
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,000
I wouldn't dare.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,280
I wouldn't, Your Highness.

25
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,680
It's Ling Yun's pill,

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,720
not mine.

27
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,960
She intended to curry favor with it.

28
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,600
I wanted to be freed,

29
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,160
so I stole it from her

30
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,680
to present to you.

31
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,520
I'd never frame you, Your Highness.

32
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,160
(It's Ling Yun again.)

33
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,680
Guards.

34
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,680
Summon Ling Yun.

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,992
Yes.

36
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,160
May Your Majesty

37
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,320
be well.

38
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,720
May Your Highnesses be well.

39
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,840
Rise.

40
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,880
This maid presented this pill.

41
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,680
Did it come from you?

42
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,072
Your Majesty,

43
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,200
I know nothing of this pill.

44
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,880
What I do know

45
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,160
is that Cui Wei

46
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,520
colluded with Madam Sun
to exploit the Fragrance Bureau.

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,640
I exposed Madam Sun's corruption.

48
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,680
Cui Wei was demoted
to the Servitude Bureau.

49
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,920
She has harbored

50
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,440
resentment toward me

51
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,440
and sought revenge.

52
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,320
Ling Yun.

53
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,880
How dare you lie to His Majesty?

54
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,160
You said Consort Wan sought this pill.

55
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,120
You prepared this as a gift

56
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,280
to seek her favor.

57
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,760
Seek her favor?

58
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,160
How absurd.

59
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,920
What was Consort Wan seeking?

60
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,080
This forbidden pill.

61
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,400
Cui Wei.

62
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,000
How could the well-respected

63
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,480
Consort Wan break palace rules?

64
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,080
Framing me is one thing.

65
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,280
But how dare you

66
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,520
slander Her Highness?

67
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,920
I'm wronged.

68
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,440
I've always been

69
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,360
loyal to you.

70
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,280
I never intended
to slander Your Highness.

71
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,176
How dare you

72
00:02:33,176 --> 00:02:34,120
frame your fellow

73
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,040
and set me up?

74
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,000
You shall be punished.

75
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,144
Chief Wu.

76
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,480
Will you let this wretch slander me?

77
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,760
Calm down, Your Highness.

78
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,080
She deserves to die if she has

79
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,640
slandered you.

80
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,280
His Majesty will punish her.

81
00:02:49,848 --> 00:02:50,800
Your Majesty!

82
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,280
Your Majesty, I have something to say.

83
00:02:53,688 --> 00:02:54,680
Consort Wan...

84
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,240
Consort Wan sent Eunuch Shun Xi

85
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,840
to make me kill Ling Yun.

86
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,840
She promised to free me

87
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,560
from the Servitude Bureau.

88
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,280
But Ru Yi found out

89
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,280
before I could administer poison.

90
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,000
Consort Wan

91
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,080
then asked me to kill Ru Yi.

92
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,320
I confess to all those crimes.

93
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,680
But I have nothing to do
with the forbidden pill.

94
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,080
Spare me, Your Majesty.

95
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,680
I was coerced.

96
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,960
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

97
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,560
This maid spews lies, Your Majesty.

98
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,920
I've never met her privately,

99
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,080
let alone

100
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,080
commissioned murder.

101
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,520
Please discern the truth.

102
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,680
Your Majesty.

103
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,800
As an imperial consort,

104
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,360
why would I mingle
with such a lowly maid?

105
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,448
I am innocent.

106
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,440
The maids and servants

107
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,720
may be of humble status,

108
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,800
but all lives matter the same.

109
00:03:44,448 --> 00:03:45,320
Abuse and killing

110
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,840
of the servants are forbidden.

111
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,080
How dare you

112
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,680
treat human lives as mere weeds

113
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,560
before His Majesty?

114
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,760
Your Majesty.

115
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,280
This wretched maid is slandering me.

116
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,440
When one scheme fails,

117
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,320
she hatches another.

118
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,720
If there's evidence,

119
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,920
I'll accept any punishment.

120
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,480
I beg Your Majesty to clear my name.

121
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,320
I beg your judgment.

122
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,608
Your Majesty,

123
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,880
Cui Wei has identified the mastermind.

124
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,224
Please

125
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,720
deliver justice for the slain maid.

126
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,184
Your Majesty,

127
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,280
I recall something now.

128
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,880
Some days ago,

129
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,960
Consort Wan took her servants
to the Servitude Bureau,

130
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,640
threatening to cut out
Ling Yun's tongue.

131
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,280
It appears to me

132
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,480
that Consort Wan harbors genuine hatred

133
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,840
toward this maid.

134
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,024
Consort Jing.

135
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,480
What are you implying?

136
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,456
Enough.

137
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,320
Consort Wan,

138
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,000
I granted you managerial authority

139
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,576
out of trust.

140
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,200
You should discipline

141
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,840
these maids and servants.

142
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,560
I leave this matter in your hands.

143
00:04:44,224 --> 00:04:45,216
Yes.

144
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,240
Thank you.

145
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,880
I'll discipline these unruly servants.

146
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,520
This young maid

147
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,000
has a cunning mind

148
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,168
and a sharp tongue.

149
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,640
Send this troublemaker

150
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,720
to the Imperial Study.

151
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,208
I'll discipline her in person.

152
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,600
We bid farewell to Your Majesty.

153
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,776
Ling Yun.

154
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,280
I must admit

155
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,960
that you're quite something.

156
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,800
I never expected

157
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,120
that you'd be the first to leave here.

158
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,560
Cui Wei.

159
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,160
A few days ago,

160
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,560
I wished you well in the next life.

161
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,600
Stop wagging your tongue

162
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,040
- and prepare your funeral.
- You...

163
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,160
Mind your own business.

164
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,240
You think you'll be safe
at the Imperial Study?

165
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,800
Serving His Majesty

166
00:05:45,523 --> 00:05:46,515
is like riding a tiger.

167
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,216
Cui Wei.

168
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,320
Ru Yi was my friend.

169
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,160
You killed her.

170
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,360
Do you think I'll let you off?

171
00:06:00,288 --> 00:06:01,360
An eye for an eye.

172
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,240
A life for a life.

173
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,080
That's justice.

174
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,840
I've warned you.

175
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,960
If I delivered that pill,

176
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,360
I could be released.

177
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,728
But if you did it,

178
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,480
it would cost your life.

179
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,760
Did you think I was joking?

180
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,120
You knew all along

181
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,400
that I killed Ru Yi.

182
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,736
Ru Yi.

183
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,160
Ru Yi.

184
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,120
How tragic.

185
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,360
Eunuch Shun Xi.

186
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,560
Here is all my savings.

187
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,760
I'll be at your service from now on.

188
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,600
Please plead for mercy

189
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,800
before Her Highness.

190
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,760
I swear.

191
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,120
My life belongs

192
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,720
to you from now on.

193
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,760
Whatever you ask me to do,

194
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,200
I will obey

195
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,792
without hesitation.

196
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,240
Cui Wei.

197
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,920
Your life

198
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,400
belongs to Consort Wan.

199
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,200
I dare not claim it.

200
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,704
Well,

201
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,160
Her Highness assigned me

202
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,200
to bring you the favor.

203
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,520
See?

204
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,880
This is the end.

205
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,088
Your Majesty.

206
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,560
I have committed a crime.

207
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,240
(Imperial Study)
What crime?

208
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,120
I deceived Your Majesty.

209
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,360
I'm detestable.

210
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:56,960
(Imperial Study)

211
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,280
At least, you are aware

212
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,240
that you're detestable.

213
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,040
I obtained

214
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,960
that forbidden pill

215
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,160
from Consort Wan's palace.

216
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,720
Consort Wan

217
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,760
realized that I had found out
about her scheme of seeking favor

218
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,760
with the forbidden pill.

219
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,040
That's why she tried every means

220
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,640
to have me killed.

221
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,200
I am aware of her scheme

222
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,400
of seeking favor.

223
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,240
But how dare you lure that maid

224
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,000
into exposing the scandal

225
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,520
and causing disturbance?

226
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,960
You've got some nerve.

227
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,840
You are truly wise.

228
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,280
So Your Majesty

229
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,880
knew about Consort Wan's
involvement with the forbidden pills

230
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,280
as well as

231
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,760
the tricks I employed.

232
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,488
Concubine Zhao's

233
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,040
dance shoes concealed a blade.

234
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,560
You nearly died

235
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,640
from meddling with it.

236
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,320
I spared you

237
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,560
because you were smart

238
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,760
and sent you to the Servitude Bureau,

239
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,240
thinking you'd behave.

240
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,960
But you remained reckless

241
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,000
and schemed against my consort.

242
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,360
You're truly suicidal.

243
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,120
I deserve to die.

244
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,400
But Your Majesty,

245
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,040
if I were to die

246
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,560
for exposing

247
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,080
Consort Wan's use of forbidden pills,

248
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,800
it would shame the imperial family.

249
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,760
So my death

250
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,720
must not be related to Consort Wan

251
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,120
or those forbidden pills.

252
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,760
I implore Your Majesty

253
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,200
to grant me

254
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,320
a novel and dignified
method of execution.

255
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,800
Are you threatening me
with the imperial reputation?

256
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,200
I dare not.

257
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,360
Kneel here

258
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,320
and ponder

259
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,440
a novel way to die

260
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,160
I've never seen before.

261
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,640
Alright.

262
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,696
Yes.

263
00:09:44,499 --> 00:09:47,160
(Imperial Study)

264
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,000
After a whole day,

265
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,520
have you figured out

266
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,104
a novel way to die?

267
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,928
Your Majesty.

268
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,560
I dare not speak.

269
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You don't fear death,

270
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,520
but you dare not speak?

271
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,960
Soldiers fight the wars
to defend our nation.

272
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,680
Ministers do their job

273
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,880
to serve the people.

274
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,560
Physicians study herbs to save lives.

275
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,840
I truly admire them.

276
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,800
Though I'm merely a lowly maid,

277
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,680
I aspire

278
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,880
to a meaningful purpose

279
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,880
and an honorable death.

280
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,984
Ling Yun,

281
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,640
you compare yourself to soldiers,

282
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
ministers

283
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,800
and physicians?

284
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,400
I've never seen

285
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,760
someone as shameless as you.

286
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,440
Your Majesty,

287
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,280
I don't deserve

288
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,120
to stand with loyal ministers

289
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,400
or virtuous physicians.

290
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,824
But Your Majesty,

291
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,160
some officials

292
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,400
flaunt their achievements,

293
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,440
forgetting your grace
bestowed upon them.

294
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,360
Such arrogance warrants correction.

295
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,480
How dare you

296
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,480
meddle in state affairs?

297
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:48,600
Slandering ministers

298
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,504
is a capital offense.

299
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,000
If my death eases your burdens,

300
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,200
then I die fulfilled.

301
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,600
Thank you

302
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,560
for devising this excellent execution.

303
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,000
Does it count

304
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,600
as a novel way to die?

305
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,984
Yes, it does.

306
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,240
You made yourself sound significant.

307
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,048
How novel.

308
00:11:12,563 --> 00:11:14,688
(Chengxi Palace)

309
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,840
You've grown so incapable.

310
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,560
That maid almost took you down.

311
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,840
You nearly got caught
with forbidden pills yesterday.

312
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,240
Perhaps you've been
a consort for so long

313
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,400
that you've forgotten why we came here.

314
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,000
I certainly remember

315
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,920
that we're here to secure
our family's lasting power.

316
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,440
Lasting power?

317
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,720
If this continues,

318
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,040
you might not even remain as a consort.

319
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,960
How dare you!

320
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,360
Even if Ling Yun gains
His Majesty's attention,

321
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,520
she's no threat.

322
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,120
Didn't our brother return triumphantly?

323
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,440
His Majesty is hosting a banquet.

324
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,800
Just watch.

325
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,320
I swear I'll make that wench die

326
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,520
in the most humiliating way.

327
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,000
Don't be so sure.

328
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,400
Everyone is waiting

329
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,000
to see you make a fool of yourself.
