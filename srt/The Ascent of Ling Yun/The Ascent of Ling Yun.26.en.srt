00:00:06,323 --> 00:00:10,912
=The Ascent of Ling Yun=

2
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:13,312
=Episode 26=

3
00:00:13,331 --> 00:00:15,744
(Ling Yun under House Arrest)

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,040
Who gave you the order?

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,480
You're still shielding someone
in front of His Majesty?

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,800
Are you tired of living?

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,600
That day,

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,840
Concubine Yun gave me
a packet of incense

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,000
and a silver ingot.

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,160
She asked me to replace the incense
Concubine Shu normally uses.

11
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,800
I knew harming the imperial heir
warrants execution of the entire clan.

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,600
So I informed Concubine Shu in advance.

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,280
Concubine Shu can testify for me.

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,000
I never intended
to harm the imperial heir!

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,880
Right.

16
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,480
He isn't lying.

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,480
If not for him,

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,280
I would've been set up by Concubine Yun.

19
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,744
Your Majesty,

20
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,360
I just heard

21
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,520
someone planned to put musk powder
into Concubine Shu's censer

22
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,200
to induce her miscarriage.

23
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,160
So I ordered the swap.

24
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,200
The incense I asked Jian to swap

25
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,200
was mild calming incense.

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,200
It absolutely wouldn't
harm her unborn child.

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,288
Someone?

28
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,480
Who is this one?

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,400
The palace is full of gossipers.

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,680
I only heard rumors.

31
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,200
I don't know the person's true identity.

32
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,600
Do you not know and refuse to say,

33
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,600
or perhaps,

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,720
that someone is actually you?

35
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,096
Your Majesty,

36
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,080
I wouldn't dare harm the imperial heir!

37
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,760
I think

38
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,280
Concubine Yun isn't such a cruel person.

39
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,000
A simple test of the incense she sent

40
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,480
can verify if she's telling the truth.

41
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,640
- Summon Chief Physician Zhang.
- Yes.

42
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,280
Chief Physician Zhang,
how is this incense?

43
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,560
Your Majesty,

44
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,840
there's no poison in this incense.

45
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,360
But it contains concentrated musk.

46
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,600
Pregnant women

47
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,200
must stay far away from it.

48
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,840
What else can you say?

49
00:02:20,192 --> 00:02:21,240
Your Majesty,

50
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,680
I didn't harm the imperial heir!

51
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,200
Someone must have swapped the incense.

52
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,200
We grant you two choices.

53
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,880
First,

54
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,080
name the person you claimed

55
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,560
who framed Concubine Shu.

56
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,120
Second,

57
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,880
take full responsibility yourself.

58
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,080
I'll punish you for attempted murder

59
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,560
of the imperial heir.

60
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,912
Your Majesty,

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,680
I didn't harm the imperial heir!

62
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,200
I believe

63
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,760
you will clear my name.

64
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,200
Whatever your decision is,

65
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,960
I will accept it.

66
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,360
Proclaim my decree.

67
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,240
Concubine Yun plotted against consorts,

68
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,624
disrupting the harem.

69
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
She is stripped of title,

70
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,800
demoted to court woman,

71
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,840
and confined in Yongxiu Palace.

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,200
My devotion to Your Majesty

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
has always been true.

74
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,760
My conscience remains clear.

75
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,648
I

76
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,728
accept the decree.

77
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,760
Your Ladyship,

78
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,560
things change in the imperial harem.

79
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,200
But life must go on.

80
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,600
Don't grieve too deeply.

81
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,440
From now on, stay here

82
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,384
- and take good care of yourself.
- Where's Fu Xiang and others?

83
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,000
Your former servants
were sent to the Disciplinary Court.

84
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,080
They did nothing wrong.

85
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,400
How can they be punished?

86
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,080
Bearing punishment for masters

87
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,440
is only natural for servants.

88
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,760
You should worry
about your own situation now.

89
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,840
Help! There's a rat!

90
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,952
Stop making such noise!

91
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,720
Don't you know all Yongxiu Palace staff
have been dismissed?

92
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,880
Madam Jiang?

93
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,320
Why are you here?

94
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,600
I was ordered to attend to you.

95
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,888
Attend to me?

96
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,200
No bedding on the bed.

97
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,800
Rats in the room.

98
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,600
And no water in the pot.

99
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,200
I'm thirsty.

100
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,680
Hey! You still think
you are a concubine?

101
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,880
If you want water,
fetch it from the well.

102
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,440
You're just a deposited court woman now.

103
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,000
Stop putting on airs here.

104
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,528
Get out.

105
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,800
(Imperial Study)

106
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,760
Chief.

107
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,640
Chief.

108
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,512
Chief.

109
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,840
His Majesty is still angry.

110
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,040
(Imperial Study)
Don't mention Concubine Yun's matter.

111
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,080
I know

112
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,080
what I'm doing.

113
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,760
Greetings, Your Highness.

114
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,920
His Majesty is reviewing memorials.

115
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,520
Don't disturb him.

116
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,840
I prepared calming tea

117
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,488
to refresh His Majesty.

118
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,704
Wu Linfu,

119
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,720
don't you understand my words?

120
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,080
What do you imply?

121
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,840
You planned to act without my permission.

122
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,360
I want to eliminate you immediately.

123
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,000
Will you do it yourself,
or shall I do it?

124
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,920
You saved my life.

125
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,800
If you want it,

126
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,600
you may claim it anytime.

127
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,120
You only know how to deceive me
with such words.

128
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,840
Yet I found no sincerity in you.

129
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,240
I have nothing

130
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,560
but loyalty

131
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
for Your Highness.

132
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,640
Your Highness,

133
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,680
please plead for Ling Yun.

134
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,880
She only changed the incense

135
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,400
to stop me.

136
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,480
Do you know

137
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,400
the more you care for her,

138
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,200
the more I must thwart you?

139
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,040
Go tell His Majesty

140
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,520
that Concubine Yun is innocent.

141
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,480
Are you threatening me?

142
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,560
After all my care for you,

143
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,040
you actually threaten me for her?

144
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,400
As an imperial consort,

145
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,600
please keep your dignity.

146
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,880
What a pity, Wu Linfu.

147
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,720
This dagger can't kill me.

148
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,960
Look closer.

149
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,528
These...

150
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,640
These are former exile marks?

151
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,112
Right.

152
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,280
If you harm me with this dagger,

153
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,920
it will be exposed
to the public as the weapon.

154
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,200
By then,

155
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,800
all shall know

156
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,280
Ling Yun is a previous dynasty princess.

157
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,960
How did you discover this?

158
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,200
Where did you get this dagger?

159
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,488
Back then,

160
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,400
after the Bi family was wiped out,

161
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,280
I sent someone to find it
in your ancestral house.

162
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,656
Wu Linfu!

163
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,000
What are you doing?

164
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,880
I offended you.

165
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,344
Let this act

166
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,480
atone for my wrongs.

167
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,400
I beg you

168
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,240
to spare Ling Yun's life.

169
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,200
Never

170
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,640
reveal her true identity.

171
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,560
Wu Linfu,

172
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,600
don't do anything stupid.

173
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,800
If you obey me,

174
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,000
I promise I'll spare her life.

175
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,640
Thank you, Your Highness.

176
00:08:37,236 --> 00:08:39,744
(Yongxiu Palace)

177
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,960
Chief Wu.

178
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,944
Get up.

179
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,040
Concubine Ling is confined
by His Majesty.

180
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,480
Without his decree,

181
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,800
I wouldn't dare let anyone in.

182
00:08:53,152 --> 00:08:54,200
Make an exception.

183
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,400
I just want a brief talk.

184
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,544
I wouldn't dare.

185
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,320
I really wouldn't dare.
Greetings, Your Highness.

186
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,320
Your Highness.

187
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,312
Lord Wu,

188
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,160
do you intend
to break the rules knowingly?

189
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:08,520
Your Highness.

190
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,472
Leave this place.

191
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:11,904
Yes.

192
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,624
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

193
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,904
Get up.

194
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,184
Yes.

195
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,760
Who would've thought Chief Wu

196
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,160
would face rejection?

197
00:09:42,464 --> 00:09:43,520
I'll take my leave.

198
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,080
Don't you want to know

199
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,880
how your Concubine Yun

200
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,720
came to this plight?

201
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,560
Are you saying

202
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,720
Concubine Yun ordered you
to replace Concubine Shu's incense?

203
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,880
I wouldn't dare harm the royal heir,

204
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,480
so I came to seek your help.

205
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,080
Your Ladyship, please save me.

206
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,400
Grant me

207
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,360
a path to survival.

208
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,280
If you want to live,
follow my instructions.

209
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,720
Except for harming royal heirs,

210
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,720
I will do anything.

211
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,160
Then inform Concubine Shu

212
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,360
about this matter in advance.

213
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:13,888
Yes.

214
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,040
Ling Yun claimed

215
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,120
someone intended to harm Concubine Shu.

216
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,200
She merely wanted to save Concubine Shu,

217
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,200
but refused to name the perpetrator.

218
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,920
You changed the incense Ling Yun sent?

219
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,960
Was there musk originally in the censer,

220
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,480
or did Ling Yun order the musk delivery?

221
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,960
Truth and falsehood

222
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,320
mixed in confusion.

223
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,960
Even I can't discern it clearly.

224
00:10:39,424 --> 00:10:40,320
Despicable.

225
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,240
You call me despicable?

226
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,720
What about you, Chief Wu?

227
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,080
How can you be so certain
that Ling Yun is innocent?

228
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,400
I believe justice resides
in people's hearts.

229
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,320
Concubine Yun was framed.

230
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,200
Her name will be cleared in due time.

231
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,000
I came by imperial decree
to interrogate her.

232
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,120
His Majesty demands
she reveal the truth.

233
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,640
Tell me,

234
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,680
who is this person
she'd rather die than name?

235
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,160
Should I make her

236
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,040
experience some persuasion?

237
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,080
Your Ladyship, please have mercy.

238
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,240
Don't torment her.

239
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,720
Spare her life.

240
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,400
I did say I wouldn't take her life,

241
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,760
but others' intentions

242
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,560
are beyond my control.

243
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,480
Madam Jiang we sent

244
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,120
hasn't made any significant moves yet.

245
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,920
Shall I give her a little push?

246
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,600
Why the rush?

247
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,200
We needn't do it ourselves.

248
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,120
Madam Jiang had served
Consort Wan for years.

249
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,320
She'll find a way to eliminate Ling Yun.

250
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,680
Truly brilliant.

251
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,160
Go tell Madam Jiang

252
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,120
to serve with greater dedication.

253
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,592
Yes.

254
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,424
