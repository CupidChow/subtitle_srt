(I'll Fight the Zhao Sisters
to the Death)

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,120
Greetings, Your Highness Consort Jing.

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,280
Rise.

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,960
Noble Lady Zhao,
how is your foot recovering?

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,720
Thank you for your concern.

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,160
I have nearly recovered.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,896
Be seated.

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,240
I hear Noble Lady Yun
employs remarkable methods.

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,680
She lured His Majesty
to a midnight boat tryst...

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,720
What?

13
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,632
How utterly...

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,320
Noble Lady Yun

15
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,568
needs but to make her move

16
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,960
to upheave the entire harem.

17
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,760
We'd all better stay vigilant.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,800
Don't claim I neglected warning you
when misfortune strikes.

19
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,200
Greetings to Consort Jing,

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,200
Consort Wan,

21
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,800
and Concubine Shu.

22
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,360
Be seated.

23
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,640
Thank you, Your Highness.

24
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,640
Noble Lady Yun
is newly elevated by His Majesty

25
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,360
and granted Yongxiu Palace.

26
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,240
From this day forth,

27
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,760
we're all sisters in harmony.

28
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,880
They say Noble Lady Yun's wit dazzles,

29
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,480
and she's favored by His Majesty.

30
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,000
We crude-minded sisters

31
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,400
must learn from you henceforth.

32
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,680
You flatter me, Concubine Shu.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,840
In this harem,

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,560
clever talents abound.

35
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,240
Yet

36
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,720
imperial favor flows like water,

37
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,040
and no flower blooms forever.

38
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,520
His Majesty

39
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,920
merely seeks novelty.

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,200
Those competing through vulgar means

41
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,240
will find imperial favor fleeting.

42
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,520
Imperial favor flows like water,

43
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,840
and no flower blooms forever.

44
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,344
Well said.

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,640
Noble Lady Zhao,
you recently offended His Majesty.

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,840
Next time,

47
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,200
you should do better.

48
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,560
Noble Lady Yun, you seem familiar.

49
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,880
Have we met before?

50
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,760
Noble Lady Rong, you have a keen memory.

51
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,640
Noble Lady Yun

52
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,640
was merely a lowly maid

53
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,600
from the Servitude Bureau
serving superiors.

54
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,360
In this imperial harem,

55
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,840
are we not all servants
serving His Majesty?

56
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,720
Serving with devotion

57
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,000
to win imperial favor is true skill.

58
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,600
Enough.

59
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,360
We're all sisters here.

60
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,880
Let's maintain harmony.

61
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,840
Don't engage in petty squabbles.

62
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,640
May endless fortune bless you.

63
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,480
Consort Jing
congratulates your coronation

64
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,760
with a pair of pearl phoenix hairpins
from East Sea tributes.

65
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,880
Thank you, Your Highness.

66
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,392
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

67
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,520
Noble Lady Zhao also prepares

68
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,320
a filigree enamel bracelet for you.

69
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,920
Thank you, Noble Lady Zhao.

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,008
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

71
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,880
Consort Wan congratulates
your residency at Yongxiu Palace

72
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,800
with a geranium hair ornament.

73
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,160
Thank you, Your Highness.

74
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,120
You are all thoughtful.

75
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,560
Hereby,

76
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,880
I thank you all.

77
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,680
Noble Lady Yun,

78
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,960
should leisure permit,

79
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,880
visit other palaces more often.

80
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,360
Company benefits us all.

81
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,448
Yes.

82
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,160
The geranium's fragrance is distinctive.

83
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,440
Its fragrance permeates the container.

84
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,720
It's my first time seeing foreign flora.

85
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,240
Consort Wan's gift

86
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,760
is truly unconventional.

87
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,600
Does Your Ladyship sense impropriety?

88
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,000
Palace rules strictly dictate:

89
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,160
concubines offer hair ornaments,

90
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,600
and empresses offer hairpins.

91
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,680
Rarer blossoms

92
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,400
signify higher station.

93
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,440
Consort Wan outranks me,

94
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,640
yet she gifts me

95
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,680
this precious geranium hair ornament.

96
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,840
That's very strange.

97
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,440
Shall I

98
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,760
dispose of it covertly?

99
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,480
No need.

100
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,880
I anticipate her opening gambit.

101
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,504
Wait here.

102
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,720
Chief Wu.

103
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,080
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

104
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,880
No one else is here.

105
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,392
No need to be formal.

106
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,600
Your Ladyship and I are worlds apart.

107
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,984
So I wouldn't dare.

108
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,872
How may I help?

109
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,320
Consort Wan

110
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,040
gifted me
a geranium hair ornament today.

111
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,840
I'm unsure if there's
hidden meaning behind this.

112
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,520
Geraniums are rare.

113
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,832
Hair ornaments with them

114
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,040
should be crafted
by Imperial Workshops artisans.

115
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,000
All steps comply with rules

116
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,320
and are overseen.

117
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,064
There should be no issues.

118
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,792
Thank you.

119
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,488
Chief Wu,

120
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,960
the Zhao sisters'

121
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,400
actions today were truly peculiar.

122
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,240
I don't know

123
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,520
what their other moves might be.

124
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,432
Noble Lady Yun,

125
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,960
you now preside over your own palace.

126
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,520
The higher you are,

127
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,440
the fiercer the winds.

128
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,400
You must be

129
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,840
fully prepared beforehand for all.

130
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,896
Chief Wu,

131
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,120
could you investigate

132
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,120
any recent issues at Zhongning Palace?

133
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,720
Stop now.

134
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,080
Don't cause more trouble.

135
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,112
Stop now?

136
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,000
My vengeance remains.

137
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,928
How can I stop now?

138
00:05:53,184 --> 00:05:54,120
It's now a fight

139
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,200
to the death
between me and the Zhao sisters.

140
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,984
If I stop now,

141
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,640
I'll be doomed eternally.

142
00:06:04,352 --> 00:06:05,216
Never mind.

143
00:06:06,304 --> 00:06:07,200
Forget it.

144
00:06:23,936 --> 00:06:25,120
Greetings,

145
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,000
Your Ladyship.

146
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,776
Rise.

147
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,024
Thank you.

148
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,440
I'd like to commission
some floral pastries.

149
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,160
Make a few using this fresh geranium.

150
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,080
Rest assured.

151
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,080
You'll have satisfactory pastries
by tomorrow.

152
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,792
One more thing.

153
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,520
Can you use alternative materials

154
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,280
to carve into a geranium shape?

155
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,160
Make it identical to real ones.

156
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,992
Can you do it?

157
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,360
Yes.

158
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,360
Thanks for your reward.

159
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,040
We'll carve it meticulously,

160
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,960
guaranteed to deceive the eye.

161
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,200
What Her Ladyship commissioned today

162
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,688
must stay confidential.

163
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,776
Understood?

164
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,024
Absolutely.

165
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,280
I won't breathe a word.

166
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,352
Take care, Your Ladyship.

167
00:07:17,984 --> 00:07:19,000
Your Ladyship,

168
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,560
why turn the real flower into pastries

169
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,080
and painstakingly create a fake one?

170
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,720
What secrets
the geranium hair ornament holds

171
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,720
remains unclear.

172
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,000
To be cautious,

173
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,440
it shouldn't be worn.

174
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,480
To avoid alerting the Zhao sisters

175
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,000
and letting them notice

176
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,880
my suspicion
about the geranium hair ornament,

177
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,240
I must pretend to wear it.

178
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,160
So the fake one
is your contingency plan.

179
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,680
Tomorrow I'll return
the geranium pastries

180
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,760
to Consort Wan herself.

181
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,880
Let's see what trick

182
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,480
she's really playing.

183
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,960
Today's gathering

184
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,720
calls all of you here to discuss

185
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,240
Her Majesty the Empress Dowager's
birthday celebrations.

186
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,960
Who's missing?

187
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,160
The newly titled Noble Lady Yun
is absent.

188
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,160
Noble Lady Zhao hasn't arrived either.

189
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,520
Your Highnesses,

190
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,680
sorry I'm late.

191
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,120
Consort Wan,

192
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,200
Consort Jing,

193
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,360
may fortune bless you.

194
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,328
You may rise.

195
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,360
Noble Lady Yun,

196
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,480
newly elevated as you are,

197
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,040
you should adhere strictly
to palace rules.

198
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,400
You all sent me gifts days ago.

199
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,080
I haven't properly acknowledged each.

200
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,600
Today I've made floral pastries
with my own hands

201
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,932
for you all

202
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,080
as a humble gesture.

203
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,920
Hence my delayed arrival.

204
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,880
I beg Your Highnesses' forgiveness.

205
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,600
Why did a noble lady like you
make flower pastries?

206
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,400
Accustomed to serving others?

207
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,120
To those unaware,

208
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,680
they'd think you're still a servant.

209
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,680
After all, she made these
with her own hands.

210
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,880
Let's at least try them.

211
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,728
Your Highness,

212
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,784
please have a taste.

213
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,080
Enough.

214
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,120
Be seated.

215
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,280
Greetings to Consort Jing

216
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,720
and Consort Wan.

217
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,560
Rise.

218
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,440
Thank you.

219
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,016
Your Highness,

220
00:10:22,528 --> 00:10:23,600
your face...

221
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,480
So much blood!

222
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,480
With her injured face,

223
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,656
she can't serve His Majesty.

224
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,760
It's over.

225
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,360
Consort Wan's proudest beauty is ruined.

226
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,080
The harem dynamics will shift now.

227
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,680
His Majesty arrives!
