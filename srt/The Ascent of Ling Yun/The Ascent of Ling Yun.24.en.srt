(If You Don't Fight,
You Become Prey for Others' Blades!)

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,000
Concubine Yun has arrived!

5
00:00:20,884 --> 00:00:24,256
(Fourteen Bureaus)

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,960
Greetings, Your Highness.

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,240
Where's Chief Wu?

8
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,864
Your Highness,

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,360
Chief Wu

10
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,480
has blood on his hands.

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,120
Right now,

12
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,760
he's probably washing them.

13
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,448
Blood on his hands?

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,856
What do you mean?

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,440
I dare not speculate.

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,320
Your Highness should ask him.

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,200
You'd better know what you're saying.

18
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,720
If I find out you're spouting nonsense,

19
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:54,880
you'll pay for it.

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,832
You all wait here.

21
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,728
Wu Linfu,

22
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,200
I know you're inside. Open up!

23
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,000
Open the door!

24
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,456
Open up!

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,880
Open it...

26
00:01:28,115 --> 00:01:30,752
(Qinglu Hall)

27
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,936
I'll go get some wine.

28
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,136
Stop.

29
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,840
I told you to stop!

30
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,000
Who are you really?

31
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,560
I am

32
00:01:50,656 --> 00:01:51,560
Wu Linfu.

33
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,800
I'll ask one last time.

34
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,912
Who

35
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,544
are you?

36
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,640
I am Wu Linfu,
Chief of the Fourteen Bureaus.

37
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,248
Bi Da,

38
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,600
don't you recognize me, your sister?

39
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,736
I

40
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,280
don't understand your words.

41
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,760
My brother Bi Da

42
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,120
has a scar on his lower back.

43
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,600
He got it climbing a tree

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,040
to retrieve my kite

45
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,080
when he fell
and scraped himself as a child.

46
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,680
I saw it that day.

47
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,600
You have a scar on your lower back too.

48
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,400
You must be mistaken.

49
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,760
I have no such scar.

50
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,336
Is that so?

51
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,200
Then let me see.

52
00:03:02,304 --> 00:03:03,280
Bi Da,

53
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,200
what are you doing?

54
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,400
Don't do this, Bi Da.

55
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,680
Don't you want to see my body?

56
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,680
Let me show you.

57
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,600
Are you insane?

58
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,800
I am His Majesty's consort!

59
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,832
I don't care!

60
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,840
Let me go!

61
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,680
Let me go!

62
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm your sister!

63
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,840
But I never wanted to be your brother.

64
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,144
Are you hurt?

65
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,544
You're bleeding.

66
00:03:32,544 --> 00:03:33,472
It's nothing.

67
00:03:33,472 --> 00:03:34,320
Just a minor injury.

68
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,440
That was dangerous.

69
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,080
Don't take such risks again.

70
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,120
From now on, let me protect you.

71
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,200
Why?

72
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,480
Because I'm your elder sister.

73
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,040
You're not my real sister.

but you were gone.

96
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,240
Consort Jing told me

97
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,520
she saved you

98
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,280
and brought you here.

99
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,400
Yes.

100
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,120
Consort Jing later adopted me

101
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,600
and brought me here.

102
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,864
Don't worry.

103
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,400
I've lived decently these years.

104
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,088
No hardships to speak of.

105
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,704
That's good.

106
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,352
Promise me

107
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,320
we'll never be apart again.

108
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,256
Okay?

109
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But as I am now,

110
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,120
there's no turning back.

111
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,600
What exactly happened?

112
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,800
The eunuchs mentioned

113
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,752
"blood on your hands."

114
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,440
What have you done?

115
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,792
Stop asking.

116
00:06:09,056 --> 00:06:10,000
Did Consort Jing

117
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,840
force you?

118
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,560
Stop now.

119
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,600
It's too late.

120
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,520
From the moment
you became His Majesty's woman,

121
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,680
I lost any chance of turning back.

122
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,200
Why did you tell her

123
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,336
I'm her brother?

124
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,360
You came here about Concubine Yun again?

125
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,960
I heard she's been looking
for her brother lately.

126
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,000
Seems she succeeded.

127
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,200
Is Your Highness afraid to admit it now?

128
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,480
You've repeatedly
saved Concubine Yun from peril.

129
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,440
She's clever enough

130
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,280
to deduce

131
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,920
that you're her long-lost brother.

132
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,560
Shouldn't your sibling reunion

133
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,080
be a joyous occasion?

134
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,320
Your Highness,

135
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,400
let me remind you.

136
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,480
If you spare her,

137
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,960
all matters can be settled.

138
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,120
But if you harm
a single hair on her head,

139
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,040
I'll show no mercy
for former affections.

140
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,440
You know exactly

141
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,800
what I'm capable of.

142
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,880
Very well.

143
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,600
Good for you, Wu Linfu.

144
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,800
You dare threaten me

145
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,640
for her sake?

146
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,640
I have said my piece.

147
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,608
I'll take my leave.

148
00:08:13,344 --> 00:08:14,200
May endless fortune

149
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,296
bless Your Highness.

150
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,832
You're here.

151
00:08:17,824 --> 00:08:18,800
Your Highness,

152
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,000
Wu Linfu is innocent.

153
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,120
I insisted on overthrowing Consort Wan,

154
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,280
forcing him to help.

155
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,760
I beg you to spare Wu Linfu

156
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,120
and keep him out of harem conflicts.

157
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,760
Innocent?

158
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,160
In this palace,

159
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,680
none are truly innocent.

160
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,480
We simply sacrifice what we can

161
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,560
in exchange for what we desire.

162
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,384
Your Highness,

163
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,320
this matter between us

164
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,480
needn't involve someone else.

165
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,720
Involve someone else?

166
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,280
You truly know nothing?

167
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,800
Everything he's done

168
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,800
has been for your sake.

169
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,280
For my sake?

170
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,520
If it weren't for protecting you

171
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,400
and wanting me
to offer Zhao Yanwan's indenture,

172
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,240
why else would Wu Linfu
serve me willingly?

173
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,600
He believed Consort Wan
forced blood from you

174
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,000
and was heartbroken.

175
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,360
To help overthrow her,

176
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,320
he demanded her indenture from me.

177
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,240
My condition was

178
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,320
his unconditional obedience,

179
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,200
becoming my loyal servant

180
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,200
bound to me forever.

181
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,320
I've misjudged you all along.

182
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,760
You've hidden your depths well.

183
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,960
In this treacherous palace,

184
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,320
you must fight.

185
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,680
If you don't fight, you become prey

186
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,200
for others' blades.

187
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,320
To control your fate,

188
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,600
it requires a sharp blade at hand.

189
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,624
Don't you agree?

190
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,560
And Wu Linfu

191
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,760
makes the perfect blade.

192
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,280
What will free him from your grasp?

193
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,800
Lately in the palace,

194
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,240
Noble Lady Mu gains prominence.

195
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,120
Her rising status displeases me.

196
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,040
I understand.

197
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,760
Your Majesty,

198
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,760
it is time to choose.

199
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,152
Not tonight.

200
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,776
Wait.

201
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,640
Concubine Yun's plaque reappears?

202
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,360
Your Majesty,

203
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,120
Concubine Yun has recovered from illness

204
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,680
and resumed palace duties.

205
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,920
I

206
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,520
restored her plaque accordingly.

207
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:49,728
(Noble Lady Rong, Concubine Shen, Attendant Li,
Consort Jing, Concubine Yun, Concubine Shu)

208
00:10:49,728 --> 00:10:50,624
(Concubine Yun)
To Yongxiu Palace.

209
00:10:50,707 --> 00:10:51,744
At once.

210
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,456
Your Ladyship,

211
00:11:00,256 --> 00:11:01,120
come catch me.

212
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,040
Ming Yue.

213
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,920
Over here.

214
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,840
Stay still.

215
00:11:07,168 --> 00:11:08,120
De Gui.

216
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,080
Where are you?

217
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,080
Over here.

218
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,480
- Is that Noble Lady Mu?
- Ming Yue.

219
00:11:14,784 --> 00:11:15,760
I caught you.

220
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,672
Your Majesty,

221
00:11:16,672 --> 00:11:17,856
it's Noble Lady Mu.

222
00:11:18,816 --> 00:11:19,808
Where are you?

223
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,112
Ming Yue,

224
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,240
I heard your voice.

225
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,048
Don't run.

226
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,040
Over here.

227
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,080
Ming Yue?

228
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,640
Ming Yue?

229
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,280
I got you.

230
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,360
Look at me.

231
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,472
Over here.

232
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,680
I got you!

233
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,280
How about I play hide-and-seek with you?

234
00:11:52,672 --> 00:11:54,208
(Noble Lady Mu)
Your Majesty!

235
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Hide-and-seek?

236
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,200
That's so you!

237
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,040
As a child,

238
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,080
I played it with eunuchs.

239
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,840
It's been ages.

240
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,520
I never expected you

241
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,600
to retain such childlike innocence.

242
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,200
If Your Majesty doesn't mind,

243
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,240
how about joining me

244
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,840
and reliving childhood memories?

245
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,680
Okay.

246
00:12:16,884 --> 00:12:19,008
(Yongxiu Palace)

247
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,176
Your Ladyship!

248
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,776
Your Ladyship.

249
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,952
Where is His Majesty?

250
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,680
His Majesty went to Noble Lady Mu's.

251
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,896
Noble Lady Mu?

252
00:12:28,896 --> 00:12:29,800
Yes.

253
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,520
His Majesty was originally coming here.

254
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,720
He was stopped midway by Noble Lady Mu.

255
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,760
Noble Lady Mu truly is a temptress.

256
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,720
She's enchanted His Majesty completely.

257
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,224
Who knows

258
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,520
what tricks she's using?

259
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,120
Chengxi Palace
is truly auspicious ground.

260
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,720
There was Consort Wan.

261
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,720
Now it's Noble Lady Mu.

262
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,016
Your Ladyship,

263
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,160
they say Noble Lady Mu

264
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,600
is very unruly.

265
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,920
If this continues,

266
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,800
His Majesty
will never leave Chengxi Palace.

267
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,320
We must devise a plan quickly.

268
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,880
Noble Lady Mu
currently enjoys imperial favor.

269
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,640
Direct confrontation with her

270
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,320
would gain us no advantage.

271
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,200
By the way, Your Ladyship.

272
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,320
I've recently heard

273
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,800
Chengxi Palace has peculiar news.

274
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,200
What is it?

275
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,120
They say His Majesty

276
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,480
permitted Noble Lady Mu
to keep a horse in Chengxi Palace.

277
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,160
Now they do horse training
day and night there.

278
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,632
Horse training?

279
00:13:24,736 --> 00:13:28,160
(Yongxiu Palace)

280
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,440
Your Ladyship.

281
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,432
Your Ladyship.

282
00:13:31,072 --> 00:13:31,936
I've had news.

283
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,600
His Majesty
went to Chengxi Palace again?

284
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,640
Yes.

285
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,920
Your Highness predicts divinely.

286
00:13:36,352 --> 00:13:37,280
What trick

287
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,720
did Noble Lady Mu use this time

288
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,160
to intercept His Majesty again?

289
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,560
What else?

290
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,600
Horse training.

291
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,640
They say she gifted His Majesty
a horsewhip

292
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,520
and a saddle.

293
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,440
At night,

294
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,680
His Majesty's horse-training commands
echo from Chengxi Palace.

295
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,160
What breed of horse

296
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,040
has so captivated His Majesty?

297
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,000
Concubine Yun has arrived!

298
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,760
Greetings, Your Highness.

299
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,800
My sudden visit

300
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,000
must trouble you.

301
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,280
Nonsense.

302
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,520
The harem praises your unmatched wisdom.

303
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,520
I'm fortunate to bask in your presence.

304
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,160
How could I not rejoice?

305
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,920
I heard today

306
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,960
you gifted His Majesty a Ferghana horse.

307
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,920
I'm deeply curious.

308
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,720
How can one

309
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,200
ride a horse in the harem?

310
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,000
Thus,

311
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,920
I came to witness this marvel.

312
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,320
Please wait.

313
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,840
Your Highness,

314
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,880
today, will you be the horse tamer

315
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,680
or

316
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,280
the wild steed to be tamed?
