00:00:06,323 --> 00:00:10,912
=The Ascent of Ling Yun=

2
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:13,312
=Episode 1=

3
00:00:13,427 --> 00:00:15,840
(Slap Them Hard)

4
00:00:17,939 --> 00:00:24,544
(The 18th Year of Daling, Spring)

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,360
(I'm Ling Yun,)

6
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,320
(a newly arrived maid.)

7
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,560
(After passing rigorous selection,)

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,080
(I was assigned to serve
in Consort Wan's Fragrance Bureau.)

9
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,488
Ling Yun,

10
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,240
look how splendid
the imperial palace is!

11
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,120
It is meaningless.

12
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,920
They say the palace is like a sea,

13
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,080
drowning worldly connections.

14
00:01:03,552 --> 00:01:04,480
(Ling Yun)

15
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,240
Once in the imperial harem,
our fate decides all.

16
00:01:07,808 --> 00:01:10,040
(Ru Yi)
Ling Yun, don't scare me like that.

17
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,120
Is the imperial harem truly so dreadful?

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,160
I know I was wrong.

19
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,240
Please spare me, my lady.

20
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,680
I'll never do it again.

21
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,840
I know I was wrong.

22
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,184
Stop screeching.

23
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,368
Shut up now.

24
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,600
Or I'll cut out your tongue!

25
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,440
If you fail to serve your masters well,
you will end up like her.

26
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,840
Or you won't keep your miserable life.

27
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,496
Do you all understand?

28
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,320
We heed your teachings, Eunuch.

29
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,800
Keep up.

30
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,160
All you newly arrived maids,
listen well.

31
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,480
Madam Sun, the Head of Fragrance Bureau

32
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,240
is a spiritually cultivated immortal.

33
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,707
Now, surrender
all your money and valuables

34
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,120
(Fragrance Bureau)
as offerings to her.

35
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,320
(Cui Wei, Maid of Fragrance Bureau)
Hand everything over now!

36
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,760
What are you hiding?

37
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,560
Nothing. I hid nothing.

38
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,016
Guards. Restrain her!

39
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:22,912
Yes.

40
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,680
Madam, please stop.

41
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,520
Madam.

42
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,880
(Madam Sun, Head of Fragrance Bureau)
I truly have no more money.

43
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,680
This bracelet is my mother's
last keepsake.

44
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,640
My sole memento of her.

45
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,040
Have mercy, Madam.

46
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,120
You fool! How dare you slander Madam!

47
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,600
She punishes your disrespect and greed

48
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,760
to appease the deities.

49
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,840
It's not about money!

50
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,928
Stop!

51
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,160
Deities want no earthly tributes.
Why demand material offerings?

52
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,280
Let alone a daughter's devotion.

53
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,720
She has surrendered all her valuables.

54
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,120
Why do you torment her further?

55
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,960
And who are you?

56
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,120
I'm a newly arrived maid,

57
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,656
Ling Yun.

58
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,280
It turns out you are here.

59
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,960
Recent misfortunes

60
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,080
made me pray fervently.

61
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,440
The heavens finally revealed

62
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:27,720
a jinx approaches the imperial harem.

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What jinx?

64
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,080
This is robbery!

65
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,200
Nonsense!

66
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,600
Guards!

67
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,200
Seize this jinx!

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,440
This fool houses evil spirits.

69
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,760
She dared to overstep
her station and slander me!

70
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,200
Bring the holy water!

71
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,040
Turn around.

72
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,880
Look, all of you.

73
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,560
See if she's the prophesied jinx.

74
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,400
Why is she vomiting black liquid?

75
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,920
She's vomiting black liquid.

76
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,680
She truly is a jinx.

77
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,616
How horrifying!

78
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,208
Wretch!

79
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,920
You think a low-born fool like you

80
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,000
can avenge your parents in the palace?

81
00:05:12,928 --> 00:05:14,048
(Bi An, Ling Yun's uncle)
Uncle.

82
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,800
Back then, my father was framed

83
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,600
and killed by Consort Wan's faction.

84
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,000
My mother got murdered without cause.

85
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,320
My sole purpose of living

86
00:05:22,432 --> 00:05:23,440
is to enter the palace

87
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,440
and avenge them.

88
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,160
Shut up!

89
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,400
Consort Wan is His Majesty's
most favored one.

90
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,000
How dare a low-born person
like you challenge her!

91
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,720
Accept your miserable fate!

92
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,280
So what I am low-born?

93
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,816
Uncle,

94
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,240
you haven't even tried.

95
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,600
How could you know it's impossible?
I'll enter the palace.

96
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,040
Even if I'll be torn to pieces

97
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,448
or lose my life,

98
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,960
I will try.

99
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,200
I'll make those villains

100
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,520
pay with their lives.

101
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,720
(Ling Yun.)

102
00:05:57,408 --> 00:05:59,120
Ling Yun.

103
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,888
You're awake?

104
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,000
Feeling better?

105
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,080
How vile!

106
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,040
Sun Meizi actually
scalded you like this.

107
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,280
I won't let her get away with this.

108
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,120
Ling Yun,

109
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,200
if you hadn't helped me,

110
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,200
you wouldn't have offended Madam Sun.

111
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,280
Her protector is Consort Wan.

112
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,640
We'll face endless trouble from now on.

113
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,280
So what?

114
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,240
Temporary imperial favor

115
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,200
makes Consort Wan abuse

116
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,160
her power recklessly.

117
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,960
Retribution will come

118
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,240
when the time is ripe.

119
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,680
Lower your voice, Ling Yun.

120
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,320
If Consort Wan's people hear us,

121
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,320
we'll lose our lives.

122
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,440
Consort Wan

123
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,240
is His Majesty's most favored one
in the imperial harem now.

124
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,280
Her brother, Zhao Wansong,
is a high-ranking official

125
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,760
(Consort Wan)
deeply trusted by His Majesty.

126
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,720
In the imperial harem,

127
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,200
any other consort

128
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,560
who displeased her would

129
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,120
be beaten and humiliated.

130
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,160
At worst, she would be flogged
to death in the Disciplinary Court.

131
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,600
Consort Wan just uses seductive tricks.

132
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,760
We aren't inferior to her.
Why does His Majesty only favor her?

133
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,464
Halt.

134
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,920
How dare you slander

135
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,840
Consort Wan!

136
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,920
- Greetings, Your Highness.
- Greetings, Your Highness.

137
00:07:25,088 --> 00:07:26,800
(Attendant Li, Attendant Cheng)
May you enjoy eternal prosperity.

138
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,080
I spoke carelessly.

139
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,120
Please forgive me.

140
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,520
Discipline in the palace
deteriorates now.

141
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,488
Jin Yu,

142
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,120
slap them hard.

143
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,712
(Chief Maid, Jin Yu)
Yes.

144
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,720
- I was wrong.
- I was wrong.

145
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,680
- Please forgive me.
- Please forgive me.

146
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,416
- I was wrong. Please forgive me.
- I was wrong. Please forgive me.

147
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:53,760
- I was wrong. Please forgive me.
- I was wrong. Please forgive me.

148
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,040
Consort Wan is so domineering.

149
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,600
Is there no one
to keep her in check in the palace?

150
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,080
I heard Wu Linfu,
Chief of the Fourteen Bureaus,

151
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,200
is Consort Wan's sworn enemy,

152
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,192
standing as equals.

153
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,208
Wu Linfu?

154
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,960
(He's trusted by His Majesty)

155
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,040
(and commands the Fourteen Bureaus.)

156
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,720
(He is impartial, having control
over life and death.)

157
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,760
(Besides favored consorts,)

158
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,824
(Wu Linfu, Chief of Fourteen Bureaus)
(he is the most powerful person.)

159
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,840
Why did you stop?

160
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,208
Her Highness is asking.
Why did you stop?

161
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,488
Guards.

162
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,560
Maid Jin Yu overstepped her station
and humiliated noble ladies.

163
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,520
Take her for 20 strikes.

164
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,520
Wait.

165
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,840
Your Highness,

166
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,560
what did two noble ladies

167
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,640
do wrong?

168
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,280
Chief Wu,

169
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,640
must I justify

170
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,640
disciplining concubines to you?

171
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,000
Palace rules authorize Fourteen Bureaus
to oversee the inner court.

172
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,520
By imperial decree,

173
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,640
we act before reporting.

174
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,200
Even if they erred,

175
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,200
the Disciplinary Court
should handle it fairly.

176
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,080
Why resort to private punishment?

177
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,760
Moreover, your chief maid

178
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,680
dared slap noble ladies.

179
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,880
Even if they are low-ranked,

180
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,360
they're masters here.

181
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,560
How dare a servant overstep

182
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,560
and bully them?

183
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,040
Drag her away!

184
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,064
Who dares!

185
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,440
Chief Wu,

186
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,800
Jin Yu acted impulsively just now.

187
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,120
I'll discipline her severely.

188
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,480
Please show mercy.

189
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,440
Half-year salary cut

190
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,040
as probation.

191
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,320
Return to palace.

192
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,560
(Chief Wu is so powerful)

193
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,600
(and principled.)

194
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,960
If we side with him,

195
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,000
we'll gain chances

196
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,360
to deal with Sun Meizi.

197
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,520
Maybe we should forget it.

198
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,720
I heard from other maids

199
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,880
Chief Wu is a demon who absorbs
yin energy to nourish himself.

200
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,280
No maid who enters Fourteen Bureaus

201
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,000
ever comes out alive.

202
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,800
(No matter what,)

203
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,480
(I must overthrow Sun Meizi)

204
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,000
(and become Head of Fragrance Bureau.)

205
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,240
(That way,)

206
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,960
(I can get close to Consort Wan.)

207
00:10:07,123 --> 00:10:09,440
(Fourteen Bureaus)

208
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,968
Add some water.

209
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,360
(Even if Wu Linfu kills people
without mercy,)

210
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,040
(I'll still try approaching him.)

211
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,160
(That must be Wu Linfu.)

212
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,256
(Where did he go?)

213
00:11:05,568 --> 00:11:07,120
Over the years, I've seen many maids

214
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,560
wanting to become His Majesty's women.

215
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,000
But you're the first one

216
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,480
to get close to me.

217
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,480
You misunderstand, my lord.

218
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,680
I harbor no improper thoughts.

219
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,560
Tell me. Why do you

220
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,320
come to my chamber at night?

221
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,480
I merely wish to offer you a strategy

222
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,240
that could help you

223
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,160
control the Fragrance Bureau.

224
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,592
How dare you!

225
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,440
The Fragrance Bureau

226
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,040
is currently
under Consort Wan's supervision.

227
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,680
How does that concern me?

228
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,208
My lord.

229
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,960
Fragrance Bureau is
overrun with the sorcery

230
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,000
and foul practices.

231
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,960
We hope you can cleanse corruption

232
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,680
and save us from this misery.

233
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,160
I'll surely help you
overthrow Sun Meizi.

234
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,800
Within these days,

235
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,280
I'll create a big event
at Fragrance Bureau.

236
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,040
Just wait and see.

237
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,120
A lowly palace maid

238
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,800
gets so obsessed with power schemes.

239
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,680
Let me see what tricks you can muster.

240
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,496
Well.

241
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,560
Isn't she a jinx?

242
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,000
Cui Wei,

243
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,760
Ling Yun isn't a jinx.

244
00:12:28,192 --> 00:12:29,160
Stop saying that.

245
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,400
Stop this nonsense.

246
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,560
Our chamber

247
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,320
won't house a jinx.

248
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,560
Get out!

249
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,920
Cui Wei,

250
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,200
please.

251
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,960
Let Ling Yun stay here.

252
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,200
She can stay.

253
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,560
Ling Yun, come wash her feet.

254
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,040
Maybe

255
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,280
she'll show mercy
and let you stay tonight.

256
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,400
I'll do it.

257
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,440
No way!

258
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,960
Just washing feet isn't enough.

259
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,360
Drink my foot bath water too.

260
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,640
What are you waiting for?

261
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,048
Hurry up!

262
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,640
Hurry!

263
00:13:10,419 --> 00:13:12,448
(Ling Zhu, Maid of Fragrance Bureau)

264
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,280
A low-born fool like you

265
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,960
deserves only my foot bath water.

266
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,368
Drink it!
