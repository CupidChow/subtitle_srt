=The Ascent of Ling Yun=

2
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:13,312
=Episode 25=

3
00:00:13,427 --> 00:00:15,840
(So His Majesty Favors That Type)

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,744
Your Ladyship,

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,200
since returning
from Noble Lady Mu's place,

6
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,120
why have you been so dejected?

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,632
Sister,

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,520
will you play the horse tamer today

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,520
or

10
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,200
the wild steed to be tamed?

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,120
So His Majesty

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,640
favors that type.

13
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,160
Your Ladyship,

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,760
what does His Majesty favor?

15
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,120
It's nothing.

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,000
Your Ladyship,

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,080
I think His Majesty still
cares deeply for you.

18
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,600
You'll defeat Noble Lady Mu

19
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,240
and regain His Majesty's favor.

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,280
I've never considered her my rival.

21
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,000
My greatest concern now

22
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,560
is Lord Wu's safety alone.

23
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,800
I try to regain favor,

24
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,440
so he could be free

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,480
from Consort Jing's manipulation.

26
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,000
To counterbalance Consort Jing,

27
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,680
I must regain His Majesty's affection.

28
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,456
Noble Lady Mu,

29
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,560
how dutiful you are
to pay daily respects to me.

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,680
It's merely my humble duty.

31
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,440
Your Highness,

32
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,800
there's something puzzling me.

33
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,160
Please make it clear to me.

34
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,968
Speak.

35
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,200
Though His Majesty favors me,

36
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,800
I feel

37
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,960
in His Majesty's heart,

38
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,160
another person lingers.

39
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,160
Do you know who this one is?

40
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,560
You're inquiring

41
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,280
whether His Majesty

42
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,560
still cares for Concubine Yun, right?

43
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,120
To pour new water into a cup,

44
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,320
one needn't empty existing water first.

45
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,880
I care not what fills the cup.

46
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,280
If it displeases my palate,

47
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,800
it shall be discarded.

48
00:02:09,844 --> 00:02:11,776
(Imperial Study)

49
00:02:14,804 --> 00:02:16,576
(Imperial Study)

50
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,800
May endless fortune bless you.

51
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,080
Rise, Noble Lady Mu.

52
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,040
This is the first time I've seen you
visiting the Imperial Study voluntarily.

53
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,120
With His Majesty occupied
by state affairs,

54
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,840
I came to check on him.

55
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,520
You're overthinking.

56
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,160
His Majesty enjoys my nightly company.

57
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,760
I'll surely attend to him diligently

58
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,320
to shoulder your burdens.

59
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,880
As imperial consorts,

60
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,680
we should serve His Majesty diligently.

61
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,520
Noble Lady Mu,
you cannot take our place.

62
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,080
I shall take my leave.

63
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,120
Forgive me, Your Highness.

64
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,120
- Your Highness.
- Please forgive me.

65
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,400
You careless servant!

66
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,880
You've soiled Her Ladyship's robe,

67
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,960
preventing her from seeing His Majesty.

68
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,320
It's fine.

69
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,440
Thank Her Ladyship for her generosity

70
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,080
for sparing you worthless servant.

71
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,640
Thank you for your mercy.

72
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,960
Noble Lady Mu,

73
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,720
let me make this clear.

74
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,720
I don't intend to vie for favor,

75
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,560
nor should you consider me your enemy.

76
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,112
Your Highness,

77
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,360
I entered the palace
bearing my clan's hopes.

78
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,040
Your lack of ambition

79
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,480
doesn't negate my need to challenge you.

80
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,800
Even so,

81
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,240
in imperial harem of endless schemes,

82
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,240
how many people secure lasting favor?

83
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,120
In the end,

84
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,520
it's nothing but an illusion.

85
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,120
You're wrong.

86
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,800
How could His Majesty's favor

87
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,280
be a mere illusion?

88
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,960
Whom His Majesty cherishes

89
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,760
blooms like vibrant flowers.

90
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,560
So I must remove

91
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,200
all obstacles in my path to honor

92
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,760
one by one.

93
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,040
Securing His Majesty's only devotion

94
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,240
shall spare me

95
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,160
from empty illusions.

96
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,480
How dare you!

97
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,560
It's fine

98
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,760
to think about that,

99
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,032
but you mustn't say it.

100
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,640
Imperial harem rivalries

101
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,440
serve different purposes.

102
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,720
I once schemed for favor too,

103
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,520
but only to lose what I cherished most.

104
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,960
Here's my advice for you.

105
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,040
Abandon your relentless obsession.

106
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,208
Now, I only seek

107
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,840
to atone for my wrongdoings in the past.

108
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,960
I don't intend to vie for favor.

109
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,280
I know what you mean.

110
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,560
If what you just said is true,

111
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,280
I shall

112
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,120
live in peace with you.

113
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,240
Oh my.

114
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,560
Chief Wu

115
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,720
has truly been determined

116
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,160
to become someone's lapdog.

117
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,080
Sir,

118
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,680
have you caught wind of something?

119
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,560
Having served in the palace for decades,

120
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,120
nothing escapes my eyes.

121
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,960
What exactly are you implying?

122
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,960
Share some gossip to liven us up.

123
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,680
Then consider this mere storytelling.

124
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,960
Don't take it seriously.

125
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,160
Rest assured.

126
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,120
Our lips are sealed.

127
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,360
Have you heard

128
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,184
Concubine Shu has conceived
the imperial heir?

129
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:18,112
Yes.

130
00:05:18,112 --> 00:05:19,072
We've heard.

131
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,880
But someone

132
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,560
smuggled abortifacient into the palace.

133
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,960
Huh?

134
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,120
Another disaster looms.

135
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,880
Last time, Tong An got betrayed

136
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,160
and died horribly.

137
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,800
Now I wonder which poor soul

138
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,480
will pay with his life this time.

139
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,776
Sir,

140
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,928
are you suggesting

141
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,160
Chief Wu plans to eliminate
Concubine Shu's heir

142
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,760
and find a scapegoat?

143
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,800
Hey, you fool.

144
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,672
I never said that!

145
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,200
Such talk could have me killed.

146
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,224
Let's go!

147
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,200
(Fourteen Bureaus)

148
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,800
Your Highness, why are you here?

149
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,200
I came to tell you

150
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,320
stop aiding Consort Jing in her schemes.

151
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,520
Countless eyes are watching you.

152
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,400
Secrets can't stay hidden forever.

153
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,560
You'll be in trouble if it goes on.

154
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,080
What are you implying?

155
00:06:06,464 --> 00:06:07,560
I don't understand.

156
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,200
- Bi Da!
- I am Wu Linfu.

157
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,472
Fine.

158
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,040
Since you claim to be a servant,
let me ask you.

159
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,200
Why did you bring abortifacient in here?

160
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,632
Also,

161
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,960
how did Tong An die?

162
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,760
This is musk powder.

163
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,240
Why have you become this?

164
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,560
Is it because of me?

165
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,800
I'm asking you.

166
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,880
I have chosen this path.

167
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,672
I'll walk it alone.

168
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,480
Spare no concern for me.

169
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,800
I was wrong.

170
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,728
Don't be like this.

171
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,944
Please?

172
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,440
You overestimate me.

173
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,256
Bi Da,

174
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,336
I was wrong.

175
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,560
I don't want it.

176
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,640
I want nothing more.

177
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,560
Just become the one
you used to be, okay?

178
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,840
Listen to me.

179
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,480
If any imperial consort loses her child

180
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,200
because of you,

181
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,600
the blood on your hands

182
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,640
will stain eternally.

183
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,272
So what?

184
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,440
It is

185
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,120
none of your business.

186
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,496
And...

187
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,840
Never come again.

188
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,424
You're unwelcome here.

189
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,440
Why must you be like this?

190
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,560
You should leave now.

191
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,480
Commendable acting, Lord Wu.

192
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,440
Though consumed by affection,

193
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,440
you feign this heartless facade.

194
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,960
It almost

195
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,800
fooled me.

196
00:09:16,884 --> 00:09:18,912
(Yongxiu Palace)

197
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,040
Any orders, Your Highness?

198
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,920
Bribe someone

199
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,480
we can trust in Concubine Shu's palace.

200
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,000
Replace her usual incense

201
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,424
with this.

202
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,824
Your Highness.

203
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,160
Currently,

204
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,320
Concubine Shu is pregnant.

205
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,200
If anything goes wrong,

206
00:09:50,752 --> 00:09:51,640
we

207
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,840
can't afford the blame.

208
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,160
Don't worry.
I'll take responsibility for everything.

209
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,080
You won't be implicated.

210
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,928
Please rest assured.

211
00:10:04,928 --> 00:10:05,920
I

212
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,240
will surely fulfill your orders.

213
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,784
Your Highness.

214
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,416
Your Highness?

215
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,760
Your Highness?

216
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,040
How audacious!

217
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,840
How dare you tamper
with Concubine Shu's censer?

218
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,800
I've treated you well.

219
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,320
Why did you poison my censer?

220
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,040
Your Highness, I was wrong.

221
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,840
It was Yongxiu Palace's Eunuch Jian.

222
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,200
He ordered me to replace the incense
in your censer.

223
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,960
Yongxiu Palace?

224
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,520
So Concubine Yun truly intended
to harm Concubine Shu.

225
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,680
I shall meet His Majesty at once.

226
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,480
Greetings, Your Majesty.

227
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,040
May endless fortune bless you.

228
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,960
Concubine Yun,

229
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,400
Concubine Shu's maid
was caught red-handed with poison.

230
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,560
She confessed being ordered by you
to harm the imperial heir.

231
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,960
How do you explain?

232
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,920
Concubine Yun has come
to confront you directly.

233
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,440
Explain yourself clearly!

234
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,800
Eunuch Jian, please prove my innocence.

235
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,240
Even with a thousand lives,

236
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,960
I'd never dare harm the imperial heir.

237
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,640
I was ordered by Eunuch Jian!

238
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,440
Your Majesty, please spare me!

239
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,320
I

240
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,840
was also ordered

241
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,120
to arrange the maid

242
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,240
to replace the incense
in Concubine Shu's censer.

243
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,280
Who gave you the order?
