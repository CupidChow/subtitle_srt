00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:13,312
=Episode 13=

3
00:00:13,459 --> 00:00:15,840
(Ling Yun's Rainy Night Meeting
with a Guard Exposed)

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,760
Your Highness,

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,960
I don't understand something.

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,240
Your brother
is the esteemed General of Jingyuan.

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,200
How could the emperor's personal maid
be worthy of him?

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,320
Wouldn't it benefit that wretch?

9
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,200
Do you truly believe I want her
to become my brother's concubine

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,960
so she can live a life
of luxury ever after?

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,120
She can dream on.

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,800
Keep watch on her the next few days.

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,160
That wretch has many tricks
up her sleeve.

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,720
Mark my words.

15
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,200
She'll likely seize the first chance

16
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,640
to crawl into my brother's bed.

17
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,328
Understood.

18
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,080
But Your Highness,

19
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,400
if that should happen,

20
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,680
aren't you afraid it'll

21
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,080
implicate your brother?

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,360
My brother is a national hero.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,880
His Majesty won't jeopardize the peace

24
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,360
for the sake of a mere maid.

25
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,560
Moreover, in such matters,

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,600
women always bear the consequences.

27
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,080
As for men,

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,960
they just add another romantic anecdote
to their list.

29
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,760
Zhao Yanwan lives in Chengxi Palace now

30
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,400
and is acting superior
as the Zhaos' legitimate daughter.

31
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,160
I should have

32
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,560
ordered someone

33
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,840
to paint her singing routines
from her southern days.

34
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,680
Your Highness,

35
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,160
Consort Wan instigated General Zhao
to request the emperor's personal maid.

36
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,480
If this should anger His Majesty,

37
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,680
General Zhao could face repercussions.

38
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,360
You show such concern for my brother.

39
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,240
Do you also

40
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,120
aspire to be his concubine?

41
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,616
I wouldn't dare.

42
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,520
I once received General Zhao's kindness.

43
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,960
My only concern
is for Your Highness and General Zhao.

44
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,240
I harbor no ulterior motives.

45
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,072
Rise.

46
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,928
You're correct.

47
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,520
Zhao Yanwan

48
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,600
schemes ruthlessly
to stir trouble for favor.

49
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,520
She'll eventually ruin our family.

50
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,880
Now she can't even defeat a mere maid.

51
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,560
I must devise a way

52
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,080
to eliminate Ling Yun.

53
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,360
I won't let them bring harm
to my brother.

54
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,040
Your Highness,

55
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,320
taking personal action
against that Ling Yun wretch

56
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,240
would be honoring her too much.

57
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,160
After dealing with Ling Yun,

58
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,200
I'll settle accounts properly
with Zhao Yanwan.

59
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,440
The next few days,

60
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,240
have someone monitor
that wretch's movements.

61
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,216
Understood.

62
00:02:35,284 --> 00:02:38,976
(Night Watch Post, Taiping Gate)

63
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,360
Will you assist me?

64
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,080
I wish to request

65
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,080
a copy of the night duty roster
for Taiping Gate's military officers.

66
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,160
Who are you, young eunuch?

67
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,560
Raise your head.

68
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,360
Miss? It's you!

69
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,240
Please forgive me.

70
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,920
I was merely passing by.

71
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,400
I've disturbed your peace.

72
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,752
I'll take my leave.

73
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,520
Coming to Taiping Gate
at night dressed like this,

74
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,160
you said you were passing by?

75
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,688
General,

76
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,080
why feign ignorance

77
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,056
and humiliate me?

78
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,760
General, please let me go.

79
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,960
People might see us.

80
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,760
General,

81
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,000
let me go.

82
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,240
Promise me

83
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,192
you'll visit me again,

84
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,792
and I'll let go.

85
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,960
Thank you for your help.

86
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,720
The Tiankui Revitalizing Incense

87
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,720
is rationed to three qian per month
for the harem consorts,

88
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,200
but should you need it,

89
00:04:14,528 --> 00:04:15,440
simply give the order

90
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,400
no matter the quantity.

91
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,328
No, no.

92
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,928
Lady Ling Yun,

93
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,400
I dare not accept your silver.

94
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,200
You serve before His Majesty.

95
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,640
I must beg your favor

96
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,200
to speak well of me in the future.

97
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,592
Sir Eunuch,

98
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,960
I shall certainly mention

99
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,840
your diligent service to His Majesty.

100
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,640
Please accept the silver.

101
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,800
We all serve our masters.

102
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,992
None have it easy.

103
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,520
Take the surplus silver

104
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,320
for some wine money.

105
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,400
Thank you for your consideration.

106
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,056
Then

107
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,760
I will take it.

108
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,080
Your Highness,

109
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,480
I have uncovered new information.

110
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,800
Ling Yun posed as a eunuch

111
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,360
to secretly meet General Zhao
at Taiping Gate two nights ago.

112
00:05:09,952 --> 00:05:10,960
Yesterday, she visited

113
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,120
Imperial Household Department

114
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,680
and spent six months' wages

115
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,760
to buy Tiankui Revitalizing Incense.

116
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,480
Today,

117
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,280
that very incense burns
on General Wansong's desk.

118
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,960
How laughable!

119
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,120
She actually gifted Tiankui Incense
to my brother?

120
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,280
This premium incense

121
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
is rationed at three qian per month
for harem consorts.

122
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,080
Even with money,

123
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,200
one can't obtain extra.

124
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,680
That wretch

125
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,200
has invested heavily

126
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,520
to ensnare my brother.

127
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,696
Indeed.

128
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,160
It seems that wretch

129
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,960
genuinely aspires to become
General Wansong's concubine.

130
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,960
Her doom approaches.

131
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,560
Let her cling to her delusions
a little longer.

132
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,568
Your Majesty,

133
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,760
you've reviewed memorials
for four hours straight.

134
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,040
State affairs matter,

135
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,800
but your imperial health
matters equally.

136
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,320
Please have some tea.

137
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,880
Unexplained kindness.

138
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,664
What are you up to?

139
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,944
Your Majesty,

140
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,160
do you remember

141
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,600
my promise to ensure

142
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,480
your restful sleep free from insomnia?

143
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,688
I recall

144
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,240
someone's bold claim

145
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,440
to discipline arrogant officials for me

146
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,200
and guarantee my sound sleep.

147
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,760
Today

148
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,120
marks the day to fulfill that promise.

149
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,968
Wait a moment.

150
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,880
Your Majesty.

151
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,640
What's this?

152
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,560
Put on this rain cloak.

153
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,560
I'll take you somewhere.

154
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,080
This is a guard's attire.

155
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,680
I am the emperor.

156
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,960
How can I wear such garments?

157
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,960
It's raining outside,

158
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,280
and we're pressed for time.

159
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,760
I could only procure these.

160
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,600
Please put them on and follow me.

161
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,808
Ling Yun,

162
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,992
what are you doing?

163
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,144
Ling Yun?

164
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,584
Ling Yun,

165
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,440
where exactly are you taking me?

166
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,760
Your Majesty,

167
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,840
this opportunity is rare.

168
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,960
Just trust me.

169
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,320
You'll know shortly.

170
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,672
Support me properly.

171
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,240
How could you answer

172
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,024
if I'm harmed?

173
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,960
Your Majesty,

174
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,720
do you suffer from night blindness?

175
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,560
Why keep stepping in puddles?

176
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,616
How dare you!

177
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,832
Silence now.

178
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,520
Rest assured,

179
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,120
I will keep your secret.

180
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:06,840
Yanwan,

181
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,760
Hui Zhi saw Ling Yun

182
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,440
and a guard-dressed man sneaking

183
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,120
into the Imperial Garden together.

184
00:08:11,392 --> 00:08:12,448
Really?

185
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,560
That wretch is very cunning.

186
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,640
Are you certain?

187
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,480
Your Highness,

188
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,360
I saw clearly.

189
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,480
It was Ling Yun.

190
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,000
The guard wore a rain cloak.

191
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,520
They behaved intimately

192
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,600
and acted furtively.

193
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,720
With the ongoing rain,

194
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,400
the Imperial Garden stands deserted,

195
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,000
perfect for clandestine meetings.

196
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,800
(The fish bit the hook.)

197
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,320
(Time to reel in the net.)

198
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,720
If it's a clandestine meeting,

199
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,760
let's capitalize on this,

200
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,800
catch her in the act,

201
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,280
and eliminate her for good.

202
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,000
Let's go.

203
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,840
Let's find out

204
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,000
how His Majesty's personal maid

205
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,960
is carrying out an affair with a guard.

206
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,280
Go bring that guard

207
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,000
to the Fourteen Bureaus.

208
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:14,771
Understood.

209
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,560
Proceed with caution later.

210
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,400
We mustn't let her escape again.

211
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,440
Consort Wan,

212
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,760
I saw it clearly.

213
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,280
Ling Yun was holding
the guard's hand tightly.

214
00:09:25,536 --> 00:09:26,520
This time,

215
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,456
she won't escape.

216
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,632
Ling Yun,

217
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,008
it's late at night.

218
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,960
Why did you bring me to the boat?

219
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,560
Shh.

220
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,640
Your Majesty,

221
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,576
listen.

222
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,120
When I was young,

223
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,880
I lived with my parents in Jiangnan.

224
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,880
We stayed in a boathouse

225
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,960
for some time.

226
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,400
On rainy nights,

227
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,800
I'd hear raindrops pattering
on the boat canopy,

228
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,240
rustling softly.

229
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,600
The gentle dripping sounds

230
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,200
would lull me into sleep.

231
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,160
Soon I'd be sound asleep.

232
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,200
Since then,

233
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,088
I've known

234
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,160
no matter how troubled my heart,

235
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,880
a rainy night always brings

236
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,320
restful sleep.

237
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,560
I've never had

238
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,200
such experiences.

239
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,200
Yet hearing you,

240
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,280
I can already sense

241
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,760
that serenity

242
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,816
and comfort.

243
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,248
Your Majesty,

244
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,480
I heard of your sleepless nights.

245
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,360
I kept thinking

246
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,120
I must find a way

247
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,240
to bring Your Majesty
to this boat on a rainy night

248
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,120
to let the rain's rhythm

249
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,760
grant you peaceful slumber.

250
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,560
So you can recover your energy

251
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,840
while also experiencing

252
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,880
the comfort and joy of my childhood.

253
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,520
Your Highness!

254
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,160
Your Highness,

255
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,112
I've investigated.

256
00:11:46,144 --> 00:11:48,320
General Zhao was supposed
to be on watch tonight.

257
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,760
But now, he's not

258
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,920
at Taiping Gate.

259
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,352
No one knows where he is.

260
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,400
That wretch!

261
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,760
She won't escape now.

262
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,560
How audacious!

263
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,688
Daring to meet in the Imperial Garden

264
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,760
for such lewd acts!

265
00:12:09,664 --> 00:12:10,560
Let's go.

266
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,712
Let's board the boat

267
00:12:11,936 --> 00:12:12,992
to catch them in the act.
