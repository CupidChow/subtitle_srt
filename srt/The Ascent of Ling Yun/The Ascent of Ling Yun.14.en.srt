00:00:06,388 --> 00:00:10,912
=The Ascent of Ling Yun=

2
00:00:11,091 --> 00:00:13,344
=Episode 14=

3
00:00:13,344 --> 00:00:15,776
(Emperor Caught in Scandal!
Ling Yun's Ascent!)

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:18,944
You wretch!

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,960
Let's see where you can run this time.

6
00:00:22,944 --> 00:00:23,880
Greetings,

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,880
Consort Wan

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,080
and Concubine Zhao.

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,600
May Your Highnesses be well.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,880
Ling Yun,

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,640
I truly admire your audacity.

12
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:31,920
In the entire harem,

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,240
there's no one bolder
in thought and action than you.

14
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,160
Your Highness,

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,400
I'm merely a servant

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,520
fulfilling my basic duties.

17
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,520
The boldness Your Highness speaks of

18
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,920
is beyond my humble worth.

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,600
Stop pretending, you wretch!

20
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,600
What a place you've chosen.

21
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,000
On this rainy night,

22
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,400
this boathouse is totally private.

23
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,360
This spot is ideal

24
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,080
for your clandestine meetings

25
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,280
and illicit affairs.

26
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,320
We caught you in the act.

27
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,680
Let's see you deny this.

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,048
Caught in the act?

29
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,400
You've misunderstood.

30
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,600
I am not

31
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,600
meeting anyone secretly.

32
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,400
Still lying even now?

33
00:01:03,776 --> 00:01:04,840
Shun Xi,

34
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,000
pull open those bed curtains.

35
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,320
I'd like to see

36
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,400
which despicable servant
is her adulterer.

37
00:01:09,408 --> 00:01:10,272
Understood.

38
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,584
No need.

39
00:01:11,904 --> 00:01:12,896
I am

40
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,400
the 'adulterer' you speak of.

41
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,616
Your Majesty?

42
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,120
(Where's my brother?)

43
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,960
On this rainy night,

44
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,600
how diligent of you two

45
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,000
to rush here to catch my affair.

46
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,440
I wouldn't dare.

47
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,360
There must be some mistake.

48
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,416
Mistake?

49
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,520
It seems you wanted to humiliate me.

50
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,200
Your Majesty,

51
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,400
no amount of courage would

52
00:01:41,536 --> 00:01:42,480
make me dare question

53
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,960
your choice to consort with a maid.

54
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,280
I truly didn't know

55
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,360
it was Your Majesty.

56
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,600
I beg your forgiveness.

57
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,080
In this harem,

58
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,600
is there anything
you Zhao siblings won't meddle in?

59
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,272
Please calm your wrath.

60
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,616
I admit my fault.

61
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,200
I implore your mercy.

62
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,680
Hear my decree:

63
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,952
From this day forth,

64
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,120
Ling Yun is a Noble Lady.

65
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,640
She takes Yongxiu Palace.

66
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,760
I receive this decree.

67
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,200
Thank you, Your Majesty.

68
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,760
Henceforth, I shall

69
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,240
strictly observe palace rules

70
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,600
and serve Your Majesty wholeheartedly.

71
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,840
Concubine Zhao has defied my authority.

72
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,960
She is demoted

73
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,936
to Noble Lady.

74
00:02:19,936 --> 00:02:21,520
She shall reflect in Zhongning Palace

75
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,680
as a warning to all.

76
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,808
I

77
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,280
accept the decree.

78
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,648
(You wretch!)

79
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,680
(You set me up again!)

80
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,680
Greetings,

81
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,600
Your Majesty.

82
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,720
Zhao Wansong,

83
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,160
do you admit guilt?

84
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,920
Your Majesty,

85
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,200
I'm terrified

86
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,160
but know not my offense.

87
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,944
Wu Linfu,

88
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,096
tell him.

89
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,216
Yes, Your Majesty.

90
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,560
Tonight, the Fourteen Bureaus

91
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,160
caught Suhebaru,
Taiping Gate's night guard,

92
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,680
and Shun Xi,
Chengxi Palace's chief eunuch,

93
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,000
collaborating

94
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,080
to share information.

95
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,512
Being interrogated,

96
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,160
Suhebaru confessed

97
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,800
that during his patrol duties,

98
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,560
he regularly relayed messages

99
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,320
between General Zhao

100
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,600
and the confidants of both Chengxi
and Zhongning Palaces.

101
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,000
Court officials are forbidden
from colluding with harem consorts.

102
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,560
As a high-ranking official

103
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,560
with your sisters being harem consorts,

104
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,040
you've flouted palace rules

105
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,960
knowingly!

106
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,640
Are you conspiring

107
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,760
against the state?

108
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,480
You said you didn't know

109
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,960
your crime?

110
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,640
Your Majesty,

111
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,520
I'm innocent.

112
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,080
Our correspondence

113
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,920
contained only mutual greetings.

114
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,400
There was no conspiracy.

115
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,000
Please see clearly.

116
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,400
I have erred,

117
00:03:44,576 --> 00:03:45,520
but I merely

118
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,480
worried about my sisters
in the imperial harem

119
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,512
missing their families.

120
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,640
So I sometimes shared
funny home anecdotes

121
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,280
to ease their homesickness.

122
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,480
I'd never conspire
with the harem to disrupt

123
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,400
state affairs.

124
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,360
Please see clearly.

125
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,240
If that were true,

126
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,920
would you need to be so secretive?

127
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,120
Zhao Wansong, you violated

128
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,960
palace rules

129
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,680
to try to disrupt governance.

130
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,040
Given your military merits,

131
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,592
I'll be lenient on you.

132
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,920
Go to the Clan Court

133
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,120
to receive 80 strikes.

134
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,520
And no pay for a year

135
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,872
as a warning to others.

136
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,760
Consort Wan ignored palace rules

137
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:19,968
and acted recklessly.

138
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,040
She is sentenced

139
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,640
to confinement in Chengxi Palace

140
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,840
for reflection.

141
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,240
Another misstep

142
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,688
will lead to no leniency.

143
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,200
- I...
- I...

144
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,200
- accept the decree.
- accept the decree.

145
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,040
- Farewell.
- Farewell.

146
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,640
You're truly cunning.

147
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,880
Since the day
you entered Chengxi Palace,

148
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,000
every single incident
has been part of your scheme, right?

149
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,520
Just wait.

150
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,560
You may continue being domineering.

151
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,360
If you're ever trampled underfoot,

152
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,080
you'll lose the chance

153
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,320
to act so arrogantly.

154
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,760
Ling Yun,

155
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,600
you'd better watch your wretched life.

156
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,920
You'll never get to trample over me.

157
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,360
I'd very much like to see

158
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,640
whether I get to trample over you.

159
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,320
Lady Ling Yun,

160
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,600
don't be rude to Consort Wan.

161
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,048
General Zhao,

162
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,960
before speaking to me,

163
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,120
you should first address me

164
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,440
as Noble Lady Yun.

165
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,680
His Majesty was caught like an adulterer

166
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,776
with Ling Yun.

167
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,120
Enraged,

168
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,440
His Majesty

169
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,760
made Ling Yun a Noble Lady.

170
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,680
Ling Yun

171
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,240
hasn't disappointed me.

172
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,800
She's turned both court and harem
upside down.

173
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,560
Your Highness,

174
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,640
did you foresee

175
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,720
that Ling Yun

176
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,720
could handle Consort Wan
and Concubine Zhao?

177
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,880
The harem's daily tedium

178
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,680
makes her schemes quite impressive.

179
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,400
Not only does His Majesty like her,

180
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,760
but I also quite enjoy her too.

181
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,560
This time not only
have the Zhao sisters fallen,

182
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,080
but even General Zhao

183
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,080
received 80 strikes.

184
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,880
Ling Yun

185
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,320
is truly something.

186
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,440
As a blade, Ling Yun
has just been sharpened.

187
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,760
The real drama is yet to come.

188
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,176
You've gotten your wish.

189
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,776
From now on,

190
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,680
you're a concubine of the palace.

191
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,600
A mere Noble Lady

192
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,080
is just the beginning.

193
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,200
What I want

194
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,560
is the position beneath one
but above all others.

195
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,760
In this imperial harem,

196
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,720
don't show your edge fully.

197
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,520
More eyes will watch you

198
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,768
from now on.

199
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,360
You must be discreet,

200
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,760
with no more acting on impulse.

201
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,560
Life is meant

202
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,760
to be lived with unrestrained freedom.

203
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,920
I've always followed my heart

204
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,160
and still survive, don't I?

205
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,280
You're just lucky.

206
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,920
His Majesty is inscrutable.

207
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,560
Do you think your scheme

208
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,880
of using the Zhao sisters
to get His Majesty 'caught'

209
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,240
hasn't aroused his suspicion?

210
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,240
His Majesty simply

211
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,440
took this opportunity

212
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,720
to discipline General Zhao
and the Zhao sisters

213
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,240
and postponed your punishment.

214
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,880
The seed of doubt in His Majesty's heart

215
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,080
will grow over time,

216
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,960
taking root and sprouting.

217
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,760
It could claim your life at any moment.

218
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,240
Thank you for your advice.

219
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,960
There is no returning for me now.

220
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,440
I must avenge my parents.

221
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,200
Having sacrificed my freedom,

222
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,320
I'm now His Majesty's woman.

223
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,832
My lord,

224
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,960
will you still assist me?

225
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,960
What am I to you?

226
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,240
A tool to summon and dismiss at will?

227
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,560
I consider you my closest friend.

228
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,400
What if I wish to be more than friends?

229
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,440
Given our current stations,

230
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,560
do we have any other choice?
