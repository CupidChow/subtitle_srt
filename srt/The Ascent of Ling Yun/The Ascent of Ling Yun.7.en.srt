00:00:06,323 --> 00:00:10,912
=The Ascent of Ling Yun=

2
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:13,312
=Episode 7=

3
00:00:13,408 --> 00:00:15,808
(Ling Yun Took the Blame
And Got Sent to Servitude Bureau)

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,560
- May you be ever blessed and in peace.
- May you be ever blessed and in peace.

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,840
Today marks the spring equinox.

6
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,880
I'm just back from rituals
outside the palace.

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,800
As I see flowers blooming in the palace,

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,880
so full of life and grace,

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,520
they remind me of you,
my beloved consorts,

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,720
each blessed with beauty and talent.

11
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,320
I hope you can support each other

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,640
like these vernal flowers,

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,840
get along well,

14
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,080
and remain by my side

15
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,400
to share my burdens.

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,872
I shall bear this in heart

17
00:00:51,872 --> 00:00:54,120
(Consort Jing)
and never disappoint your expectations.

18
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,232
Rise.

19
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,480
Please be seated.

20
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,840
Your Majesty,

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,080
for today's Spring Banquet,

22
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,840
I personally oversaw preparations

23
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,640
to share this

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,240
glorious springtime with you

25
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,560
and celebrate our flourishing realm
with other consorts.

26
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,640
Thank you, my beloved.

27
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,200
Thank you for your concern.

28
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,800
My effort is worthwhile

29
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,720
if it brings you joy.

30
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,640
Let the banquet begin.

31
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,600
(Oh, no!)

32
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,120
(I still fell into Consort Wan's trap.)

33
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,720
(Well, Lian'er.)

34
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,080
(You truly never disappoint me.)

35
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,960
Check out what's happening.

36
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,952
Yes.

37
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,480
Your Majesty,

38
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,880
hidden blades were discovered
in Concubine Zhao's shoes.

39
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,880
Please endure the pain.

40
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,040
The physician is on the way.

41
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,560
Concubine Zhao,

42
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,000
your foot injury is severe.

43
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,480
You should refrain from moving.

44
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,600
I fear I'll never be able to dance
for Your Majesty again.

45
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,480
The one who harmed me is so vile.

46
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,400
Your Majesty, please bring me justice.

47
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,760
Be at ease, my beloved.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,880
I will investigate thoroughly.

49
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,960
Your Majesty, these dance shoes
were gifted by Consort Wan.

50
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,680
She asked me to perform
before you today.

51
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,680
You struck so ruthlessly.

52
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,360
Are you trying to kill me?

53
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,360
Consort Wan,

54
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,160
what did Concubine Zhao mean
by dance shoes?

55
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,360
Your Majesty,

56
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,160
as I know,

57
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,040
Consort Wan orchestrated
Concubine Zhao's performance

58
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,880
and provided the dance shoes.

59
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,080
Today, Concubine Zhao got injured
during the dance,

60
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,720
and blades were found
in her dance shoes.

61
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,640
Consort Wan's involvement
can't be overlooked.

62
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,040
What do you imply, Consort Jing?

63
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,240
Are you accusing me
of hiding blades in her dance shoes?

64
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,224
Consort Wan,

65
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,160
I want to hear your explanation.

66
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,080
I beg your fair judgment.

67
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,440
I did dispatch servants

68
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,160
to deliver dance shoes
to Concubine Zhao.

69
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,360
But accusing me of plotting harm

70
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,080
is truly unjust to me.

71
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,840
Concubine Zhao and I are sisters.

72
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,280
Though we had disagreements,

73
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,880
we are still family.

74
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,720
Besides, I'd hardly need

75
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,040
to disgrace myself
with such crude means.

76
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,800
Maybe

77
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,120
the delivering maid interfered.

78
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,480
Ling Yun! See what you have done!

79
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,680
Confess now!

80
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,240
You delivered dance shoes
to Concubine Zhao?

81
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,760
Yes.

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,760
Your Majesty, I merely obeyed orders

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,600
to deliver them to Zhongning Palace.

84
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,480
I know nothing else.

85
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,680
Caught with evidence,

86
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,600
only you handled these shoes.

87
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,520
Who else could it be?

88
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,816
Your Highness,

89
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,200
I bear Concubine Zhao no enmity.

90
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,040
Why would I harm her?

91
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,400
I am innocent.

92
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,360
Your Majesty,

93
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,760
how could a lowly maid

94
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,040
dare harm a concubine

95
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,600
without instigation?

96
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,320
I beg your fair judgment.

97
00:05:07,443 --> 00:05:08,672
(Virtue, Blessing, Peace)

98
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,880
I didn't expect Chief Wu

99
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,600
to defend a mere maid.

100
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,800
Oh, right.

101
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,400
(Virtue, Blessing, Peace)
Chief Wu has been close to this maid.

102
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,040
Could you be her mastermind?

103
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,200
I wouldn't dare.

104
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,320
Your Majesty,

105
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,880
the use of blades within the palace

106
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,080
is strictly documented.

107
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,040
If I ever retrieved blades,

108
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,400
the records would immediately
prove my innocence.

109
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,200
Tong An,

110
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,640
go check the records
in the Imperial Household Department.

111
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,816
Yes.

112
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,680
What if someone else
retrieved them for you?

113
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,680
Your Highness, every servant
in Chengxi Palace

114
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,000
has been replaced by your chosen staff.

115
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,800
They would never help me.

116
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,360
If someone did help me,

117
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,400
it must have been the one
from other palaces.

118
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,840
Your Highness, may I ask

119
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,600
which palace you suspect

120
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,000
aided me in obtaining blades

121
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,120
to harm Concubine Zhao?

122
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,200
Sharp-tongued one.
You still dare to argue!

123
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,680
It seems you can only confess

124
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,000
in the Disciplinary Court.

125
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,440
Your Majesty, a mere maid

126
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,800
couldn't possibly dare
commit such a grand scheme.

127
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,120
Consort Wan,
you rush to punish this maid.

128
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,600
Are you trying to hide something?

129
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,760
Why would I sabotage my own banquet

130
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,800
by gifting blade-filled dance shoes?

131
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,960
I beg your judgment.

132
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,240
Your Majesty,
please deliver justice for me.

133
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,200
Your Majesty.

134
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,160
Consort Wan is benevolent

135
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,160
and shares sisterly bonds
with Concubine Zhao.

136
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,320
They both hold deep devotion for you.

137
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,960
I believe

138
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,360
someone must have
deliberately sowed discord

139
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,840
to ruin their sisterhood.

140
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,000
With countless palace staff
accessing blades,

141
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,760
it's really not easy
to identify the culprit immediately.

142
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,160
I'm afraid the investigation

143
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,200
would disturb the masters' peace

144
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,840
and distress innocent servants.

145
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,320
I'm willing to shoulder your concern,

146
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,360
accepting punishment
to resolve everything.

147
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,000
Your Majesty, I await

148
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,720
your punishment.

149
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,960
(Finally, someone knows
how to give me a way out.)

150
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,560
Look up.

151
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,960
Since you admit your guilt

152
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,160
and accept your punishment,

153
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,760
I shall send you

154
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,360
to the Servitude Bureau.

155
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,040
How about that?

156
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,000
Thank you for sparing my life,
Your Majesty.

157
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,760
(You lowly maid.)

158
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,720
(You escaped death this time.)

159
00:07:38,964 --> 00:07:41,184
(Zhongning Palace)

160
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,200
Gently!

161
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,120
Your Highness,

162
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,160
why did you harm your precious body?

163
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,080
With such severe injuries,

164
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,560
His Majesty just sent a maid
to the Servitude Bureau.

165
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,600
Consort Wan got off lightly.

166
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,640
His Majesty shields her too well.

167
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,840
Your Highness,

168
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,040
His Majesty still favors you.

169
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,360
Otherwise, he won't have asked someone
to send the finest jade ointment here.

170
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,000
His Majesty fears
that your fair feet might be scarred.

171
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,400
Of course, His Majesty favors me.

172
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,200
Once I recover,

173
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,960
I'll settle this debt with Consort Wan.

174
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,520
Now I am a convicted servant.

175
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,240
Chief Wu of the Fourteen Bureaus,
having you

176
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,120
escort me to the Servitude Bureau

177
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,160
is quite the honor.

178
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,600
Your so-called wit

179
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,840
is just stupidity and rashness
in this palace.

180
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,360
I asked you to leave,

181
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,840
yet you insisted on staying.

182
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,160
Now look at you,

183
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,320
ending up in the Servitude Bureau.

184
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,600
You underestimate me, my lord.

185
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,200
I chose to go to the Servitude Bureau.

186
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,240
You didn't see
His Majesty's expressions that time.

187
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,680
When both consorts refused to let it go,

188
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,360
His Majesty needed a way out.

189
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,920
I provided it

190
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
and helped him out.

191
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,960
It saved my life

192
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,760
and made me escape Consort Wan's grasp.

193
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,000
I truly underestimated you.

194
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,560
Impressive scheming.

195
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,640
But you should know

196
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,920
luck won't always favor you.

197
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,560
When heaven makes you fall,

198
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,320
maybe it's warning you

199
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,840
to give up.

200
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,200
I won't give up.

201
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,200
I'll rise from every fall

202
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,720
and endure every wound.

203
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,040
Because I've got important things to do.

204
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,904
My lord,

205
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,560
do you have family outside the palace?

206
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,840
I have an older sister.

207
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,720
And I have a younger brother.

208
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,320
But we've been separated for many years.

209
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,360
I don't even know if he's alive

210
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,720
or how he has been.

211
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,520
I don't want to be your younger brother.

212
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,720
What?

213
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,960
Nothing.

214
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,200
Let's go now.

215
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,040
First time in the Servitude Bureau.

216
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,320
Being late won't be good.

217
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,600
Take care of that lowly maid
for Her Highness.

218
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,160
You'll be duly rewarded.

219
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,240
Wow.

220
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,960
This... Wow.

221
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,600
Thank you so much.

222
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,960
Ling Yun.

223
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,720
You were lucky to escape
with your life today.

224
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,840
But once you enter the Servitude Bureau,

225
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,960
crushing you will be as easy
as crushing an ant.

226
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,520
Thank you for the reminder, Madam.

227
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,280
Though ants are weak,

228
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,800
I've never heard

229
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,680
of all ants in the world
being wiped out.

230
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,320
And I won't be crushed so easily.

231
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,000
Sharp-tongued one.

232
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,320
Look who's here.

233
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,960
Isn't this Consort Wan's lapdog?

234
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,560
What? Got thrown out?

235
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,920
Cui Wei.

236
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,600
Servitude Bureau's labor

237
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,920
still hasn't cured your foul mouth.

238
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,320
Ling Yun,

239
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,440
you got us sent
to the Servitude Bureau back then.

240
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,000
Now you're here too.

241
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,920
The heavens are just.

242
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,080
We'll see.

243
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,600
I won't let you off easy.

244
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,816
Newcomer.

245
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,240
(Eunuch Gao, Head of Servitude Bureau)
You'll stay in this chamber for now.

246
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,040
Go!

247
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,976
Ru Yi!

248
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,480
Ling Yun.

249
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,800
Why are you here?

250
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,960
Who allowed you to release a convicted
servant? According to rules here,

251
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,840
wrongdoers stay locked up overnight.

252
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,080
I did nothing wrong.

253
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,560
Eunuch Gao wanted the jade bracelet
my mother left me.

254
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,120
I'd rather die than give it up.

255
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,760
So he falsely accused me
of ruining his clothes.

256
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,080
and locked me here
without hearing my side.

257
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,120
You lowly maid!

258
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,480
You dare slander Eunuch Gao!

259
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,920
Cui Wei,

260
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,960
you punished her.

261
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,480
- Is this place beyond palace rules?
- You...

262
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,920
Well.

263
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,000
Look at you.

264
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,400
You're quite the sharp-tongued one.

265
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,360
Here, I am the palace rules.

266
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,360
Seize her!
