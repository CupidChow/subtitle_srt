=Episode 17=

3
00:00:13,427 --> 00:00:15,667
(A Fatal Blow Against Consort Wan)

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,592
Your Majesty!

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,320
Your Majesty, help!

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,472
Your Majesty!

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,760
Your Majesty, please help!

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,096
Your Majesty!

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,240
My love,

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,200
what's with your face?

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,120
What happened to her face?

12
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,352
Your Majesty,

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,920
Consort Wan's face

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,720
was scratched by Noble Lady Zhao's cat.

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,784
Your Majesty, I...

16
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:51,720
Noble Lady Zhao,

17
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,864
you let your cat hurt her

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,080
out of jealousy.

19
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,520
You've disappointed me.

20
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,480
Your Majesty,

21
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,320
I didn't do it!

22
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,880
I swear I'm innocent!

23
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,720
From now on,

24
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,040
Noble Lady Zhao is grounded.

25
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,520
Without my decree,

26
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,280
she shall not leave her palace.

27
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,672
Understood.

28
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:21,800
Your Highness,

29
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,920
consorts have come to visit.

30
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,360
Send them away!

31
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,336
Understood.

32
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,936
Halt!

33
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,120
Come back.

34
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,232
Your Highness.

35
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,472
Raise your head.

36
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,840
I told you to raise your head.

37
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,720
You dare not look at me?

38
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,200
Why don't you dare?

39
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,640
Is my face hideous now?

40
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,160
I wouldn't dare.

41
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,120
All say Your Highness' beauty
is peerless

42
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,520
and outshines the harem.

43
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,920
Even with a scratch,

44
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,200
you remain the fairest.

45
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,600
You all dare...

46
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,480
You all dare gossip behind my back?

47
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,680
My face got a scratch,

48
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,880
and you revel in it!

49
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,920
Out!

50
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,920
Summon the physician!

51
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,192
At once.

52
00:02:20,339 --> 00:02:22,240
(Zhongning Palace)

53
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,560
Why are you here?

54
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,920
I was worried you might be lonely.

55
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,120
So I came

56
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,320
with refreshments to keep you company.

57
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,080
Such unprovoked kindness.

58
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,960
What's your real intention?

59
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,960
I

60
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,600
don't kick those already down.

61
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,336
Sit.

62
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,520
One thing

63
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,600
puzzles me.

64
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,760
How exactly
did you avoid the cat's attack?

65
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,880
When Consort Wan gave me
that hair ornament,

66
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,800
I examined it thoroughly,

67
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,160
suspecting tampering.

68
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,600
But only a fool

69
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,040
would poison it outright.

70
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,160
True.

71
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,880
With no poison in the flower,

72
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,440
how would you

73
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,200
scheme against me?

74
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,520
Later, investigating your palace

75
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,680
revealed that someone exposed your cat

76
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,840
to rabid dogs.

77
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,520
Your cat seemed
to have become rabid too.

78
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,920
Then I understood

79
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,240
that your plan

80
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,760
might be using
geraniums' hallucinogenic properties

81
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,400
to make your cat attack me

82
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,640
and then claiming

83
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,840
rabies as an excuse

84
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,120
to avoid blame.

85
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,760
Now I see.

86
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,280
Therefore,

87
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,760
you added geraniums

88
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,600
to the pastries you brought.

89
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,960
Ling Yun,

90
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,840
I must admit

91
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,520
you impress me

92
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,920
as a master strategist.

93
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,960
I concede defeat.

94
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,760
But must you scar her face?

95
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,560
Consort Wan reaped what she sowed.

96
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,584
But you

97
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,680
are blameless.

98
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,680
I came today

99
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,160
also to ask you

100
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,720
if we

101
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,880
can join forces.

102
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,960
Ling Yun,

103
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,520
have you gone mad?

104
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,240
Zhao Yanwan and I share Zhao blood.

105
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,120
Who let you sow discord between us?

106
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,800
Even if I loathe Zhao Yanwan,

107
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,640
I would never collaborate with you.

108
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,840
Don't be so absolute in your words.

109
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,520
Perhaps by tomorrow,

110
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,200
you'll have a change of heart.

111
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,560
If you and Consort Wan
are indeed what you said,

112
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,080
now that you've been demoted in rank

113
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,800
and grounded for days,

114
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,200
why hasn't Consort Wan
interceded with His Majesty

115
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,680
to plead for mercy on you

116
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,960
to secure your release?

117
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,680
She didn't even

118
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,200
bother to visit you once.

119
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,920
Visiting Zhongning Palace

120
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,080
may bring ill fortune.

121
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,880
The chrysanthemum tea can offset that.

122
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,560
Zhao Lian'er still dared
to oppose me stubbornly.

123
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,480
It seems she hasn't realized

124
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,480
she's already stepped into doom.

125
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,480
Noble Lady Zhao refused
to talk about Consort Wan.

126
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,280
What should we do now?

127
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,800
She didn't mention it,

128
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,320
but her reactions

129
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,720
confirmed some of my suspicions.

130
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,600
And they are...

131
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,760
Consort Wan is actually
a pitiful and insecure woman.

132
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,640
(Though having unparalleled beauty)

133
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,760
(and supreme favor,)

134
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,840
(her constant fear of losing it)

135
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,760
(makes her obsess over her appearance.)

136
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,560
(She foolishly believes
that maintaining peerless beauty)

137
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,720
(will ensure her invincibility
in the imperial harem.)

138
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,080
But beauty fades with time

139
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,280
like generals grow old.

140
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,680
Physical charm
is the most unreliable asset.

141
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,920
Those who rely on beauty

142
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,680
find love dims when beauty fades.

143
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,440
In this imperial harem

144
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,280
filled with beauties,

145
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,360
(His Majesty doesn't cherish them,)

146
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,640
(as there are too many.)

147
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,800
Even the fairest face becomes tedious

148
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,480
after constant exposure.

149
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,800
How pitiful

150
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,000
that Consort Wan
fails to understand this.

151
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,720
She tolerates not the slightest flaw
in her beauty.

152
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,880
(Any minor mishap)

153
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,080
(triggers her anxiety)

154
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,760
(and her crazy fuss over her face.)

155
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,360
How dare you slap my face?

156
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,680
(She's become a slave
to her own beauty.)

157
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,000
I intend to exploit her inner fears,

158
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,360
her shallow nature,

159
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,000
and her appearance anxiety

160
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,760
to deliver the final blow.

161
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,680
When my lady was favored before,

162
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,120
you visited Zhongning Palace
ten times daily to flatter her.

163
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,880
Now you even obstruct

164
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,480
her nutritional supplies.

165
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,320
Hui Zhi,

166
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,440
I merely follow protocol.

167
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,360
Your lady currently holds
the rank of Noble Lady.

168
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,080
A Noble Lady naturally

169
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,880
shouldn't receive
concubine-level privileges.

170
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,680
No authority in the harem

171
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,800
would find fault

172
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,840
with my conduct.

173
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,760
You pack of opportunistic curs!

174
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,840
When my lady regains favor,

175
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,200
you'll face results!

176
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,840
Watch your step!

177
00:07:56,096 --> 00:07:57,040
My lady

178
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,760
already suffers
from these vile servants'

179
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,712
withheld rations.

180
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,480
Now the few provisions

181
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,880
were knocked over by you.

182
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,040
Watch your tongue!

183
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,280
They simply follow protocol.

184
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,296
Where's the fault?

185
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,680
Blame your lady
for her own incompetence.

186
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,128
Madam Jiang,

187
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,520
the Zhaos' generosity

188
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,360
benefited you too.

189
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,000
How can you be so cold
and kick us when we're down?

190
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,280
You presume to lecture me?

191
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,680
Hui Zhi,

192
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,680
stop weeping here.

193
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,656
Leave at once.

194
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:33,080
Hui Zhi,

195
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,112
get up quickly.

196
00:08:35,968 --> 00:08:37,440
These servants flatter the powerful

197
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,720
and oppress the weak.

198
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,640
Madam Jiang, you encourage them

199
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,040
instead of stopping them.

200
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,360
Aren't you shaming Consort Wan's
authority over the Six Palaces?

201
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,960
Another sharp-tongued maid.

202
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,200
Don't presume
Noble Lady Yun's recent favor

203
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,800
gives you license for insolence.

204
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,480
Within days,

205
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,360
Noble Lady Zhao's present

206
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,680
is your lady's future.

207
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,464
You!

208
00:09:03,136 --> 00:09:04,064
Hui Zhi,

209
00:09:04,064 --> 00:09:05,040
come with me.

210
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,480
My lady personally selected gifts
for your lady

211
00:09:07,716 --> 00:09:08,896
and had me bring them to you.

212
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,616
Just you wait.

213
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,040
Here.

214
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,720
These are premium bird's nests
and ginseng.

215
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,400
These are cordyceps

216
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,664
and fish maw.

217
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,640
Thank you, Fu Xiang

218
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,680
and your lady.

219
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,080
No need for formalities.

220
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,080
My lady said

221
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,560
that if your lady's cat
hadn't done well,

222
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,200
we wouldn't have achieved this.

223
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,880
Now that your lady faces cold treatment,

224
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,200
we will certainly lend assistance

225
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,360
and won't stand by.

226
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,936
What does it

227
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,640
have to do with my lady's cat?

228
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,680
Fu Xiang, have you forgotten?

229
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,760
If your lady hadn't interfered,

230
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,120
my lady and Consort Wan wouldn't have

231
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,160
ended up in such discord.

232
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,840
I'd better not

233
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,120
accept these things.

234
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,440
Your Highness!

235
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,888
Your Highness!

236
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,168
Your Highness.

237
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,880
What is it?

238
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,856
Why the panic?

239
00:10:13,856 --> 00:10:14,720
Your Highness,

240
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,840
at the Imperial Household,

241
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,480
I saw Fu Xiang,
Noble Lady Yun's personal maid,

242
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,000
shielding Hui Zhi at every turn.

243
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,640
Could

244
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,080
Noble Lady Yun and Noble Lady Zhao

245
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,880
have secretly colluded?

246
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,280
I also heard them mention the cat,

247
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,720
claiming it has done well.

248
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,680
No wonder!

249
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,680
Ling Yun was wearing
the geranium hair ornament,

250
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,240
yet the cat ignored her

251
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,360
and charged at me!

252
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,960
That idiotic Zhao Lian'er

253
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,040
colluded with Yongxiu Palace

254
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,080
to frame me,

255
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,280
ruining my face,

256
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,880
so they could steal
His Majesty's favor from me!

257
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,320
Noble Lady Zhao is your blood sister.

258
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,920
How could she bear

259
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,360
to go so viciously at you?

260
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,120
Those who betray me

261
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,880
must die.

262
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,400
Zhao Lian'er,

263
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,960
you showed no mercy.

264
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,760
Don't blame me for being ruthless!
