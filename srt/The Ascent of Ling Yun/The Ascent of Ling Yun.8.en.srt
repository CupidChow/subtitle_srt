00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:13,312
=Episode 8=

3
00:00:13,408 --> 00:00:15,712
(Someone! Chief Wu is Harassing Me)

4
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,320
Wait.

5
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,640
Eunuch Gao, I've got something to say.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,056
Let go of her.

7
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,600
Eunuch Gao,

8
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,360
I'm a newcomer in Servitude Bureau
and don't know the rules.

9
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,400
Your discipline was justified.

10
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,520
From now on, I will behave properly

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,640
and be at your service.

12
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,480
Who wants your money?

13
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,800
Enough.

14
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,760
You know what's good for you.

15
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,000
All of you, stay put!

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,120
Don't cause any more trouble.

17
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,960
Ever since you left
the Fragrance Bureau,

18
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,680
they've been giving me a hard time.

19
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,880
Later, they found an excuse

20
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,720
and sent me here.

21
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,400
Ru Yi,

22
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,200
I got you into this.

23
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,480
Ling Yun, don't say that.

24
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,320
Actually, I got you into this.

25
00:01:49,216 --> 00:01:51,080
You didn't know
that after my mother died,

26
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,720
you were the only one on my side.

27
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,200
If it weren't for you,

28
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,760
I don't know
how I would've made it this far.

29
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,040
I heard

30
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,960
the masters grant clemency every spring.

31
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,760
Hold on a little longer.

32
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,840
When the time comes,
beg for their mercy.

33
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,480
Maybe you can leave
the Servitude Bureau.

34
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,240
With some luck,

35
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,600
you might even escape
the imperial harem earlier.

36
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,040
We're just lowly servants
from the Servitude Bureau.

37
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,920
Which master would care about us?

38
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,440
Even if there's clemency,

39
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,640
no one would remember us.

40
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,280
But with you by my side,

41
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,720
I'm not afraid anymore.

42
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,904
Don't worry.

43
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,520
I'll protect you.

44
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,600
From now on,

45
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,880
I'll protect you properly.

46
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,520
I won't let them bully you again.

47
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,960
Those who dare bully us

48
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,760
won't get away with it.

49
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,280
Listen well.

50
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,440
I'll throw her into the well soon.

51
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,480
If she struggles,

52
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,600
hold her down for me.

53
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,128
Eunuch Gao,

54
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,600
I'll help you kill Ling Yun.

55
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,560
You must keep your word,

56
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,720
plead with Consort Wan for me

57
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,080
and get me out of the Servitude Bureau.

58
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,640
Well, rest assured.

59
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,760
You'll get your reward after it's done.

60
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,800
Thank you, Eunuch Gao.

61
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,080
What are you doing?

62
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,920
Help!

63
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,000
Let go!

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,976
Let go!

65
00:03:44,896 --> 00:03:45,920
Help me!

66
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,080
- Help!
- Hurry!

67
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,480
Do you want to leave
the Servitude Bureau or not?

68
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,520
Help!

69
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,480
Let go!

70
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,184
Harder!

71
00:03:58,688 --> 00:03:59,680
Help!

72
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,544
Hurry!

73
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,928
Let go!

74
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,520
Harder! How could you...

75
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,064
Chief Wu,

76
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,160
why have you come
to the Servitude Bureau?

77
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,240
You insolent servants!

78
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,920
How dare you attempt murder
in the palace!

79
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,800
Drag them out and beat them to death!

80
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,280
- Chief Wu, spare me!
- Chief Wu,

81
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,680
spare me!

82
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,840
Eunuch Gao threatened me.

83
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,320
If I didn't obey,

84
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,080
he would throw me into the well.

85
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,440
It's Consort Wan.

86
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,560
Her servant Madam Jiang

87
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,160
ordered Eunuch Gao to kill Ling Yun.

88
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,560
I had nothing to do with it.

89
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,160
I was forced into this.

90
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,080
My lord.

91
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,840
Take them away.

92
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,840
Thirty lashes.

93
00:04:50,228 --> 00:04:52,467
Chief Wu. Please have mercy.

94
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,800
Thank you for saving me.

95
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,200
If you hadn't arrived in time,

96
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,840
I'd be dead in that well now.

97
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,720
Since you've already faced death,

98
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,840
learn from this experience.

99
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,464
My lord,

100
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,360
you're the only one here
who can oppose Consort Wan.

101
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,000
You and the Fourteen Bureaus
are my only hope.

102
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,040
It's a pity
that you dismissed me before.

103
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,600
Why is Consort Wan determined
to kill you?

104
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,280
Because

105
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,040
I discovered one of her secrets.

106
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,760
But even if I didn't know these things,

107
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,240
if she knew who I am,

108
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,080
she would still do everything
to eliminate me.

109
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,360
Who are you?

110
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,480
My Lord,

111
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,440
you didn't choose me that night.

112
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,320
Would you reconsider tonight?

113
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,080
Choosing a nearly crippled person
like you?

114
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,480
My Lord,

115
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,760
please grant me some wound medicine.

116
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,920
If this wound festers,

117
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,360
my hands will truly become useless.

118
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,520
Would you let that happen?

119
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,280
Stay squatting!

120
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,600
If I can't discipline her,

121
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,080
I can certainly discipline you.

122
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,160
If that bell makes any noise,

123
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,320
you'll be in trouble.

124
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,496
Are you alright?

125
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,040
Chief Wu's pouch is missing.

126
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,600
He asked me to search here.

127
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,320
You're always the greediest one.

128
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,280
You must have stolen it.

129
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,200
Did you see me steal it?

130
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,240
Why falsely accuse me?

131
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,200
That's an imperial gift.

132
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,280
If an imperial gift is missing here,

133
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,440
everyone will be punished.

134
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,920
Even if you didn't steal it,
you're still guilty.

135
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,624
Really?

136
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,280
A pouch gifted by His Majesty?

137
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,720
What are you doing?

138
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,840
I didn't steal it!

139
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,104
Here it is.

140
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,840
The pouch is here.
The evidence is solid.

141
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,000
You still deny stealing it?

142
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,000
I didn't steal it!

143
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,960
I swear I didn't!

144
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,360
With both witnesses and evidence,

145
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,480
how can you still argue?

146
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,560
Chief Wu spared you during the day,

147
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,360
yet you repay kindness with betrayal.

148
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,040
You're done for this time.

149
00:08:21,184 --> 00:08:22,120
Ling Yun,

150
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,440
I admit defeat.

151
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,560
I surrender.

152
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,280
Please spare me just once.

153
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,960
I wronged you before.

154
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,920
It was my fault.

155
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,360
I'll never dare to do so again.

156
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,560
Please spare me.

157
00:08:34,784 --> 00:08:35,720
Cui Wei,

158
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,000
we all came from similar backgrounds.

159
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,560
We entered the palace

160
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,040
as servants just to survive.

161
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,400
Don't tear others' umbrellas

162
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,000
just because you got wet.

163
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,080
That's not how the world works.

164
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,360
This will be my last warning.

165
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,240
From now on,

166
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,560
if you bully Ru Yi again,

167
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,680
I'll tell Chief Wu
that you stole his pouch,

168
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,560
ensuring your death.

169
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,480
I wouldn't dare.

170
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,600
I'll never dare again.

171
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,440
I'll never harm Ru Yi again.

172
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,304
Your Highness,

173
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,680
the one from Chengxi Palace
has been quiet lately.

174
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,560
At the Spring Banquet,

175
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,480
Consort Wan's scheme backfired,

176
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,040
nearly burning herself.

177
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,080
Naturally, she's lying low recently.

178
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,040
Your Highness, you mean

179
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,760
the blade in the dance shoes
was Consort Wan's doing?

180
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,040
It was that maid named Ling Yun?

181
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,920
Not her, either.

182
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,360
The blade was Concubine Zhao's doing,

183
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,960
yet also Consort Wan's.

184
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,920
Well, I don't understand.

185
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,160
Consort Wan planned meticulously.

186
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,600
She knew Concubine Zhao too well.

187
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,280
She knew Concubine Zhao would go
as far as to wound herself to win favor.

188
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,560
So she used the dance shoe plot,

189
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,480
to achieve two goals,

190
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,280
crippling Concubine Zhao's foot

191
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,560
and framing the maid.

192
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,840
The Zhao sisters only seek favor,

193
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,840
foolishly thinking
His Majesty is stupid.

194
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,120
His Majesty just wanted
to preserve harmony.

195
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,200
Speaking of which,

196
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,320
Consort Wan's maid is impressive.

197
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,080
She discerned His Majesty's intent,

198
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,240
resolved the crisis with a few words,

199
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,280
and saved herself.

200
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,960
Truly clever.

201
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,680
But she's in the Servitude Bureau now.

202
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,800
I guess she's got no hope.

203
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,880
For some people,

204
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,840
the tougher the challenge,
the stronger their spirit becomes.

205
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,960
A mere Servitude Bureau
could never contain her.

206
00:10:57,428 --> 00:10:58,560
(Fourteen Bureaus)

207
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,480
Master, here's the wound medicine
you requested.

208
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,600
Only through enduring hardships

209
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,160
will she learn to restrain herself.

210
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,920
Greetings, Chief Wu.

211
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,360
Mend these clothes,

212
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,960
and I'll give you wound medicine.

213
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,800
You give me wound medicine,

214
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,480
and I mend your clothes.

215
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,240
It is fair enough.

216
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,040
There's an embroidery workshop.

217
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,640
Why not take it there instead, my lord?

218
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,920
Their skills far surpass mine.

219
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,592
Done.

220
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,336
Here you are.

221
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,560
Only one bottle?

222
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,480
It's barely enough for one person.

223
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,720
Ru Yi is also injured.

224
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,520
Look how well I mended this, my lord.

225
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,440
Shouldn't this be worth two bottles?

226
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,480
Demanding more for yourself
is understandable,

227
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,440
but pushing your luck for others

228
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,840
is utter foolishness.

229
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,760
True affection is rare in the palace.

230
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,680
Focus on your own survival.

231
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,608
My lord,

232
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,280
could you get Ru Yi out
of the Servitude Bureau?

233
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,560
If you can't,

234
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,640
I'll have to parade your pouch around,

235
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,080
telling everyone
we've traded secret gifts

236
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,400
and formed factions.

237
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,040
Let's see how you explain that then.

238
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,328
You rogue!

239
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,480
Why do you think I will agree to this?

240
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:27,080
A mere pouch is enough to threaten me?

241
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,000
If you don't agree,

242
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,680
I'll have to ruin your reputation.

243
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,080
I have no reputation to protect.

244
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,600
Someone!

245
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,360
Chief Wu is harassing me!
