=The Ascent of Ling Yun=

2
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:13,312
=Episode 19=

3
00:00:13,427 --> 00:00:15,840
(A True Devil Resides
within the Imperial Harem!)

4
00:00:15,988 --> 00:00:18,784
(Yongxiu Palace)

5
00:00:20,704 --> 00:00:21,800
Your Ladyship.

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,840
We found the maid

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,968
you've been looking for.

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,000
Is it Ling Zhu?

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,200
Yes.

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,640
You've predicted it perfectly.

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,560
Today is the bathing day
for maids at the bathhouse.

12
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,320
Ling Zhu indeed appeared.

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,720
How did you know Ling Zhu
would go to the bathhouse today?

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,440
Since Consort Wan claimed Ling Zhu,

15
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,560
she has never left Chengxi Palace.

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,752
There's no news at all.

17
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,800
But Consort Wan is a tidy person.

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,920
She'd never tolerate odors
on her personal maids.

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,560
She'll eventually
permit Ling Zhu to bathe.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,032
And this

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,680
is the opportunity I awaited.

22
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,720
Greetings,

23
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,880
Your Ladyship.

24
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,400
You still remember me?

25
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,720
Yes, I do.

26
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,160
I once judged others
with blind arrogance

27
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,680
and offended you
at the Fragrance Bureau.

28
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,600
I beg your forgiveness.

29
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,440
Get up.

30
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,592
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

31
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,160
I heard

32
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,520
you were sent to Chengxi Palace.

33
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,576
How have you been?

34
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,440
I'm fine.

35
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,640
Thank you for your concern.

36
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,280
Having been in Chengxi Palace myself,

37
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,960
I know precisely

38
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,480
how you have been.

39
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,360
Her Highness

40
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,520
treats me tolerably.

41
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,840
Do you remember Cui Wei?

42
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,040
When she was in the Servitude Bureau,

43
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,440
she always claimed to serve Consort Wan

44
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,720
loyally.

45
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,280
But when Consort Wan ordered her death,

46
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,000
she never spared a thought

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,400
for your loyal service

48
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,080
to her.

49
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,760
It's not easy for you
to leave Chengxi Palace.

50
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,880
Whether you get to see me again

51
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,000
depends on your fortune.

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,976
I...

53
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,160
Both you and Cui Wei
knew Consort Wan's secrets.

54
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,160
She eliminates all who know them.

55
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,016
Ling Zhu.

56
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,160
You should know

57
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,080
I'm not your enemy.

58
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,400
If you want to live,

59
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,768
just tell me

60
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,760
back in the Fragrance Bureau,

61
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:40,096
what did you and Cui Wei

62
00:02:40,096 --> 00:02:41,720
do for Consort Wan?

63
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,560
Your Ladyship, please help me.

64
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,160
If only I could

65
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,880
escape the terrible Chengxi Palace,

66
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,560
I'd tell you everything.

67
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,160
Consort Wan...

68
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,360
Consort Wan has gone mad.

69
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,344
Lord Wu.

70
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,360
What's this?

71
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,480
It's from Consort Wan's palace.

72
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,600
You can have
an imperial physician verify

73
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,312
what this is.

74
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,120
If you have nothing else to command,

75
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,200
I shall attend His Majesty's affairs.

76
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,616
I'll take my leave.

77
00:03:17,472 --> 00:03:18,202
My lord,

78
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,840
I once made use of you.

79
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,720
I owe you deeply.

80
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,800
But what happened today is serious.

81
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,880
I act not for myself alone,

82
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,920
but for innocent palace dwellers.

83
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,704
I believe

84
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,320
after investigating,

85
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,160
you won't just stand by.

86
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,568
What do you mean?

87
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,680
When you confirm

88
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,360
what's in this bottle,

89
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,168
you'll believe

90
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,760
a true devil

91
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,960
resides within the imperial harem.

92
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,712
Greetings, Your Majesty.

93
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,344
What is it?

94
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,808
Your Majesty,

95
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,680
Consort Wan has been unwell lately.

96
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,424
Alone in her palace,

97
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,544
with no one to visit,

98
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,160
she looks quite forlorn.

99
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,040
Consort Wan...

100
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,520
It's been too long since I saw her.

101
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,960
I wonder how her reflection is.

102
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,080
I'll go to Yongxiu Palace.

103
00:04:32,243 --> 00:04:33,216
Yes.

104
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,120
Procession to Yongxiu Palace.

105
00:04:37,363 --> 00:04:38,816
(Yongxiu Palace)

106
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,055
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

107
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,160
What's the matter?

108
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,608
Your Ladyship,

109
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,000
His Majesty is on his way here.

110
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,120
Please get prepared.

111
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,520
His Majesty didn't go to Chengxi Palace?

112
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,080
He was originally headed there,

113
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,400
but he changed his mind.

114
00:04:52,544 --> 00:04:53,400
My master sent me

115
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,496
to inform you in advance.

116
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,224
Thank you.

117
00:05:09,728 --> 00:05:10,528
Why are you crying?

118
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,320
Your blood

119
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,360
will be the primer
for Her Highness's rebirth,

120
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,360
restoring her beauty.

121
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,360
Consider it an honor.

122
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,040
Stop crying.

123
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,992
Such bad luck.

124
00:05:21,984 --> 00:05:23,000
Your Highness,

125
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,480
I came from humble origins.

126
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,440
My blood is filthy and worthless.

127
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,560
Your Highness, please spare me.

128
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,784
Ling Zhu,

129
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,240
you were personally selected
by Sun Meizi

130
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,760
at the Fragrance Bureau.

131
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,200
She spent years searching there

132
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,040
and only found a few like you

133
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,160
who share my exact birth chart.

134
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,360
How rare this is.

135
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,760
Each of you is my treasure.

136
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,160
If you obediently
donate your blood to me,

137
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,280
I'll ensure you're well rewarded.

138
00:05:51,616 --> 00:05:52,560
Your Highness,

139
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,560
at the Fragrance Bureau,

140
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,600
Madam Sun prepared Asuji Pills for you,

141
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,240
using our maiden blood as the primer.

142
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,240
But now that Madam Sun is gone,

143
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,000
no one can make the Asuji Pills.

144
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,960
Even if you demand more,

145
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,160
our blood is useless now, Your Highness.

146
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,120
Please spare me.

147
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,040
Shut up!

148
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,800
How could Asuji Pills

149
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,760
compare to this secret
beauty-restoration art.

150
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,760
I'm on the verge of success.

151
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,800
After tonight,

152
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,560
I'll regain my former peerless beauty.

153
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,840
Considering your diligent service,

154
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,880
I'll overlook your impertinence.

155
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,160
But if you dare defy me again,

156
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,160
you'll end up like Cui Wei.

157
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,664
Hand.

158
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,336
Don't cry!

159
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,288
Go.

160
00:07:21,152 --> 00:07:23,160
(Yongxiu Palace)
His Majesty has arrived.

161
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,480
May Your Majesty be ever blessed
and in peace.

162
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,008
Where is Noble Lady Yun?

163
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,680
She went to Chengxi Palace.

164
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,600
Why did she go there?

165
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,576
Your Majesty,

166
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,400
before leaving,
Her Ladyship instructed me

167
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,240
that if you came to Yongxiu Palace,

168
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,520
I shall tell you

169
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,440
she went to visit the ailing Consort Wan
in Chengxi Palace.

170
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,960
Her Ladyship said

171
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,200
although she and Consort Wan
are estranged at heart,

172
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,960
she should follow palace rules.

173
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,960
As a lower-ranking Noble Lady,

174
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,840
she should serve the ailing Consort Wan.

175
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,672
Go to Chengxi Palace.

176
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,800
You think damaging my face

177
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,480
will prevent my return to favor?

178
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,576
Today,

179
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,360
I'll use the forbidden art
of the entertainer

180
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,880
to offer blood to the Joy Deity,

181
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,560
and show my restored beauty

182
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,480
to all of you.

183
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,920
Your Highness,

184
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,480
the Yin hour approaches.

185
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,960
There's only one chance
every three years for blood rebirth.

186
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,760
Finding these individuals
sharing your birth chart

187
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,240
is extremely difficult.

188
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,440
I will guard outside

189
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,760
to ensure no one
disrupts your grand endeavor.

190
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,840
His Majesty has arrived.

191
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,192
What should I do?

192
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,920
May Your Majesty be ever blessed
and in peace.

193
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,032
Rise.

194
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,880
I heard you are unwell,

195
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,160
so I came to see you.

196
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,240
Thank you for your concern.

197
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,720
I'm fine.

198
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,536
Your Majesty,

199
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,320
I've been reflecting
on my past actions recently.

200
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,360
Henceforth, I'll be cautious

201
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,200
and won't let you down.

202
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,120
I'll see your future behavior.

203
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,920
Your Majesty,

204
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,720
I've been feeling unwell lately.

205
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,600
The chamber air is stale.

206
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,360
Your health is paramount.

207
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,960
Don't risk harming it
with this foul air.

208
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,480
Consort Wan is right.

209
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,320
Your health is paramount.

210
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,880
You'd better not go inside.

211
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,672
Tong An.

212
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,880
Ask someone to bring a chair
for His Majesty now.

213
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,456
Let His Majesty and Consort Wan
enjoy the moonlight here

214
00:09:55,456 --> 00:09:56,352
and talk for a while.

215
00:09:56,352 --> 00:09:57,216
Yes.

216
00:09:59,392 --> 00:10:00,288
- Summon the physicians.
- Yes.

217
00:10:00,288 --> 00:10:01,248
There's no need.

218
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,480
They check my pulse daily.

219
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,000
I

220
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,680
have merely been fatigued lately,

221
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,968
easily wearied.

222
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,560
More rest will suffice.

223
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,160
Then rest well.

224
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,992
Focus on recuperating.

225
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,560
Your Majesty,

226
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,120
please wait a moment.

227
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,000
I sent people to the Imperial Kitchen

228
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,200
for special red ginseng
and bird's nest soup

229
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,240
to replenish Consort Wan's vitality.

230
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,920
You have been overworked recently.

231
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,760
Please take a bowl as well.

232
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,096
Alright.

233
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,360
I happen to be hungry.

234
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
Tonight's moonlight

235
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,576
is rather splendid.

236
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,440
Let's stay in this courtyard

237
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,808
to admire the moon

238
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,440
and enjoy the soup.

239
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,160
Noble Lady Yun, you're so thoughtful.

240
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,760
I only do my duty.

241
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,120
It's late.

242
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,200
Moon-viewing with me for two hours,

243
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,752
you should rest early.

244
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,360
Your Highness, please take care.

245
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,600
Farewell, Your Majesty.

246
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,960
Return to Yongxiu Palace.

247
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,760
I'll take my leave.

248
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,752
Summon Wu Linfu.

249
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:52,760
Your Highness,

250
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,120
the appointed time has passed.

251
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,000
What should we do now?

252
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,960
That vile woman.

253
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,760
I'll kill her!

254
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,424
Useless!

255
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,568
Incompetent fools!

256
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,720
Incompetent fools!

257
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,200
Incompetent fools!

258
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,640
What use are any of you?

259
00:12:27,136 --> 00:12:28,160
Greetings,

260
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,216
Your Majesty.

261
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,336
Wu Linfu,

262
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
do you confess?

263
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,600
I willingly accept punishment.

264
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,160
Please make it clear.

265
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,880
Tonight,

266
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,200
you reminded me of my long absence
from Consort Wan first.

267
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,960
At the Yongxiu Palace,

268
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,208
before I entered the hall,

269
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,840
Noble Lady Yun diverted me

270
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:49,568
to see Consort Wan in Chengxi Palace.

271
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,120
Tell me.

272
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,560
Is it all coincidence?

273
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,624
I know I was wrong.

274
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,600
It was my negligence

275
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,560
for intervening in your affairs.

276
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,160
I beg for punishment.

277
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,640
The discord between them

278
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,920
is a matter between harem consorts.

279
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,320
Why do you

280
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,040
side with Noble Lady Yun?

281
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,024
I wouldn't dare.

282
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,560
I beg for punishment.

283
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,560
I heard palace rumors

284
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,620
that you are close to Noble Lady Yun.

285
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,920
I trust your conduct

286
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,200
will not make trouble.

287
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,120
With what I saw today,

288
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,640
can I still trust you?

289
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,720
I know I was wrong.
