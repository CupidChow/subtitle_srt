=Episode 27=

3
00:00:13,427 --> 00:00:15,744
(I've Come to Take Your Life
for Consort Wan)

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,664
(Yongxiu Palace)

5
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,120
You're insane.
Did Consort Jing send you?

6
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,940
I've come to take your life
for Consort Wan!

7
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,820
You're truly insane.

8
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,300
Every debt has its creditor.

9
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,060
This is what you deserve.

10
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,100
I'm still a court woman.

11
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,500
If I die,

12
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,500
you'll also be punished.

13
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,580
I don't care at all.

14
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,340
Right now,

15
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,700
you're nothing but prey.

16
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,460
I'll torment you to death slowly.

17
00:01:15,924 --> 00:01:17,920
(Chengxi Palace)

18
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,300
I'm here, Your Majesty.

19
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,460
Didn't you say you want to dine with me?

20
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,580
Your Majesty,

21
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,780
are you hungry?

22
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,060
Any suggestions, my love?

23
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,940
I've dismissed all the servants

24
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,060
from the palace.

25
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,060
Your Majesty, look at my chamber,

26
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,460
this bed,

27
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:45,860
and this space.

28
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,500
Is it spacious enough?

29
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,708
Eat.

30
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,620
This is leftover food, right?

31
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,668
Take it away.

32
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,460
Don't starve yourself
and get me into it.

33
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,940
What a jinx!

34
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,960
Say that again.

35
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,020
Jinx!

36
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,860
What can you do if I say it again?

37
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,100
How dare you hit me?

38
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,660
You...

39
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,652
Stop.

40
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,060
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

41
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,660
Ling Yun,

42
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,700
I was waiting for your comeback.

43
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,260
I never thought you can't
even handle a lowly servant.

44
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,300
How utterly boring.

45
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,660
Your Ladyship,

46
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,500
Ling Yun sure loves putting on airs.

47
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,260
Even under house arrest,

48
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,740
she still acts like a master.

49
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,900
She just said the food was awful
and smashed the bowl.

50
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,140
You lowly one daring to defy masters!

51
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,380
She once served His Majesty,

52
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,260
while you're just a lowly servant.

53
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,060
It's not your place to speak.

54
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,860
Kneel outside all night.

55
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,620
Madam Jiang was planted by Consort Jing.

56
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,780
I don't want you dead too soon.

57
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,300
Understood?

58
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,196
Don't worry.

59
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,700
I'll stay alive.

60
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,904
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

61
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,660
After all, you once served her.

62
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,060
Visit her at Yongxiu Palace sometimes

63
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,756
and bring her some food.

64
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,388
Yes.

65
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,460
Your Highness,
you've got the kindest heart.

66
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,580
Don't let her starve to death.

67
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,860
Her life

68
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,220
is still of use to me.

69
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,340
Forgive my boldness,

70
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,740
but without her rank,

71
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,144
of what use can she be?

72
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,900
Consort Jing hasn't fallen yet.

73
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,020
Everything is uncertain.

74
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,660
Shall we dispose

75
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,816
of Madam Jiang?

76
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:23,904
Keep her.

77
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,060
No need to make
Ling Yun's life comfortable.

78
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,384
Understood.

79
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,780
Only half a bowl of rice gruel daily.

80
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,500
Let me see how long you can last.

81
00:05:16,659 --> 00:05:18,912
(Chengxi Palace)

82
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,820
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

83
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,020
May I ask

84
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,264
why you summoned me?

85
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,640
Hmm.

86
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,380
In your opinion,

87
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,460
given the current palace situation,

88
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,260
can Ling Yun still survive?

89
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,792
In this imperial harem,

90
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,380
only His Majesty decides life or death.

91
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,860
As you said,

92
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,300
Ling Yun is still His Majesty's woman.

93
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,820
Do you know

94
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,900
whether His Majesty
ignores her deliberately

95
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,060
to make her

96
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,020
give in to him and beg for mercy?

97
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,540
Your Ladyship,
why are you telling me this?

98
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,860
Ling Yun holds no power now.

99
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,620
She poses no threat to you.

100
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,104
True.

101
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,700
Even if she regains favor,

102
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,180
it'll be her last gasp.

103
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,380
She once used His Majesty's affection
to deal with Consort Wan.

104
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,500
His Majesty holds pride.

105
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,900
He'll never tolerate
impure affection from others.

106
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,820
You're perceptive.

107
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,100
My next target

108
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,540
will be the lofty Consort Jing.

109
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,456
Chief Wu,

110
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,940
should we collaborate?

111
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,580
You jest.

112
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,340
I serve His Majesty

113
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,860
and should attend to the ladies
of the harem and ease their troubles.

114
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,220
How could we collaborate?

115
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,500
Your recent actions

116
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,660
have spread unease
in the imperial harem.

117
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,140
Yet this was all for His Majesty?

118
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,140
If you have no further matters,

119
00:06:53,472 --> 00:06:54,540
I

120
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,460
will take my leave.

121
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,660
Jian.

122
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,940
Yes.

123
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,260
I heard Ling Yun has fallen ill,

124
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,700
only drinking rice gruel.

125
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,700
Fetch medicine
from the Medical Bureau for her.

126
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,140
Don't let her die.

127
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:18,048
Yes.

128
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:25,984
Your Highness,

129
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,940
there's report from Chengxi Palace.

130
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,260
As you predicted,

131
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,560
Noble Lady Mu

132
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,700
indeed sought to collaborate
with Chief Wu.

133
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,260
Did he agree?

134
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,104
He wouldn't dare.

135
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,740
Everything remains under your control.

136
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,700
One more matter, Your Highness.

137
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,860
It's said that Ling Yun

138
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,340
has been bedridden
from Madam Jiang's torment.

139
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,820
She's still alive?

140
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,020
Madam Jiang said

141
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,820
Ling Yun was nearly dead.

142
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,700
But someone

143
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,420
sent her medicine.

144
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,300
Whose else could it be?

145
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,460
Wu Linfu is still protecting her?

146
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,816
Your Highness,

147
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,860
I suspect Noble Lady Mu sent it.

148
00:08:08,992 --> 00:08:09,952
Right.

149
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,424
It was her.

150
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,340
It should be her.

151
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,100
Noble Lady Mu grows more favored.

152
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,300
Yesterday, she enjoyed music
and wine in the Imperial Garden.

153
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,980
And today, she stages operas
in the palace.

154
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,380
Such a born seductress.

155
00:08:28,768 --> 00:08:29,740
Now,

156
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,180
she meddles with Ling Yun's affairs.

157
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,660
Who does she think she is?

158
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,580
Does she mean to overturn
the order here?

159
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,460
She's arrogant from favor,

160
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,540
but she wouldn't dare disregard you.

161
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,740
Why would I care for her regard?

162
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,340
She can vie for favor,

163
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,300
but she'll never surpass me
to become the new empress.

164
00:08:51,648 --> 00:08:52,704
Yes.

165
00:08:52,704 --> 00:08:53,568
(Section Five: Seeing the Reality)
Yes.

166
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,300
I want her dead.

167
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,700
Greetings, Your Highness.

168
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,540
Please rise.

169
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,580
The weather has turned cold lately.

170
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,540
Why do you still dress so lightly?

171
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,300
You should wear more layers

172
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,480
and mind your health.

173
00:09:17,088 --> 00:09:18,048
Lv He.

174
00:09:18,048 --> 00:09:18,980
Yes.

175
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,580
Fetch some warm milk.

176
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,368
Yes.

177
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,180
Thank you for your concern. Might I ask

178
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,020
why you

179
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,460
summoned me?

180
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,100
How is the task

181
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,540
I assigned you?

182
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,224
Don't worry.

183
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,500
I've been diligent in my efforts.

184
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,488
Good.

185
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,840
Thank you.

186
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,340
Have you visited
the Medical Bureau recently?

187
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,980
Basking in your favor,

188
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,460
I enjoy perfect health.

189
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,780
I haven't been there.

190
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,580
Then why do I hear

191
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,660
Ling Yun got life-saving medicine
from the Medical Bureau?

192
00:10:16,192 --> 00:10:17,184
Medicine?

193
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,240
What medicine?

194
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,780
Why did she need medicine?

195
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,300
Wu Linfu,

196
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,380
did you provide her medicine?

197
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,504
Your Highness,

198
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,140
I didn't give her the medicine.

199
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,740
But Ling Yun mustn't die.

200
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,496
She

201
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,700
may still serve
as a useful pawn for you.

202
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,860
I act in your interest.

203
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,660
Whether Ling Yun becomes my pawn or not
is not my main concern.

204
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,580
What matters to me is your attitude.

205
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,620
You must be aware

206
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,020
you belong to me.

207
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,140
Since you belong to me,

208
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,340
you should adapt to circumstances

209
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,460
and only devote to me.

210
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,580
But if you dare betray me,

211
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,220
this will be Ling Yun's fate.
