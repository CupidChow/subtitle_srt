1
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,920
EIGHT YEARS AGO

2
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,440
- Where are you off to, sweetie?
- Help!

3
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,160
Help!

4
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,960
Hey!

5
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,840
- Come on.
- What's the rush?

6
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,640
Help me!

7
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,800
Let go!

8
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,240
- No, please. No…
- Come with me.

9
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,320
Please, just let me go…

10
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,120
What the…

11
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,680
Don't you dare mess with girls again.

12
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,840
- Go away!
- We're leaving!

13
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,280
Let's go!

14
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,560
Go!

15
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,880
Can you get up?

16
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,760
Are you hurt?

17
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,480
How are you getting home?

18
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,080
My driver should be nearby.

19
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,720
But my phone's dead.

20
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,280
Come on.

21
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,920
I'll walk you to your car.

22
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,840
Wear this.

23
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,120
Your shirt's too thin.

24
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,000
Oh, that's my car!

25
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,840
Well…

26
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,600
Thank you so much for helping me today.

27
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,160
I'm Ayla. What's your name?

28
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,640
Thank you.

29
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,000
Mr. Jacket.

30
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,320
Why is your owner so cool?

31
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,000
She took on three guys
like it was nothing.

32
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,440
Whack! Whack! Whack! Just like that!

33
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,440
So gorgeous. So tough. So cool.

34
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,360
Only flaw?

35
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,160
She wouldn't even tell me her name.

36
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,440
How am I supposed to return this?

37
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,480
I'll probably never see her again.

38
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,640
Stay with me, okay?

39
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,680
I'm talking to the jacket?

40
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,400
Hi, new girl! What's your name?

41
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,720
I'm Ayla.

42
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,360
Full name?

43
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,160
Sasina.

44
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,280
And your last name?

45
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,320
Ruengkunakorn.

46
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,280
Nice to meet you, new friend!
I'm Khaotu, Suthasinee Sawangkamol.

47
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,280
I've been here since grade seven.

48
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,480
Great to meet you, Ayla Sasina.

49
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,200
- Nice to--
- If you need help with anything, just ask.

50
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,440
Because

51
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,280
I know everyone and everything
in this school.

52
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,000
And if you're worried about grades,
don't be.

53
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,120
Because…

54
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,840
I get straight A's in every subject.

55
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,880
That's impressive.

56
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,000
Want to hang out in class first, or--

57
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,760
Oh!

58
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,000
Khaotu?

59
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,400
PLEASE CLOSE THE DOOR

60
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,000
- Lucky we made it in time.
- What are they competing in?

61
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,680
<i>Hajime!</i>

62
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,560
It's called Kendo.

63
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,680
Pretty simple.
Whoever lands a hit scores a point.

64
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,600
Amazing!

65
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,640
- She's so cool!
- Right?

66
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,720
<i>Dome!</i>

67
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,360
<i>Kawaré!</i>

68
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,160
Sit down!

69
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,800
That girl…

70
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,680
Her name's Tawan. She's in Grade 12.

71
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,840
Top student, student council president,

72
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,240
and the school's best kendo athlete.

73
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,760
She's been champion three years in a row.

74
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,960
Top of the class, star athlete…

75
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,880
She's basically good at everything.

76
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,760
And she's gorgeous too.

77
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,440
No, cool. That's what you call cool.

78
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,240
Anyway, what club
are you thinking of joining, Ayla?

79
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,880
KENDO CLUB SIGN-UP

80
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,280
Are you sure about this?

81
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,560
Of course. I want to join the Kendo club.

82
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,880
Just so you know…

83
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,880
Training's pretty intense.

84
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,800
I'm not sure you can handle it.

85
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,040
I definitely can.

86
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,960
I'm ready for it. I'm totally fired up.

87
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,280
<i>All right. Let's run a little test first.</i>

88
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,840
Everyone ready?

89
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,320
Ready!

90
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,400
That weak-looking one?
No way she's gonna make it.

91
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,680
Look at her. She's about to pass out.

92
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,440
If she wants to join, let her.

93
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,520
Yeah, true.

94
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,320
Then who's gonna train her?

95
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,840
I will.

96
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,880
You said it.

97
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,120
You're training her, then. Deal?

98
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,040
Deal.

99
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,040
All right.

100
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,720
Kid, you don't need to run anymore.

101
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,240
You're in. Great effort.

102
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,360
See you at practice tomorrow.

103
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,480
Get up and drink some water.

104
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,880
Tawan!

105
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,160
I feel dizzy…

106
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,920
You okay?

107
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,520
Thank you, Tawan.

108
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,840
Do you remember me?

109
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,240
Well, you know my name now.

110
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,160
Just know,
this club's no walk in the park.

111
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,000
Got it.

112
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,800
I'll give it everything I've got.

113
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,400
Thanks for letting me join.

114
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,880
Go on.

115
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,920
Head home.

116
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,960
See you at practice tomorrow,

117
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,360
Ayla.

118
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,920
Bye, Tawan!

119
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,600
She knows my name!

120
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,360
She knows my name!

121
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,960
Before we begin training,

122
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,960
I'm going to demonstrate
a few Kendo basics.

123
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,200
<i>Kikaeshi, hajime!</i>

124
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,320
<i>Men, hajime!</i>

125
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,640
<i>Kote, hajime!</i>

126
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,800
<i>Do, hajime!</i>

127
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,760
<i>Tokyo!</i>

128
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,680
Now, we're starting with the basics.

129
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,080
Ready?

130
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,520
Ready!

131
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,960
<i>Kendo, the way of the sword,</i>

132
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,680
<i>is rooted in samurai swordsmanship.</i>

133
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,720
Training involves

134
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,880
fast, forceful, decisive moves,

135
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,560
so it demands intense focus.

136
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,320
Here.

137
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,280
Hurry up! Run!

138
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,240
Hey! I want one too!

139
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,560
Fine, take it.

140
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,680
I want one too!

141
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,680
HELLO

142
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,080
Tawan accepted mine.

143
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,000
She did! She did!

144
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,920
She accepted my gift.

145
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,240
It's really pouring out there.

146
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,920
Tawan!

147
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,800
You're still here?

148
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,240
I happened to forget my umbrella.

149
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,120
I forgot mine too.

150
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,000
Then… want to make something
to stop the rain?

151
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,560
Something to stop the rain? Like what?

152
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,000
A <i>teru teru bōzu</i>.

153
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,960
A <i>teru teru bōzu</i>?

154
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,840
Look.

155
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,800
Oh!

156
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,440
You drew the sun. That's so cool.

157
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,480
Tawan means "sun".

158
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,520
You drew a moon?

159
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,840
Yes.

160
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,520
Why a moon?

161
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,080
Because Ayla means "moon".

162
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,640
The sun and the moon.

163
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,840
Tawan and Ayla.

164
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,800
The rain stopped!

165
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,280
It actually worked!

166
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,880
Thank you, Mr. Teru Teru Bōzu.

167
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,080
Tawan.

168
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,360
It's all right. Thank you.

169
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,800
I'll take that.

170
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,840
Tawan.

171
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,160
Think you're special, huh, new girl?

172
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,000
Just 'cause Tawan took your drink,

173
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,880
you think
you're better than the rest of us?

174
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,040
Acting all high and mighty.

175
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,320
You want a drink? Fine.

176
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,200
Here. Not just a glass.

177
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,120
Have a whole bucket!

178
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,080
No… No!

179
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,600
Tawan!

180
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,480
Tawan!

181
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,040
Was that really necessary?

182
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,560
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to splash you.

183
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,920
It was meant for that new girl.

184
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,960
She just got here and now
she's all over you? How's that fair?

185
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,960
So, I'm the reason this happened?

186
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,560
I really don't like this kind of behavior.

187
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,840
Bullying someone is never okay.

188
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,080
You shouldn't treat anyone like this.

189
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,680
Ever.

190
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,080
I'm honestly disappointed in myself

191
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,320
for not being a better example to you all.

192
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,560
No, Tawan.

193
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,200
It's not your fault.
You're amazing, always have been.

194
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,840
We're the ones in the wrong.

195
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:09,000
We're really sorry. We mean it.

196
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,800
Then, let's end it here. I'm asking you.

197
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,200
Sure.

198
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,440
If you ask, I'll do it.

199
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,440
Let's call it even.

200
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,520
Huh?

201
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,200
Even? Just like that?

202
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,320
Yeah.

203
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,080
Tawan asked, so that's that.

204
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,080
Are you okay?

205
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,640
Thank you, Tawan,

206
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,760
for helping me.

207
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,040
You always protect me.

208
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,000
You're like my personal bodyguard.

209
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,080
Bodyguard?

210
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,000
Mhm.

211
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,880
I'm expensive, you know.

212
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,720
Think you can afford me?

213
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,960
Can I ask you something?

214
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,400
Sure.

215
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,760
You like dancing, don't you?

216
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,960
I do. I love dancing.

217
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,840
How'd you know?

218
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,760
I saw you

219
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,360
when you were cleaning the clubroom floor.

220
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,240
You were basically dancing the dirt away.

221
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,280
What?

222
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,080
Tawan accepted my gift.

223
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,600
You saw all of that?

224
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,520
Every second.

225
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,360
Even this part.

226
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,920
I want to cry.

227
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,640
You really saw everything?

228
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,920
Our school has a strong dance club,
you know.

229
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,520
I think you should audition.

230
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,600
Kendo might be a bit too intense for you.

231
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,680
No, I like Kendo.

232
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,320
I like it.

233
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,080
I really do.

234
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,640
You like Kendo

235
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,600
more than dancing?

236
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,960
Not sure

237
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,320
I believe that.

238
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,480
Why not?

239
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,800
Do I look that hopeless?

240
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,120
Not hopeless.

241
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,480
You're not giving me much hope here.

242
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,200
Trust me.

243
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,760
Do what your heart really wants.

244
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,720
It'll be worth it.

245
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,960
But…

246
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,880
if I leave the Kendo club,

247
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,280
I won't get to talk to you
like this every day.

248
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,280
Sure you will.

249
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,720
If you see me, just come say hi.

250
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,480
Or…

251
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,240
I'll still be training here.

252
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,520
You can drop by anytime you want.

253
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,240
Promise?

254
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,840
Yeah.

255
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,160
Promise.

256
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,480
- I've got something for you.
- Huh?

257
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,560
What is it?

258
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,760
AUDITIONS: SCHOOL DANCE TEAM
REPRESENTATIVE FOR ANNUAL COMPETITION

259
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,400
You want me to audition
for a dance competition?

260
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,800
Yep.

261
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,800
I want you to try out.

262
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,360
Think of it
as a way to challenge yourself.

263
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,880
Do you think I'm good enough?

264
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,040
There are already
so many amazing dancers in the club.

265
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,360
Come on.

266
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,280
Just give it a shot.

267
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,600
No harm in trying.

268
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,400
Think of it as gaining experience.

269
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,600
Okay then.

270
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,840
I'll do it.

271
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,680
But if I compete, will you come watch me?

272
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,000
I'll try to make it.

273
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,800
Promise?

274
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,120
Promise.

275
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,640
You better not break it.

276
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,320
Sure.

277
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,800
DANCE AND PERFORMANCE CLUB

278
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,920
Super pinky promise!

279
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,800
Super pinky promise.

280
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,159
Ayla.

281
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,360
Tawan!

282
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,920
I thought you weren't going
to come watch me!

283
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,639
I'm sorry I'm late.

284
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,400
I had something to take care of.

285
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,679
It's okay. Just the fact that you're here
already makes me so happy.

286
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,560
Now I've got all the motivation I need!

287
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,320
I made a promise, didn't I?

288
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,960
What happened to your lip?

289
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,120
Just a little accident.

290
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,120
Nothing serious.

291
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,200
Hang on. I've got ointment with me.

292
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,680
You carry stuff like this all the time?

293
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:31,280
Yup. I'm super clumsy,
so I always keep some on me.

294
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,560
Here, let me put some on for you.

295
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,280
So it doesn't scar.

296
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,360
Done!

297
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,960
Take it with you and reapply later,

298
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,640
so it heals up nice and smooth, okay?

299
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,840
Hello, Khaotu?

300
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,520
Yeah, yeah.

301
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,640
I'm heading in now.

302
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,800
Okay.

303
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,120
I've gotta go get ready now.

304
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,800
Watch me, okay?

305
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:25,920
Ayla.

306
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,120
For you.

307
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,720
A school badge?

308
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,200
But you haven't even graduated yet.

309
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,560
Think of it as a lucky charm.

310
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,360
Thank you!

311
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,160
Ayla! Ayla! Ayla!

312
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,720
Ayla! Ayla! Ayla!

313
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,920
THAILAND PASSPORT

314
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,320
<i>There's something I want to tell you.</i>

315
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,800
<i>Thank you for always helping me,</i>
<i>looking out for me.</i>

316
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,160
<i>Those snacks in your locker…</i>

317
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,040
<i>That was just</i>
<i>my little way of saying thanks.</i>

318
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,920
<i>I'm really glad</i>
<i>I got to be at the same school as you.</i>

319
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,440
<i>Got to be close to you.</i>

320
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,720
<i>And finally,</i>

321
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,160
<i>I love you, Tawan.</i>

322
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,240
<i>I hope…</i>

323
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,480
<i>you feel the same.</i>

324
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,320
What are you doing falling asleep here?

325
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,320
I was waiting for Tawan.

326
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,680
Do you know where she is?

327
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,760
She didn't tell you?

328
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,880
Tell me what?

329
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,760
She's transferred schools.

330
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,560
Transferred?

331
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,880
Where did she go?

332
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,440
Do you have her address?

333
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,560
Can I help you with something?

334
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,160
I'm looking for Tawan.

335
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,840
Is this her house?

336
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,520
Ms. Tawan doesn't live here anymore.

337
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,600
So,

338
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,760
do you happen to have her phone number?

339
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,560
I'm afraid I don't. I'm really sorry.

340
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,920
Now that you're alone,

341
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,320
the rain just won't stop, huh?

342
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,640
Let's go back together, alright?

343
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,320
<i>Ayla, can you promise me something?</i>

344
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,680
From this day on, no matter what happens,

345
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,240
don't ever forget who you are.

346
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,440
Study hard.

347
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,920
Keep chasing your dreams.

348
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,560
I believe your determination

349
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,400
will lead you to something beautiful.

350
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,720
Stay strong.

351
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,800
I'll always be rooting for you.

352
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:33,560
<i>I promised you I'd give it my all.</i>

353
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,680
<i>That I'd chase my dreams, no matter what.</i>

354
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,160
<i>One day, the spotlight will shine on me.</i>

355
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,040
<i>And when that day comes,</i>

356
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:47,480
<i>when the whole world is watching,</i>

357
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:54,640
<i>you'll see me again.</i>

358
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,680
<i>And I'm going to get you back, Tawan.</i>

359
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,440
Not good enough!

360
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,680
Go train again.

361
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,480
<i>I no longer trust your agency.</i>

362
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,480
I'll find a personal bodyguard
for my daughter myself.

363
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,520
From what I've heard,

364
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,440
none of our bodyguards
meet your VIP's criteria

365
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,120
<i>I don't think we'll be needing</i>
<i>a new agency after all, Dad.</i>

366
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,080
Pleasure working with you,

367
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,240
Ms. Bodyguard.

368
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,040
<i>We also have some additional rules.</i>

369
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,840
You must stay within visual range

370
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,280
of your bodyguard at all times.

371
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,760
<i>And what exactly is "visual range"?</i>

372
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,280
Can you see me now?
