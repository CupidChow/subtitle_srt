1
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,840
I think you have to make a choice.

2
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,360
Do you want to protect her
as a bodyguard protecting a VIP

3
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,520
or as someone
protecting the love of her life?

4
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,400
Stop!

5
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,840
This is all your fault, Ayla.

6
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,480
You ruined everything for me!

7
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,600
Will you ever see me as anything else?

8
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,080
Not through a bodyguard's eyes,
something other than a VIP client.

9
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,640
I'm not exactly the best choice.

10
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,640
Take care of Ms. Ayla for me.

11
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,480
- Yes, Boss.
- Got it, Boss.

12
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,000
Has Tawan been really busy lately?

13
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,680
Not really. Why do you ask?

14
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,200
It's just…

15
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,920
She's acting so strange lately.

16
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,080
Like she has something on her mind.

17
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,600
Honestly, what Boss is doing
isn't strange at all.

18
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,840
It is!

19
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,400
Do you know she hasn't said
a single word to me all day today?

20
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,200
And she's been standing like a whole
meter away. She's never done that before.

21
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,920
And lately, she keeps making
this dead-serious face,

22
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,120
like some scary elite bodyguard.

23
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,840
Bodyguards have rules
they have to follow, just like VIPs do.

24
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,960
Keeping a distance between a VIP
and their bodyguard is really important.

25
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,000
Boss probably decided

26
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,920
this is the best way to keep you safe.

27
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,240
Let me help.

28
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,240
It's fine.

29
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,440
How is it fine--

30
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,920
I'm not hungry yet. You eat first.

31
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,880
Why not?

32
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,640
But I ordered exactly
what Chanya and Nana suggested.

33
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,520
Look.

34
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,560
TAWAN'S FAVORITE DISHES

35
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,560
NOODLE SOUP, SPAGHETTI…

36
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,280
You're the VIP here.

37
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,240
I'm here to take care of you,

38
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,000
not the other way around.

39
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,920
That's a VIP thing. But here I am…

40
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,640
Ayla, your little sister.
I can take care of you too, can't I?

41
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,840
Please, let me look after you like this.

42
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,480
Come on. Just have a bite.

43
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,000
Will you ever see me as anything else?

44
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,520
Not through a bodyguard's eyes,

45
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,440
something other than a VIP client.

46
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,760
Would it be okay if I wanted
to stand by your side like this forever?

47
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,520
- Jam.
- Yes, ma'am.

48
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,480
Hi, everyone!
Today, I'll show you how to make

49
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,880
my super spicy stir-fried instant noodles
with basil, Ayla's special recipe!

50
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,000
First, boil some water

51
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,560
until it's bubbling.

52
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,480
Then toss in the noodles.

53
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,720
I'll use two packets today.
Little girls like us don't eat too much!

54
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,600
Once the noodles are cooked,
let's move on to the stir-fry!

55
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,600
When the oil is hot,

56
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,840
add chili and garlic.

57
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,280
Stir until the garlic turns golden

58
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,400
and fragrant.

59
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,120
Then add minced pork.

60
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,000
Cook it through.

61
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,320
When the pork's done, add the noodles.

62
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,560
Finally,

63
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,480
toss in the holy basil leaves.

64
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,840
Once they're in for a bit,
you can turn off the heat.

65
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,920
Then plate everything up!

66
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,240
Done! Bye-bye!

67
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,720
Thank you!

68
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,520
Sure! Thank you so much!

69
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
That was great.

70
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,920
Thank you so much!

71
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,240
Was that okay?

72
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,800
Good! I really liked it.

73
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,400
Ayla, we're taking a break now.

74
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,360
You can go grab some lunch.

75
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,880
You all go ahead. I'm still full.

76
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,080
Okay, okay.

77
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,360
Ms. Ayla, here's some water.

78
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,000
Thank you.

79
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,240
Nana,

80
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,120
you all go eat first.

81
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm full from filming.

82
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,920
I'd like to be alone for a bit.

83
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,640
Okay.

84
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,200
Everyone, take a break.
I'll stay with Ms. Ayla.

85
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,800
Yes, Boss.

86
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,640
Hey, you think they're gonna fight?

87
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,920
A bodyguard can't fight a VIP.
What are you saying?

88
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,920
I meant the VIP!

89
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,040
Did you see her face?
She looked so mad at Boss.

90
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,440
If she dares fight an S-class
like Boss, be my guest!

91
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,600
No…

92
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,560
- What now?
- Boss might even let her win.

93
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,800
- Our boss? Come on.
- Can we go now?

94
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,920
- Go where?
- Take a break, duh. Let's go!

95
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,640
Ayla!

96
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,640
- Ayla!
- Pete!

97
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,160
I missed you.

98
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,960
I missed you too! How'd you get here?

99
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,080
I live nearby.

100
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,960
And someone told me you were filming here,

101
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,040
so, of course, I came to see you.

102
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,320
Wait. Don't you have work today?
How did you sneak away?

103
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,280
I do, but it's in the evening.
So, I dropped by first.

104
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,360
Have you met Jay yet?

105
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,480
Jay? Oh, not yet.

106
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,280
- I'll take you to meet him.
- Let's go then.

107
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,240
They were just talking about you
yesterday, you know.

108
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,680
- Gossiping?
- Not gossiping…

109
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,360
- Talking about what?
- Just random stuff. Work, money…

110
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,360
It's been so long…

111
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,640
Jay! Kik!

112
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,520
Jay, hi! Kik, Hi!

113
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,800
It's been forever.

114
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,760
- How are you?
- Doing well.

115
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,320
Instead of me getting to hug…

116
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,680
Well, well…

117
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,160
That's Pete Pawit.

118
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,680
One of the top singers in Thailand.

119
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,640
Same label as Ms. Ayla.

120
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,160
They even featured together
in a song two years ago.

121
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,440
They met when they were trainees.

122
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,280
Who asked?

123
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,960
In case you wanted to know.

124
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,080
Handsome, rich, no scandals.

125
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,480
Fans keep shipping him with everyone.

126
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,520
Even with Ms. Ayla, you know.

127
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,920
Most importantly, he's single.

128
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,000
In case you wanted more info.

129
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,040
I… don't have any info.

130
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,840
Hey, when are you two gonna start dating?

131
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,440
Look at that chemistry!

132
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,560
Yeah! Just go for it!

133
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,520
Well…

134
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,760
If you two start dating,
I'll even become a monk!

135
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,960
What? What dating?

136
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:26,880
Look!

137
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,400
Look at them!

138
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,120
Pete? Oh, there you go again!

139
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,400
You always mess with me like this,
making me curious and then not telling me!

140
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,120
Why?

141
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,040
No, I'm not letting this slide.

142
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,360
Send it to me right now!

143
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,520
You better know, the one you're looking at

144
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,240
Won't just fall for your magic like that

145
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,840
You better know, I'm a superstar

146
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,880
If you wanna try
You'll have to wait in line

147
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,560
It's not that I'm stuck-up
I'm just not that easygoing

148
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,520
Nana!

149
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,200
One, two, three, four.

150
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,880
I'm going to step outside for some air.

151
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,920
Look after Ms. Ayla.

152
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,599
Yes, Boss.

153
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,920
When are you two gonna start dating?

154
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,920
Look at that chemistry!

155
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,160
What dating?

156
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,480
Pete!

157
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,640
Can't sleep…

158
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,800
And what would you like me
to do about that?

159
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,040
Can you talk to me for a bit?

160
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,880
Maybe if we keep talking,
I'll start to feel sleepy.

161
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,560
Oh, there you go again!
You always mess with me like this,

162
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,680
making me curious and then not telling me.

163
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,280
Send it to me right now!

164
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,800
Where's Ayla?

165
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:15,320
Ms. Ayla asked
to speak privately with Mr. Pete.

166
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,720
We've checked the room already.
Only one way in and out.

167
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,400
I wanted to stay, but she wouldn't let me.

168
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,840
So, Ms. Ayla is alone with Mr. Pete?

169
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,760
Yes, just the two of them.

170
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,200
How long?

171
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,120
About ten minutes now.

172
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,760
Why didn't you call her?

173
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,920
How could you let her
be alone with someone else?

174
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,920
But Boss, they looked really close.

175
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Yeah.

176
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,640
Typhoon,

177
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,440
get the car ready.

178
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,320
We're taking Ms. Ayla home in ten minutes.

179
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,800
Yes, Boss.

180
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,400
I'll head out now.

181
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,120
See you later.

182
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,760
Everyone else, leave.

183
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,200
I need to speak with Ms. Ayla.

184
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,000
Yes, Boss.

185
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,720
Ayla.

186
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,800
Talk to me first.

187
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,520
But this VIP has nothing to discuss
with her bodyguard.

188
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,720
If you have something to say,
say it quickly.

189
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,200
I don't have much time.

190
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,680
Are you really sure
you want to act like this?

191
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,760
Like what?

192
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,400
Like this.

193
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,880
Working so hard to become a superstar,

194
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:26,080
and then, what if someone snaps a photo
and uses it to blackmail you?

195
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,480
Do you really trust people that easily?

196
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,240
And what did I do wrong?

197
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,160
Why are you scolding me?

198
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,880
Sitting on a man's lap. Is that not wrong?

199
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,400
It's not wrong.

200
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,920
And about to kiss him?
That's not wrong either?

201
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,200
It's not wrong.

202
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,840
Pete is single. I'm single.

203
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:58,080
If two single people want to kiss each
other, there's nothing wrong with that.

204
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,600
Besides, Pete is a true gentleman.

205
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,280
A gentleman?

206
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,840
You think that's respecting a woman?

207
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,360
Yes.

208
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,800
I trust Pete.

209
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,640
At least he's never hurt me.

210
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,440
Fine.

211
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,240
If you won't listen,

212
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,760
then I can't protect you anymore.

213
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,640
I'm resigning

214
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,640
as your bodyguard, Ms. Ayla.

215
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,960
If you still want to hire my company,

216
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,080
Chanya and Nana
will handle your protection.

217
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,120
If not,

218
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,800
I'm ready to terminate the contract

219
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,000
and pay any compensation.

220
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,920
You're going to leave me just like
you did eight years ago, aren't you?

221
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,760
Do you know?

222
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,240
Ever since we met again,

223
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,680
I've never dared to ask

224
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,440
why you disappeared back then,

225
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,080
without leaving me any way to contact you.

226
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:48,440
You acted like
you didn't care at all how I felt.

227
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,520
You've been in my heart

228
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,400
since the very first day we met.

229
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,320
When we were kids,

230
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,760
I followed you into that club,

231
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,200
even though I didn't want to join at all.

232
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,160
Do you know how hard
it was for me to stay?

233
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,680
But I stayed because you were there.

234
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,760
I was the one who made
all those treats for you.

235
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,480
The day after the dance competition,

236
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,880
I was going to confess to you
that I loved you.

237
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,280
But you disappeared.

238
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,360
Every single day since then,

239
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,560
I've been chasing my dreams,
hoping to meet you again.

240
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,920
I wanted to become famous
just to prove to you

241
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,720
that I could do it,

242
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,720
just like we talked about back then.

243
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,400
Khaotu scolded me every single day,

244
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,200
telling me I was crazy,
that you'd never come back.

245
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,440
But I didn't give up.

246
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,120
I couldn't stop thinking about you.

247
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,280
I couldn't forget you.

248
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,000
I couldn't stop loving you.

249
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,920
Do you know how happy I was

250
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,440
when I finally found you again?

251
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,360
Do you know how hard I tried

252
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,600
to make you stand beside me again?

253
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,640
And in the end,

254
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,760
you still don't love me.

255
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,720
You only care about those stupid rules.

256
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,680
Even though I love you so much,

257
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,680
you never loved me back.

258
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,040
Never. You've never loved me. Never!

259
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,760
If I say I love you now,
would it still be in time?

260
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,200
I love you, Ayla.

261
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,200
I love you so much.

262
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,200
Don't cry.

263
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,800
Your eyes will get all puffy.

264
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,760
I didn't want to cry.

265
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,480
But I can't stop the tears.

266
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,240
Come on.

267
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,520
Show me that smile.

268
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,200
My good girl.

269
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,280
Your smile is so much
more beautiful than your tears.

270
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,680
Don't cry, okay?

271
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,680
Can I stay in this hug for an hour?

272
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,360
Of course.

273
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,480
But won't you get sore?

274
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,880
I don't know.
I just know that I'm so happy.

275
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,720
I don't ever want to let go.

276
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,720
Can I hug you to make up
for the past eight years?

277
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,880
Would just hugging be enough?

278
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,800
What… What do you mean?

279
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,480
I could give you even more than that.

280
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,520
What?

281
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,560
Tawan!

282
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,760
You always mess with me!

283
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,200
Tawan.

284
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,760
Yes?

285
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,720
I have so many things I want to ask you.

286
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,080
So many

287
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,400
that I don't even know where to start.

288
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,440
Then…

289
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,880
how about I start first?

290
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,600
I don't know if you'll believe me.

291
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,400
But I've loved you since we were students.

292
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,920
Huh?

293
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,840
Since we were students?

294
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,480
Cha Nom,

295
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,000
let me tell you something.

296
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:00,520
I met this girl once.

297
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,760
She was so cute.

298
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,120
I helped her out,

299
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,960
but…

300
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,880
I didn't get her number.

301
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,320
Do you think

302
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:33,000
I'll ever see her again?

303
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,080
Sit down!

304
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,280
- Too tight?
- No.

305
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,280
HELLO

306
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,159
A POWER-UP SNACK!
EAT IT AND YOU'LL HAVE LOTS OF ENERGY

307
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,800
I think

308
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,000
Sasina's body isn't strong enough.

309
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:21,240
If she has to do intense exercises,
she probably won't be able to handle it.

310
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,600
Our school has a strong dance club,
you know.

311
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,440
I think you should audition.

312
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,400
Kendo might be a bit too intense for you.

313
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,080
- Hey.
- Yes?

314
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,280
It's raining outside.

315
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,680
Thank you so much, Tawan!

316
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,840
It's really pouring out there.

317
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,800
Tawan!

318
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,040
You're still here?

319
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,960
I happened to forget my umbrella.

320
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,640
I forgot mine too.

321
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,040
So, you were just looking
for an excuse to stay with me, huh?

322
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,080
You hid your umbrella too. I saw you.

323
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,000
Who would pass up
a chance to be alone with you?

324
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,640
At that time, I really thought
the heavens were helping me out.

325
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,120
No.

326
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,200
It was all us.

327
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,720
You know, I always loved
watching you dance the most.

328
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,320
You looked so happy when you danced.

329
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,320
If you loved watching me dance so much,

330
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,920
then why didn't you come cheer me on
when I auditioned for the dance club?

331
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,640
Just because you didn't see me
doesn't mean I wasn't there.

332
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,640
Can I feel shy right now?

333
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,880
Shy? After all this time?

334
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,160
Well, I'm shy retroactively!

335
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,480
Who would have believed

336
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,880
that the most popular girl in school
actually had a crush on me,

337
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,000
nerdy,

338
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,440
glasses-wearing Ayla?

339
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,440
Oh! I want to call Khaotu right now.

340
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,360
Can I tell her? Where's my phone?

341
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,080
Ayla, how about we hold off
on that call for now?

342
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,920
I still have so many things
I want to tell you.

343
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,720
There's more?

344
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,240
But before I start,

345
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,680
can I ask you something?

346
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:31,120
Did you keep the teru teru bōzu doll
we made together?

347
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,960
Of course.

348
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,360
I've kept it safe.
It's in my cabinet at home.

349
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,600
I don't know if you'll believe me…

350
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,720
but I didn't leave

351
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,120
without leaving you a way to contact me.

352
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,640
What?

353
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,000
The teru teru bōzu?

354
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,800
Tell your new owner…

355
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,720
to not forget about Tawan.

356
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,680
Tawan, why did you make it so difficult?

357
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,840
I'm not that smart, you know.

358
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,360
Why didn't you make it easier
for me to find it?

359
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,800
When you said

360
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,200
I left you behind,

361
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,280
I guessed then

362
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,560
that you probably never saw it.

363
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,440
All those years, I kept hoping

364
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,680
maybe you'd find it someday and email me.

365
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,640
But as time passed,

366
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,120
I thought

367
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,960
maybe you did see it

368
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,880
and just didn't want to reach out.

369
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,640
That's not true at all.

370
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,960
If I had known,

371
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,880
there's no way
I wouldn't have contacted you.

372
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,640
If you don't believe me,
you can ask Khaotu.

373
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,520
I believe you.

374
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,560
Back then, it was me
who didn't have the courage.

375
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,680
I'm so sorry

376
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,600
for making you wait all this time.

377
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,480
And thank you, Ayla,

378
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,840
for trying so hard,

379
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,640
for bringing me back
to stand beside you again.

380
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,480
Should we ambush and take them out now?

381
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:48,280
If we're going to do it,
there must be no evidence.

382
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,560
So, let's be girlfriends?

383
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,840
Tawan…

384
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,520
Yes?

385
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:03,000
Ayla, I want to do this properly.

386
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,280
When I asked you to protect my daughter,

387
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,160
I meant as her bodyguard.

388
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,960
Not to get that deeply involved.

389
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,040
