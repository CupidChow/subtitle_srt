1
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,600
- Hey!
- Tawan!

2
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,400
That mistress's daughter. Everything
she does is perfect in your eyes!

3
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,720
How fortunate you haven't
turned Mek against me as well.

4
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,400
<i>Why are you apologizing for him?</i>

5
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,520
Make him kneel before me!

6
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,440
<i>If Dad can't fix this problem,</i>

7
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,560
<i>then there might not be</i>
<i>a T.S. Construction anymore.</i>

8
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,640
Will you sit here
and watch over me while I'm singing?

9
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,880
How's my daughter?

10
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,000
In the initial tests,

11
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,960
we found red blood cells
and protein leaking in her urine.

12
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,280
She also has high blood pressure.

13
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,480
As she is so young,
we'll need to investigate further.

14
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,920
We suspect she has a kidney condition.

15
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,120
After she's admitted, we'd like to do

16
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,760
a biopsy for a clearer diagnosis.

17
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,400
Hello.

18
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,320
I'm Dr. Phanorn,
the nephrologist treating Ms. Sasina.

19
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,920
The biopsy results are back.

20
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,200
From the results,

21
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,480
she has IgA nephropathy.

22
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,400
Her blood work also shows

23
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,279
reduced kidney function
and toxin build-up.

24
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,200
In simple terms, kidney failure.

25
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,360
Kidney failure?

26
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,600
How could this happen?
Ayla is still so young.

27
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,560
This condition
can even affect young people.

28
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,320
It happens when the body
produces IgA antibodies

29
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,680
that attack the kidneys themselves.

30
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,480
For now, we'll control

31
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,320
her blood pressure,

32
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,040
restrict salt in her diet,

33
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,640
and start dialysis
to reduce the toxin build-up.

34
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,240
That should make her feel better.

35
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,680
But she won't be able to go back
to working the way she used to.

36
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,440
And in the future,

37
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,280
we'll likely need to discuss

38
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,080
a kidney transplant
to improve her quality of life.

39
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,800
Then do the surgery right away.
I've got no objections at all.

40
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,200
I understand. But the issue

41
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,920
is finding a compatible donor.

42
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,120
<i>If your tissue</i>

43
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,200
<i>matches hers, it could be quick.</i>

44
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,600
<i>If not,</i>

45
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,320
<i>she'll have to wait</i>
<i>on the transplant list,</i>

46
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,680
<i>and no one knows how long that will take.</i>

47
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,440
<i>It's best to tell her soon,</i>

48
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,520
<i>so treatment can begin right away.</i>

49
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,680
Ayla.

50
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,880
You're awake.

51
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,680
How are you,

52
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,840
my brave girl?

53
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,840
Guess I didn't sleep enough before.

54
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,200
But I have now.

55
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,680
I feel better. Can we go home?

56
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,640
You still need to be here for now.

57
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,040
The doctors won't allow it yet.

58
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,440
Why not?

59
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,080
Please tell me the truth.

60
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,400
The doctors say you have a kidney disease.

61
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,000
Huh?

62
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,120
And right now…

63
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,560
your kidneys aren't working well.

64
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,000
Don't panic.

65
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,160
We'll get through this together.

66
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,160
I'll always be by your side.

67
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,200
Okay?

68
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,960
You don't have to be afraid.

69
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,520
I'm full.

70
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,320
Just a little more, okay?

71
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,520
Good girl.

72
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,680
See?

73
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,200
My girl's amazing.

74
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,960
So easy to take care of.

75
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,120
Right?

76
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,400
I just want to go home.

77
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,000
I'll ask the doctor

78
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,040
when you can be discharged.

79
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,040
But first, no more tears.

80
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,640
Alright?

81
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,680
Dad.

82
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,800
Hey, sweetheart.

83
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,280
How are you feeling? My brave girl.

84
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,200
It's okay, right?

85
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,680
Just a little sick.
You'll get better soon.

86
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,720
PRINC HOSPITAL SUVARNABHUMI

87
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,040
Boss, hello.

88
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,120
How are you? Get plenty of rest.

89
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
Your health comes first.

90
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,680
When you're better,
then we'll think about work.

91
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,600
Thank you.

92
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,480
But really…

93
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,760
you don't have to cancel everything.

94
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,880
I think I can still manage some of it.

95
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,920
Stop it. Rest first.
Just focus on getting better.

96
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,880
In the meantime,
I'll have Kie rearrange the schedule.

97
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,040
Alright then. I'll rest and get well soon.

98
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,320
But you have to promise
I can keep working.

99
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,840
Of course. You'll be back at work.

100
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,040
Thank you, Madam President,

101
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,800
for understanding
and giving Ayla this chance.

102
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,720
I've watched Ayla since day one.

103
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,640
All I've ever seen
is her dedication and effort.

104
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,040
The least I can do is support

105
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,680
and encourage her in every way I can.

106
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,240
And as for the work we just discussed,
if Ms. Rawee has any worries, let them go.

107
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,800
If Ayla really isn't well enough,
she shouldn't push herself.

108
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,520
Ayla loves singing,

109
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,600
and she loves her fans.

110
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,200
I don't think
she'd want to make them worry.

111
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,240
Anyway, Kie,

112
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,320
draft a statement, please.

113
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,480
We'll need to inform the fans

114
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,200
that Ayla is taking a temporary break.

115
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,840
Yes, ma'am.

116
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,920
Thank you so much.

So much love and support online.

My girl really is adored, you know.

Don't get jealous.

127

With this many people loving you,

128
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,880
I couldn't possibly keep up
with all that jealousy.

129
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,560
You really do have an army of fans.

Are you sure you can handle this, Ayla?

135
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,480
Seriously, I'm worried about you.

136
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,240
I can do it.

137
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,600
Please, let me be the one
to tell them the truth myself.

138
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,040
Because…

139
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,640
after this, I don't know
how much strength I'll have left.

140

There's something I need to tell you.

- What?
- Ayla!

168
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,480
The truth is…

169
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,480
my condition is more serious
than what the label announced.

170
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,480
- What?
- Huh?

171
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,000
I have kidney inflammation.

00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,560
And right now,

173
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,960
I'm in kidney failure.

174
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,400
I need dialysis all the time,

175
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,760
and my life isn't the same anymore.

176
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,760
The staff, my family,

177
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,560
even our president,
have told me to stop working.

178
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,800
But I was stubborn, and that's why
this event could happen today.

179
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,040
Because…

180
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,600
I don't know if this will be
the last time we meet.

181
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,200
I'm so sorry…

182
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,320
if I can't bring you happiness
the way I used to.

183
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,560
- That's alright.
- It's okay, Ayla!

184
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,040
Ayla!

185
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,240
I love you all so, so much.

186
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,320
Love you!

187
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,040
Ayla!

188
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:57,040
Ayla! Ayla! Ayla!

189
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,520
Ayla! Ayla! Ayla!

190
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,880
Ayla! Ayla! Ayla!

191
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,080
The label BEC Music
has confirmed Ayla is safe,

192
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,760
currently receiving hospital care.

193
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,080
She will be on indefinite medical leave.

194
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,560
<i>We'll bring you any updates</i>

195
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,480
<i>as soon as they come in.</i>

196
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,480
Here, drink some water.

197
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,200
I must look…

198
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,360
awful right now, right?

199
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,840
Not pretty anymore.

200
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,240
Who said that?

201
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,080
Show me.

202
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,320
Who dares say my girl isn't beautiful?
I'll deal with them myself.

203
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,840
You're gorgeous.

204
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,640
Don't cry.

205
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,640
You're the prettiest.

206
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,000
So, are you my bodyguard or a mafia boss?

207
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,160
Me?

208
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,120
Oh, I switch back and forth.

209
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,480
When I've got time, I'm a mafia boss.
When I'm busy, I'm just your bodyguard.

210
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,600
And today?

211
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,200
Today?

212
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,600
Today… I'm free.

213
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,080
You know,

214
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,360
at 24,

215
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,520
I feel like I've already lived my dream.

216
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,720
I followed my dream.

217
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,440
I became a singer.

218
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,840
I have tons of fans.

219
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,800
And my first love, whom I thought
we wouldn't end up together,

220
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,440
I got to meet again.

221
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,200
- Tawan.
- What?

222
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,080
Seriously,

223
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,680
if one day

224
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,480
I can't fight anymore,

225
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,880
if I don't make it,

226
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,080
promise me

227
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,560
you won't grieve for too long.

228
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,880
Don't cry too long.

229
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,280
Be strong quickly.

230
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,560
And if someone comes into your life,

231
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,600
someone who loves you
and takes care of you,

232
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,320
maybe not as much as I do, it's fine.

233
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,920
Please open your heart to them.

234
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,960
I want you to have
someone nice taking care of you.

235
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,840
I don't want you to be lonely.

236
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,160
I'll be watching from the sky,

237
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,440
as the moon shining bright

238
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,800
for this sun.

239
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,000
This sun only.

240
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,080
No one else can take care of this sun.

241
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,240
Because this sun's heart
doesn't have any room left

242
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,360
for anyone,

243
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,120
except…

244
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,160
this one moon.

245
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,760
We'll fight this together.

246
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,400
I want to keep fighting with you too.

247
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,480
To love you like this, in every lifetime.

248
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,360
But please, not like this.

249
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,000
Not so soon.

250
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,920
How long have you been awake?

251
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,440
A little while.

252
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,080
I was just wondering where you went.

253
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,000
I had some errands.

254
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,760
Hungry?

255
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,400
Look,

256
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,040
I brought snacks.

257
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,400
Want some?

258
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,080
Will you marry me?

259
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,120
Yes.

260
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,280
Thank you.

261
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,360
Thank you so much.

262
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,800
When you hug me this tight…

263
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,040
When you hug me this tight…

264
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,960
You can.

265
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,840
But…

266
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,080
What about my dad?

267
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,280
Congratulations, my dear.

268
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,880
You're… not angry?

269
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,679
I gave Tawan my blessing myself.

270
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,840
Because she promised me
she'd take the best care of you.

271
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,320
MS. SASINA RUENGKUNAKORN

272
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,920
How cute!

273
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,960
MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE

274
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,840
Honestly, I wanted to throw
a bigger wedding for you.

275
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,640
- But…
- Hey.

276
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,000
It's totally fine.

277
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,800
I'm so happy already.

278
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,520
I love you so much, Tawan.

279
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,720
Thank you
for standing by me all this time.

280
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,840
From now on,

281
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:51,480
I'll live the rest of my life
as happily as I can,

282
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,240
even if--

283
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,480
From now on,

284
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,000
your time isn't going
to be cut short anymore.

285
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,320
What?

286
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,720
Today is our special day,

287
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,080
and I have good news.

288
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,920
What is it?

289
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,600
You're going to get better.

290
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,800
A donor match

291
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,680
has been found for your kidney.

292
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,320
Really?

293
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,400
Really.

294
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,440
But…

295
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,480
we'll need to fly overseas
for the surgery.

296
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,240
Okay?

297
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,800
Mr. Thana and I will be there with you.

298
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,440
So, not only am I your bride today,

299
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,160
I'll also get my surgery.

300
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,040
I'll finally be healthy again?

301
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,560
This is the happiest day of my life!

302
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,160
Yes. You'll be fine, Ayla.

303
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,040
I'm so happy…

304
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Are you ready?

305
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:01,160
I'm ready.
I just want my normal life back.

306
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,320
A match?

307
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,120
Yes.

308
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,520
I can be Ayla's donor.

309
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,320
But the surgery mus be done abroad,

310
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,720
and they require a marriage certificate.

311
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,520
May I ask for your permission
to marry Ayla?

312
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,760
Is this your way of forcing me
to accept you,

313
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,760
even as Songklod's daughter?

314
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,800
No.

315
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,040
It's just a requirement for the surgery.

316
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,080
To show you my sincerity,

317
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,080
I'll even sign divorce papers in advance.

318
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,360
Once the surgery succeeds,

319
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,600
I'll disappear from Ayla's life.

320
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,480
I don't understand.

321
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,040
Why sacrifice so much

322
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,720
when in the end,

323
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,120
you won't even be together?

324
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,520
Because I love Ayla.

325
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,080
I love her without conditions.

326
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,520
I don't need to possess her.

327
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,400
All I want

328
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,240
is for her to live her life fully again.

329
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,800
As long

330
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,840
as we breathe under the same sky…

331
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,800
that's enough for me.

332
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,720
We don't need to be together.

333
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,480
That's all I ask.

334
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,520
Hi, my baby girl.

335
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,240
Dad…

336
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,720
Where's Tawan?

337
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,880
She had urgent business.

338
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,720
She had to fly back to Thailand.

339
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,000
<i>The number you have dialed</i>
<i>cannot be connected at this time.</i>

340
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,440
<i>Please try again later.</i>

341
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,600
Tawan left you a gift.

342
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,080
Is that your girlfriend? She's gorgeous.

343
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,840
<i>The one who donated me a kidney</i>

344
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,720
<i>was Tawan?</i>

345
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,880
I came to see Tawan.

346
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,880
<i>No matter where you are,</i>

347
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,400
<i>I'll find you.</i>

348
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,440
<i>Even if it takes years,</i>

349
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,400
<i>I'll keep searching until I do.</i>

350
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,360
<i>My love.</i>

351
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,080
