1
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,360
Ayla!

2
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,640
Handsome, rich.
Fans keep shipping him with everyone.

3
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,880
Ms. Ayla is alone with Mr. Pete?

4
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,480
Yes, just the two of them.

5
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,120
I'm resigning

6
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,040
as your bodyguard, Ms. Ayla.

7
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,040
You're going to leave me just like
you did eight years ago, aren't you?

8
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,880
You never loved me back.

9
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,360
I love you, Ayla.

10
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,800
They've made up,
suddenly walking side by side again.

11
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,120
Shh…

12
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,800
Okay, other side!

13
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,280
Pull it back more.

14
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,360
Okay, switch!

15
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,600
- Hello!
- Hello.

16
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,160
Perfect timing.

17
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,320
Look!

18
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,120
I really don't like
that Pete guy's face at all.

19
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,080
Should we ambush and take him out now?

20
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,000
Look!

21
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,800
But there are security cameras here.
We'd have to handle him somewhere else.

22
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,000
But from what I know,

23
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,640
this Pete guy is…

24
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,640
kinda weird.

25
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,960
Weird?

26
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,000
Don't you guys have anything better to do

27
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,920
than gossip?

28
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,400
No, Boss.

29
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,360
If we're going to do it,

30
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,480
there must be no evidence.

31
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,880
What was that, Boss?

32
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,160
We didn't hear anything.

33
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,640
Getting better and better, Ayla, Pete.

34
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,040
Thank you!

35
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,360
Okay, Teacher. Bye!

36
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,600
See you later.

37
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,720
Done. Are you hungry?

38
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,280
Tawan, Pete is gay.
No need to be jealous anymore, okay?

39
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,280
He's gay?

40
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,400
Keep your voice down! Everyone will hear!

41
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,040
Gay?

42
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,840
Yeah.

43
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,680
Pete loves me like a little sister.
He totally adores me.

44
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,680
Yesterday,
I just asked him for a tiny favor.

45
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,120
Girl, what do you want me
to do exactly? Say it again.

46
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,880
Was that dance not close enough already?

47
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,280
That was just dancing.

48
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,040
Maybe Tawan thinks it's strictly work.

49
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,120
She's not gonna punch me, right?
My nose job was expensive.

50
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,120
Why are you laughing? It really was!

51
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,560
Tawan's reasonable. She won't punch you.

52
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,880
She might throw you, though.

53
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,760
What? Throw me?

54
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,840
I'm a tiny, delicate man.

55
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,000
My face cost a fortune…

56
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,200
Pete,

57
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,200
please, help me just this once? Please?

58
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,000
Fine, tell me what to do.

59
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,160
I think Tawan will show up soon.

60
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,680
She knows exactly
when I finish dance practice.

61
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,000
How about this?
We pretend we're about to kiss.

62
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,440
Stop squinting like that!
It's just acting!

63
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,400
Do I really look that disgusted?

64
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,880
Fine! If you weren't like my baby sister,
I would never do this.

65
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,200
Alright, let's practice a bit.

66
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,920
Hold up. You're the girl, I'm the guy,

67
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,320
so I'd grab you like this,
and then move in like…

68
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,480
Goosebumps! If only I could swap you

69
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,400
for that hot bodyguard outside.

70
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,880
What's his name again? The handsome one.

71
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,800
Typhoon.

72
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,160
Typhoon…

73
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,600
A literal tropical cyclone.

74
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,120
Messing with me like this,

75
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,720
you know you're gonna get punished.

76
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,760
Punished?

77
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,760
But I didn't even sleep last night.

78
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,600
Please don't do anything to me!

79
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,160
You're the one
who was too excited to sleep.

80
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,720
I told you to rest, but you wouldn't.

81
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,720
You just kept talking and talking.
How's that my fault?

82
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,680
But I was so happy.

83
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,320
I finally have you all to myself.

84
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,720
Can I be jealous now? You are so sweet,
I can't even focus on my call.

85
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,880
Well, hurry up
and find someone for yourself.

86
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,880
I heard your queue of admirers
is as long as a kite tail.

87
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,560
Nah.

88
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,320
Mr. "Too Handsome to Choose".

89
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,520
Of course!

90
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,840
Ms. Tawan, I really want to apologize
for being so touchy with Ayla.

91
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,160
There was really nothing going on.

92
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,840
A little sister asked me for help,
so I helped.

93
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,120
I should apologize too.

94
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,760
Yesterday, I might have been a bit…

95
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,880
Jealous.

96
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,720
Just a little.

97
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,080
No worries.

98
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,160
I'm a pretty great actor, after all.

99
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,920
So, sis, where are you off to next?

100
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,920
I've got a meeting with the boss.

101
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,200
I'm heading out now. See you.

102
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,880
- Wait. Let me hug you.
- Okay.

103
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,040
See you!

104
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,160
See you. Bye-bye. Get home safe!

105
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,440
What the heck was that?

106
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,880
Well, it's obvious now.

107
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,400
Obvious what?

108
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,040
I mean,

109
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,440
no need to worry about him
being Boss's rival anymore.

110
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,400
What do you mean?

111
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,160
Tell us!

112
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,480
- What do you mean "obvious"?
- Yeah, what is it?

113
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,040
Boss, there's a package
from Ms. Ayla's house for you.

114
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,040
It's here!

115
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,360
Where is it?

116
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,200
What?

117
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,600
Why am I so blind?

118
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,480
If it was a snake,
it would've bitten me by now!

119
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,920
Really?

120
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,320
Yes! Seriously!

121
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,600
Chanya,

122
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,040
I've made my choice.

123
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,440
Whatever you choose, Boss, we're with you.

124
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,120
Guess we'll be calling her
"Lady Boss" now, huh?

125
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,840
We finally have a Lady Boss!

126
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,800
Head on home now.

127
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,080
Not yet?

128
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,600
We haven't even said goodbye
to our Lady Boss.

129
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,680
- I'm leaving, Boss.
- Okay, Boss!

130
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,880
Good luck!

131
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,160
YOU'VE GOT AN EMAIL

132
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,200
SORRY IT TOOK ME SO LONG
BUT I REALLY MISS YOU - AYLA

133
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,280
Ready?

134
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,080
The sky is so beautiful today.

135
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,920
Is there anything else
you really like or dislike?

136
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,360
I like the sky, the stars,

137
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,320
the mountains,

138
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,280
the aurora…

139
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,080
I love sweets, but I can't
eat too much, or I'll get fat.

140
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,720
I also want to go to an amusement park,
but I can't since it's too crowded.

141
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,360
And things I don't like…

142
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,040
The dark. I'm scared of it.
I'm scared of ghosts too.

143
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,920
You're scared of the dark?

144
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,360
But what about concerts?

145
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,200
It's always dark backstage.

146
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,440
Right before going onstage,
I get really scared, you know?

147
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,120
It's so dark, and the pressure is intense.

148
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,440
The only one who knows
I'm scared of the dark is Gie.

149
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,080
Gie always stays with me.

150
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,840
When I get scared, I focus
on the lights in the hall and the fans.

151
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,040
They really give me strength.

152
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,720
Just knowing they're waiting for me

153
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,760
makes most of that fear disappear.

154
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,560
You're amazing.

155
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,600
So, where are we going?

156
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,760
We're going camping.

157
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,080
Camping?

158
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,080
Then, let's go buy snacks first!

159
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,680
Stock up on snacks! Snacks!

160
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,520
Where's Jam?

161
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,440
Can I have the car keys?

162
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,160
Car keys… Oh.

163
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,480
Thank you. You can head back first.

164
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,720
Sure, no problem.

165
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,320
And here's gas money.

166
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,720
Okay, thank you.

167
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,240
I'll drive.

168
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,400
It's done!

169
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,200
- Let's go!
- Let's go.

170
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,760
I haven't gone camping
like this in so long.

171
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:08,400
The last time
was probably back in grade nine.

172
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,920
But it was kind of a disaster because
Dad didn't know how to pitch a tent.

173
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,040
He just wanted that "dad taking
his kid camping" vibe, chilling and stuff.

174
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,680
You really love camping, huh?

175
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,920
I love it so much.

176
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,839
Whose place is this?

177
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,480
The atmosphere is amazing.
Right by the water too.

178
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,120
It's mine.

179
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,720
I bought it as my own safe zone.

180
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,120
It's quiet, peaceful, and totally secure.

181
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,600
That's so nice.

182
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,760
I really love it here.

183
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,240
I feel like I could
actually live like this.

184
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,480
Oh! The lights went out!

185
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,920
So, you can see the stars better.

186
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,640
Look over there!

187
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,720
Look! There!

188
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,360
- What do you see?
- A shooting star.

189
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,480
I only see the moon.

190
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,080
Where's the moon?

191
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,120
Can we see it tonight?

192
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,040
Right here.

193
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,400
Beautiful too.

194
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,600
Hey, you know,

195
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,800
If you see a shooting star
and make a wish,

196
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,320
it'll come true.

197
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,680
Oh!

198
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,560
There's another one!

199
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,040
Quick, make a wish!

200
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,880
Aren't you going to wish?

201
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,560
I already did.

202
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,800
Already?

203
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,280
You weren't even looking at the star.

204
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,840
I made my wish to the moon.

205
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,160
Why would I look at the star?

206
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,120
- Ayla.
- Yes?

207
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,880
Be my girlfriend.

208
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,200
Why that face?

209
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,280
You don't want to?

210
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,200
Of course I do!

211
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,200
I really, really want to.
More than anything in the world!

212
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,920
So, let's be girlfriends?

213
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,640
Yes.

214
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,480
This bracelet is so pretty.

215
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,840
It glows.

216
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,320
Yeah.

217
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,240
It glows in the dark.

218
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,680
The darkness can't scare you anymore.

219
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,720
Because I'll always have
the sun with me, right?

220
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,800
I'll always be by your side

221
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,040
and protect you forever.

222
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,000
The lights are back.

223
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,160
MAMA MINCED PORK FLAVOR

224
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,120
I'll help.

225
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,480
What?

226
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,960
What's with that cute face?

227
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,440
You wanted to ask me something, right?

228
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,520
Can I?

229
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,480
Of course.

230
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,920
I have nothing to hide from my girlfriend.

231
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,400
I wanted to ask about

232
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,320
when you suddenly moved to Hong Kong.

233
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,000
When I found out, I rushed to your house,

234
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,680
but they told me you were gone.

235
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,360
But if you can't answer, it's okay.

236
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,520
At that time, I got into a huge fight
with my half-brother,

237
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,360
to the point it turned physical.

238
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,440
So, I decided to move and stay
with Aunt Mui in Hong Kong.

239
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,880
Mek…

240
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,520
What right do you have
to go through my room

241
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,120
and steal my things?

242
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,520
What right?

243
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,560
You forget this is my house?

244
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,120
Your stuff is in my house,

245
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,440
so it's mine too.

246
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,560
Give it back!

247
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,720
You bastard!

248
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,880
How dare you talk to me like that?

249
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,720
You mistress's child.

250
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,280
Let go!

251
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:08,200
So, how's my little rain doll doing?

252
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,440
Is she doing okay?

253
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,920
How are you? Are you doing okay?

254
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,120
Do you miss me?

255
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,440
"I miss you."

256
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,280
"I miss you so, so much."

257
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,880
This was my first single, right?

258
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,760
So, that means
you were keeping up with me.

259
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,960
Yes.

260
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,800
I've always followed everything you do.

261
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,520
Did you ever come to my concerts?

262
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,560
Every single one.

263
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,280
What? Then why
didn't you come say hi to me?

264
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,400
I was afraid you wouldn't remember me.

265
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,720
How could I ever forget you? Look at me.
Do I look like someone who'd forget?

266
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,560
You didn't just remember.

267
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,480
You figured everything out so well.

268
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,040
You know, I once thought

269
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:56,400
if my company needed a private detective,
I'd hire you part-time.

270
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,520
Speaking of your company,

271
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,440
why did you decide
to open a bodyguard agency?

272
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,400
Do you remember?

273
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,000
You once told me
I was like your personal bodyguard.

274
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,920
Of course. And you said

275
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,680
your fee would be sky-high,
that I could never afford to hire you.

276
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,560
That was actually

277
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,520
my true inspiration.

278
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,560
Protecting youv back then

279
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,560
made me realize keeping someone safe

280
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,200
felt so meaningful.

281
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,280
Since then, I made it my goal.

282
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,240
I trained hard, kept learning,

283
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,520
and eventually built
my own bodyguard company.

284
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:49,040
So, we were
each other's inspiration all along.

285
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,480
Isn't that nice?

286
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,400
Yes.

287
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,240
Thank you

288
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,360
for never giving up on loving me.

289
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,840
And thank you

290
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,800
for accepting my love.

291
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,240
Oh!

292
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,640
Dad!

293
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,080
Hey, sweetheart.

294
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,840
You didn't tell me you were coming!

295
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,120
Did you wait long?

296
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,400
Not long at all.

297
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,160
Wait.

298
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,840
You look so bright.

299
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,520
Guess you've been resting well, huh?

300
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,840
Hello, Mr. Thana.

301
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,600
Ms. Rawee,

302
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,800
thank you so much
for taking such good care of Ayla.

303
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,440
I spoke with the chairwoman.

304
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:36,000
She told me the whole plan to catch
the culprit was your team's work.

305
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,560
I apologize
for not informing you beforehand.

306
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,480
That's alright.

307
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,680
The fewer people who knew,
the better the chances of success.

308
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,760
All that matters is that Ayla's safe.
That's a huge relief to me.

309
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,720
Well…

310
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,200
Aunt Kate cooked
your favorite dishes for you.

311
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,880
I put them in the fridge.

312
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,280
Eat them whenever you like.

313
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,960
Okay, Dad. Thank you so much.

314
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,320
Dad.

315
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,960
I think I'll be able to sleep
at home again next week.

316
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,280
I hope so, my superstar girl.

317
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,320
Working so much,
you've forgotten your old man, huh?

318
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:22,280
Come on. Don't sulk now. There, there.

319
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,800
Are you sleepy yet?

320
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,720
Not yet.

321
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,120
I just want to cuddle with you.

322
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,080
Cuddle all you want.

323
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,600
I'm ready.

324
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,120
Tawan…

325
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,440
Yes?

326
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,960
What is it?

327
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,360
Ayla.

328
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,200
I want to do this properly.

329
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,040
If I tell your father that we're dating,

330
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,800
what do you think?

331
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,320
I'm totally fine with that.

332
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,680
Whenever someone hits on me,

333
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,040
I always tell Dad anyway.

334
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,160
Then tomorrow, after work,

335
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,000
let's go see your father together.

336
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,520
Sure.

337
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,960
I'll set it up.

338
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,120
So, Ayla.

339
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,960
Is there something you want to tell me?

340
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,320
Well…

341
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,760
I…

342
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,120
I'd like to ask for your permission…

343
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,720
to date Ms. Ayla.

344
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,760
Ayla.

345
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,240
Step outside for a moment.

346
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,480
I need to speak privately with Ms. Rawee.

347
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,680
But Dad…

348
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,880
Ayla.

349
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,360
Okay…

350
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,320
When I asked you to protect my daughter,

351
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,960
I meant as her bodyguard.

352
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,000
Not to get that deeply involved.

353
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,120
Can you explain to me

354
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,240
exactly what happened?

355
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,840
I've known Ms. Ayla
since high school, sir.

356
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,360
We lost touch after that,

357
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,520
until we met again through this job.

358
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,040
Did you accept this job

359
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,440
because you had feelings for her?

360
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,680
No, sir.

361
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,840
I took the job

362
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,360
because you told me Ms. Ayla's
and your lives were being threatened

363
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,800
by enemies in your business.

364
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,720
Let me be straightforward.

365
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,960
The reason I hired a private bodyguard
for my daughter was because

366
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,120
I've been dealing
with serious business threats.

367
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,560
I've received multiple death threats
against both me and my daughter.

368
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,120
I don't know if what happened to Ayla

369
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,800
was really from anti-fans

370
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,600
or from my business enemies.

371
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,800
I couldn't stand it

372
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,120
if anything ever happened to her.

373
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,080
And the most important reason

374
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:16,040
is because of your deep love
and care for Ms. Ayla.

375
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,720
Your desire to protect her

376
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,680
is no different from mine.

377
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,720
Ms. Ayla

378
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,240
is incredibly important to me.

379
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,600
If I hadn't taken this job

380
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,280
and something happened to her,

381
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,960
I'd regret it

382
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,600
and blame myself for the rest of my life.

383
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,000
So, you're saying
you're ready to protect her

384
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,920
with your life?

385
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,800
Yes.

386
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,120
With my life.

387
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,600
Since we share the same intention,

388
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,520
I have no objection

389
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,000
to you dating Ayla.

390
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,040
But I have only one request.

391
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,760
Never hurt her feelings.

392
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,520
Because if you do,
I won't forgive you either.

393
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,520
That day will never come, sir.

394
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,320
Kate,

395
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,400
could you call Ayla back in?

396
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,560
Yes, sir.

397
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,080
- Dad. Actually, I wanted to--
- I'm not against it.

398
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,760
If you two want to be together,

399
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,000
then take good care of each other.

400
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,040
And don't bother her too much, okay?

401
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,400
I love you more
than anything in the world!

402
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,240
Thank you so much!

403
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,360
I love you more than anything too.
You know that?

404
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,080
Please take care of Ayla for me,

405
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,760
Tawan.

406
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,160
Thank you so much.

407
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,000
I promise I'll make her

408
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,400
the happiest she can be.

409
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,240
How about this?

410
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,960
Let's celebrate.

411
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,440
My daughter

412
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,880
is finally off the shelf!

413
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,920
Dad! I was never on the shelf
in the first place!

414
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,720
Thanks.

415
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,800
Let me ask you something.

416
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,560
This relationship…

417
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,600
Are you two serious enough

418
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:46,240
to even think about marriage?

419
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,640
Dad! You're asking that already?

420
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,280
I just want to know!
I mean, I'm easygoing.

421
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,920
You can live together first,
or get married first,

422
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,280
or even move in here after you marry.

423
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,120
I'm serious about this.

424
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,680
If it's serious,

425
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,400
how about we just get married tomorrow?

426
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,440
Well, since we're talking about marriage…

427
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,120
Tell me more about your family.

428
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:24,840
I'm not familiar with your surname, Tawan.

429
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,480
My surname, "Wang",

430
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:33,440
came from my time
living with my aunt in Hong Kong.

431
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:37,400
She adopted me as her own,

432
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,640
and I've used that name ever since.

433
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,560
My original surname…

434
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,760
is Chokprasertsap.

435
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,520
Rawee Chokprasertsup?

436
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,720
Yes, sir.

437
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,120
What's your father's name?

438
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,520
His name is Songklod Chokprasertsup.

439
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,200
He's the owner of TS Construction Group.

440
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,720
I can't allow you to see Ayla anymore.

441
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,440
Dad! What are you talking about?

442
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,640
I will not let my daughter

443
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,840
be with the child of a traitor.

444
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,000
From this moment on,

445
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,480
I'm canceling your bodyguard contract.

446
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:40,080
I'll cover all penalties and costs.
But after this,

447
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,720
stay away from my daughter.

448
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,240
Dad!

449
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,760
Ayla, go home! Now!

450
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,080
Dad, calm down!

451
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,440
You can't do this to me!

452
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,560
I won't let you leave this house

453
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,080
until you get over her.

454
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,640
Can I know the real reason?

455
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,680
What happened between the two of you?

456
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,800
Tawan's father and Ayla's father

457
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,840
are sworn enemies.

458
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:34,200
Why would we let her meddle
in our company's business?

459
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,320
I don't even know why she came back.

460
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,320
I won't break up with you.

461
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,760
And you can't give up either, okay?

462
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,800
