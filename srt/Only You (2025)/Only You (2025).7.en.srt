1
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,000
So, let's be girlfriends?

2
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,280
Tawan…

3
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,960
Yes?

4
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,440
Ayla, I want to do this properly.

5
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,760
Never hurt her feelings.

6
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,400
That day will never come, sir.

7
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,360
Tell me more about your family.

8
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,960
I'm not familiar with your surname, Tawan.

9
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,920
His name is Songklod Chokprasertsup.

10
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,640
I will not let my daughter
be with the child of a traitor.

11
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,520
<i>Stay away from my daughter.</i>

12
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,720
It took long enough
to finally meet, Ms. CEO.

13
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,440
When my secretary tried to set up
a meeting, you were always busy.

14
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,800
Have a seat.

15
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,560
You look tense.
Is there something you need help with?

16
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,320
I want to know what really happened
between you and Mr. Thana…

17
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,480
Ruengkunakorn.

18
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,160
How do you even know
that double-crossing snake?

19
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,120
Mr. Thana said the exact same thing,
word for word.

20
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,400
Don't you dare call him "Mr."
or show him any respect.

21
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,080
Can you please just tell me the truth?

22
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,520
What happened between the two of you?

23
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,120
Then you tell me first.
What's your connection to that Thana?

24
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,320
He's the father of the person I love.

25
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,160
The person you love?

26
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,480
Yes.

27
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,120
I'm in love with Ayla, his daughter.

28
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,440
Honestly, I don't really care
if two women love each other.

29
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,080
The world's moved on.

30
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,160
But if it's Thana's daughter?

31
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,080
You can forget it.

32
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,200
I will never reconcile with that man.

33
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,800
So, you'd better give up on her right now.

34
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,520
What did you do to Mr. Thana?

35
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,640
He's the one who betrayed me.

36
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,720
Back then, he and I were best friends.

37
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,520
I helped him build
T.R. Develop from the ground up.

38
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,360
But in the end,

39
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,560
he stabbed me in the back
and took everything for himself.

40
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,880
That's why I had to start my own company

41
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,280
and fight my way up to where I am today.

42
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,920
That's it.

43
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,280
Tawan, I think

44
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,320
you should forget about that family
and come back to help our company.

45
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,920
No.

46
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,560
I already have
my own company to look after.

47
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,600
But--

48
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,840
Why would we let this one
meddle in our company’s business?

49
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,080
I'm already helping you manage everything.

50
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,760
I'll be going now.

51
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,520
Tawan, wait.

52
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,320
Next time, don't bother coming back.

53
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,680
I don't even know why you came back.

54
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,760
Dad,

55
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,640
about that big project bid next month,
I've already prepared everything.

56
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,960
I promise, this time,
our company will win.

57
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,320
Good. If you're ready, that's great.

58
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,920
But are you sure you won't mess up
like you did with the last bid?

59
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,120
You don't have to worry, Dad.
I've got it all under control this time.

60
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,080
And that person you called
"this one" earlier has a name.

61
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,040
Call her by her name.

62
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,960
INCOMING CALL - TAWAN

63
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,360
So, now that you know the whole truth,
are you still angry with me?

64
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,880
Even though Songklod
is the one who betrayed me?

65
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,720
And what did we do wrong?

66
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,680
All we did was fall in love.

67
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,040
If the father is bad,
the child must be bad too.

68
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,520
You have to break up with her. Understand?

69
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,600
Have you ever actually seen
Tawan do anything bad, like her father?

70
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,200
I'll be keeping these
until you get over her.

71
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,240
As for work,
I've already called in sick for you.

72
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,880
You can't do this to me!
I won't accept it!

73
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,360
I won't let you leave this house

74
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,640
until you get over her.

75
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,200
No one is allowed in or out
without my permission.

76
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,480
Yes, sir.

77
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,000
I don't love you anymore!

78
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,040
I don't want to stay here with you!

79
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,000
Get out! I don't want
to live here anymore! I don't love you!

80
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,400
I don't love you anymore…

81
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,000
I took breakfast up to Ms. Ayla.

82
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,520
Did she eat?

83
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,880
No, sir. She didn't touch it at all.

84
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,320
She refused to eat, sir.

85
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,600
Ayla, please eat something, sweetheart.

86
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,600
Excuse me, miss.

87
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,840
I said I'm not eating! I'm not!

88
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,120
Whoa!

89
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,160
Okay, okay.
If you don't want to eat, then don't.

90
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,040
Khaotu…

91
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,520
Hey…

92
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,040
How are you holding up?

93
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,000
You can't keep
starving yourself like this.

94
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,400
What am I supposed to do?

95
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,480
Dad wants me to break up with Tawan.
But I can't. I love her.

96
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,360
You know how much I love her.

97
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,560
Yeah, I get it.
But you need to calm down first.

98
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,560
Can you tell me everything that happened?

99
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,160
Your dad explained a bit,
but I didn't really understand it.

100
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,280
My dad and Tawan's dad used to be friends.

101
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,880
They built a company together,

102
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,000
and it was doing really well.

103
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,920
Then, one day,
there was a big project bid.

104
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,360
My dad was so confident

105
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,480
his company would win,

106
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,480
but at the last minute,

107
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,560
they got undercut
by some unknown dark horse company.

108
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,200
Everyone at my dad's company was shocked.

109
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,720
No one understood what happened.

110
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,000
But then it turned out
the owner of that new company

111
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,640
was Tawan's dad.

112
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,440
And ever since then,
the two companies have been rivals.

113
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,720
So, it's basically one of those
"betrayal between best friends" dramas?

114
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,280
Exactly.

115
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,120
But think about it.
What does that have to do with us?

116
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,600
That was forever ago!

117
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,480
Why do we have to pay for it now?

118
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:16,040
And you know how hard it was for me
and Tawan to finally be together.

119
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,680
And now he wants us to break up?

120
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,320
Even if we only got together recently,

121
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,680
I've loved her for eight years.

122
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,320
Eight whole years!

123
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,520
I know. I've been listening to you
talk about her for eight years too!

124
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,600
God, what are we gonna do?

125
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,200
This is the first time
I've seen your dad so serious.

126
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,240
Usually, he gives you anything you want.

127
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,320
I don't know what to do.

128
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,880
All I know is that I miss Tawan.
What do I do?

129
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,600
I miss her…

130
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,320
I miss her so much…

131
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,840
Hey!

132
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,920
Okay, listen to me.
First thing you need to do…

133
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,160
Go take a shower.
You smell awful right now,

134
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,520
and your hair's a mess too.

135
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,480
Then eat something.

136
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,760
Hey, that's not what I meant.

137
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,200
It'll make your dad think you're
calming down.

138
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,600
Once he lets his guard down,

139
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,360
I'll get some credit for helping,

140
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,960
and I'll be able
to come and go more easily.

141
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,160
Right?

142
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,840
Right.

143
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,240
It's been ten minutes,
and she's just sitting there.

144
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,360
Just the other day,
everything was so lovey-dovey.

145
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,080
But today?
Her face is stiff, she's spaced out…

146
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,360
They definitely had a fight.

147
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,000
With Lady Boss? No way.

148
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,320
Then what else could it be?

149
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,080
She hasn't even slept properly.

150
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,120
What else would be stressing her out
if not something about Lady Boss?

151
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,720
Should we just ask?

152
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,040
Boss, did you have a fight with Lady Boss?

153
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,000
I didn't fight with Ayla.

154
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,200
But she's having problems
with Ayla's father.

155
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,040
Khaotu!

156
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,160
How's Ayla?

157
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,880
She asked me to give this to you.

158
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:09,480
<i>Tawan… I miss you so, so much.</i>

159
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,520
<i>I won't break up with you.</i>
<i>I won't stop loving you.</i>

160
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,840
<i>And you can't give up either, okay?</i>

161
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,120
<i>I love you</i>
<i>more than anything in this world.</i>

162
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,360
So…

163
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,680
your dad was actually in the wrong,
wasn't he?

164
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,360
I don't know either.

165
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,440
What exactly happened?

166
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,920
Well…

167
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,080
Tawan's dad and Ayla's dad

168
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,840
had a big conflict ages ago.

169
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,640
They're now business rivals,

170
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,200
sworn enemies, basically.

171
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,520
Ah…

172
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,960
No wonder he doesn't want them dating.

173
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,960
Exactly. He’s locking her up
like it’s something out of a movie.

174
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:26,360
He took all her devices
and won't let her leave her room.

175
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:31,040
There's a new bodyguard
stationed outside all the time.

176
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,120
Yesterday, Ayla didn't eat at all.

177
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,960
Not eating? Exactly like someone here…

178
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,520
She's eating now though, right?

179
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,800
She is. I made her.

180
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,240
She needs her strength
if she wants to keep fighting.

181
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,840
Thank you.

182
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,560
You didn't have to get involved like this.

183
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,080
It's okay, Tawan.

184
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,040
But you need to eat and rest properly too,

185
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,880
or how will you have the strength
to keep going?

186
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,280
Ayla's fighting so hard.

187
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,200
I know you are too.

188
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,319
So, what will you do next?

189
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,880
I still haven't figured out

190
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,480
how to fix this mess between the adults.

191
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,600
All I know is I really
want to see Ayla right now.

192
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,000
Should I try to find out

193
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,200
which company
sent the new bodyguard for her?

194
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,720
Maybe it'll help you somehow.

195
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,640
In the meantime, Boss,
how about eating something?

196
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,400
It'll help you think more clearly.

197
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,400
Yes. I already ordered
all your favorite dishes.

198
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,600
It's fine. I'm not hungry.

199
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,480
Even if you're not hungry,
you still need to eat.

200
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,000
Do it for Ayla.
Keep telling yourself that, Tawan.

201
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,920
Boss, please eat something first.

202
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,960
Eat up, Tawan.

203
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,600
I got the info, Boss.

204
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,440
The company Mr. Thana is using
is CN Security, owned by Mr. Chanon.

205
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,520
Can you connect me?

206
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,240
Already on the line, Boss.

207
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,200
When you're done, just knock for me.

208
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,160
Ayla.

209
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,640
Tawan!

210
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,520
How are you?

211
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,960
Not okay at all. I miss you so much.

212
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,600
I miss you too.

213
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,440
Did Khaotu find you yet?
You read my letter, right?

214
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,240
I meant every word.

215
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,640
How can Dad do this to me?
It doesn't make any sense.

216
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,120
I've loved you for eight years.
How can he just tell me to stop?

217
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,440
Tawan,

218
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,480
you're not going
to stop loving me, are you?

219
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,440
I've loved you for so long,

220
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,320
and I'm not going anywhere.

221
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,760
I miss you…

222
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,680
I want to see you.
I want to hold you so bad.

223
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,800
Don't cry, okay?

224
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,000
My strong girl, no crying.

225
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,560
The security company watching over you now
is run by my friend.

226
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,040
I'll find a way to come see you.

227
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,200
Wait for me, okay?

228
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,360
I'll wait.

229
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,920
I love you.

230
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,280
Love you too.

231
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,240
Tonight, I'm going to see Ayla.

232
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,880
But Tawan…

233
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,080
from what I heard,

234
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,360
Mr. Thana canceled all her schedules.

235
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,600
She's probably
staying home all the time now.

236
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,560
How are you going to see her?

237
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,400
- Typhoon.
- Yes, Boss?

238
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,200
Tell Chanon to clear the way.

239
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,480
Tonight, I'm going to her house.

240
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,680
That's more like it, Boss!

241
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,920
Got it.

242
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,400
I'll prep all the gear right now.

243
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,760
And I'll email you
the house layout right away.

244
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,800
And me? What can I do?

245
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,760
Should I be the lookout?

246
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,760
- Khaotu.
- Yes?

247
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,760
Just don't accidentally
leak this to Mr. Thana.

248
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,200
Oh…

249
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,560
Roger that!

250
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,640
Tawan…

251
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,640
Don't cry anymore.

252
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,480
I'm here now.

253
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,560
Don't cry,

254
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,640
my good girl.

255
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,560
You know…

256
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,120
I missed you so much,
I couldn't do anything.

257
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,320
And I was so scared.

258
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,320
Scared I'd never see you again.

259
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,640
You don't have to be scared anymore.

260
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,240
I'm here now.

261
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,800
It's okay.

262
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,680
When Khaotu said you were coming,
I honestly thought she was just bluffing.

263
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,040
With so many guards,
how could anyone get in?

264
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,760
The guards…

265
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,240
Could they get in here?

266
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,160
Don't worry.

267
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,760
The team outside is basically my team now.

268
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,160
No need to worry at all.

269
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,920
Your team?

270
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,040
Yeah.

271
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,880
Who are you, really?

272
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,120
I'm your girlfriend.

273
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,800
My girlfriend is amazing.

274
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,080
Climbing up here even though it's so high.

275
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,320
Weren't you scared of falling?

276
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,120
No.

277
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,040
My heart is here.

278
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,880
No matter how high, I'm not afraid.

279
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,840
My love.

280
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,320
Love you the most.

281
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,920
I'm your girl now, okay?

282
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,480
You are…

283
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,880
my one and only.

284
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,440
Of course, I have to be the only one.

285
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,520
Try having more,

286
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,360
and I'll kill you!

287
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,480
So scary…
I'm terrified! Please don't do that.

288
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,000
Ayla.

289
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,960
Huh?

290
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,960
I have to go now.

291
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,920
I don't want you to leave.

292
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,840
Should I just run away with you?

293
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,320
Or maybe…

294
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,840
you could just hide here in my room.

295
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,720
I can keep Dad from coming in, you know.

296
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,320
That wouldn't be good.

297
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,440
Khaotu and the team outside
would get in trouble.

298
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,800
I promise,

299
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,920
I'll come see you every night.

300
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,840
Promise.

301
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,720
Promise.

302
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,080
I'll wait for you.

303
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,320
Thank you.

304
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,680
Use this phone only when necessary, okay?

305
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,640
Don't let anyone find out.

306
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,120
I love you, Ayla.

307
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,480
I just wanted to remind you.

308
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,600
So, whenever you feel down,

309
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,040
you'll remember
that I'm not going anywhere.

310
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,320
Okay.

311
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,640
I'll hang in there

312
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,360
until Dad finally lets us be together.

313
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,840
This way, please.

314
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,160
You're gonna make
the whole house running here!

315
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,960
What happened next?

316
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,800
So?

317
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,440
So?

318
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,040
Well, you know.

319
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,040
Know what?

320
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,360
- Well…
- Well?

321
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,000
We became each other's completely.

322
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,800
- Gosh! Where's my pillow?
- Go get it!

323
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,080
I can't handle this! I'm dying over here!

324
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,680
You were screaming too!

325
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,160
I'm blushing so hard, I might pass out!

326
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,280
I'm exhausted…

327
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,520
You look so stupidly happy right now.

328
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:15,320
I'm so excited and so jealous,
I could explode!

329
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,800
Can you even handle this, Khaotu?

330
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,440
I don't think so.

331
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,639
What?

332
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:34,080
Just opening it smells amazing.

333
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,960
Amazing…

334
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,440
You're taking forever!

335
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,400
She came back in the morning?

336
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,440
Yeah.

337
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,440
So? What happened?

338
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,280
Boss looked really happy.

339
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,480
That's it?

340
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,719
Yeah, that's it.

341
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,560
Boss is happy. Isn't that enough?

342
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,200
I guess that's better than seeing
that stressed-out face all day.

343
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,400
Are you gonna tell us,
or do we have to drag it out of you?

344
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,080
Are you?

345
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,840
Not telling.

346
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,760
- Say it or not?
- Not saying!

347
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,320
Let's see what happens first.

348
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,080
You suffocating
or you finally spilling the story.

349
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,120
Hello? Ayla? Are you okay?

350
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,880
I'm fine…

351
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,520
Just missing you, so I called.

352
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,680
I thought something happened.

353
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,920
You gave me this phone

354
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,840
and said to call only when it's necessary.

355
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,680
This is necessary.
I needed to hear your voice.

356
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,160
You're so cheeky.

357
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,000
I missed you too.

358
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,280
And I've been thinking…

359
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,400
about last night too.

360
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,080
Stop teasing me!

361
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,160
Have you eaten yet?

362
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,440
I miss you so much.

363
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,120
I see.

364
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,040
I'm leaving now.

365
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,480
Love you, bestie.

366
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,560
Love you too.

367
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,760
You can send it in now.

368
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,160
The urgent work.

369
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,360
Done.

370
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,960
Did you fall asleep?

371
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,320
Yeah.

372
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,280
Wake up…

373
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,480
Just a bit more.

374
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,680
I have to go now.

375
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,000
Can't you stay?

376
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,720
I can't. Come on.

377
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,560
I'm leaving now.

378
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,440
<i>I don't know what the future holds,</i>

379
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,240
<i>but my love for you</i>

380
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,760
will never change.

381
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,800
And we'll never
let go of each other's hands.

382
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,400
At least, if anything happens,
you'll know how to protect yourself.

383
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,240
I just wish
I could freeze time right here,

384
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,160
<i>just the two of us.</i>

385
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,240
<i>If you're still in contact with Tawan,</i>

386
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,800
I'll destroy everything with my own hands.

387
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,080
