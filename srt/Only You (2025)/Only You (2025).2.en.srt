1
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,920
Thank you so much for helping me today.

2
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,560
Her name's Tawan. She's in Grade 12.

3
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,520
The school's best kendo athlete.

4
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,120
No!

5
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,720
Tawan!

6
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,000
Don't ever forget who you are.

7
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,880
Keep chasing your dreams.

8
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,480
I'll always be rooting for you.

9
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,360
She didn't tell you?

10
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,160
She's transferred schools.

11
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,960
And when that day comes,

12
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,600
you'll see me again.

13
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,400
And I'm going to get you back, Tawan.

14
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,240
Hi, everyone. It's Ayla!

15
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,040
Today, I'll be unboxing
some gifts from my fans.

16
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,920
Let's start with the first one.

17
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,120
Oh my God.

18
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,280
You guys, it's a collectible!

19
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,920
AYLA

20
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,600
Wait!

21
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,080
This box has a rose in it too.

22
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,040
Let's take a closer look.

23
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,720
AYLA

24
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,520
WHAT HAPPENED?

25
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,840
Guys…

26
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,520
I think the staff are messing with me.

27
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,440
Must be Halloween coming up soon.

28
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,360
Right.

29
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,000
I don't want an apology.

30
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,920
I want to know where Ayla's safety stands.

31
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,720
How did your staff
let someone like that get through?

32
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,960
Wasn't there any kind of screening?

33
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,000
We're currently looking into

34
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,280
how that box ended up
mixed in with Ayla's fan gifts.

35
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,920
The staff organizing them said
they'd never seen that box before.

36
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,000
So, basically,

37
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,160
anyone can just walk into your studio?

38
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,800
Anyone can stroll into your company

39
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,560
whenever they want?

40
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,840
No, that's not the case.

41
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,920
We have security stationed at all times.

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,560
Clearly not enough.

43
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,560
This isn't the first time
something's happened to Ayla.

44
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,120
Your president promised me

45
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,920
her safety would always come first.

46
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,160
That's the only reason
I let her sign with your label.

47
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,080
Mr. Thana,

48
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,560
we'll assign extra security
to Ayla immediately.

49
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,080
I don't want it.

50
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,640
I no longer trust your company.

51
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,440
Dad.

52
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,200
I'll find a personal bodyguard
for my daughter myself.

53
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,840
That's it.

54
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,880
Dad.

55
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,840
You don't have to be mad.
Nothing really happened.

56
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,680
I was just a little shaken.

57
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,760
This isn't a joke.

58
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,120
You've already received
too many disturbing gifts.

59
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,560
Get me a list and profiles
of bodyguard agencies.

60
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,960
I'm choosing one
for my daughter personally.

61
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,720
Dad, actually,

62
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,360
I know one agency.

63
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,640
They've got a great track record.

64
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,760
They protect international artists

65
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,640
and even global leaders
when they're in Thailand.

66
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,040
Quite impressive. Want to check them out?

67
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,160
Stay back!

68
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,360
Clear!

69
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,240
Clear!

70
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,920
Keep down!

71
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,040
Go!

72
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,720
Mission complete!

73
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,280
You were three minutes late.

74
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,600
Come on, boss.

75
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,960
It's Tim's fault. He wouldn't go down.
Wasted a ton of ammo.

76
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,200
Or maybe your skills are slipping?
Missing your shots?

77
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,720
I hit him, okay? Just grazed him.

78
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,920
At least the mission was a success.

79
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,720
But does anyone know what went wrong
that cost us those three minutes?

80
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,720
My side and Chanya's
hit all targets, boss.

81
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,080
Yeah, but the hostage got injured.

82
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,520
What happened? What's wrong with your leg?

83
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,840
I rushed down the stairs
and twisted my ankle.

84
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,440
Oh…

85
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:33,000
That explains it. I noticed
she slowed down right after that.

86
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,760
Sorry about that.

87
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,120
Go ice it right away.

88
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,680
Nana, take care of it.

89
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,760
Yes, boss. This way, please.

90
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,560
Boss, what did I mess up on?

91
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,160
How did Tim manage to fight back?

92
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,000
Instead of disarming
your opponent quickly,

93
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,520
you hesitated.
Gave him an opening to counter.

94
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,280
When did he even have a chance?

95
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,680
Tim.

96
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,360
Boss, a new assignment came in
via email a minute ago.

97
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,200
Chanya, help Nana handle it.

98
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,480
On it, boss.

99
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,880
Class C…

100
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,840
PERSONAL PROFILE

101
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,320
EXECUTIVE PROTECTION

102
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,880
Still not quite right.

103
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,200
Not quite right yet.

104
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,280
PERSONAL PROFILE

105
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,640
This set isn't it either.
Are there more to choose from?

106
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,360
Here.

107
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,640
Are there any more options?

108
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,360
Right.

109
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,520
But the next batch is Class A.

110
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,720
Then this better be it.

111
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,880
PERSONAL PROFILE

112
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,560
Still not feeling it.

113
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,800
May I?

114
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,120
Don't tell me…

115
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,480
Yup. No one has been picked.

116
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,800
What do we do now?

117
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,040
None of them made the VIP cut?

118
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,440
Not even Class A?

119
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,600
That's right, boss.

120
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,720
That's why Chanya's sulking right now.

121
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,920
Nana,

122
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,520
set up a meeting with the VIP.
I'll talk to her myself.

123
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,560
Got it, boss.

124
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,680
MUTUAL TERMINATION OF EMPLOYEE AGREEMENT

125
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:39,240
Is that really
all your agency has to offer?

126
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,680
From what I've heard,

127
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,640
from Class C to Class A,

128
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,120
none of our bodyguards
meet your VIP's criteria.

129
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,360
So, we'll take full responsibility

130
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,760
and cancel the contract.

131
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,000
I don't think we'll be needing
a new agency after all, Dad.

132
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,240
Then,

133
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,160
how are you going to have a bodyguard?

134
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,600
You didn't choose anyone.

135
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,640
I've made my choice.

136
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,400
Ms. Rawee, would you be my bodyguard?

137
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,040
Or is Ms. Bodyguard too scared
to take care of me?

138
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,360
If that's what Ms. Ayla wants,

139
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,400
our company is happy
to provide the service.

140
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,920
And I'm happy

141
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,560
to be taken care of by someone top-tier.

142
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,560
How about starting tomorrow?

143
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,800
Well,

144
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,320
don't you think we should hire
two or three bodyguards instead?

145
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,320
One doesn’t seem like enough.

146
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,320
One's all I need.

147
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,920
Pleasure working with you,

148
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,080
Ms. Bodyguard.

149
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,320
Let's go.

150
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,360
See? Told you. That's my boss!

151
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,040
Handled the VIP like it was nothing.

152
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,400
No issues, right?

153
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,240
She canceled the old deal herself,
and we didn't lose anything, right?

154
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,720
Let's discuss this at the office.

155
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,800
TERMINATION LETTER

156
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,640
Uh… Boss? The termination letter
hasn't been signed.

157
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,480
What? Why--

158
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,600
See you tomorrow,

159
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,000
Tawan.

160
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,080
She didn't cancel the contract…

161
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,480
See you tomorrow…

162
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,240
So, we got the job?

163
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,680
- Boss!
- So, this means--

164
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,800
Quiet.

165
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,040
We'll talk at the office.

166
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,960
She's a famous idol!

167
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,160
You've never seen her on TV?

168
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,600
Yes?

169
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,360
She waved!

170
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,200
I'm going after her.

171
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,960
- Wait. Is she leaving?
- Let's go!

172
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,080
Oh?

173
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,680
Who left the door open?

174
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,720
INDIVIDUALS RELATED TO THE VIP

175
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,440
MISS CHANITTHA NAMWONG
"KAEW" - MAID

176
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,600
Don't you all have something to do?

177
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,000
No, ma'am.

178
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,040
Mission briefing, please!

179
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,120
You saw the VIP, didn't you?

180
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,160
That's the job. Simple as that.

181
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,360
But you don't usually take celebrity gigs.

182
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,320
I was the only one left. The VIP
made her choice. Was I supposed to say no?

183
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,520
Does she know you or something?

184
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,680
She called you "Tawan".

185
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,000
Right. If we knew you two had a history,

186
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,360
I'd have had you speak with her
from the start.

187
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,040
We met a long time ago.

188
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,640
We're not close.

189
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,240
I think she wants to be.

190
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,360
That sweet smile she gave you…

191
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,320
Boss did this for the company.
Right, Nana?

192
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,040
Absolutely.

193
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,360
Boss, Ms. Ayla is really pretty, you know?

194
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,400
Could I maybe…

195
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,319
get her autograph?

196
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:10,240
Or maybe not.

197
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,839
I mean, she's seriously beautiful.

198
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,480
Gorgeous, sexy, can sing and dance…

199
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,880
No wonder she's got stalkers.

200
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,960
Boss,

201
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,359
I've sent you all of Ms. Ayla's songs,

202
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,880
just in case it helps when talking to her.

203
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,840
Why though?

204
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,160
Why does our boss
need to listen to her music?

205
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,560
We're bodyguards, not her fans!

206
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,760
- Exactly!
- Oh, come on--

207
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,800
It's fine.

208
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,480
Good to have background info.

209
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,160
Mr. Teru Teru Bōzu…

210
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,040
Do you think
Tawan's still as sweet as before?

211
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,440
Do you think she has someone?

212
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,320
But she's not wearing a ring on
either hand. So, maybe she's still single.

213
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,840
Right?

214
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,040
Ms. Rawee, would you be my bodyguard?

215
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,400
Morning, Tawan.

216
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,200
Good morning, Ms. Ayla.

217
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,920
Can I ask something?

218
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,120
Of course.

219
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,560
If it's within my ability,
I'd be happy to.

220
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,200
Could you talk to me

221
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,400
a little more casually?
This feels way too formal.

222
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,160
Oh, and one more thing.

223
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,800
I don't really like people gossiping about

224
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,400
how I have a personal bodyguard
following me around all the time.

225
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,520
So…

226
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,800
You'd like me to dress in plain clothes?

227
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,880
Uh-huh.

228
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,720
Understood.

229
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,240
Wow…

230
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,440
So professional. No wonder you're S-rank.

231
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,120
We also have some additional rules

232
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,880
for you, Ms. Ayla.

233
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,560
RULE NO. 3

234
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,160
The last one…

235
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,120
"You must stay within visual range

236
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,360
of your bodyguard at all times."

237
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,240
Visual range?

238
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,680
And what exactly is "visual range"?

239
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,120
Like this?

240
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,760
Or maybe this?

241
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,560
Or this?

242
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,280
Can you see me now?

243
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,920
Please sign to acknowledge the rules.

244
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,800
Got a pen?

245
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,680
THE PRINCIPAL

246
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,040
DANCE AND PERFORMANCE CLUB

247
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,440
Super pinky promise!

248
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,280
DANCE AND PERFORMANCE CLUB

249
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,240
Super pinky promise.

250
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,200
THE BODYGUARD

251
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,520
I'll go put this away,

252
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,440
then we can head to the office.

253
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,000
Yes, Ms. Ayla.

254
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,800
Just Ayla.

255
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,960
Call me Ayla, like before?

256
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,800
I don't think that would be appropriate,
Ms. Ayla.

257
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,880
Rule 27.

258
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,600
Follow the VIP's instructions,
unless it's life-threatening.

259
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:23,200
Calling me Ayla isn't exactly
life-threatening, right, Tawan?

260
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,040
Alright then.

261
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,440
Ayla.

262
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,760
Hello, Ayla!

263
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,080
Hello!

264
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,000
Yam, how are you?

265
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,440
I'm great.

266
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,720
Missed you!

267
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,160
See you later.

268
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,120
Goodbye.

269
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,320
Go ahead.

270
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,080
Hello, boss?

271
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,080
What is it, Chanya?

272
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,720
Just a moment.

273
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,520
Huh?

274
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,680
Is everything alright?

275
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,760
Excuse me. Can you turn around for a sec?

276
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,400
Try posing like this.

277
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,440
And can you do a voice like this?

278
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,800
Well, would you be interested
in auditioning tomorrow?

279
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,720
No, thank you.

280
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,800
Why not?

281
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,800
You're so pretty, great figure.

282
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,920
Perfect for being an artist.

283
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,960
If it's about singing,

284
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,000
don't worry, we can train you.

285
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:47,040
I'm here to look after Ms. Ayla.

286
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,040
Wait, did we hire someone to guard Ayla?

287
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,600
Why didn't I know?

288
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,480
I don't think so.
I'll have to check with Tik.

289
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,440
Tell Tik to find someone else.

290
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,440
As for this beautiful lady,

291
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,120
I'm signing her to debut.

292
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,680
Huh? Debut?

293
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,920
Boss.

294
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,240
No way.

295
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,400
This gorgeous lady
is my personal bodyguard.

296
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,120
Her name is Rawee.

297
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,680
Bodyguard?

298
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,520
Oh, I don't mind!

299
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,320
Once she debuts and becomes famous,

300
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,440
I'll give you a share
of the profits, no problem.

301
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,720
Please? She's stunning.

302
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,280
Sorry, but…

303
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,680
I'm kind of possessive over this one.

304
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,200
Well, understandable.

305
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,680
She really is stunning.

306
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,880
I just finished recording a new rap verse.
Wanna come listen?

307
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,960
Let's go.

308
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,640
- I really put my heart into it.
- Okay, fine.

309
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,080
Oh, and I still need to talk about
that bloody doll.

310
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,920
What happened with that, anyway?

311
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,440
What is it, Chanya?

312
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,680
Chanya!

313
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,000
Yes, boss.

314
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,760
I've got a report.

315
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:19,080
We got info on the bloody cloth doll.

316
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,160
There were fingerprints inside the box,

317
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,840
and Nana's checking them now.

318
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,040
As for the blood,

319
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,840
it's not human.

320
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,800
It's animal blood. Nothing dangerous.

321
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,720
If you get any more details,
just send them to my email.

322
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,200
Got it. Oh, boss.

323
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,000
How's work…

324
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,680
going?

325
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:55,320
Nothing much.
Just haven't signed off on the bonus yet.

326
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,280
What? The bonus?

327
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,360
Boss, I didn't want to ask, really.

328
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,400
Typhoon and Nana made me do it!

329
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,120
I would never…

330
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,240
Chanya, stop!

331
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,880
Stop talking. Quiet!

332
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,840
- I didn't say anything, boss!
- Hey!

333
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,560
I'm hanging up.

334
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,360
- Hello! Hi!
- So pretty! Are you tired?

335
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,360
Not tired at all. Are you guys tired?

336
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,280
We're fine!

337
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,600
Thanks so much for coming today!

338
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,720
- Make sure you rest up!
- You too!

339
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,800
Bye-bye!

340
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,720
Bye…

341
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,120
Jam, can we head
to the Sathorn house today?

342
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,880
Yes, ma'am.

343
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,480
The Sathorn house?

344
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,240
Yeah, I have two houses.

345
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,600
That one's for when I work late.

346
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,840
It's more convenient.

347
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,920
You live there alone?

348
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,720
Yup, all by myself.

349
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,480
But don't worry.

350
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,560
It's been through every safety check
approved by Mr. Thana.

351
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,160
Dad handpicked it himself.

352
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,280
Rejected at least ten
before settling on this one.

353
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,440
Back then, I took him to so many places.
He didn't like a single one.

354
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,880
"This one's too big."
"That one's too small."

355
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,640
"That one had a tiny kitchen.
What if Ayla tripped?"

356
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,920
When we finally got this place,
it was like fireworks went off.

357
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,800
He really cares about you.

358
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,000
Yeah. It's just me and my dad, you know?

359
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,520
He's super protective.

360
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,280
Can I get out now?

361
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,280
Please.

362
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,640
Come on in.

363
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,800
Oops.

364
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,440
I'm starving.

365
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:22,080
Want to make something simple to eat?

366
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,920
You know how to cook?

367
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,000
If I said yes, would you believe me?

368
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,760
Based on the file I read,

369
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,520
you don't know how to cook.

370
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,719
The file is pretty accurate.

371
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,240
There's literally nothing to eat.

372
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,840
Usually, I just order delivery.

373
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,320
It's easy.

374
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,200
I'll make egg fried rice.

375
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,080
Think you can handle that?

376
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,000
Done.

377
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,640
That looks so good!

378
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,280
Wanna eat now?

379
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,640
Careful. It's hot.

380
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,120
I didn't know

381
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,160
egg fried rice with chili sauce
could taste this good.

382
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,640
Where did you learn this?
It's just a few ingredients, right?

383
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:59,160
It's my survival recipe.

384
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,440
But I don't think it's that good.

385
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,720
No, it is.

386
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,240
I could eat the whole pan.

387
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,360
Then go ahead. Eat lots.

388
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,680
Thank you

389
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,680
for making this for me.

390
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,800
You'll cook for me again sometime, right?

391
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,800
I should head out now.

392
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,960
I'll pick you up here tomorrow
at 8 a.m., okay?

393
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,720
Got it.

394
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,560
See you then.

395
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,000
Thank you.

396
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,240
And if anything seems off,
call me anytime.

397
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,040
Will do.

398
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,800
Is there an emergency?

399
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,680
Whoa, you picked up so fast.

400
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,520
I don't think it even rang once.

401
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,960
So, no emergency?

402
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,520
There is. That's why
I'm calling to report it.

403
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,600
What is it?

404
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,800
I can't sleep. What should I do?

405
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,640
Can't sleep?

406
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,160
Can't sleep…

407
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,680
And what would you like me
to do about that?

408
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,360
Can you

409
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,640
talk to me for a bit?

410
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,560
Maybe if we keep talking,
I'll start to feel sleepy.

411
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,480
Sure.

412
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:48,400
What do you want to talk about?

413
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,440
Then…

414
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,360
Can I tell you about myself?

415
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,120
If it's about you,

416
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,160
I already know everything.

417
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,040
Tawan!

418
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,240
Go ahead.

419
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,960
Even if I've heard it all,
I don't mind listening again.

420
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:30,160
You know, back then,
I was so nervous about the audition.

421
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,120
That year, the competition was insane.

422
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,520
The day before the final round,
I still remember,

423
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:38,320
I had muscle inflammation.
Dad didn't want me to compete.

424
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,760
I had to beg him in tears,
practically crying blood.

425
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,600
Almost chased my dream
and lost my home all in one go.

426
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:52,000
When I was a trainee,
I trained like crazy.

427
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,160
At least

428
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,720
eight hours a day, singing, dancing.

429
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,440
And that's not even counting acting.

430
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,840
And all the extra practice I had to do
on my own because I wasn't good enough.

431
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,800
It was brutal.

432
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,960
I only got a few hours of sleep a day.

433
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:11,400
And that's not even the whole story!
I've got a lot more to tell.

434
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,320
The journey of a people's idol!

435
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,640
Tawan!

436
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,960
What happened?

437
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,400
Power outage. Don't hang up, okay?

438
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,560
The lights just went out.

439
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,440
Tawan, the lights are back.

440
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,880
By the way,
I want to go to an amusement park.

441
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:57,080
Ever since I told you I wanted to go,

442
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,000
I haven't gone yet. Can you believe that?

443
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,720
- Tawan!
- Yes?

444
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:15,000
I'm almost at the front door.
I don't see anyone outside though.

445
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,760
Ayla, listen to me. Be careful.

446
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,360
Okay.

447
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,280
Approach slowly.

448
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,680
If you see anything, scream.

449
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,320
I'm at the door now.

450
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,400
Stay alert.

451
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,760
Move slowly.

452
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,280
Tawan!

453
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:48,520
Morning. I brought congee.

454
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,920
How did you know

455
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,000
I love congee with Chinese crullers?

456
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,040
I told you, I have all your info.

457
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,520
No way. That's not in the files.

458
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,320
There's this girl who chattered non-stop
about what she liked to eat

459
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,160
around 4 a.m.

460
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,520
This place sells good congee,

461
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:36,160
so I bought it and came straight here.

462
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,720
You know what?
I think we both need caffeine now.

463
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:57,000
This time, it's on me,
since you bought me breakfast. Deal?

464
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,280
Ayla!

465
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:32,800
Tawan works like this.
won't her lover get mad?

466
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,040
This goes against protocol, you know.
Is this really okay?

467
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,720
Something smells fishy.

468
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,320
Right now, your safety is my duty

469
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,160
and my responsibility.

470
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,720
But if you're not happy
with the way I'm doing things,

471
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,640
I'm willing to step down.

472
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,400
