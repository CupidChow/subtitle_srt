1
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,120
But Mek is still Mek.

2
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,840
I just can't put any hope in him.

3
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,440
Who's the frontrunner
for this bidding round?

4
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,240
I don't care what tricks
you're planning to use.

5
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,640
But I will win this bid.

6
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,880
Did you see the photo I sent?

7
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,760
The choice is yours, Mr. Thana.

8
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,960
Pull us out of the bidding. Now.

9
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,200
Tawan!

10
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
Put the gun down.

11
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,320
You laid a hand on my woman.

12
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,039
Tawan! Stop, stop!

13
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,400
Ayla.

14
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,080
I'm okay.

15
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,560
Thank you, Tawan.

16
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,720
If it weren't for you,

17
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,760
who knows what would've happened to Ayla.

18
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,120
I'm willing to protect her.

19
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,200
For everyone's safety,

20
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,160
may I add more of my team
to look after you and Ayla?

21
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,680
Of course. Please do.

22
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,520
Chanya.

23
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,640
Understood, Boss.

24
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,760
Ayla, go on inside.

25
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,040
You need to go to the hospital
right after, okay?

26
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,360
-Boss!
-Boss!

27
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,000
-Let's go.
-Boss.

28
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,520
Get in the car, Boss.

29
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,960
Careful, Boss.

30
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,120
It's all taken care of.

31
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,240
Luckily, the bullet only grazed her.

32
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,240
But she did lose a lot of blood.

33
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,240
I've given her supplements.

34
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,640
Thank you so much, Doctor.

35
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,920
Hello, Nana? How's Tawan?

36
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,480
She's safe.

37
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,360
The medicine's taken effect,
and she's asleep now.

38
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,600
And what hospital is she at?

39
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,120
Well…

40
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,760
Nana…

41
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,040
At the office.

42
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,120
But don't worry.

43
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,760
The doctor's already checked on her.

44
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,880
It was just a graze.
Nothing lodged inside.

45
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,480
If anything happens,

46
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,680
you can call me anytime, 24 hours.

47
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,960
I will.

48
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,120
Nana, please don't get annoyed with me.

49
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,840
How could I ever be annoyed
at the woman Boss loves most?

50
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,480
I just…

51
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,600
I'm really worried about her.
But I don't know what to do.

52
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,200
I can't even be by her side
when I want to.

53
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,720
I can't do anything.

54
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,160
I feel like I'm a terrible girlfriend.

55
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,680
Want some advice from me?

56
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,160
If it were me,

57
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,480
and there was a woman I loved,

58
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,120
she wouldn't need to protect me at all.

59
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,160
Just being there,
ready to hold my hand when I fall,

60
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,880
to help me through…

61
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,520
That alone would be happiness enough.

62
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,400
Think about it, Ms. Ayla.

63
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,200
Love yourself first,
then, when you're strong,

64
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,920
you can go back and love her fully,
so that you'll be loved in return.

65
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,720
Stay calm. You have to stay calm.

66
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,000
Being the girlfriend of a bodyguard
means you need to stay calm.

67
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,000
Okay.

68
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,040
I'll stay calm.

69
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,840
Thank you, Nana.

70
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,840
OUR LITTLE SECRET, OKAY?
I DON'T WANT TO DIE

71
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,720
Dad.

72
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,000
Go get dressed, sweetheart.

73
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm taking you to see Tawan.

74
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,480
Dad… Thank you…

75
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,560
I love you.

76
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,680
Are you getting up?

77
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,520
How's your wound? Still hurting?

78
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,320
It's nothing.

79
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,040
But…

80
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,000
how did you get here?

81
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,240
Dad dropped me off.

82
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,120
He finally let me come take care of you.

83
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,840
Want some water?
I'll get it for you. Just a sec.

84
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,240
No need. I'm not thirsty.

85
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,600
Not an option. You need to drink water--

86
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,120
Or eat something!

87
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,680
I have rice porridge.
Hold on. I'll get it.

88
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,840
Wait…

89
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,160
Did you…

90
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,000
make it…

91
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,320
or buy it?

92
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,200
Made it myself.

93
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,760
Here.

94
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,720
It's good!

95
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,560
Good, right?

96
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,440
Because I bought it.

97
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,800
I've never had porridge this good before.

98
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,640
For me?

99
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,920
Try some.

100
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,360
Since you got sick,

101
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,600
you've gotten so sweet, huh?

102
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,240
Sweet, am I?

103
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,640
Sweet only for you.

104
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,400
Is that true?

105
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,560
Anyway, I should put this bowl away.

106
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,280
Time for your medicine.

107
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,640
Not going to feed me?

108
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,600
I have to feed you medicine too?

109
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,720
I'm hurt.

110
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,480
No strength left.

111
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,560
You'll taste the bitterness.

112
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,840
Let me put the bowl away first.

113
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,720
I haven't finished the medicine.

114
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,400
You have. There's nothing left.

115
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,280
There is. This one.

116
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,000
The elixir of life.

117
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,680
All she did was bring porridge.

118
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,680
We shouldn't be nosy
about the Boss' stuff, right?

119
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,400
But I kind of am.

120
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,520
How long now?

121
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,800
It's been a while now.

122
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,880
Geez!

123
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,960
What are you two sneaking around for, huh?

124
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,640
It hurts?

125
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,760
Of course, it hurts!
You always hit us hardest.

126
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,120
Ugh, it rattled my brain.

127
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,720
Straight to my cerebellum.

128
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,000
-Can't function.
-Oh, stop it.

129
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,120
You're overreacting.

130
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,920
You two are built like tanks.
You can't feel a thing.

131
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,080
It did hurt though.

132
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,600
Got a bump.

133
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,000
So…

134
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:03,000
What are you doing here?
You look suspicious.

135
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,200
Well…

136
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,520
-What?
-Ms. Ayla

137
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,360
went up with porridge.
But it's been a while.

138
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,440
Yeah, a while.

139
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,200
Long enough for us to worry.

140
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,920
-And?
-And…

141
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,840
And we're their subordinates.
Of course, we worry about Boss.

142
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,240
What if she needs help or something?

143
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,000
That's it.

144
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,760
Nonsense. If she needs something,
don't you think she'll call?

145
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,000
Nest two, report.

146
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,600
Wait up!

147
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,400
No one's allowed
up to the Eagle's Nest. Repeat.

148
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,320
Absolutely no entry.

149
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,360
Copy that.

150
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,720
-Whoa!
-Whoa! What?

151
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,920
What are you even hanging around for?

152
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,800
Go! Go back to work.

153
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,040
If they want to sweet-talk
each other, let them.

154
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,240
With care like that, Boss
will be back on her feet in no time.

155
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,680
Go on.

156
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,760
-We're worried.
-Okay, okay.

157
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,119
Just worried.

158
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,880
Now what are you doing, huh?

159
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,440
Ayla.

160
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,360
Oh!

161
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,960
Why are you getting up?

162
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,400
Lie down properly.

163
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,680
You're looking much better today.
Everythings seems normal.

164
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,560
Any headaches or body aches?

165
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,960
None.

166
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,240
Right this way, please.

167
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,760
Thank you.

168
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,200
Good job!

169
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,520
Good job, Boss.

170
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,400
CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD DIRECTORS

171
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,520
A pleasure working with you.

172
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,760
Don't worry, I'll see this project through
to the best of my ability.

173
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,080
Of course.

174
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,320
The bidding was handled well.

175
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
The board should be satisfied.

176
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,840
Good job.

177
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,960
You can count on me, Dad.

178
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,600
From now on, I won't let you down again.

179
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,600
See? When you give something

180
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,200
your full focus and effort,

181
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,640
the results always follow.

182
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,160
Yes.

183
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,440
Dad, how about we celebrate tonight?

184
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,280
Just you and me.

185
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,840
I'll book a place right now.

186
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,520
Mek.

187
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,200
For everything, I'm sorry.

188
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,480
All this time,
I never trusted or believed in you.

189
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,480
Sometimes I even spoke harshly.

190
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,360
It's alright, Dad.
You don't need to worry about me.

191
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,120
Keep working hard.

192
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,440
Show the board what you can do.

193
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,720
At the end of the year, I'm making you
vice president of our company.

194
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,200
You mean it, Dad?

195
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,760
Thank you, Dad.

196
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,000
I'll give it everything I've got.

197
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,800
Just wait and see.

198
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,440
Thank you.

199
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,440
Tonight, close up the bar early.

200
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,600
After dinner with my father,

201
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,600
I'll come by to celebrate
with everyone. Special occasion.

202
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,120
Of course.

203
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,280
And hey, no sneaking off before sunrise!

204
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,360
What?

205
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,920
Oh.

206
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,120
Alright, see you then.

207
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,960
Mr. Mek.

208
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm hanging up now.

209
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,160
You scared the hell out of me.

210
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,320
Here to collect your reward, huh?

211
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,000
No problem. You did well this time.

212
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,600
SUCCESSFUL TRANSFER
1,000,000 BAHT

213
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,040
Done.

214
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,840
Thank you, sir.

215
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,000
Hey. Not even going to check?
That's a hefty sum.

216
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,400
No need, sir.

217
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,240
Anything else?

218
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,400
No, nothing else.

219
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,400
Then go.

220
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,320
Yes, sir.

221
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,400
Get going.

222
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,520
The number you've dialed
cannot be connected at this time.

223
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,040
Why can't I get through?

224
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,640
Keep your eyes on everyone
in the Chokprasertsap family.

225
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,440
That's your old family name, isn't it?

226
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,840
Send word to Mr. Thana.
Tell him to lie low.

227
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,040
I don't want them to know they failed.

228
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,560
At a time like this,
we can't trust anyone.

229
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,160
Boss.

230
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,600
And if what you're thinking
turns out to be true,

231
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,920
what will you do?

232
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,360
Then it'll be to the death.

233
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,400
I don't think things
will get that bad, Boss.

234
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,520
Let's hope not.

235
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,520
I'd hate to despise my own blood.

236
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,760
T.S. CONSTRUCTION WINS MAJOR BID
MULTI-BILLION REAL ESTATE PROJECT SECURED

237
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,880
Documents from T.S. Construction
you left downstairs.

238
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,720
T.S. Construction sent over
some additional files, Boss.

239
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,440
‎ANNUAL MEETING SUMMARY 2025
‎ANNUAL MEETING SUMMARY 2018-2020

240
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,720
Couldn't sleep?

241
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,120
No.

242
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,720
Must've napped too much during the day.

243
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,280
What about you?

244
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,280
Why are you up?

245
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,760
Woke up and you weren't there,

246
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,280
so I came looking.

247
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,520
What's wrong? You look tense.

248
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,240
No. Nothing.

249
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,320
Just worried.

250
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,360
Worried?

251
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,000
About what?

252
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,040
Don't be.

253
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,520
Rest up first, okay?

254
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,120
Honestly, I'm already feeling much better.

255
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,920
Or…

256
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,440
Should I…

257
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,160
-carry…
-No, no!

258
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,200
No way!

259
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,200
You'll tear your stitches.

260
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,920
Fine.

261
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,280
I won't be stubborn with my girl.

262
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:20,360
Good. You've earned Best Girlfriend award.

263
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,120
Now, come on. Back to bed.

264
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,440
Alright, alright.

265
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,200
Close your eyes.

266
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,200
Yes, ma'am.

267
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,320
Eyes closed means mind shut too.

268
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,320
No more thinking, okay?

269
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,600
Roger that.

270
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,720
Then why are your eyes open?

271
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,720
Sleep.

272
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,440
What is it? Three, four…

273
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,440
Don't get confused. Slide over.

274
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,920
One, two, three!

275
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,040
What was that?

276
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,160
You won?

277
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,320
Yay!

278
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,800
Victory!

279
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,240
You won!

280
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,720
Haven't played like this in a long time.

281
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,200
You're drenched. Tired?

282
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,600
Just a little. It was fun though.

283
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,480
Thank you.

284
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,840
Boss Lady.

285
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,080
The way you were playing just now--

286
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,160
Wait, what did you just call me?

287
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,520
Boss Lady.

288
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,000
Please don't mind him, Ms. Ayla.

289
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,280
His mouth runs ahead of his brain.

290
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,800
Exactly, he always blabs.

291
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,440
Not at all.

292
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,880
Good talk!

293
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,440
I actually like that word, Boss Lady!

294
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,560
In that case, shouldn't we call Tawan

295
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,720
Big Bro too?

296
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,200
Big Bro! Ooh, Big Bro!

297
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:17,400
Big Bro, Big Bro!

298
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,480
Big Bro, Big Bro!

299
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,160
Big Bro's clenching his fists…

300
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,800
Nope, nope! Bad idea!

301
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,640
-Not good.
-Very unlucky.

302
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,160
Boss would never like that.
Doesn't suit her.

303
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,160
What should we call her?

304
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,960
Better stick to Boss.

305
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,080
-Boss.
-Yes.

306
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,600
Much better, right, Boss?

307
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,200
Mr. Thawat, correct?

308
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,600
Yes. What is this about, Officer?

309
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,720
I'll have to ask you
to come with us to the station.

310
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,680
You're a suspect in the abduction

311
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,720
of Ms. Sasina Ruengkunakorn.

312
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,840
Please cooperate.

313
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,680
Yes.

314
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,560
Thank you so much.

315
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,000
Boss,

316
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,160
we've got more leads on the culprit.

317
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,240
Ayla,

318
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,320
give me a moment. I need
to discuss something with Typhoon.

319
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,760
Alright.

320
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,360
These are the names of the suspects
and several persons of interest.

321
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,760
The one we believe
to be the middleman is Thawat.

322
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,120
PEOPLE LINKED TO MR. THAWAT THAMMA

323
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,920
And this photo shows him

324
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,680
following Mr. Mek at the company.

325
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,080
And this is the proof
of a large money transfer

326
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,480
from Mr. Mek to Thawat,

327
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,160
a big sum.

328
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,080
SUCCESSFUL TRANSFER

329
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,880
And the most important thing
is that it happened

330
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,760
right after Mr. Songklod's
company won the bid.

331
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,960
And here, evidence
of Ms. Ayla being held hostage.

332
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,520
It all

333
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,800
points straight at Mr. Mek

334
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,440
as the one who hired Thawat.

335
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,840
But Boss,

336
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,920
this could also be a setup,
making him the scapegoat.

337
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,320
Is it?

338
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,640
But the evidence seems clear enough.

339
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,720
Where are you going, Boss?

340
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,560
Boss.

341
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,120
Please, wait for the police.

342
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,960
-Typhoon, stand--
-No.

343
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,000
Trust me, Boss. Don't go.

344
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,040
I said stand down!

345
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,520
Tawan!

346
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,480
I know who the culprit is.

347
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,840
I forced them to tell me.

348
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,760
Don't blame them.

349
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,639
Where are you going?

350
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,320
I'm going to deal with Mek myself.

351
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,199
For the bad things he did.

352
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,679
Why not leave it to the police?

353
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,520
Because I need to see him suffer
by my own hand.

354
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,719
He hurt you, he'll pay for it.

355
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,880
But I'm fine.

356
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,719
See? I'm not hurt anymore.

357
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,720
Please, leave it to the police.

358
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,440
Please?

359
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,880
Please, my love…

360
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,520
Will you do this for me?

361
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,600
Typhoon.

362
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,640
Yes.

363
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,160
Notify me the second
the warrant for Mek is issued.

364
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,600
Understood.

365
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,200
You all can head back now.
I'll take care of her from here.

366
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,560
Alright.

367
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,000
Let me see that.

368
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,760
Looks like Boss went easy on you.

369
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,760
Otherwise, you'd be wrecked.

370
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,520
You're probably right.

371
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,760
Don't know what's going on upstairs.

372
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,120
I've never seen Boss this angry
in a long time.

373
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,120
Terrifying.

374
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:56,200
I'm a man, and even I was shaken.

375
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,800
Good thing Ms. Ayla was there.

376
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,720
If she hadn't stopped her,
Mr. Mek would be done for.

377
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,120
Either dead or not worth keeping alive.

378
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,720
Ms. Ayla is the only one
who can calm her down.

379
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,840
Makes me wonder who's luckier.

380
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:18,240
Boss, for having Ms. Ayla…

381
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,640
Or Ms. Ayla, for having her.

382
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,000
I'd say both.
They're complete opposites, but together…

383
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,520
it's perfect.

384
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,280
Like…

385
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,000
Like they were made

386
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,800
for each other only.

387
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,840
Isn't that

388
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,760
what they call… soulmates?

389
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,560
Soulmates,

390
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,000
tested by fire.

391
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,560
Does it hurt?

392
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,080
The wound or my heart?

393
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,520
Both.

394
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,800
The wound doesn't.

395
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,880
But my heart…

396
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,200
Then let me heal both,

397
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,800
for the wound

398
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,560
and for your heart.

399
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,120
Let's start with your heart, shall we?

400
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,400
And now, the wound.

401
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,040
You know,

402
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,800
when a bodyguard holds a gun,

403
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,880
it means someone has to survive.

404
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,920
But when a hitman holds a gun,

405
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,120
it means someone must die.

406
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,760
So many times people have hurt you.

407
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:57,000
And in those moments, I'd rather
be the hitman than the bodyguard.

408
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,240
Because I want to kill them.

409
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,280
Just because others are cruel

410
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,040
doesn't mean you have to be cruel too.

411
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,440
Don't go to the dark side
because of me, Tawan.

412
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,280
I've tried to protect you from everyone.

413
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,280
But my own family,

414
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,640
the ones who share my blood,

415
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,800
they're the ones who hurt you.

416
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,520
He can hurt me and I'll take it.

417
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,000
But when he hurts you,

418
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,760
the person I love most,

419
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,440
I can't forgive that.

420
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,440
Either he dies or I do.

421
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,000
Death doesn't solve everything.

422
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,560
Let karma do its work.

423
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,160
What they've done will come back to them.

424
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,480
That's better than blood for blood.

425
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,880
The feud in my family…

426
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,280
I don't know how it will ever end.

427
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,840
In my father's time, my father hurt yours.

428
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,560
Now, in our generation,

429
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,160
my brother hurts you.

430
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,320
I don't know

431
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,600
what I'm supposed to do anymore.

432
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,520
No matter what happens,

433
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,320
I'll always be right here,

434
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,640
by your side. Forever.

435
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,720
-Hey!
-Tawan!

436
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,520
That daughter of a mistress,
whatever she does, you're always pleased.

437
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,840
Why don't you make Mek hate me too?

438
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,520
Why are you apologizing for him?

439
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,640
Make him kneel before me!

440
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,560
If you can't fix this problem,

441
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,680
then there might not be
a T.S. Construction anymore.

442
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,720
What is it you really want from me?

443
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,280
Will you sit here
and watch over me while I'm singing?

444
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,800
