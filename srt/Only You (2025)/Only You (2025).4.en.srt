1
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,120
Ayla!

2
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,400
This goes against protocol, you know.
Is this really okay?

3
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,040
Something smells fishy.

4
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,640
Right now, your safety is my duty

5
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,480
and my responsibility.

6
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,040
But if you're not happy
with the way I'm doing things,

7
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,960
I'm willing to step down.

8
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,360
Tawan, no…

9
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,360
I'm sorry. Eight years
without you by my side,

10
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,960
they were so hard.

11
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,480
So, do you think it's weird?

12
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,320
Or just normal?

13
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,600
Weird.

14
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,560
How exactly is it weird?

15
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,120
Have you ever seen Ms. Strict-Everything,
like our boss, break protocol like that?

16
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,880
Or maybe Ms. Ayla was being difficult,
so she didn't swap…

17
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,120
But no. I think the issue's with our boss.

18
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,360
She literally slept next to her,
watching over her all night.

19
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,840
So, what does that make
Class-A bodyguards like us?

20
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,640
I feel completely useless.

21
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,240
And this morning?

22
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,080
She kicked all of us out,
even though she's still recovering.

23
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,400
That is not normal. I'm telling you.

24
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,160
Oh, come on…

25
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,800
Ms. Ayla's so cute.
Maybe the boss is catching feelings?

26
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,200
Let's find out…

27
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,080
Can love and duty

28
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:15,200
really go hand in hand… hand… hand…?

29
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,240
And with our boss's iron will?

30
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:26,120
How's this story gonna end… end… end…?

31
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,800
Boss!

32
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,840
Boss, you totally snuck up on us!

33
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,000
Boss, are you hungry?

34
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,360
I can grab you something to eat.

35
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,480
No need.

36
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,760
I'm not hungry.

37
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,120
Don't you all have work to do?

38
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,000
Oh, right.

39
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,240
The motorcycle license plate was a fake.

40
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,600
Our surveillance team is checking
other nearby cameras as we speak.

41
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,840
Smooth recovery.

42
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,680
Best survival instincts.

43
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,280
Just a bit.

44
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,760
So, what brings you here?

45
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,280
I came to sign off on payroll.

46
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,200
But I seem to have forgotten my pen.

47
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,200
I guess…

48
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,959
it'll have to wait
till next week… week… week…

49
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,480
Boss! Come on!

50
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,920
- Pen! Where's the pen?
- Pen!

51
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,160
No, that's a spoon!

52
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,760
- Home.
- What?

53
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,920
What's that?

54
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,480
Oh, someone delivered a package
for the boss this morning.

55
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,640
I was just taking it to her.

56
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,840
Home.

57
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,480
Let me take it instead.

58
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,720
Okay.

59
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,000
Thanks.

60
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,400
For the boss.

61
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,440
That's pretty, Boss.

62
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,840
Boss,

63
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,720
if there's ever anything on your mind,
you can always talk to us.

64
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,000
We're family.

65
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,440
So… We wonder…

66
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,160
Is she making you feel anything?

67
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,200
I swear, it stays between the four of us.

68
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,840
Our lips are sealed. No leaks here.

69
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,720
We've known each other
since high school. That's all.

70
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,960
That's all?

71
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,040
Yeah. We hadn't seen each other in years.
We're reconnecting because of work.

72
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,160
That's it, purely professional.

73
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,920
Purely?

74
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,240
Exactly.

75
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,160
I took this job, and I intend
to do it to the best of my ability.

76
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,760
To your best ability?

77
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,240
Are we done here?

78
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,440
Or do I need to channel
my inner Boss Rawee?

79
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,560
Done!

80
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,080
Okay, okay! Done!

81
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,040
- Nana.
- I know, enough, Boss

82
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,440
Upload all the data to the system.

83
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,800
Make sure no one bothers her.

84
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,640
Take care of the VIP.

85
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,480
- Yes, Boss.
- Copy that, Boss.

86
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,840
CULPRIT

87
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,680
Additional files, Boss.

88
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,600
On it.

89
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,520
Can I play this card?

90
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,520
- The boss is here! Boss, please sit here.
- You can play any card.

91
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,480
Boss, please.

92
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,000
Hand me the papaya.

93
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,680
Didn't even get to play my turn.

94
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,560
Smells so nice.

95
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,680
Let the boss play.

96
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,240
Boss, you're on VIP duty.

97
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,440
Exactly, Boss.

98
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,800
We're just doing our job.

99
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,560
So, can we keep playing?

100
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,480
I don't have the spinning card.

101
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,280
- Here! This is the spinning card.
- Which one?

102
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,320
This one's correct.

103
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,120
- Correct. Let me find the spinning card.
- Your turn.

104
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,440
- Every deck has it.
- Ms. Ayla.

105
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,840
Here you go.

106
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,840
Thank you so much!

107
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,560
Please try it and let me know
if it's to your taste.

108
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,280
It feels like it's missing something.

109
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,360
- Missing?
- I'm not sure…

110
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,000
Chili?

111
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,360
You mean spice?

112
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,800
Exactly!

113
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,040
But it's okay. I can still eat it.

114
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,360
Hold on a sec.

115
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,640
Try this.

116
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,720
This is it! That's the right flavor!

117
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,840
When it's the right person,
everything they do turns out right.

118
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,240
Come on…

119
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,360
When it's the right one,
everything just clicks.

120
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,920
Right?

121
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,960
But if they're not the one…

122
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,840
like you…

123
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,480
it just doesn't work.

124
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,680
The taste is off.

125
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,200
That bad?

126
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,320
Absolutely. I forced myself
to chew for way too long.

127
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,360
But I made it the same way as always!

128
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,240
Maybe it's time for a new method.

129
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,080
Today was so much fun.

130
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,840
Next time, bring me along
to hang out with the others again.

131
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,000
You do know they're some

132
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,200
of the top Class-A bodyguards
in the business, right?

133
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,120
And you had them playing around like kids.

134
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,920
Come on. It was after-hours.

135
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Even I want to feel like
a normal person sometimes.

136
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,040
Oh!

137
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,360
Look at the moon!

138
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,040
The moon is so beautiful tonight.

139
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,040
Can you see the moon, Tawan?

140
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,680
It's getting late.

141
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,360
Let's head home.

142
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,360
Yeah.

143
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,480
Let's go.

144
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,720
The revised security measures
will follow your team's recommendations.

145
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,240
If there's anything

146
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,680
you think we should adjust,
feel free to let us know.

147
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,520
Our team reviewed it. It all looks good.

148
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,600
Let's proceed with this plan,

149
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,720
unless something else comes up.

150
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,800
Next month, Ayla

151
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,920
has a major concert,

152
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,800
an international event
representing Thailand,

153
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,120
alongside artists from over ten countries.

154
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,920
Should we consider

155
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,320
canceling it for her safety?

156
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,760
Please, no. I really want to perform.

157
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,360
I don't want to let my fans down.
They've been waiting.

158
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,320
Don't worry, Madam President.

159
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,360
I'll do everything I can

160
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,200
to protect her.

161
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,920
And the attacker?

162
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,400
We're actively working
with the investigators right now.

163
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,280
I'm counting on you, Ms. Rawee.

164
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,240
Yes, ma'am.

165
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,160
I want you to know
No matter how long I keep it inside

166
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,560
Do you even realize
My whole heart is yours?

167
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,840
And every single moment

168
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,800
I long to say this word, love
More than you could ever know

169
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,200
- Yam!
- Ayla!

170
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,480
You holding up okay, beautiful?

171
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,080
Totally fine.

172
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,120
Looks like you've been practicing hard.

173
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,200
Here.

174
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,400
Something to cheer you on.

175
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,800
Thank you so much.

176
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,480
What brings you here today?

177
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,240
I came to discuss
renewing my endorsement deal.

178
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,640
Oh, congrats! You're amazing, sis!

179
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,240
Thanks, little sis.

180
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,440
How long will you be here? If my meeting
doesn't run too long, I'll stop by again.

181
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,360
I'll be here late. I've got a blocking
rehearsal tonight in the Star Room.

182
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,840
Oh, alright. Good luck with everything!

183
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,520
- See you later!
- Okay!

184
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,280
See ya.

185
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,080
TYPHOON

186
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,400
What's up?

187
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,800
I've got info on the person
who attacked Ms. Ayla.

188
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,400
I'm hanging up.

189
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,000
I need to use the restroom.

190
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,000
Tawan, that's enough. I can't anymore.

191
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,480
Seriously, I'm fine.
It's just the restroom.

192
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,360
Go ahead. I'll wait right here.

193
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,840
No!

194
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,840
I'm having a really bad stomachache.

195
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,800
Got it. Go ahead.

196
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,680
Honestly, I'm just super embarrassed.

197
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,200
You really need to wait outside.
I really can't.

198
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,640
So, you want me to wait outside?

199
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,200
Yes, please.

200
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,400
Ayla, are you done yet?

201
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,000
Not yet!

202
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,120
Can you go wait a little further, please?

203
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,400
Ayla?

204
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,280
Are you done yet, Ayla?

205
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,720
Ayla?

206
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,480
Bathroom. Tenth floor. Now.

207
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,480
Boss! Boss, that's enough!

208
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,800
- He's knocked out.
- Ms. Ayla!

209
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,600
Ms. Ayla.

210
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,520
There's a needle mark on her arm. Looks
like she was injected with something.

211
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,320
It's a sedative.

212
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,720
I found the drug on the attacker.

213
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,560
The attacker probably planned to take
photos to ruin Ms. Ayla's reputation.

214
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,960
The attacker's phone is over there.

215
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,800
Typhoon, handle it.

216
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,320
Yes, Boss.

217
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,960
Are you okay?

218
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,480
You're alright?

219
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,360
Come with me.

220
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,040
PRINC HOSPITAL SUVARNABHUMI

221
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,240
I have to apologize to you,
Madam President.

222
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,800
What happened

223
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,160
was entirely my fault.
I failed to protect Ms. Ayla properly.

224
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,840
But you caught the attacker, didn't you?

225
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,640
And you recovered all the photos
and videos before they got out.

226
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,120
Most importantly, Ayla is safe.

227
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,440
You deserve our thanks more than anything.

228
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,280
- But…
- If we're looking for someone to blame,

229
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,200
then we're all at fault.

230
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,800
Ayla made a mistake too.
She let embarrassment cloud her judgment,

231
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,480
sent you out of the bathroom,

232
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,200
and gave the attacker
a chance to approach her.

233
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,360
I'm also to blame,
as the head of this company,

234
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,520
for having such weak security

235
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,440
that someone could get into the building

236
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,600
and harm her. We all made mistakes.

237
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,400
Please, stop blaming yourself.

238
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,280
Tomorrow, we can finally
put this to rest, right?

239
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,440
Yes.

240
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,680
We have all the evidence we need.

241
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,560
Will Boss be okay?
She hasn't moved at all.

242
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,440
She hasn't even eaten dinner.

243
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,080
We called her to eat,
but she kept saying she wasn't hungry.

244
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:39,320
Boss, what are you planning
to do about Ms. Ayla?

245
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,440
I think you know exactly

246
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,000
which rules you've already broken, right?

247
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,520
We can't control our feelings,

248
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,360
I get that.

249
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,360
But when bodyguards like us
break the rules,

250
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,880
it's the VIP who pays the price.

251
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,600
And I know you're blaming yourself so much

252
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,800
for what happened to Ms. Ayla today.

253
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,920
So…

254
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,040
Let me say this, as family.

255
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,800
I think you're getting careless
as a bodyguard, Tawan.

256
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,760
You're indulging your own feelings,

257
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,000
and hers, too much.

258
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,480
That's not the strict,
disciplined bodyguard

259
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,840
we've always known.

260
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,200
Honestly,

261
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,680
now I finally understand

262
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,000
why there's a rule forbidding closeness
between a VIP and their bodyguard.

263
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,920
Those rules exist to prevent
exactly this kind of mistake.

264
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,720
I think you have to make a choice.

265
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:20,400
What do you want to do for Ms. Ayla?

266
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,400
Do you want to protect her

267
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,800
as a bodyguard protecting a VIP…

268
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,280
or as someone

269
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,480
protecting the love of her life?

270
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,720
I think it's time for you

271
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,400
to make that decision.

272
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,760
I think you have to make a choice.

273
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,240
What do you want to do for Ms. Ayla?

274
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,040
Do you want to protect her

275
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,480
as a bodyguard protecting a VIP…

276
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,800
or as someone

277
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,880
protecting the love of her life?

278
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,000
Ayla…

279
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,480
How are you feeling?

280
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,280
I feel dizzy…

281
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,880
Take it slow, okay?

282
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,400
Let me adjust the bed.

283
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,640
Slowly…

284
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,320
Do you feel pain anywhere else?

285
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,720
It hurts…

286
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,520
My stomach hurts.

287
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,640
I remember

288
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,880
someone grabbed me from behind

289
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,840
and punched me in the stomach.

290
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,480
Then everything went dark.

291
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,600
Did they drug me?

292
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,560
I already checked.

293
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,120
It was just a sedative.

294
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,720
No wonder I feel so dizzy…

295
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,480
The culprit has been caught.

296
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,720
Later this morning,

297
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:18,560
we'll settle everything officially
with the president.

298
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,400
So, you already know
who was behind it all, right?

299
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,480
Good morning.
We're here to take Ms. Sawitree in

300
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,480
for questioning
on assault charges against Ms. Sasina.

301
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,800
Here's the warrant.

302
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,600
I… I didn't do anything.

303
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,200
This isn't true. I swear, I didn't do it.

304
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,920
Come with us to the station, please.

305
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,560
Boss!

306
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,360
Please, don't! Boss!

307
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,000
Boss…

308
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,720
Please help me…

309
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,360
That's enough, Yam.

310
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,760
I never imagined

311
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,440
you could be this cruel.

312
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,960
Boss… Boss…

313
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,400
I didn't do it!

314
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,200
I didn't!

315
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,800
- Take her away.
- Please move.

316
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,600
- Stop!
- Please move.

317
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,200
This is all your fault, Ayla.

318
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,200
You ruined everything for me!

319
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,960
You came later and stole it all.

320
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,120
Everything!

321
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,120
I hate you!

322
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,240
If it weren't for you,
I wouldn't be like this!

323
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,600
No one would compare me.

324
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,120
No one would belittle me,
saying I'm not as good as you!

325
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,360
I hate you, Ayla!

326
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,640
- I hate you!
- That's enough.

327
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,080
Stop it, Yam!

328
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,720
You have no right
to say those things to Ayla.

329
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,120
She did nothing wrong.

330
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,280
She just worked harder
and put in more effort than you ever did.

331
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,360
The reason she debuted first,

332
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,280
even though she joined later,

333
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,280
is because she's talented.

334
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:12,440
Before you envy someone else,
look at yourself first.

335
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,920
With your level of skill

336
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,520
and effort?

337
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:25,280
If your father hadn't begged us
to take you in,

338
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,920
no label would have even considered you.

339
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,920
Listen carefully, Yam.

340
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,880
No one ruined you,

341
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,560
except yourself.

342
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,720
All the evidence
tying you to the attack on Ayla

343
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,760
is airtight.

344
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,560
Please take her away.

345
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,480
- Please.
- Boss…

346
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,400
I didn't do it!

347
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,040
I didn't know anything!

348
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,920
- Boss!
- Move.

349
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,160
This way, please.

350
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,200
I still can't believe it was Yam.

351
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,600
You knew for a while?

352
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,400
Yes, for quite some time.

353
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,240
We were waiting
to gather undeniable evidence.

354
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,640
Our team would like to install
additional surveillance cameras

355
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,160
at key points as detailed.

356
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,080
Ms. Rawee wants to secure extra evidence,

357
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,600
so the suspect can't deny anything later.

358
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:05,320
But please,
keep this strictly confidential.

359
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,199
Of course. We'll fully cooperate.

360
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,800
Bingo!

361
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,320
That's the one, Officer.

362
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,440
Police!

363
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,800
- Don't even think about running!
- Hey, stop!

364
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,520
Hands up!

365
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,320
Sit down! Stay still!

366
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,440
Jealousy is terrifying, isn't it?

367
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,000
It burns you from the inside

368
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,760
and ends up
hurting everyone around you too.

369
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:15,800
From now on, we're making changes
to your security detail.

370
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:22,000
I'll be adding Chanya, Nana,
and Typhoon full-time.

371
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,280
Adding?

372
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,520
Even after catching the culprit?

373
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,560
Why? Are you planning on leaving me?

374
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,440
I'm not going anywhere.

375
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,800
I'll still be here.

376
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,560
But we can't let our guard down yet.

377
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,600
There are still several
threatening letters that Yam didn't send.

378
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,320
For your safety,

379
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,560
let's stick with this plan for now.

380
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,000
If you're staying,

381
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,200
then I have no problem with it.

382
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,600
I promise I'll protect your life
with everything I've got,

383
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,080
even if it costs me my own.

384
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,480
Why do you have to say
scary things like that?

385
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,320
I'm speaking as your bodyguard.

386
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,040
Hi!

387
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,760
Let me finish eating first, okay?
Just a moment.

388
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,520
Of course, take your time, Ms. Ayla.

389
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,280
Tawan!

390
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:29,520
Cut! Good. That's a wrap. We'll change
to the next setup. Ayla can take a break.

391
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,560
Tawan, I had to stand for so long
during the shoot just now.

392
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,880
My legs are killing me,

393
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,440
and those heels were so high!

394
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,920
I'll go get you some water.

395
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,560
SANAMDERNPA

396
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,800
Thank you so much.

397
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,840
Tawan, tonight, can we--

398
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,080
I'd like to talk to you about something.

399
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,680
Tawan.

400
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,680
What are you doing?

401
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,640
Why have you suddenly changed?

402
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,000
Did I do something to upset you?

403
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,120
You didn't do anything wrong, Ayla.

404
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,320
I just need to take a step back,

405
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,920
so I can protect you better.

406
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,360
When we get too close,

407
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,080
I lose perspective.

408
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,120
I can't allow myself to make mistakes,

409
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,520
like what happened in the restroom.

410
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,720
But that day, it was my fault.

411
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,360
I was the one who threw a tantrum
and forced you out. It wasn't your fault.

412
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,200
No, it was still my fault.

413
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,960
If I hadn't given in,

414
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,760
if I hadn't spoiled you like that,

415
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,160
the attacker wouldn't have had the chance
to do something so awful.

416
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,640
We were lucky we caught them in time,

417
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,480
but if we hadn't,

418
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,160
if photos or videos had gotten out,

419
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,440
it would've destroyed you.

420
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:26,200
You would've been forced
to live like a ghost in society.

421
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,720
But in the end, it's over.

422
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,440
I'm safe now.

423
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,000
Nothing got leaked.

424
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,680
You really didn't do anything wrong.

425
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,960
I still take responsibility.

426
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,480
This happened because we knew each other,
because we got too close.

427
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:55,040
I let my feelings cloud my judgment,

428
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,280
spoiled you too much,

429
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:03,000
and neglected my duty as your bodyguard.
I broke the rules.

430
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,800
I can't let something like that
ever happen again.

431
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,560
If something happened to you,

432
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,600
I'd never forgive myself.

433
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,560
- But--
- I insist.

434
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,200
This is how it has to be.

435
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,920
It's for the best.

436
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,920
Fine.

437
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,440
If that's what you believe is best,
I'll respect it.

438
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,440
But can I ask you one thing?

439
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,280
Is the reason
you're keeping your distance from me

440
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,440
because you only see yourself
as my bodyguard

441
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,640
and me as your VIP?

442
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,560
But what if you didn't see it that way?

443
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,920
Will you ever see me as anything else?

444
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,920
Not through a bodyguard's eyes.

445
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,040
Something other than a VIP client.

446
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,160
Would it be okay

447
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,640
if I wanted to stand
by your side like this forever?

448
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,120
You shouldn't say things like that.

449
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I'm not exactly the best choice.

450
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,040
You're still not really
answering my question.

451
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,360
Fine.

452
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,720
If that's really what you want,

453
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,840
I'll follow it.

454
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,800
You can go now.

455
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,080
I don't have anything else to say to you.

456
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,600
It's Tawan.

457
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,600
She's acting so strange lately.

458
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,560
Like she has something

459
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,760
on her mind.

460
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,040
Ayla!

461
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:25,600
Handsome, rich…
Fans keep shipping him with everyone,

462
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,480
even with Ms. Ayla, you know.

463
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,760
Ms. Ayla is alone with Mr. Pete?

464
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,400
Yes, just the two of them.

465
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:38,160
Ayla, talk to me first.

466
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,920
But this VIP has nothing to discuss
with her bodyguard.

467
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,280
