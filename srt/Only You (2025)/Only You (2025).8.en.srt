1
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,040
Can you please just tell me the truth?

2
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,080
What happened between the two of you?

3
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,280
How do you even know
that double-crossing snake?

4
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,400
Tawan's dad and Ayla's dad

5
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,440
are sworn enemies, basically.

6
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,800
Why would we let her meddle
in our company business?

7
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,920
I don't even know why you came back.

8
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,000
You can't do this to me!

9
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,280
I won't let you leave this house

10
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,760
until you get over her.

11
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,320
I won't break up with you.

12
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,400
And you can't give up either, okay?

13
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,680
Hello?

14
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,360
Please let her rest a bit longer.

15
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,560
She's not ready
to return to work just yet.

16
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,760
Please, sir.

17
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,440
The president had to reschedule so much
that she took the blame for this.

18
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,040
Fans and reporters

19
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,880
have been crowding the office,
asking where she is.

20
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,360
We're starting
to lose control of the narrative.

21
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,680
I'm worried rumors will start flying.

22
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,600
The reason I called you here

23
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,840
is because the company approached me.

24
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,320
They want you back at work.

25
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,560
I gave them my word you would return,

26
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,040
even though the termination fee

27
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,840
isn't that high.

28
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,000
But I don't want to destroy your dream,

29
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,560
everything you've worked so hard to build.

30
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,600
You can go back to work,

31
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,400
go back to living your life.

32
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,760
But you'll be under 24-hour surveillance
by this bodyguard team.

33
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,280
And if I hear even once

34
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,640
that you're still in contact with Tawan,

35
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,960
I'll destroy everything with my own hands.

36
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,360
Think about it.
What do you want to hold onto?

37
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,440
A love with no future,

38
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,040
or a dream you built with your own hands?

39
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,960
Are you sure
this plan's going to work this time?

40
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,440
Last time was a flop.

41
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,640
Don't worry, sir.

42
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,800
The guy we've brought in this time
is sharp. He never fails.

43
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,600
Better not be all talk.

44
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,360
Let me see the blueprint.

45
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,520
Careful, Mr. Thana!

46
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,240
A TOTAL FAMILY WIPEOUT

47
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,040
Where's Ayla?

48
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,320
She's rehearsing her songs, sir.

49
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,480
Keep her safe.

50
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,480
Yes, sir.

51
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,880
Boss, we just got word. Mr. Thana
was the target of a shooting attempt.

52
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,200
But the team caught it in time.

53
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,880
He's safe.

54
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,120
Any injuries?

55
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,800
None. Do you think…

56
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,480
it was just a warning shot?

57
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,040
According to our intel,

58
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,480
there's a major suburban development bid
coming up next month.

59
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,000
Mr. Thana's company
will definitely be in the running.

60
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,800
T.R. Develop is usually the frontrunner.

61
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,200
Tell Ayla's security detail
to raise their alert level.

62
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,000
If they need backup,
we're ready to step in.

63
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,480
Got it, Boss.

64
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,520
Have you been busy lately?

65
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,840
Lately? I've been prepping for my concert.

66
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,160
Vocal practice, dance rehearsals,

67
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,240
song meetings…

68
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,520
I've also got a shoot next week.

69
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,040
A food show.

70
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,840
I'm dying to eat something good!

71
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,240
Are you okay?

72
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,280
You seem tense.

73
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,120
I'm worried.

74
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,800
Worried?

75
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,040
Worried

76
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,280
and protective.

77
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,480
When I'm not there
to look after you myself, I get anxious.

78
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,760
Promise me

79
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,120
you'll behave. No sneaking around.

80
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,680
Listen to the guards.

81
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,480
Of course.

82
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,480
I promise I'll be good.

83
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,960
I'll follow what the team says.

84
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,640
Okay?

85
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,240
That's my girl.

86
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,600
Ayla, I'm coming in.

87
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,960
Dad!

88
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,000
Get out!

89
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,200
Dad…

90
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,280
Get her out of my house. Now!

91
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,680
Yes, sir.

92
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,160
I said out!

93
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,040
No.

94
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,760
I'm staying with Tawan.

95
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,400
Bring Ayla here. And get her out of here!

96
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,280
Yes, sir. Please, Ms. Ayla. This way.

97
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,080
Dad!

98
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,600
Let go!

99
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,040
Ouch!

100
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,920
Let her go!

101
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,000
Don't you dare touch my girl!

102
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,120
Ayla…

103
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,680
Are you hurt?

104
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,240
She's my daughter too!

105
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,520
Stay away from her!

106
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,040
Get her out of my house,

107
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,400
or I'll fire the entire company!

108
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,760
Sorry, Ms. Rawee.

109
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,680
Please step outside.

110
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,320
This way, ma'am.

111
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,840
You two love each other so much,
you've completely forgotten about me, huh?

112
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,640
Do you even realize

113
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,560
how much this hurts me?

114
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,080
You want to hate me? Fine.

115
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,920
You can't see my good intentions? Fine.

116
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,000
But I'm angry too, Ayla.

117
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,440
You broke the promise we made.

118
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,280
And now, I'll keep mine.

119
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,320
From this moment on,

120
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,800
you are not leaving this room!

121
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,320
Not until I'm convinced

122
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,080
you've cut ties with that woman!

123
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,120
I'll call the company
and cancel all your work.

124
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,760
You're not ready to return yet.

125
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,840
Now tell me.

126
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,240
How have you been contacting her?

127
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,920
How?!

128
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,920
TAWAN

129
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,360
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

130
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,200
Do you know how disappointed I am in you?

131
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,320
Don't let Ayla out of that room!

132
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,160
‎Let's go.

133
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,360
Check on Ms. Ayla often, okay?

134
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,560
Yes, sir.

135
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,200
-I climbed down from the balcony.
-Even we're ashamed of ourselves!

136
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:52,280
-We have to be embarrased!
-Right, we all are.

137
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,480
Are you trying to steal our jobs now?

138
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,040
-Steal what job?
-Being a bodyguard!

139
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,520
What's with all the noise?

140
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,800
Tawan!

141
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,800
Ayla…

142
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,040
Hi!

143
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,560
Sorry to interrupt,

144
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,040
but we've been standing here
the whole time.

145
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,360
You're not gonna yell at us later,
are you, Boss?

146
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,560
We were all stressed out.

147
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,320
Aren't you even going to ask

148
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,240
how Ms. Ayla managed to get out?

149
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,840
I escaped to see you.

150
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,480
I climbed down the balcony,
just like you did.

151
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,120
It was so much fun.

152
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,400
And there!

153
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,200
They helped me.

154
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,800
Even drove me all the way here.

155
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,080
Tell Chanon
these two are getting punished.

156
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,280
You two are getting disciplinary action.

157
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,360
You neglected your duties as bodyguards.

158
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,920
Helping a VIP sneak out,

159
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,600
whether you were tricked or not,
it's still wrong.

160
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,560
But since we asked Chanon for help,

161
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,120
we'll take full accountability.

162
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,560
Typhoon,

163
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,960
handle the transfer.
Move them over to our team.

164
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,280
Yes, Boss.

165
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,880
Thank you

166
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,760
for bringing Ayla here safely.

167
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,640
You're welcome, Ms. Tawan.

168
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,080
Sneaking out like this,

169
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,400
won't Mr. Thana be furious?

170
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,680
Of course he will. But I'm mad at him.
I'm not ready to talk to him yet.

171
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,040
Tawan,

172
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,240
can you take me somewhere far away?

173
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,000
Somewhere Dad can't find us?

174
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,720
Okay.

175
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,120
Let's go.

176
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,520
Let me pack a few things first.

177
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,400
Boss?

178
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,920
Wait, you're serious?

179
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,480
I'm taking Ayla on a short trip.
Just a few days.

180
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,360
Then I'll bring her back home.

181
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,200
-Yes.
-Yes, Boss.

182
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,960
Find a way to inform Mr. Thana.

183
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,960
Tell him Ayla is safe.

184
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,240
I'll personally take her back.

185
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,840
Yes, Boss.

186
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,360
Is this your room?

187
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,320
Whoa…

188
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,360
It's like the sun's room
surrounded by moons.

189
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,960
Don't tell me…

190
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,440
Seriously?

191
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,080
Yes.

192
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,440
Tawan…

193
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,600
Yes?

194
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,600
We really can't just run away together?

195
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,920
I think

196
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,760
you already know the answer.

197
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,480
I don't know what the future holds,

198
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,960
but my love for you

199
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,360
will never change.

200
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,240
Do you trust me, Ayla?

201
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,960
I do.

202
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,600
I'll be your one and only girl.

203
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,160
And we'll never
let go of each other's hands.

204
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,160
No matter what Dad says,

205
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,600
I'm not giving up on us. I won't let go.

206
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,960
I'm super stubborn. Dad knows that.

207
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,920
I know it too.

208
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,920
You really are stubborn.

209
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,120
So…

210
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,720
Where exactly are you taking me?

211
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,200
Where do you want to go?

212
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,720
I'll take you anywhere.

213
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,200
Honestly?

214
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,320
I just wanna lie in bed with you all day.

215
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,760
But…

216
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,880
that might be a little too lazy.

217
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,520
Then…

218
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,360
let's not just lie around.

219
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,400
Let's do something.

220
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,520
Like what?

221
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,400
Well…

222
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,160
Like what?

223
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,280
I've seen your world.

224
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,880
Now I want you to see mine.

225
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,320
Remember what I taught you?

226
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,560
Whatever happens, stay behind me.

227
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,480
So, you taught Ms. Ayla
how to fight and shoot

228
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,600
because you wanted her to protect herself?

229
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,480
Just in case.

230
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,240
At least, if anything happens,

231
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,440
she'll know how to protect herself.

232
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,960
You're good at this!

233
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,920
Yay!

234
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,320
I won!

235
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,520
I'm not eating anymore.

236
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,760
What did you find out?

237
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:57,200
Our contact says Mr. Thana
handed some info to the police.

238
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,280
They've collected evidence from the scene,

239
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,120
but the investigation's still ongoing.

240
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,360
He's also tightened security everywhere,

241
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,520
at his house, the office,
and the project site.

242
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,120
Everything's on high alert.

243
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,280
And from what we know,

244
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,440
the people behind this are professionals.

245
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,200
On the day of the shooting,

246
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,200
the car they used had fake plates.
No leads at all.

247
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,720
As for the attackers,

248
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,400
they were completely covered up.

249
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,000
Even the CCTV didn't get a clear shot.
Tracking them is going to be tough.

250
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,760
What about the music label?

251
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,880
Anything suspicious?

252
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,800
CN hasn't reported anything yet.

253
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,360
I think Mr. Thana's team can handle it.

254
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,360
But what worries me most…

255
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,880
The Boss Lady.

256
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,800
Exactly.

257
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,440
Because she's under the spotlight.

258
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,160
But isn't she grounded right now?

259
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,480
Staying home should keep her safe.

260
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:05,160
Trust me. Mr. Thana's
gonna let our Boss Lady work again.

261
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,840
She's too rebellious.
Grounding her won't do a thing.

262
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,400
She'll be climbing down
balconies again for sure.

263
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,960
We'd better step up the investigation.

264
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,360
I don't want any more mistakes.

265
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,240
Yes, Boss.

266
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,880
Time to wake up.

267
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,840
You're up too early.
I don't wanna get up yet.

268
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,200
I'm the early-rising sun, remember?

269
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,960
If you're the early-rising sun,

270
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,080
I'll be the moon that sleeps in.

271
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,320
If the moon sleeps in,

272
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,680
the sun might sneak a kiss.

273
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,120
Kiss me or do whatever you want.
I'm sleep-talking anyway.

274
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,680
Okay, okay!

275
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,240
Eat it while it's hot.

276
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,440
Here, I'll tear it

277
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,600
into bite-sized pieces for you.

278
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,840
Okay.

279
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,120
So, what are you gonna train me in today?

280
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,840
Can I just take my girlfriend out
on a proper date for once?

281
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,720
Sure!

282
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,520
Do you even know how sore I was yesterday?

283
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,240
I can barely lift my arm!

284
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:47,320
Where are we going today?

285
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,320
Thanks…

286
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,160
This makes me so happy.

287
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,000
I just wish
I could freeze time right here,

288
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,760
just the two of us.

289
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,520
But then again,

290
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:19,480
part of me wants to show you off to
the world, let everyone know you're mine!

291
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,880
Am I really that great
that you'd wanna show me off?

292
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,760
You are. Why?

293
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,280
I'm the child of a second wife.

294
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,720
My mom was Dad's other wife.

295
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,960
Not long after I was born,

296
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,680
she got sick and passed away.

297
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,159
Left me all alone in this giant house.

298
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,400
It was huge,

299
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:14,360
but it never felt like home.

300
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,080
Can you sign my school leave form?

301
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,719
Wow!

302
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,760
You're an athlete?

303
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,719
That's impressive!

304
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,360
Dad's first wife and my half-brother

305
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,960
hated me.

306
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,960
Dad kept trying to make us get along,

307
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:44,080
but I was always bullied,
always picked on.

308
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,280
Hey! Go get the ball.

309
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,360
Aren't you the athlete? So good, right?

310
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,920
I tried to put up with it,

311
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:59,080
but I reached my limit.

312
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:14,520
A POWER-UP SNACK!
EAT IT AND YOU'LL HAVE LOTS OF ENERGY

313
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,040
Mek…

314
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,480
What's going on?

315
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,240
Mom! Mom!

316
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:35,120
Mek! Are you okay, sweetie?

317
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,000
You ungrateful little brat!

318
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,880
My goodness!

319
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,400
You have to deal with this brat!

320
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,760
So, what exactly happened?

321
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,600
My watch went missing,

322
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,520
so I searched her room.

323
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,640
She got mad and punched me.

324
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,080
Were you searching,
or were you just trashing my room?

325
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,040
Don't you talk back!

326
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,520
You wild child!

327
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,680
Picking fights with everyone,
you think I'll let this slide?

328
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,400
It's just kids fighting. Calm down.

329
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,360
Kids fighting?

330
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,880
Look at our son's face,

331
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,960
and look at hers.
Which one looks more beaten up?

332
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,880
Fine.

333
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,640
So? Did you find the watch?

334
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,480
-I did.
-Where?

335
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,400
I found--

336
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,080
Let's just say it was found. So what?

337
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,760
Either way, you have to deal with her.

338
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,280
She hurt Mek!

339
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,480
Okay.

340
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,360
So, if she apologizes, that's it?

341
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,800
Tawan, just apologize.

342
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,200
Dad… I didn't do anything wrong.

343
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,120
-Yes, you did!
-I didn't.

344
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,280
You punched me!

345
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,680
Wanna check the cameras?
See who actually started it?

346
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:04,160
Fine. Let everyone see how you beat me up.

347
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,640
You need to deal with this brat!
I won't stand for this!

348
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,840
My daughter has a name, you know.
Speak to her with respect.

349
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,400
No, I won't.

350
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,880
She's the second wife's kid.

351
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,920
Your mistress' child.
You're lucky I even let…

352
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,480
your dad raise you

353
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,120
in this house.

354
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,040
Then what do you want me to do
to make you happy?

355
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,640
Easy!

356
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,960
Kick her out.

357
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,680
Send her to another country. Far away.

358
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,920
I don't wanna see your face again!

359
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,040
You better take care of it.
Or I won't let it go.

360
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,280
Fine.

361
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,480
I'll leave.

362
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,920
And I won't come back.

363
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,560
Good. Get lost.

364
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,320
I never want to see your face again.

365
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,000
Go! This is my house!

366
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,720
So, I ended up living
with Auntie Mui and Uncle in Hong Kong.

367
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,920
So…

368
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,560
How was it over there? Was it hard?

369
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,320
Not really.

370
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,720
I worked and studied at the same time.

371
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,840
Was it hard? No.

372
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,200
But was it lonely? Definitely.

373
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,120
I was lucky

374
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,120
they loved me like their own.

375
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,440
Both of them

376
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,840
never had kids,

377
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,280
so they adopted me.

378
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,640
That's when

379
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,280
I changed my last name.

380
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,400
And after they passed,

381
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,200
I came back to start over in Thailand.

382
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,440
There was no one left for me

383
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,600
over there.

384
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,800
So, I didn't see the point in staying.

385
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,920
I know

386
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,920
Auntie and Uncle would be so proud of you.

387
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:33,520
You've come so far on your own.

388
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,200
And about your dad,

389
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,640
I believe no father
could ever truly not love their child.

390
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,880
I'm proud of you, Tawan.

391
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,560
You're the best person in the world.

392
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,200
So good that I don't think

393
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,000
I'll ever find someone like you again.

394
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,000
You're incredible, out of this world!

395
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:00,640
If you're ever scared that people
think you're not good enough,

396
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,360
just don't.

397
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,880
Don't overthink it, okay?

398
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,880
If anyone dares talk bad about you,

399
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,360
I'll protect you.
I'll take care of them myself.

400
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,040
Wow.

401
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,720
Amazing.
My girlfriend is the loveliest ever.

402
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,160
So now that I'm lovely, do you love me?

403
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,280
Good morning.

404
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,440
Oh!

405
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,040
Breakfast in bed?

406
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,640
Thank you.

407
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,560
You're welcome.

408
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,720
Thanks!

409
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,480
I don't wanna go home.

410
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,640
I know I shouldn't whine,
since you already promised Dad.

411
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,320
I have to keep my word.

412
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,640
I'm just scared
he'll put me on lockdown again.

413
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:34,080
I believe Mr. Thana
knows his daughter well enough.

414
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,760
He knows how stubborn you are.

415
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,840
He probably doesn't want to see you

416
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,480
climbing down the balcony again.

417
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,200
Let's hope he softens up soon.

418
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,240
Boss!

419
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,520
What is it?

420
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,240
Boss, where are you right now?

421
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,440
Why?

422
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:18,240
Can you check your messages?
We sent you something.

423
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:41,680
Our source says many reporters
are outside Ms. Ayla’s house.

424
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,960
Alright, I'm hanging up.

425
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,520
Tomorrow at noon, I'll go live
and make a public statement.

426
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,080
The person in the photo is me.

427
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,920
Dad's precious daughter,

428
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,640
causing more drama for the family again.

429
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,880
Are you planning to stay
and drag our name down even further?

430
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,600
And who exactly is so disgraceful?

431
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,760
Can't you forgive Tawan's father, Dad?

432
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,800
I told you to break up with her

433
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,720
because I'll never make peace with him.

434
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,040
If you want to love each other

435
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,520
while making me miserable,
then do whatever you want.

436
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:41,880
Do you really think we can be together
if both our dads refuse to accept it?

437
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,720
