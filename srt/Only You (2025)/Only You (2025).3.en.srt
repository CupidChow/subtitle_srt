1
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,720
I no longer trust your company.

2
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,720
I'll find a personal bodyguard
for my daughter myself.

3
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,760
From what I've heard,

4
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,680
none of our bodyguards
meet your VIP's criteria.

5
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,360
I don't think we'll be needing
a new agency after all, Dad.

6
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,320
Pleasure working with you,

7
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,480
Ms. Bodyguard.

8
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,280
We also have some additional rules.

9
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,080
"You must stay within visual range

10
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,520
of your bodyguard at all times."

11
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,000
And what exactly is "visual range"?

12
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,960
Can you see me now?

13
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,040
This place sells good congee,

14
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,480
so I bought it

15
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,080
and came straight here.

16
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,920
This time, it's on me,
since you bought me breakfast. Deal?

17
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,120
Mick!

18
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,960
Tawan,

19
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,600
that's Mick. He's the housekeeper's son.

20
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,680
He always brings me snacks.

21
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,520
He's one of my fans.

22
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,880
Let me see your neck.

23
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,120
It's okay. I'm fine now.

24
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,960
I'll get going. Excuse me.

25
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,760
I've got all kinds of fans.

26
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,280
Some can't even make eye contact.

27
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,200
Some won't come near me.
Some don't want to touch at all.

28
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,440
Some have only ever seen me on screen

29
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,440
or heard my voice through it,

30
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,080
and that alone makes them happy.

31
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,920
Some haven't even met me in real life,

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,760
but still, they love me so much.

33
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,720
Their support and love
mean everything to me.

34
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,840
And what about the ones
who send you disturbing things,

35
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,680
who stalk you?

36
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,440
To be honest,

37
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,560
that only started recently.

38
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,520
Death threats,

39
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,040
letters telling me to leave the industry,

40
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,360
bloody dolls…

41
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,240
It made me wonder. Did I ever hurt anyone?

42
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,000
But when I really think about it…

43
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,040
No. I've never hurt anyone first.

44
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,000
Sometimes, it's not
that you did anything wrong.

45
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,360
It's just that jealous people

46
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,840
want to hurt you.

47
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,080
Anti-fans, I guess.

48
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,360
Hey, gorgeous girl!

49
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,560
- Hello, Yam!
- Hi.

50
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,400
Still not done practicing?

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,440
Just one section left and I'm done.

52
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,120
Ayla, your new song is amazing.

53
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,600
I love it!

54
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,280
You've heard it?
I thought the mix wasn't done yet.

55
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,920
Oh, right…

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,400
Yeah, it's not done.
But I'm your number one fan, remember?

57
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,080
So, I snuck a preview.

58
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,520
Anyway, you keep practicing.

59
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,560
I'll hop in this afternoon.

60
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,000
It's totally fine. I'll wrap up now,

61
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,360
so you can take over.

62
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,080
Come on…

63
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,880
A superstar like you? You train so hard.

64
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,360
I'm tiny.

65
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,480
I can wait.

66
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,240
Stop. I'm no superstar.

67
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,840
You go ahead. I have to record anyway.

68
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,240
Alright then. See you later.

69
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,960
- See you, sis! Bye-bye!
- Bye!

70
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,920
Ayla,

71
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,000
your guest has arrived.

72
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,160
Got it.

73
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,160
Did you wait long, Khaotu?

74
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,720
Not at all. Did you just finish?

75
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,400
Yep, I'm done.

76
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,880
Well,

77
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,200
I've got someone I want you to meet.

78
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,800
Tawan? Tawan!

79
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,840
Tawan…

80
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,840
Is this really Tawan in the flesh?

81
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,200
Of course it is!

82
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,880
She's the real deal. Gorgeous, right?

83
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,920
You're still as cool as ever!

84
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,920
How have you been?

85
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,040
I'm doing well.

86
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,080
And you, Khaotu?

87
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,960
I'm a pretty flight attendant now.

88
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,400
And today, this idol girl right here
dragged me to her office.

89
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,000
Dragged, huh?

90
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,640
Don't make me look bad in front of Tawan!

91
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,680
Fine, I dragged myself.

92
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,680
But you owed me
a birthday treat, remember?

93
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,480
You're always flying around like a bird.
This was the first day we were both free.

94
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,160
Excuse me. I'm an angel, not a bird.

95
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,360
There's a fine line
between angel and bird, you know.

96
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,800
Not for me. I've got wings
and everything. Definitely an angel!

97
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,040
You might just be a bird.

98
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,120
Nope!

99
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,560
I'm way too pretty. Angel, definitely!

100
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,400
Hey! What the hell?

101
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,040
Let go! Let me go!

102
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,240
You can't just take my stuff!

103
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,760
Give it back!

104
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,400
With evidence this solid?

105
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,760
You'd better stay quiet.

106
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,040
Boss, it's not sasaengs.
Just gossip peddlers.

107
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,800
Handle it. Coordinate with Ayla's team.

108
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,640
Understood, Boss.

109
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,520
Everything's handled.
You can get in the car now.

110
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,720
Tawan, is that your team?

111
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,400
They're so cool!

112
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,360
I only ever see stuff like that
in action movies.

113
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,760
Can you do one of those moves for me?

114
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,840
Ugh!

115
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,320
I'm starving!

116
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,160
Enough with the action show. Let's go eat.

117
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,520
Fine, fine. My car's parked over there.

118
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,520
See you there.

119
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,680
- See you.
- Bye-bye!

120
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,760
Bye!

121
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,720
Thanks.

122
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,480
1KT - PHITSANULOK

123
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,240
Ayla!

124
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,200
Ayla,

125
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,040
are you okay?

126
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,440
I'm fine.

127
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,000
And you…

128
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,560
Ayla.

129
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,360
I'm okay.

130
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,440
Look.

131
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,600
Just a scratch.

132
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,240
But it still hurts, doesn't it?

133
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,840
I've already contacted the hospital, Boss.

134
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,360
Come here.

135
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,440
Tawan, Ayla, are you alright?

136
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,280
You should head back first.

137
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,320
No, I'm worried about you.

138
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,120
Please, trust me.
Just go for now. I'll call you later.

139
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,640
Okay.

140
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,720
But you were so cool just now!

141
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,240
Ayla, you're really okay, right?

142
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,920
That was terrifying!

143
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,640
I'm fine. Luckily, Tawan was there.

144
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,120
Then… I'll take her to the hospital now.

145
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,960
I'll come with you.

146
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,360
If the chairman finds out
I let you go alone, I'm done for.

147
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,560
Don't worry.
We'll take good care of Ms. Ayla.

148
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,040
But--

149
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,000
That's right. If Boss has any questions,

150
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,000
just call me. Don't worry.

151
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,520
- Take care, alright?
- Bye.

152
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,120
Tawan?

153
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,720
Tawan.

154
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,800
Are you okay?

155
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,600
The doctor said it's nothing serious.

156
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,080
Thanks to first aid.

157
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,880
I should be fine

158
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,520
in a few days.

159
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,880
Nana's working
on tracking the license plate.

160
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,720
Good. The sooner, the better.

161
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,040
Got it, Boss.

162
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,200
In the next few days,

163
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,080
I'll have the team assign
extra security to take care of Ayla.

164
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,240
No problem at all.

165
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,880
So you can rest too.

166
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,240
I'll still be here.

167
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,680
Just bringing in backup.

168
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,280
Ms. Rawee, please proceed
to the billing counter.

169
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,920
This goes against protocol, you know.

170
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,280
Is this really okay?

171
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,720
Yeah.

172
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,040
And that painkiller she took was strong.
She should be out cold.

173
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,440
Why didn't she just rest?

174
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,840
Normally, if you're injured, you rest.

175
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,200
We're all available to sub in.

176
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,320
This is weird.

177
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,280
Yeah

178
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,360
Something smells fishy.

179
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,000
Where's Boss?

180
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,080
Why are you here?

181
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,760
Boss called me in.

182
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,800
Said backup was needed.

183
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,120
Backup or moral support?

184
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,080
So…

185
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,160
Where's the boss now?

186
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,080
Over there.

187
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,240
No need to go over. Come here.

188
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,920
- All clear downstairs.
- Everything's secured.

189
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,120
Tawan,

190
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,840
do you want to go get some rest?

191
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,000
Boss,

192
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,080
we'll take care of Ms. Ayla.
No need to worry.

193
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,640
Please, go get some rest.

194
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,800
Okay?

195
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,480
Will you go?

196
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,280
Everyone, follow Rule 27.

197
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,040
Unless you're leaving the building,
come straight to me.

198
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,680
Copy that.

199
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,120
I'll leave it to you.

200
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,240
Yes, Boss.

201
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,600
Can I have that medicine?

202
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,320
Please, make yourself at home.

203
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,120
If you're hungry,
I can order something for you.

204
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,720
Given the situation, let us order instead.

205
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,160
We'll make sure it's safe and tasty.

206
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,000
What would you like to eat, Ms. Ayla?

207
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,560
What does Tawan like to eat?

208
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,280
I'll have whatever she's having.

209
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,240
Everything the boss likes?

210
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,000
Exactly.

211
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,240
Order two or three sets of each.

212
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,280
Here's your bedtime medicine.

213
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,440
And pajamas.

214
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,080
If you need anything, just call me.

215
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,560
SPAGHETTI CARBONARA

216
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,200
PAD THAI

217
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,120
All these restaurants
are pre-approved by the company.

218
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,160
Safe and delicious.

219
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,680
Order whatever you like.

220
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,720
Okay.

221
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,480
Ms. Ayla?

222
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,120
Yes?

223
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,840
Would you like to add anything?

224
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,520
Oh…

225
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,800
That's already a lot of food.
I don't think we'll finish it all.

226
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,400
There are a lot of us here.
Better to order extra.

227
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:55,080
And besides,
I don't actually know what Tawan likes.

228
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,840
Boss eats anything.

229
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,080
Really?

230
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,200
Yup.

231
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,280
You guys, come sit with me.

232
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,360
Tawan said this room
has top-notch security.

233
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,680
You can sit if you'd like.

234
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,560
I think I'll stay standing.

235
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,000
Technically, we're still on duty.

236
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,480
By now, she's fast asleep.

237
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,640
Come on. Chat with me for a bit.

238
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,120
I was actually
Tawan's junior back in high school.

239
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,120
I knew it!

240
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,360
That explains everything.

241
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,760
Alright.

242
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,320
So, Ms. Ayla, you've known
each other since high school?

243
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,400
She's never told you?

244
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,920
No.

245
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,200
We've asked,

246
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,520
but all she ever says is,
"We've known each other a long time."

247
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,560
Well, it's true. It's been eight years.

248
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,960
Whoa, eight years?

249
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,240
What should I order for Tawan?

250
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,240
She loves noodles.

251
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,720
Yup, any kind, from any country.

252
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,080
Perfect. Then…

253
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,320
Let's get noodle soup, sukiyaki,
bolognese, carbonara, boat noodles…

254
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,640
And barbecue pork egg noodles too!

255
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,280
I'm really lucky
Tawan agreed to be my bodyguard.

256
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,080
We were surprised too.

257
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:06,360
She hasn't taken on
a private case in a while.

258
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,040
Her last few were either

259
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:12,880
high-level government clients or returning
ones who requested her specifically.

260
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,560
Exactly. And even now, she's injured.

261
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,920
Normally, we'd bring in a whole new team.

262
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,320
But she refused to switch out

263
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,600
and brought us in as backup instead.

264
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,840
That just shows how important
your case is to the boss.

265
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,880
I think responsibility means a lot to her.

266
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,920
She promised to protect me.

267
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,880
She wouldn't want to break that promise.

268
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,040
That's her.

269
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,240
She's incredibly strict
and detail-oriented.

270
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,400
She doesn't like mistakes.

271
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,800
Nothing escapes her attention.

272
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,560
So…

273
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,760
How did you all end up working with her?

274
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,160
I was in the military.

275
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,640
Navy SEALs.

276
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,000
Top of my class.

277
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,280
And me…

278
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,240
You probably wouldn't guess,

279
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,160
but I used to be a total nerd.

280
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,680
Didn't talk to anyone.

281
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,320
Just obsessed with writing code.

282
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,280
That's awesome!

283
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,800
I'm hopeless with tech.

284
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:24,680
I only know music, singing,
that sort of thing. But computers?

285
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,560
Zero.

286
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,520
Back then, the boss had just come back
from Hong Kong.

287
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,880
Hong Kong?

288
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,640
Yes.

289
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,720
She was looking for someone
to manage the IT side of things.

290
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,800
Someone recommended me,

291
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,520
and she contacted me.

292
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,120
At first,

293
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,960
I was just helping with research.

294
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,520
Then, next thing I knew,
I was roped into the bodyguard life.

295
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,080
And…

296
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,120
how long did she live in Hong Kong?

297
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,960
Ages.

298
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,640
When she speaks Mandarin,
no one would believe she's Thai.

299
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,640
She's fluent in many languages.

300
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,680
At least five.

301
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,160
That's amazing!
And what about you, Chanya?

302
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,080
I used to be a police officer.

303
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,800
I eventually left the force
and came to work with the boss.

304
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,160
I felt like this job suited me better.

305
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,440
So, you're someone who values freedom.
Doesn't like being boxed in?

306
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,800
That's exactly what the boss said.

307
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,120
Am I that easy to read?

308
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,440
- Am I?
- Yep.

309
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,800
- Speechless, huh?
- You guys…

310
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,800
You know, with the way Tawan works,

311
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,720
doesn't her lover ever complain?

312
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,920
She's single. No lover.

313
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,440
Really?!

314
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,720
Where is she now?

315
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,000
She's asleep.
The rest of the team is here with me.

316
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,320
Girl, I'm still not over what happened.

317
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,640
What about you? Are you okay?

318
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,960
Not really.

319
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,320
Because Tawan got hurt?

320
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,240
Yeah.

321
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,320
I feel awful she got hurt because of me.

322
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,440
Look, she's your bodyguard.

323
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,200
She was doing her job.

324
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,280
And if anything had happened to you,

325
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,440
your dad would've killed her on the spot.

326
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:38,840
We just reunited a few days ago,
and now this happens.

327
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,160
By the way, does your dad know?

328
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,840
Of course not.

329
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,160
And I don't want him to find out.
He'll call me home.

330
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,520
True.

331
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,960
But at least you're safe.

332
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,400
Your dad wouldn't blame her.

333
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,480
Honestly, right now,
I'm all over the place.

334
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:05,880
Part of me is so glad she's here,
looking out for me.

335
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,400
But then, seeing her get hurt,

336
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,840
I just… don't want her in danger.

337
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,320
And those people who attacked me…

338
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,440
Why do they hate me so much?
I don't even know them.

339
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,880
Who knows what'll happen next?

340
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,680
Deep breaths, superstar.

341
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,640
Focus, okay?

342
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,040
Right now, can you even
trust anyone but Tawan?

343
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,800
You should be grateful
she's willing to take this job for you.

344
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,040
But I'm worried about her too.

345
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,600
Yeah, I know.

346
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,040
You're worried. You love her.

347
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,160
I've been hearing this since we were 16.

348
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,160
Go take care of her, alright?

349
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,880
Maybe she'll finally fall for you.

350
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,520
Yeah.

351
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,480
Boss has been working so hard

352
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,600
to build the company up to this point.

353
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,600
The VIP clients we've worked with,

354
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:28,160
almost none of them
ever switch to another agency.

355
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,840
That's true.

356
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,280
Not to brag,

357
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,000
but she has incredibly high standards.

358
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,280
When people hear the name Ms. Rawee,

359
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,640
they immediately think
of flawless execution.

360
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,880
No mistakes at all.

361
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,480
Thoroughness, attention to detail,
and sharp observation.

362
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,600
That's what makes everything run smoothly.

363
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,600
We all follow that same standard.

364
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,160
And it really works.

365
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,520
Boss once told me,

366
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,480
protecting someone
with everything you've got

367
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,040
is where a bodyguard's duty begins.

368
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,760
Tawan!

369
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,040
Ms. Ayla.

370
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,000
Let's go sleep in your room.

371
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,880
I'd rather stay here.

372
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,120
It's really better if you go back.

373
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,840
If Boss wakes up
and sees you sleeping here,

374
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,880
we're all getting punished for sure.

375
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,080
Boss…

376
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,680
Boss.

377
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,680
You're up so early.

378
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,040
It's only 5:30.

379
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,720
The meds shouldn't have worn off yet.

380
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,720
You can go back to sleep, you know.

381
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,160
Yeah, we've got things covered, Boss.

382
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,200
No, I'm up.

383
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,160
You guys go rest.

384
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,560
As tough as ever.

385
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,960
Oh, by the way.

386
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,520
That pajama set is super cute.

387
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,760
Very cutesy-cutesy.

388
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,440
Cutie patootie!

389
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,760
What about Ms. Ayla?

390
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,640
Is she still asleep?

391
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:49,400
She is. She didn't fall asleep
until nearly 3 a.m.

392
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,840
Okay.

393
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,320
Boss, are you okay now?

394
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,880
It's not near my heart.

395
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,520
The wound may be far from your heart,

396
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,960
but I feel like the person
is getting closer to it.

397
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,480
Go already. Always saying random things.

398
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,120
Random talk, as usual.

399
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,240
Seriously. All of you, saying nonsense.

400
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,360
Don't you have work to do?

401
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,960
Are we getting any updates
on that motorcycle today or not?

402
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,560
You'll have the info by noon, Boss.

403
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,160
Good.

404
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,280
Then, what are you standing around for?

405
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,640
Get back to work.

406
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,840
- Go pack up your things.
- Okay.

407
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,120
Why'd you bring such a huge bag anyway?

408
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,520
Tawan.

409
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,680
How are you feeling?

410
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,080
I'm feeling better.

411
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,960
Nothing serious now.

412
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:26,159
Is there something on your mind?

413
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,280
I…

414
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,639
I want to cancel
the contract with your company.

415
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,120
May I ask why?

416
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:48,120
I'm confident our company
hasn't made any mistakes.

417
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,719
Or did one of the three
do something to upset you?

418
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,159
No, not at all.

419
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,760
They've been nothing but kind.

420
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,040
And your company has done an amazing job.

421
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,240
I'm not upset about anything.

422
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,800
I'm actually really grateful

423
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,600
that you've been by my side,
looking after me.

424
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,080
But…

425
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,080
I don't want something like yesterday
to ever happen again.

426
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,760
You got hurt because of me.

427
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,200
I'm the reason you got hurt.

428
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,840
They were after me. So, why should you
be the one who ends up getting hurt?

429
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,440
Then I'm going to have to say no.

430
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,000
This contract can't be canceled
for that reason.

431
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,240
Then…

432
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,640
I'll pay the full cancellation fee.

433
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,920
Your company won't lose anything.

434
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,120
I'm not worried about that.

435
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,440
Right now,
your safety is what matters most.

436
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,320
And the situation you're in,

437
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,560
it's too dangerous for me to walk away.

438
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:04,120
Right now, your safety is my duty
and my responsibility.

439
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,440
But if you're not happy
with the way I'm doing things,

440
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,080
I'm willing to step down.

441
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,360
There are definitely other companies out
there that could handle this job better.

442
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,960
No! Tawan, no…

443
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,800
I'm sorry.

444
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,520
Sorry if I did anything to upset you.

445
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,440
But please don't disappear on me again.

446
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,680
I only wanted to cancel the contract,
not walk away from you.

447
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,920
I'm sorry.

448
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,120
These past eight years…

449
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:20,160
Eight years without you by my side,
they were so hard.

450
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,400
Please don't leave again.

451
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,240
Please… I'm sorry.

452
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,400
Don't cry.

453
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,840
No more tears.

454
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,480
I'm not going anywhere.

455
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,600
Thank you…

456
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,880
Are you hungry? I am.

457
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,880
Should we go eat something?

458
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,800
Yeah.

459
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,200
Wait. Where is it?

460
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,800
I swear I left it right here.

461
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,040
If you mean the food in the fridge,

462
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,480
I saw Typhoon take it earlier.

463
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,800
He must've grabbed the wrong one.

464
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,160
I ordered that especially for you.

465
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,880
Looks like there's nothing left to eat.

466
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,280
I'll order more. Just wait a sec.

467
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,720
Wait.

468
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,800
Don't worry.

469
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,440
I'll make us some egg fried rice.

470
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,080
Egg fried rice?

471
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,440
No, it's okay.

472
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,280
I'll make my signature dish for you.

473
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,360
Will it actually be edible?

474
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,080
Yes. I promise this one
won't blow up the kitchen. I swear.

475
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,160
Go sit down.

476
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,520
The water's boiling.

477
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,640
OK STIR FRIED SALTED EGG

478
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,920
Careful. It's hot.

479
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,000
Ding!

480
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,920
Heard someone likes noodle dishes.

481
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,520
Then…

482
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,120
I'll dig in.

483
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,320
It's good.

484
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,160
Looks like you've got at least
one dish that's a success.

485
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,480
That's exactly what Mr. Thana said.

486
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,120
He's the one who forced me to learn.

487
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,520
And he said the exact same thing,

488
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:27,040
"At least there's one dish you can cook."

489
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,840
So good!

490
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,880
Oh, excuse me for a second.

491
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,320
Hello, Boss.

492
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,600
Ayla, how are you?

493
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,880
I just landed and heard what happened.

494
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,520
I nearly had a heart attack.

495
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,840
Does Mr. Thana know yet?

496
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,520
Not yet, Boss.

497
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,560
But…

498
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,360
Can you please not tell him just yet?
I'm afraid he'll worry too much.

499
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,000
I'll tell him myself.

500
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,960
Alright.

501
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:24,840
We're reviewing the CCTV footage
and coordinating with Ms. Rawee's team.

502
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,680
This has gone too far. I can't accept it.

503
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,440
I won't let the culprit get away with it.

504
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,200
And don't worry about work.

505
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,400
Take some time off. I'll have Tik
rearrange your whole schedule.

506
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,640
Also, don't come to the office for now.

507
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,960
I'm upgrading
all the security systems first.

508
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,600
Got it, Ayla?

509
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,360
Got it, Boss.

510
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,720
And how's Ms. Rawee?

511
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,320
She's doing fine now. No need to worry.

512
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,680
Let her know all medical expenses
will be covered by us.

513
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,320
Thank you so much.

514
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,400
Take good care of yourself, Ayla.

515
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,600
I bet right now,

516
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:15,360
the entire office
is getting chewed out by the boss.

517
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,400
How could something like this happen?

518
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,000
Didn't I make it clear

519
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:34,600
that artist safety must always come first?

520
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,400
And yet Ayla was attacked
right outside our own building.

521
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,480
If we stay this careless

522
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,880
and another artist gets hurt,

523
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,800
how are we going to face anyone?

524
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,520
What will we tell their parents?

525
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,760
When we asked them
to let their kids become artists,

526
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:59,000
we promised to take good care of them.

527
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,920
So, live up to that promise.

528
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,720
If not,

529
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,320
then shut this company down!

530
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,600
Don't just think about
profiting off your artists

531
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,120
if you're not going
to protect them properly.

532
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,080
So, that means

533
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,640
you don't have to go to work today?

534
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,520
After that explosion?

535
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,800
I think I'm off
for at least two or three days.

536
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,840
I wonder… Is she making you feel anything?

537
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,400
Our lips are sealed. No leaks here.

538
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,200
I think you have to make a choice.

539
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:20,000
Do you want to protect her
as a bodyguard protecting a VIP

540
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:24,080
or as someone
protecting the love of her life?

541
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,120
Will you ever see me as anything else?

542
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,920
Not through a bodyguard's eyes.

543
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,600
Something other than a VIP client.

544
