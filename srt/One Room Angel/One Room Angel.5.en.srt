00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:07,095
(Forget about it quickly.

2
00:00:07,104 --> 00:00:08,564
Were there no other alternatives?)

3
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:13,724
(If you have the courage to jump,
were there no other alternatives?)

4
00:00:13,724 --> 00:00:15,386
(If you commit suicide,

5
00:00:15,411 --> 00:00:17,267
it's like admitting defeat)

6

(I have a kid.

7
00:00:18,497 --> 00:00:20,138
It's painful to think about

8
00:00:20,163 --> 00:00:22,008
the feelings of the parents left behind)

9
00:00:22,032 --> 00:00:23,464
(Why couldn't you

10
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:25,474
hang on a little longer?)

11
00:00:29,297 --> 00:00:30,094
Here you go.

12
00:00:30,874 --> 00:00:31,698
Alright.

13
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:35,452
What are you looking at?

14
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:46,895
It's not as much of a topic

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,934
as I imagined.

16
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:50,324
Comments on celebrity infidelity

17
00:00:50,349 --> 00:00:51,645
get much more attention.

18
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,263
You...

19
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:55,528
Once you found out

20
00:00:55,536 --> 00:00:57,073
you're not really an angel,

21
00:00:57,097 --> 00:00:58,934
did your language worsen?

22
00:01:01,634 --> 00:01:03,230
Well, it's only natural!

23
00:01:03,347 --> 00:01:04,982
People say whatever they want.

24
00:01:05,216 --> 00:01:06,797
They talk nonsense,

25
00:01:06,827 --> 00:01:08,181
and forget about it quickly.

26
00:01:09,394 --> 00:01:10,862
It's truly a great toy!

27
00:01:11,561 --> 00:01:12,781
It's irritating.

28
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:16,702
- Hey.
- Oh.

29
00:01:17,225 --> 00:01:18,412
Stop it, stop it.

30
00:01:18,771 --> 00:01:19,913
It's toxic to your wings.

31
00:01:21,078 --> 00:01:21,873
Yeah?

32
00:01:26,965 --> 00:01:28,547
Hey, pick up those seeds.

Wake up, Kouki-san!

00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,988

Rakugo?

40
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,176
Where did you get that?

41
00:02:39,176 --> 00:02:41,200
I found it at Takashina-san's house.

42
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,915
You wandered around and brought stuff

43
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,583
from someone else's room?

44
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,377
He couldn't see, so what's the big deal?

45
00:02:49,207 --> 00:02:51,463
Anyway, that's not important right now!

46
00:02:51,674 --> 00:02:53,382

an SNS account name or something.

Come on, I 'll search it,

so hand me your phone.

00:03:06,764 --> 00:03:07,604
Alright.

00:03:08,432 --> 00:03:09,189

Wow,

61
00:03:21,183 --> 00:03:22,411
you're a great detective, huh?

62
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:24,286
This is information even the police

63
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:25,584
haven't found, for sure.

70
00:03:41,025 --> 00:03:42,055
Huh?

71
00:03:42,133 --> 00:03:44,641
Well, that's too obvious, isn't it?

72
00:03:44,665 --> 00:03:45,600
Give it to me.

73
00:03:48,957 --> 00:03:49,825

(tks_jugem2)

79
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:03,618
It worked.

80
00:04:10,764 --> 00:04:11,984
To break through such

81
00:04:11,992 --> 00:04:13,023
a complex password,

82
00:04:13,047 --> 00:04:14,504
My, my, Koki-san,

83
00:04:14,528 --> 00:04:16,715
you must be a great detective!

84
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,518
There you go.

85
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:30,729
And so,

86
00:04:31,299 --> 00:04:33,732
by combining Takashina-san's story

87
00:04:34,184 --> 00:04:35,910
with the records left by his son,

88
00:04:35,935 --> 00:04:37,074
Takashi-kun,

89
00:04:38,118 --> 00:04:39,348
we learned a part of

90
00:04:39,373 --> 00:04:41,349
the memories lost by the angel.

91
00:04:41,388 --> 00:04:42,877
(Stop - Sorry - I didn't do anything)
(How did it come to this? - Forgive me)

92
00:04:43,525 --> 00:04:44,409
Hey!

93
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,089
Takashi, Takashi.

94
00:05:02,695 --> 00:05:03,359
Ah!

95
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,473
Here, we have a story from old Edo

96
00:05:06,897 --> 00:05:08,150
about a patient person

97
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:09,726
and an impatient person

98
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,854
getting along well.

99
00:05:13,706 --> 00:05:14,854
Hey, who is it?

100
00:05:14,878 --> 00:05:17,901
Who's the one peeping behind the door?

101
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:19,581
It's creepy. Return now.

102
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:20,303
Rakugo?

103
00:05:20,327 --> 00:05:21,279
I got it.

104
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,739
Are you trying to say it's weird?

105
00:05:22,763 --> 00:05:24,407
No, I didn't really think that.

106
00:05:24,752 --> 00:05:26,092
I was just wondering what

107
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,483
you're always listening to.

108
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,874
It's fate that we're next to each other,

109
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,417
so let's get along.

110
00:05:36,582 --> 00:05:37,928
I can't imagine our personalities

111
00:05:37,936 --> 00:05:38,951
meshing well.

112
00:05:38,975 --> 00:05:41,550
Don't say that.

113
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:42,342
Hey,

114
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,511
let's exchange contact info.

115
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:54,479
Let's call him

116
00:05:54,635 --> 00:05:56,314
A-kun, for now.

117
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,572
As opposed to the sound...

118
00:05:59,596 --> 00:06:00,671
Eventually, the two

119
00:06:00,687 --> 00:06:02,229
became close friends,

120
00:06:02,254 --> 00:06:03,718
and whenever A-kun had free time

121
00:06:03,743 --> 00:06:04,783
from club activities,

122
00:06:04,807 --> 00:06:06,179
they always seemed to be

123
00:06:06,204 --> 00:06:07,249
together at school.

124
00:06:08,797 --> 00:06:10,502
- Thank you for the meal.
- Thank you for the meal.

125
00:06:12,094 --> 00:06:13,832
I'm stuffed.

126
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,092
It's a thank-you.

127
00:06:24,271 --> 00:06:26,386
You always help me with my studies.

128
00:06:26,605 --> 00:06:27,470
Huh?

129
00:06:27,752 --> 00:06:28,831
You don't need to go

130
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:29,964
through the trouble.

131
00:06:30,536 --> 00:06:31,641
Wow.

132
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:37,939
Lame.

133
00:06:38,182 --> 00:06:39,540
If you don't want it, return it.

134
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,319
Ah! I want it! Please!

135
00:06:56,092 --> 00:06:56,875
Ah...

136
00:06:57,336 --> 00:06:58,543
Is something wrong?

137
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:01,963
Nothing.

138
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,257
Well...

139
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:09,721
This.

140
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:22,901
This is...

141
00:07:23,116 --> 00:07:25,405
(Fan keychain)

142
00:07:27,251 --> 00:07:28,865
I happened to find it while passing by.

143
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,368
Rakugo...

144
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,122
And it reminded me of you.

145
00:07:38,655 --> 00:07:39,960
But, well,

146
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,546
I never had a chance to give it to you.

147
00:07:46,071 --> 00:07:47,742
But if you don't want it, that's okay.

148
00:07:47,742 --> 00:07:48,677
I'm happy.

149
00:07:52,591 --> 00:07:53,848
Actually, I was

150
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,574
made fun of for liking rakugo before.

151
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,312
So,

152
00:07:59,844 --> 00:08:01,022
I'm really happy.

153
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,441
Thank you.

154
00:08:11,495 --> 00:08:12,367
I...

155
00:08:15,137 --> 00:08:16,246
think...

156
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:18,873
it's great that you can stick to

157
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,001
what you like.

158
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:35,515
Oh no, it's time for gym. Let's hurry.

159
00:08:36,331 --> 00:08:38,226
Forget it. Hurry up!

160
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,894
Never mind that. Come on!

161
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,692
And their circle of friends expanded.

162
00:08:45,793 --> 00:08:47,777
So I became close with A-kun's

163
00:08:47,802 --> 00:08:49,535
group of friends as well.

164
00:08:50,068 --> 00:08:51,281
Gimme that!

165
00:08:51,947 --> 00:08:53,324
- Yum!
- Hey!

166
00:08:53,348 --> 00:08:55,164
Delicious. Can I have more?

167
00:08:55,164 --> 00:08:56,077
No.

168
00:08:56,101 --> 00:08:57,871
- Isn't it fine?
- No.

169
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,394
You guys get along that well?

170
00:08:59,418 --> 00:09:00,081
Huh?

171
00:09:00,605 --> 00:09:01,875
Well,

172
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:03,144
we went to Takashina's

173
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,491
house the other day.

174
00:09:04,515 --> 00:09:05,336
House?

175
00:09:06,229 --> 00:09:06,941
Takashi's?

176
00:09:06,941 --> 00:09:07,964
Yeah.

177
00:09:08,245 --> 00:09:10,252
Takashina's gaming skills are insane.

178
00:09:10,252 --> 00:09:11,551
- Really?
- No.

179
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,261
- Mad skills.
- This guy was just too weak.

180
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,270
Huh?

181
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:15,742
Hey, shut up!

182
00:09:15,742 --> 00:09:16,973
Please stop!

183
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,141
Really?

184
00:09:18,219 --> 00:09:19,184
I see.

185
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,060
Can I go next time?

186
00:09:21,084 --> 00:09:21,978
Me too, me too.

187
00:09:22,002 --> 00:09:24,039
I'll beat all of you in one go.

188
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,063
I'll be the one who wipe them.

189
00:09:26,087 --> 00:09:27,984
- No, me.
- It's fine.

190
00:09:28,172 --> 00:09:29,209
Didn't you say

191
00:09:29,217 --> 00:09:30,743
you'll beat three of them?

192
00:09:30,775 --> 00:09:32,939
No. Sorry, I'll wipe everyone of you.

193
00:09:35,732 --> 00:09:36,910
From this time,

194
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:39,662
the kind A-kun had started to change

195
00:09:39,885 --> 00:09:41,956
and became cold towards me.

196
00:09:43,781 --> 00:09:44,751
Who?

197
00:09:44,993 --> 00:09:45,960
Here.

198
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,588
Just my type.

199
00:09:49,216 --> 00:09:51,382
She's too thin. I'm worried.

200
00:09:51,805 --> 00:09:54,094
So, what kind of girl do you like?

201
00:10:01,488 --> 00:10:02,352
What,

202
00:10:03,008 --> 00:10:04,564
you interested in that kind of stuff?

203
00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:05,313
Huh?

204
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,566
Cut it out. You won't be popular anyway.

205
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:10,985
And...

206
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,572
men doing that with each other is gross.

207
00:10:15,585 --> 00:10:16,449
Let's go.

208
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:19,369
Ah...

209
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:20,495
Yeah.

210
00:10:35,493 --> 00:10:40,013
(I don't get it)

211
00:11:02,642 --> 00:11:03,788
After that,

212
00:11:04,053 --> 00:11:05,623
A-kun's harassment

213
00:11:05,897 --> 00:11:07,125
seemed to

214
00:11:07,203 --> 00:11:08,793
intensify with each passing day.

215
00:11:09,287 --> 00:11:11,386
Hey.

216
00:11:11,926 --> 00:11:13,298
Could you please stop?

217
00:11:13,376 --> 00:11:14,549
Hey, you.

218
00:11:14,844 --> 00:11:17,886
It's not "could you please stop?"

219
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:19,762
Hey, are you even listening?

220
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:21,347
Hey.

221
00:11:21,475 --> 00:11:22,348
Hey,

222
00:11:23,122 --> 00:11:24,309
stop that.

223
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,313
What, are you defending him?

224
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,606
It's not that.

225
00:11:30,403 --> 00:11:32,108
I just thought it was noisy.

226
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:33,359
Just leave it.

227
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,319
But...

228
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:35,361
Huh?

229
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,773
Wait, is it that you like this guy?

230
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,619
I told you, it's not like that.

231
00:11:42,928 --> 00:11:44,037
How pitiful.

232
00:11:44,061 --> 00:11:45,121
I thought so.

233
00:11:45,364 --> 00:11:46,706
That's a shame.

234
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:50,001
Looks like you won't be getting a girl.

235
00:11:50,384 --> 00:11:51,252
Right?

236
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:53,671
Don't overthink it.

237
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,925
So similar.

238
00:11:57,619 --> 00:11:58,676
By the way,

239
00:11:58,887 --> 00:12:00,720
why are you treating him like an enemy?

240
00:12:00,744 --> 00:12:02,096
No particular reason.

241
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:03,451
Just felt like it.

242
00:12:03,475 --> 00:12:04,224
What?

243
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,352
I don't know either.

244
00:12:07,512 --> 00:12:08,770
You don't know?

245
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,140
(Annoying)
You don't know?

246
00:12:10,894 --> 00:12:11,796
It just how it is.

247
00:12:28,884 --> 00:12:48,138
(Oshino)

248
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:49,185
And so,

249
00:12:49,778 --> 00:12:51,479
during the night of the school trip...

250
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:01,531
Hey,

251
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,285
alone again?

252
00:13:06,556 --> 00:13:07,515
You are

253
00:13:07,906 --> 00:13:10,498
always alone unless I bother with you.

254
00:13:11,555 --> 00:13:12,709
You reek of alcohol.

255
00:13:13,534 --> 00:13:15,628
The old lady at the shop was forgetful.

256
00:13:18,156 --> 00:13:19,716
So I got it easily.

257
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,225
Drink it.

258
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,520
No, thank you.

259
00:13:35,837 --> 00:13:37,250
Come on, drink it!

260
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,801
- No!
- Just drink it!

261
00:13:38,801 --> 00:13:39,986
I said drink it!

262
00:13:40,126 --> 00:13:41,416
Drink it!

263
00:13:43,014 --> 00:13:44,866
Please stop!

264
00:14:05,868 --> 00:14:07,388
Pervert!

265
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:19,317
The hell are you saying?

266
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,072
You mocking me?

267
00:14:24,662 --> 00:14:25,656
I'm not mocking you.

268
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,075
You looked down on me, didn't you?

269
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,161
Come here.

270
00:14:34,472 --> 00:14:35,390
Jump.

271
00:14:37,766 --> 00:14:38,753
Go on.

272
00:14:39,493 --> 00:14:40,953
Try jumping.

273
00:14:41,717 --> 00:14:42,590
Hey!

274
00:14:44,637 --> 00:14:46,010
Scared?

275
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:48,096
Hey!

276
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,097
Sorry!

277
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,014
I'm sorry!

278
00:14:50,038 --> 00:14:52,558
I'm sorry!

279
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:53,935
I'm sorry!

280
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:01,275
Why did you get worked up?

281
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:03,528
Are you crazy?

282
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:09,742
Hey.

283
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,164
Hey, Takashi.

284
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,755
About earlier...

285
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:37,270
Huh?

286
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:47,029
No way...

287
00:16:16,474 --> 00:16:17,435
I don't dare look.

288
00:16:17,998 --> 00:16:20,479
I don't dare look down.

289
00:16:20,628 --> 00:16:26,819
I don't dare look...

290
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:44,328
Takashina-kun is here.

291
00:17:19,586 --> 00:17:20,926
(The victim held a grudge against

292
00:17:20,951 --> 00:17:21,848
the one who was with him)

293
00:17:21,872 --> 00:17:22,910
(The one who pushed him

294
00:17:22,935 --> 00:17:24,102
hasn't come to school since)

295
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,963
(Murderer. I can never forgive that)

296
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,879
People speculating, making irresponsible

297
00:17:31,904 --> 00:17:33,435
comments about the incident.

298
00:17:34,071 --> 00:17:35,596
Speculation becomes judgment,

299
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,765
from judgment to purging.

300
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,810
The crucible of justice and malice

301
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:43,229
became abnormally intensified.

302
00:17:52,943 --> 00:17:54,574
I deeply apologize.

303
00:17:54,762 --> 00:17:57,034
Why does your kid and you get to live,

304
00:17:57,538 --> 00:17:58,411
and our son...

305
00:17:59,448 --> 00:18:01,747
and our son has to die?

306
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,666
Why...

307
00:18:04,096 --> 00:18:06,544
I deeply apologize.

308
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,754
Replace him.

309
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,257
Even now, it's fine.

310
00:18:11,812 --> 00:18:13,342
We want you to replace him!

311
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,845
Replace him!

312
00:18:15,869 --> 00:18:16,759
You're right!

313
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:18,139
Replace him!

314
00:18:18,662 --> 00:18:19,662
A-kun's parents,

315
00:18:19,693 --> 00:18:20,927
who believed those rumors,

316
00:18:20,943 --> 00:18:22,185
threw tantrums.

317
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:23,446
(Life's over. What to do next?)

318
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,146
Social backlash.

319
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:25,980
(Not coming to school is telling)

320
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,004
Takashina-san seemed

321
00:18:28,348 --> 00:18:29,667
to have reached his limit

322
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,347
with the overflow of malice.

323
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:01,849
I understand.

324
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,686
Father was exhausted,

325
00:19:06,498 --> 00:19:09,065
and A-kun's parents couldn't accept it.

326
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:15,905
Everyone,

327
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:19,533
no one can help but blaming someone.

328
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:23,788
But

329
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:43,724
still...

330
00:19:45,111 --> 00:19:46,110
This is...

331
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,234
It's just so sad.

332
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,586
I feel like I can fly now.

333
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,725
I...

334
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,477
What should I do now?

335
00:20:30,524 --> 00:20:31,814
Even though I've glimpsed the past,

336
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,692
my memories haven't truly returned.

337
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,071
I see.

338
00:20:41,739 --> 00:20:44,410
It feels like I saw someone else's life.

339
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,120
I'm at a loss for how to react.

340
00:20:49,264 --> 00:20:50,541
A-kun

341
00:20:51,275 --> 00:20:53,294
liked you, huh?

342
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:56,714
Seems like it.

343
00:21:03,954 --> 00:21:05,249
Someone who distorts their

344
00:21:05,274 --> 00:21:06,750
own feelings and expresses it,

345
00:21:06,775 --> 00:21:08,058
I hate it.

346
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:10,269
But well...

347
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,396
It's because they're young.

348
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:22,173
I like it when people convey

349
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:23,860
their feelings straightforwardly.

350
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,291
If you're okay with it,

351
00:21:35,009 --> 00:21:36,086
you

352
00:21:36,899 --> 00:21:38,547
can stay with me forever.

353
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,659
Isn't it 'I want you to stay?'

354
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,348
You...

355
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:50,059
How shameless.

356
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:51,018
Come here!

357
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,270
Ouch!

358
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:54,980
That tickles!

359
00:21:55,725 --> 00:21:56,752
Geez!

360
00:21:56,776 --> 00:21:58,776
Please stop!

361
00:21:59,377 --> 00:22:01,654
Why is it so ticklish?

362
00:22:01,873 --> 00:22:03,948
Especially inside here.

363
00:22:04,182 --> 00:22:05,825
I hate it.

364
00:22:18,835 --> 00:22:20,881
It'd be bad if you didn't let me stay,

365
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,884
I don't want to leave.

366
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,263
Huh?

367
00:22:27,904 --> 00:22:29,557
Oh, how dumb.

368
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,560
I've said so much about A-kun,

369
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:36,021
so I thought I should be honest too.

370
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,440
Honest?

371
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:40,526
Where?

372
00:22:47,206 --> 00:22:48,701
I want to be by your side.

373
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,258
Sometimes I think...

374
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,427
Maybe the angel

375
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,446
is absorbing and

376
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:10,813
purifying my negative emotions.

377
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,351
Since this guy came,

378
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:17,855
I no longer think I want to die.

379
00:23:19,144 --> 00:23:20,145
On the contrary,

380
00:23:20,943 --> 00:23:22,234
it's the opposite.

381
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:26,655
Oh, right.

382
00:23:27,562 --> 00:23:28,449
I get it!

383
00:23:28,503 --> 00:23:29,575
I get it!

384
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,494
Kouki-san!

385
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,580
Please go out with me!

386
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,165
Huh?

387
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:45,460
(Next Episode)

388
00:23:45,553 --> 00:23:47,760
Life is about opening up to new things.

389
00:23:47,784 --> 00:23:49,094
Since I met you,

390
00:23:49,118 --> 00:23:51,118
it's the first time I feel so fulfilled.

391
00:23:51,142 --> 00:23:52,097
u-san,

392
00:23:52,152 --> 00:23:54,505
you can no longer be away from me.

393
00:23:54,529 --> 00:23:57,078
I want to have more fun

394
00:23:57,078 --> 00:23:57,938
with you.

395
00:23:57,938 --> 00:23:59,480
Kouki-san, amazing!
