Come in, come in.

21
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,480
Put them on the table.

22
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,320
I hope you’re not tired.

23
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,000
OK.

24
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,920
I’m fine.

25
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,400
Look what I’ve bought.

26
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,000
Are you used to living here?

27
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,680
Yes, sure I am.

28
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,440
It’s much better than the hotel.

29
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,000
I can cook here.

30
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,480
Glad to know.

31
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,640
Auntie,

32
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,040
I see you’re familiar with the place,

33
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,640
how come you didn’t know the way?

34
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,320
I just remembered it

35
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,720
while I was walking.

36
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,800
It’s the weekend.
You don’t work, I suppose.

37
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,640
No.

38
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,640
Then stay and have lunch with me.

39
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,000
Sure.

40
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,640
Food prices are high in the cities.

41
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,560
These vegetables cost me four yuan.

42
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,520
I’ve got lots of these
in my vegetable plot.

43
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,000
More than we could eat.

44
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,040
Auntie, you’ve got your own plot!

45
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,040
Cool!

46
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,760
Rice,

47
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,760
eggplant, potatoes, cucumbers.

48
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,160
I can plant all of them,

49
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,680
with home-made

50
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,480
farmyard manure.

51
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,880
They’re very popular
among urban dwellers.

52
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,840
They call them

53
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,400
green and natural.

54
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,240
Do you want some? I can mail you some.

55
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,400
Me?

56
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,920
I can’t cook.

57
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,520
But I can learn.

58
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,840
Learning how to cook is good.

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,160
Girls should take care of themselves.

60
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,280
But in my family, Wenbo…

61
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,000
He really knows how to cook.

62
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,520
He can teach you later.

63
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,440
Great!

64
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,160
Xia,

65
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,120
how old are you?

66
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,880
I’m turning 26 this year,

67
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,760
born in the Year of the Dog.

68
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,720
Born in the Year of the Dog?

69
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,760
Wenbo was born in the Year of the Horse.

70
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,520
The Year of the Dog is good.

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,680
It matches well with him.

72
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,360
Xia,

73
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,920
are you dating someone?

74
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,440
No.

75
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,400
Is it OK for the boy to be
4 years older than you?

76
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,760
I’m quite straightforward.

77
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,960
Tell me.

78
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,040
Do you have a crush

79
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,480
on Wenbo?

80
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,280
I…

81
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,200
You don’t?

82
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,200
Yes, yes…

83
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,840
I do, I do…

84
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,040
I really like him.

85
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,920
He’s a silly lad.

86
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,680
What do you see in him?

87
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,320
I find him silly but cute,

88
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,360
good-natured and honest,

89
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,800
and courageous.

90
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,200
He’s good in so many ways.

91
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,480
Now that you like him, let’s do this.

92
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,320
My son has a thick head,

93
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,440
requiring some push

94
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,840
to understand this.

95
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,680
Auntie, I think

96
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,880
I’ve already pushed him enough,

97
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,240
except for following him every day

98
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,440
and chasing after him.

99
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,510
You weren’t doing this in the right way.

100
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,720
This time, I’ll help.

101
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,600
You’ve got enough assistance.

102
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,520
Auntie,

103
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,720
if Wenbo is half as direct as you are,

104
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,600
I would’ve made it.

105
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,760
Wenbo is just as simple as his father.

106
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,240
Common girls

107
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,480
aren’t able to hit on him.

108
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,840
Omelette is his favorite.

109
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,960
Do you want to learn?

110
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,040
Mi,

111
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,440
is there anything else
you want me to do?

112
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,480
Off you go.

113
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,160
Go find your idol.

114
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,560
Your heart’s not here.

115
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,880
It’s no use keeping you here. Go.

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,500
OK.

117
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,080
I’m leaving.

118
00:04:59,200 --> 00:04:59,880
Go.

119
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,520
♪Give me a bottle of wine♪

120
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,480
Mom, I’m back.

121
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,160
Xia,

122
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,680
how come you… you… you are here?

123
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,520
I was out doing shopping and I got lost.

124
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,520
Thankfully, Xia sent me back home.

125
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,760
The food market is right downstairs.

126
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,960
Back in our home, you walked 1.5 km,

127
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,160
and you knew your way perfectly.

128
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,640
But there are so many roads in the city,

129
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,360
nothing like in the countryside,

130
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,600
where one only needs to go straight
down the road.

131
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,200
What is it?

132
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,920
Are you complaining about your mom not
being in the city before?

133
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,120
No… no… I didn’t mean that.

134
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:39,880
I’m just saying if you

135
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,000
have any trouble, just tell me.

136
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,480
Xia is very busy at work.

137
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,090
You...

138
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,640
It’s OK. I’m not busy recently.

139
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,640
Tell you?

140
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,040
Whenever you’re in operation,

141
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,480
you turn off your mobile.

142
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,280
How could I ever reach you?

143
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,600
Come to the table for lunch.

144
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,200
Hey…

145
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,720
taste the omelette.

146
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,720
Is it good?

147
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,400
OK.

148
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,360
Mom,

149
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,440
it’s a little salty.

150
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,800
Compared with
what you made back at home,

151
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,560
this is awful.

152
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,440
See…

153
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,160
Its shape is strange.

154
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,440
This was cooked by me

155
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,360
with Auntie’s help.

156
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,800
I probably added too much salt.

157
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,440
I think it’s delicious.

158
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,080
You sweat a lot in the day.

159
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,560
Eating more salt is good.

160
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,680
After a few more bites,
I don’t find it salty.

161
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,680
It’s pretty good.

162
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,680
Take more. Make yourself at home.

163
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,640
We are like a family.

164
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,360
Eat, eat.

165
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,560
Mom,

166
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,920
girls in the city

167
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,200
all pay attention to keeping fit
and losing pounds.

168
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,680
Why bother losing pounds?

169
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,320
She’s so slender already.

170
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,400
A good appetite is a blessing. Get it?

171
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,600
Plus,

172
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,680
being too thin makes it hard
to get pregnant.

173
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,560
Mom,

174
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,400
she’s a young girl.

175
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,520
Besides, fat or thin,

176
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,960
it’s none of your business.

177
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,400
Have your meal.

178
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,120
How come it has nothing to do with me?

179
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,800
It has everything to do with me.

180
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,360
Here, come on.

181
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,960
Thank you, Auntie.

182
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,720
Enough… enough…

183
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,400
Drink it.

184
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,920
Drink it and your hearts will be

185
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,440
linked together forever.

186
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,720
Ignore her. Eat.

187
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,320
Hello?

188
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,800
Yes,

189
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,880
I’ve found another date

190
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,760
for Wenbo.

191
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,000
Wenbo has a date.

192
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,280
There’s no need.

193
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,320
What?

194
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,480
Since when?

195
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,160
They just got together.

196
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,360
She’s from the city. A great girl.

197
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,840
Pretty and all. She’s a journalist.

198
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,000
Well-educated.

199
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,280
She just took me to have my hair curled.

200
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:51,840
Mom.

201
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,960
Auntie, my mother was talking nonsense.

202
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,120
Leave me alone. I was talking.

203
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,880
What can I say?

204
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,160
Stop poking your nose
into others’ business.

205
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,320
Wenbo is very popular in the city.

206
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,920
Quite a catch.

207
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,600
Mom, could you stop

208
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,400
talking nonsense to my auntie?

209
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,640
It’s all nonsense.

210
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,200
That’s because she’s so unreliable.

211
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,760
She

212
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,760
introduced Wenbo to a girl last year,

213
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,000
who arrived at my house,

214
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,240
and left immediately

215
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,720
because it’s not new.

216
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,800
Such a disgrace

217
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,120
to my face!

218
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,720
How can I get on in the village?

219
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,410
Right?

220
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:23,960
Right.

221
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,120
Never should we cave in to such people.

222
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,440
Exactly.

223
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,320
Xia,

224
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,840
you aren’t a snob like her, right?

225
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,480
Don’t worry, Auntie.
I have my own house.

226
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,600
I’m finished.

227
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,790
You take your time.

228
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,760
Ignore him. Let’s eat.

229
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,480
Come on.

230
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,270
Auntie, look,

231
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:46,140
it’s actually really simple.

232
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,160
These small animal icons.

233
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,320
When three of the same type

234
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,360
are linked together,

235
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,440
they’re removed.

236
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,920
You have a try.

237
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,920
He volunteered to do the dishes.

238
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,520
My son is not bad, right?

239
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,680
So you can enjoy your life,

240
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,120
with such a good son.

241
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,880
How to do this?

242
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,640
Like…

243
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:08,800
this…

244
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,560
Right.

245
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,080
Actually,

246
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,120
if Wenbo

247
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,680
gets very busy at work

248
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,760
and doesn’t have time for you,

249
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,440
you can

250
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,480
play Anipop

251
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,840
to kill the time. It’s great!

252
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,880
I don’t have this on my phone.

253
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,560
I’ll wait for you to come

254
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,320
and lend it to me.

255
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,280
What’s the matter with your neck?

256
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,640
How come it turns red?

257
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,040
It’s quite itchy.

258
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,080
Wenbo, come quick and take a look.

259
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,720
What’s wrong with Xia’s neck?

260
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,160
What’s going on?

261
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,680
Look!

262
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,840
It’s an allergy.

263
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,040
After eating the omelette?

264
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,200
I’m allergic to eggs.

265
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,480
You can’t eat eggs?

266
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,640
How come you didn’t say it?

267
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,080
Don’t… don’t scratch it!

268
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,000
How about this?
Let me take you to the hospital.

269
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,200
I’m OK… OK.

270
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,000
I’ll get some ointment.

271
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,320
I’ve checked for you.

272
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,800
It’s just a mild allergy.

273
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,520
Taking meds for a couple of days
will do.

274
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,600
Thank you! Mi Ka.

275
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,520
It’s just quite itchy.

276
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,720
Don’t scratch.

277
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,560
It’s itchy.

278
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,360
Why were you being so careless?

279
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,240
Just a small piece of omelette.

280
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,760
I thought it’d be fine.

281
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,440
Wenbo’s mom gave it to me.

282
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,000
I’d be awkward if I didn’t take it.

283
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,040
What magic portion on earth

284
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,160
has Shu Wenbo fed you,

285
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,360
so you can’t refuse

286
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,160
the omelette from his mother?

287
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,160
I tell you, it’s different this time.

288
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,600
Auntie likes me a lot.

289
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,880
Fine. She likes you.

290
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:40,920
Everyone likes you.

291
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,280
I’ll pick you up later then.

292
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,560
Don’t come!

293
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,760
Mi Ka.

294
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,800
Oh, you’re tied up and can’t pick me up.

295
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,040
OK, OK.

296
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,760
You finish your work first.

297
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,160
Don’t worry about me.

298
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,120
Bye-bye.

299
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,920
Is it Dr. Mi?

300
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,080
She’s busy.

301
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,680
I’ve got the meds.

302
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,840
Thanks.

303
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,640
Let’s go.

304
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,760
What can I say?

305
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,280
It’s quite serious!

306
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,440
It hurts?

307
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,000
I’m… I’m sorry. I’ll be gentle.

308
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,120
Should I apply some there?

309
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,120
It doesn’t hurt this time, I suppose.

310
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,360
It’s done.

311
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,160
Remember.

312
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,400
Do take the western meds.

313
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,200
You should have been more careful.

314
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,040
Knowing that

315
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,120
you’re allergic to eggs,

316
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,360
you shouldn’t have eaten it.

317
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,360
Health is the foundation for work.

318
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,080
Being like this, work will be affected.

319
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,440
I was just trying to have a taste.

320
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,120
Why did you want to taste?

321
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,520
Because Auntie told me you like it.

322
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,600
I wanted to know

323
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,080
how your favorite taste is like.

324
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,320
My mom is like that.

325
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,440
You mustn’t take her words

326
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,400
too seriously.

327
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,280
I know what she meant.

328
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,840
She knew I like you,

329
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,680
so she wanted to help set us up.

330
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,920
Why are you behaving so shocked?

331
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,480
It’s not like you just knew

332
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,560
I like you.

333
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,760
It’s just I said it to you
for the first time.

334
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,200
Em, I was just thinking…

335
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,760
Forget about it.

336
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,480
Don’t say this or that.

337
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,800
I know now you

338
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,800
haven’t accepted me.

339
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,360
But it’s OK.

340
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,760
I’ll try.

341
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,160
I’ll wait.

342
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,280
I’ll prove to you

343
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,600
me, Ruan Qingxia, is a good girl.

344
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,040
It does you no harm to be with me.

345
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,680
I… I… I know.

346
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,840
You’re a really good girl.

347
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,720
I… I…

348
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,400
well...

349
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,600
I… I’m home.

350
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,080
I’m leaving then.

351
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,120
You’re home?

352
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,720
Your home’s here?

353
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:19,920
If I told you just now

354
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,600
I arrived,

355
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,800
would you still be here,

356
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,120
applying meds for me?

357
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,160
You… you…

358
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,640
Don’t sigh!

359
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,880
I’ve got more tricks!

360
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,520
I’m…

361
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,160
You just saw it today.

362
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,520
Hello, Captain Xing.

363
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,160
Yes!

364
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,360
I’ll be right over!

365
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,840
Help!

366
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,680
Coming… coming…

367
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,080
-Help!
-Be careful!

368
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,000
-Help!
-Quick!

369
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,830
Help!

370
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:19,730
-Help! Help!
-Coming. Coming.

371
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,400
Help! Help!

372
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:21,660
Come on.

373
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,200
This way, this way.

374
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,240
Come on.

375
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:23,960
(Emergency Room)

376
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,040
Come, this way.

377
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,160
Be quick! This way.

378
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,060
Be careful!

379
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:27,680
Here.

380
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,520
-Be careful!
-Slow down.

381
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,120
This way.

382
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,160
Slow down.

383
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:35,860
How is it?

384
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,760
All saved.

385
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:37,960
What happened?

386
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,000
Didn’t you go to the meeting?

387
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,640
There was an accident.

388
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,560
People panicked when evacuating.

389
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,880
A stampede.

390
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,320
What? What accident?

391
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,560
Someone kidnapped

392
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,800
Xuan Meiqi.

393
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,120
Mi Ka, what should we do?

394
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,070
I saw Xing Kelei

395
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:51,820
and the Special Police

396
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,760
were all called out.

397
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,680
That scoundrel was vicious.

398
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,040
I… I’ll make a call.

399
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,880
(Xing Kelei)
Which surgeon is on duty today?

400
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,560
Me.

401
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,680
Dr. Mi.

402
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,400
There’s a

403
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,800
kidnapping in the suburb.

404
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,720
Most probably,

405
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,640
there will be casualties.

406
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,120
The police requests emergency support.

407
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,400
OK. Let’s go.

408
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,700
(Ambulance)

409
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,680
Attention, please!

410
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,680
The traffic is heavy here.

411
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,520
Forcing it to pull over is not possible.

412
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,240
All vehicles, keep your distance!

413
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,680
Has the suspect been identified?

414
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,040
The suspect is Lyu Fan.

415
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,720
He’s a big fan of the kidnapee.

416
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,840
According to her manager,

417
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,760
this man

418
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,200
used to harass the victim often.

419
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,400
He chased her car, followed her,

420
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,320
and even stayed overnight
around her place.

421
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,880
But they were considered
as fan behaviors,

422
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,560
and didn’t get

423
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,000
enough attention.

424
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,520
This time, Lyu Fan

425
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,600
disguised as a driver,

426
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,600
and after the show’s finished,

427
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,720
he kidnapped Xuan Meiqi.

428
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,520
Plus, according to the informant,

429
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,880
Lyu Fan said he

430
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,000
had explosives on himself.

431
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:31,840
Xing Kelei,

432
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,320
we mustn’t allow the explosives

433
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,600
to get set off in the downtown area.

434
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,280
Roger that.

435
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,160
We plan to lead him

436
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,960
to some empty place in the suburb.

437
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,800
Firing is authorized if necessary.

438
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,720
Repeat.

439
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,640
Firing is authorized.

440
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,360
Roger that.

441
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:47,880
All vehicles

442
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,920
coordinate to corner
the suspect’s vehicle

443
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,280
to the exit of the eastern suburb

444
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,320
two km ahead.

445
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,080
It’s Jiangning Special Police.

446
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,400
You’ve been surrounded.

447
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,120
Put down your weapon
and release the hostage.

448
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,000
I repeat.

449
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,680
Put down your weapon immediately.

450
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,040
Release the hostage.

451
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,630
Go, go, go.

452
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:38,690
-Go, go, go.
-There, there.

453
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,320
I have explosives on me!

454
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,480
If you get close, I’ll set them off.

455
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,480
Sniper in position.

456
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,640
Clear for shooting.

457
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,200
Sniper No.2 in position.

458
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,480
Lyu Fan, don’t act on impulse.

459
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,720
We can negotiate.

460
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,800
What do you want?

461
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,480
I want her to annul

462
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,920
her engagement with that man.

463
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,040
What?

464
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,680
How could you be like this?

465
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,640
Don’t you know

466
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,200
the man’s a scoundrel?

467
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,800
What fund company?

468
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,760
It’s all fake.

469
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,400
He’s a liar.

470
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,820
(Ambulance)

471
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:16,960
Captain Hao,

472
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:17,800
this Lyu Fan

473
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,520
turns out to be the property man.

474
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,680
This bomb

475
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,680
is very probably to be fake.

476
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,240
Sniper not advised.

477
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,560
Can you confirm?

478
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,160
Yes.

479
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,600
Meiqi?

480
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,960
What’s wrong with you?

481
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,480
How come you’re here?

482
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,240
Back off.

483
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,520
It’s not safe here.

484
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,840
That Xuan Meiqi has asthma.

485
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,080
She’s about to have an attack.

486
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:43,640
Look!

487
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,880
When did this happen?

488
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,680
Today.

489
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:46,880
Oh my goodness.

490
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,600
Manman.

491
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,480
This is the list of patients
to be transferred to Neurosurgery.

492
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,240
Take a look and sign your name.

493
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:50,800
OK.

494
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,600
Yes.

495
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,600
I hope it’s OK.

496
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,440
(Police and Hospital
Jointly Save the Hostage)

497
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,600
My gosh. It’s horrible!

498
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,640
Hope they get caught asap.

499
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,680
Me, too.

500
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,000
I’m wondering
what it’s like in the field.

501
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,840
Patients sent to ER

502
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
get treated here.

503
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,480
Wait.

504
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,600
I’m wondering
what it’s like in the field.

505
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,480
Me, too.

506
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,720
Are you all gathered here to keep warm?

507
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,160
Have the wounded patients

508
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,360
all been registered?

509
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,640
Go, go, go.

510
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,440
OK…

511
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,840
Isn’t that Mi Ka?

512
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,440
Why’s Dr. Mi there?

513
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,440
-Just now. It slipped.
-Just a second.

514
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,480
All right.

515
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,680
You’re not in the field.

516
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,600
What’s the point

517
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,360
of looking here?

518
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,680
Mind your own business.

519
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,080
Mi Ka also went there?

520
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,280
Yes, with Zhou.

521
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,600
He’s still mentally fuzzy.

522
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,110
The indicators don’t look good.

523
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:37,920
I’ll keep you informed.

524
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,560
OK.

525
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,840
What’s wrong? Are you OK?

526
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,840
Lyu Fan,

527
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,440
don’t get impulsive.

528
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,240
We only need to confirm

529
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,560
if Xuan Meiqi is OK.

530
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,680
What’s wrong with her?

531
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,310
Captain Hao,

532
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,960
Xuan Meiqi does have asthma.

533
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,000
Just now, Lyu Fan,

534
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,160
in the process of kidnapping,

535
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,520
is very likely
to have used diethyl ether,

536
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:55,310
and triggered the attack.

537
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,280
Keep the hostage safe.

538
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,280
Updates on the suspect

539
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,120
have been obtained.

540
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:58,800
Sent over to you right away.

541
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,600
OK. Roger that.

542
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,320
Captain Xing,

543
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,240
this Lyu Fan

544
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,760
is a big fan of Xuan Meiqi.

545
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,400
He wouldn’t hope Xuan Meiqi to die.

546
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,280
We can negotiate with him

547
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,480
to let the doctor go over.

548
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,360
Li Nian,

549
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,000
get changed into a doctor’s outfit.

550
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:15,800
Roger that.

551
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,320
Nian,

552
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,680
be safe!

553
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,000
Dr. Mi,

554
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:21,920
do you have

555
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,280
meds for asthma?

556
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,120
There’s an oxygen device
in the ambulance.

557
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,760
Some oxygen
will help relieve the symptom.

558
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,360
It’s OK.

559
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,520
It will be OK soon.

560
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,600
The doctor’s on the way.

561
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,720
It’s OK.

562
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,720
Freeze.

563
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,640
No male doctor!

564
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,080
Female doctor!

565
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,200
What are you trying to do?

566
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,280
I’m trying to help!

567
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,480
Saving her is our responsibility.

568
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,680
You’re no police.

569
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,560
Should there be any potential danger,

570
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,000
I won’t let you go.

571
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,880
I’m a doctor.

572
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,560
This is my job.

573
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,920
If Xuan Meiqi’s life is at risk

574
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,400
because of asthma,

575
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,280
your mission will fail.

576
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,160
Lyu Fan,

577
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,840
we’ve got an ambulance here.

578
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,000
I hope you don’t act on impulse.

579
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,560
She’s in a very bad condition now.

580
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,520
You can choose

581
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,320
to let her get in the ambulance first.

582
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,240
You all shut up!

583
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,240
I want a doctor,

584
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,520
a female doctor.

585
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,200
Get me a female doctor.

586
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,160
Don’t be impulsive!

587
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,480
The doctor’s on her way.

588
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,560
I’ll go with you.

589
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,800
Captain Hao,

590
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,560
the camera’s ready.

591
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,440
Take a look.

592
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,280
Wear the face shield!

593
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,640
Evacuate immediately!

594
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,560
Don’t linger!

595
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,400
Got it.

596
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,560
Wear the face shield!

597
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,080
Evacuate immediately! Don’t linger!

598
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,560
Say something.

599
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,960
Say… say what?

600
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:48,040
Xing Kelei.

601
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,560
Roger that.

602
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,600
I’m here.

603
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,080
You’ll be fine.

604
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:10,880
I’m here.

605
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,960
You’ll be fine.

606
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:31,920
Look,

607
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,010
there…

608
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,610
What’s going on?

609
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,640
Zoom in

610
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,720
scene No.9.

611
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,360
Police, stop!

612
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,360
Send… send that female doctor here.

613
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,360
Be quick!

614
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,400
It’s OK.

615
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,120
It’ll be OK soon.

616
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:34,920
Captain Hao,

617
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:35,920
Mi Ka is now

618
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,080
close to the vehicle.

619
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,120
Come on.

620
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,920
Wear the oxygen mask first.

621
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,000
Be quick!

622
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,560
Okay.

623
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:46,760
It’s OK.

624
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,480
It’ll be OK soon.

625
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,600
The bomb isn’t connected
to the main switchboard.

626
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,640
It’s fake.

627
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,640
Roger that.

628
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,320
Captain Hao,

629
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,920
there’s no connection
to the main switchboard.

630
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,360
It won’t cause a short circuit

631
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,360
to set off the bomb.

632
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,640
Over.

633
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,360
Wenbo, come with me.

634
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,080
Let me debug the device.

635
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:12,840
Excuse me.

636
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,800
It’s OK.

637
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,400
Relax.

638
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,080
Breathe with me.

639
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,520
Breathe.

640
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,600
Do you feel any better?

641
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,520
Any better?

642
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,120
She’s not good.

643
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,160
She really needs to go to the hospital.

644
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,960
It’s just a temporary relief.

645
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,080
You’re no longer needed. Go!

646
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,520
-She’ll die like this.
-Go away!

647
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,240
Your… your hand’s injured.

648
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,400
Let me bind it up.

649
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,400
You can’t marry him!

650
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,240
He’s a scoundrel!

651
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,200
You can’t marry him!

652
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,240
Just now,

653
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,560
the kidnapper has been subdued,

654
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,880
and locked into the police car.

655
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,880
And we’re informed

656
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,840
(Police and Hospital Jointly)
that a female doctor

657
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,920
(Save the Hostage)
coordinated with the Police

658
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,000
and brought the operation

659
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,320
to its success.

660
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,240
We pay our heartfelt tribute

661
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,080
to this brave female doctor.

662
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,440
And at this moment, she’s still here,

663
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,640
treating the injured police.

664
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,120
The wound is quite deep.

665
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,680
It requires several stitches.

666
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,280
You made so many calls.

667
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,400
I was

668
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,320
at the hospital,

669
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,760
and when I got the task,

670
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,840
I wanted to call you and ask

671
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,600
what’s going on.

672
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,040
That’s it?

673
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:27,840
It’s done.

674
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,600
OK.

675
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:33,840
Xing Kelei.

676
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,520
Captain.

677
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,240
It’s almost done.

678
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,760
You get your things done first.

679
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,600
Your technique

680
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:58,920
is improved.

681
00:28:59,200 --> 00:28:59,760
Thanks!

682
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:26,960
I’m here.

683
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,840
You’ll be fine.

684
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,280
Wear the face shield!

685
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,480
Evacuate immediately! Don’t linger!

686
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,960
Xing Kelei.

687
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,160
Hello.

688
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,120
Xia,

689
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,800
if I had dreams about someone,

690
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,720
what does it mean?

691
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,200
Did you dream about me?

692
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,320
It means you miss me.

693
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,400
I dreamed about

694
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,880
that special policeman
from two years ago.

695
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,000
He looked just like Xing Kelei.

696
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,640
Xing Kelei?

697
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,440
For real?

698
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,400
It’s real. Did I get

699
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,560
too nervous today?

700
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,520
So I dreamed about him.

701
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,160
No, wait a second.

702
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,280
Weren’t you obsessed with that

703
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,160
special policeman?

704
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,560
How come it suddenly

705
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,080
changes to Xing Kelei?

706
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,360
You hope it’s him?

707
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,080
I…

708
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,880
I don’t know.

709
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,440
Don’t try to mess with me.

710
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,480
Think about it.

711
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,120
When you heard

712
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,080
he was called out,

713
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,360
did you get really nervous?

714
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,640
And you instantly wanted to know

715
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,960
what’s going on with him?

716
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,000
But I worried about him as a friend.

717
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,720
Come on!

718
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,600
I think you’re trapped.

719
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,200
If Captain Xing

720
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,440
goes after you now,

721
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,360
what would you do?

722
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,480
He goes after me?

723
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,000
Impossible.

724
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,680
You need to ask him

725
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,440
to confirm it.

726
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,560
How about this?

727
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,720
You find another chance to confirm it.

728
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,280
OK.

729
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,440
It’s late. Go back to sleep.

730
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,520
Leave it to tomorrow.

731
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,520
Bye.

732
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,440
How can I check this?

733
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:08,840
OK.

734
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,640
Thank you, Captain Hao.

735
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:12,760
Bye, then.

736
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,160
You seem so happy.

737
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,360
What did Captain Hao say?

738
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,840
Good news for me.

739
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,440
Bad news for you.

740
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,400
Which one do you want to hear first?

741
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,920
Why am I involved?

742
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,440
Well, then my bad news.

743
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,760
Training for the next 3 days

744
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,320
will all be led by you,

745
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,640
including mine.

746
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,160
Why?

747
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,760
Because I’m injured.

748
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,840
Captain Hao gave me

749
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,440
a three-day leave.

750
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,560
It’s true that you need some good rest.

751
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,560
By the way,

752
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,080
have you sorted out all these documents?

753
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,040
All done.

754
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,120
This case is taken seriously.

755
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,520
It will be an example for a series of

756
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,520
training on emergency response.

757
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,600
But we’re counting on you.

758
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,640
Consider it done!

759
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,640
Three days.

760
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,760
What should I do then?

761
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,040
You’re

762
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,440
on sick leave.

763
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,400
How’s your hand?

764
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,760
Dinner together, what do you say?

765
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,520
Are you crazy?

766
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,480
Why would I dine with you
on this hard-earned holiday?

767
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,560
I’ve got plans.

768
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,520
I’m leaving.

769
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,920
I think you’re…

770
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,420
One, two, three, four.

771
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,300
(Climbing Building)

772
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,640
Shu Wenbo!

773
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,880
It’s 12:30 PM.

774
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,800
Have you finished training?

775
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,240
If you have,

776
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,520
let’s dine together!

777
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,160
I’m not finished yet.

778
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,360
I’ll pass.

779
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,480
You eat by yourself.

780
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,200
If you won’t go, I won’t either.

781
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,600
I’ll wait until you finish,

782
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,720
and go with me.

783
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,670
This video of you climbing down.

784
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,440
If it’s put on TikTok,

785
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,040
it will be a big hit.

786
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:19,840
You looked great.

787
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,440
Now, shall we

788
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,880
go to the canteen together?

789
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,120
It suddenly occurred to me

790
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,000
I’ve got a meeting
in the municipal bureau this afternoon.

791
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,320
I’m running late,

792
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,920
so I’ll pass.

793
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,760
Off from work?

794
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,000
How come you’re here?

795
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,640
Let’s go.

796
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,280
Where to?

797
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,600
You’ve done us such a big favor.

798
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,680
I’ll treat you

799
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:12,880
to a dinner.

800
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,320
What shall we eat?

801
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,840
Get in the car first.

802
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Maybe I’ll pass.

803
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,760
I’m going home tonight

804
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,000
to handle some documents.

805
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:24,920
Right.

806
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,520
Let’s eat at home.

807
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,360
Let’s go.

808
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,840
He said he’d treat me to dinner,

809
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,960
and then we’re at home.

810
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:16,840
And now

811
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:17,760
we’ve bought a pile of things.

812
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,240
He’s cooking now.

813
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,280
Doesn’t this look good?

814
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,040
No, it’s his place.

815
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,280
What if he’s doesn’t want to go

816
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,440
after it’s all finished?

817
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,880
That’s true.

818
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,720
After all, it’s his place.

819
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,600
Exactly.

820
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,880
When he rented the place,
he just asked me

821
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,160
to stay clear of his room.

822
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,800
But he didn’t say anything

823
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,840
about refusing his stay here.

824
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,600
Yes.

825
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,080
No!

826
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,880
There are only me and him here.

827
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,920
Isn’t that good?

828
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:45,840
Good?

829
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,240
I really don’t think
you understand my situation.

830
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,000
It’s no use making this call to you.

831
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,360
Dr. Mi.

832
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,880
Dr. Mi!

833
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,240
Coming!

834
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,800
I’m hanging up.

835
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,760
He asked for me. Let me see.

836
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:10,800
Bye.

837
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,000
Em.

838
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:17,640
What?

839
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,080
Help me with this.

840
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,720
My… my hand…

841
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,680
Done.

842
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:56,880
Thanks.

843
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,840
Anything else I could help?

844
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,840
Em…

845
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,240
Do you have water?

846
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,080
I’m thirsty.

847
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,560
You… you stand there.

848
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,680
OK.

849
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,480
You, you go ahead with your stuff.

850
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,120
My stuff?

851
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,800
Get them washed.

852
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,160
Give me a tomato.

Join me in a toast.

876
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:04,960
First of all,

877
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,680
thank you very much.

878
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,160
If it weren’t for you,

879
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,440
and your accurate judgement,

880
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,280
we’d never know
how things would be like.

881
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:14,920
You helped me,

882
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,120
and saved her.

883
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,080
Why do you get so serious suddenly?

884
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,360
I’m not used to this.

885
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,680
I’m a serious man
doing serious business.

886
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,680
Certainly I speak seriously.

887
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:30,720
Yes.

888
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,880
Then, I’d also like to say thank you.

889
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,240
Captain Xing, you went all out.

890
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,760
Actually, you took on most of the job.

891
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,880
I was merely coordinating with you.

892
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,560
If it weren’t for you

893
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,760
risking your lives,

894
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,360
then we couldn’t have

895
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,080
brought Xuan Meiqi back

896
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,080
safe and sound.

897
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,720
Come on.
Let’s save the false politeness.

898
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,600
Let’s eat!

899
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,440
How does it taste?

900
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,480
Delicious.

901
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,200
Did you often handle

902
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,840
dangerous cases like
that one from yesterday?

903
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,240
Actually, that case

904
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,560
doesn’t count

905
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,960
as dangerous to us.

906
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,880
Then in your memory,

907
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,280
which case

908
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,120
is the most dangerous and impressive?

909
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,320
And how is it like?

910
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,240
My most impressive case

911
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,280
would be my first one,

912
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,440
when I served as the sniper.

913
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,640
That was a burglary.

914
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,520
The robber had his knife

915
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,560
on the hostage’s neck.

916
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,280
Up close like this.

917
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,080
But at that time,

918
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,800
a surprise attack was not possible.

919
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,000
So I was asked to do sniper attack.

920
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,560
You know about

921
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,200
the old-fashioned anti-theft door,

922
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,920
with the iron window on top.

923
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,720
I was supposed to

924
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,440
make my call

925
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,560
through the narrow gap,

926
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,640
and shoot the robber dead.

927
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,000
Did you make it?

928
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:00,920
Yes.

929
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:02,680
Did you

930
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,680
get really nervous?

931
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,520
Actually,

932
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,280
I didn’t feel nervous
during the operation.

933
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,560
But after it was finished,

934
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,120
I was quite scared afterwards,

935
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,760
because that shot of mine

936
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,320
could very probably decide

937
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,280
one man’s fate.

938
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,600
Be it the robber’s fate,

939
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,320
or the hostage’s.

940
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,600
Yes, indeed.
