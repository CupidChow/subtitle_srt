=You Are My Hero=

19
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,940
=Episode 16=

20
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,280
Has the old couple settled in?

21
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,360
Yes.

22
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,960
They’re taking a break.

23
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,480
Grandpa was

24
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,120
acting like a child just now.

25
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,520
He simply must eat Oil-spraying Noodles.

26
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,040
None of us could handle it.

27
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,480
But Grandma nailed it

28
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,280
within 2 minutes.

29
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,440
What they said is true.

30
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,240
“When you truly love someone,

31
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,480
you’ll fully accept
and adore him/her, flaws and all.”

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,200
After Grandpa got sick,

33
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,560
he could barely remember

34
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,680
things and people.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,200
But he still remembered his wife

36
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,240
named Zhang Guihua.

37
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,880
Before I arrived,

38
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,000
people from the rescue site
of Mingyue Village

39
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:06,840
told me that

40
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,320
he had told everyone that

41
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,960
his wife’s name is Zhang Guihua

42
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,280
and he has been looking for her.

43
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,200
Even if he forgets the whole world,

44
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,520
he can’t forget his wife.

45
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,480
Right.

46
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,280
Sit down.

47
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,160
OK.

48
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,600
I got a question for you.

49
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,600
Go ahead.

50
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,800
The other night,

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,280
what did you say exactly

52
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,680
when you came to deliver the cookies?

53
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,800
I kept my headphones on
to edit the footage

54
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,320
and didn’t hear anything you said.

55
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,280
And I raised my head,

56
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,640
only to find that you’ve ran away.

57
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,880
So, that explains it.

58
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,680
What exactly did you say?

59
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,000
I specifically went to

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,880
apologize to you.

61
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,360
I thought you were so angry

62
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,680
that you deliberately ignored me.

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,120
That’s why you left?

64
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,320
What else?

65
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,720
How perfunctory

66
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,840
your apology was!

67
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:03,910
Well.

68
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,880
I give you another chance.

69
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,240
You can start over.

70
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,120
Ruan Qingxia.

71
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,840
I was being subjective before.

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,080
I got you wrong.

73
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,040
Through this rescue operation,

74
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,160
I found that you’re damn good.

75
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,080
I’m sorry for underestimating you.

76
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,200
Today, I’d like to officially
apologize to you.

77
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,160
I’m so sorry.

78
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,120
Apology accepted.

79
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,640
Actually, it’s not all your fault.

80
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:37,960
I used to

81
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,800
look quite unsettling.

82
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:40,920
That’s why people think

83
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,360
I’m not trustworthy.

84
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,880
It takes time for people

85
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,000
to get to know

86
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,240
and understand each other,

87
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,560
right?

88
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,960
What’s over

89
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,880
is over.

90
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,440
What about this?

91
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,320
Let’s start over.

92
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,400
Hi.

93
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,680
I’m Ruan Qingxia.

94
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
What?

95
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,880
You don’t wanna start over with me?

96
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,080
No.

97
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,840
Hi.

98
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,600
I’m Shu Wenbo.

99
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,200
Actually, I wanna thank you.

100
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,920
Thank you for sparing no efforts

101
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,560
to get back the camera for me.

102
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,680
It’s nothing.

103
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,600
Not a big deal.

104
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,320
In fact, the camera

105
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,680
was a gift from my father

106
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,680
when I got into
the Journalism Department.

107
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,840
He told me,

108
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,960
he hoped that I could make my dream
come true

109
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,880
and become an excellent journalist.

110
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,240
His words have always been

111
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,800
the greatest motivation to me.

112
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,880
So, for me,

113
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,880
it is a big deal.

114
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,200
You are already

115
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,440
an excellent journalist now.

116
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,800
You mean it?

117
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,880
Of course.

118
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,840
Otherwise, how could the old couple

119
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,360
get reunited so soon?

120
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,640
I agree.

121
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,480
Doctor Mi.

122
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,440
Do you know

123
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,040
why Captain Xing didn’t beat us?

124
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,760
Why?

125
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,440
Don’t you feel cold?

126
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,080
Sitting next to the burning fire,

127
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,800
how come I still feel freezing?

128
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,680
It’s quite warm.

129
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,000
You’re the only one who feels cold.

130
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,600
Think carefully
whether it’s cold or not.

131
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,400
Captain Xing.

132
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,440
I’ll go for a walk

133
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,840
and collect some branches back.

134
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,720
I’m scared.

135
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,840
Come on. Come on.

136
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,320
Captain Xing. I worry about him.

137
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,560
I’ll go with him.

138
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,280
How’re you holding up?

139
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,320
I thought

140
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,240
I’ve been used to seeing life and death

141
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,280
in the hospital.

142
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,000
When I got here,

143
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,880
I found I have overestimated myself.

144
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,960
Being used to it
is not the same as being numb.

145
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,520
This is not your problem.

146
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,160
With regard to the evacuation
of Xinguan Village,

147
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,880
you won’t mind it, will you?

148
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,120
I won’t.

149
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,000
This isn’t the first time.

150
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,680
All we want

151
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,800
is to help

152
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,080
more people.

153
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,160
So, it’s totally understandable

154
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,960
even if we had some arguments
during the process.

155
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,400
Don’t you wanna go to bed now?

156
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,280
I have to be on duty.

157
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,560
Then I’ll stay with you for a while.

158
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,080
OK.

159
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,000
Then can I

160
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,120
ask you a few questions?

161
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,760
Where is your kit?

162
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,480
In the tent.

163
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,800
What’re you doing with this?

164
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,280
All these medical devices

165
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,080
seem to look the same.

166
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,040
Why did you bring so many of them?

167
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,160
Didn’t you prepare these for me?

168
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,760
I...I’m not familiar with these things.

169
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,680
Like these two things.

170
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,360
Aren’t they the same?

171
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,960
No, they aren’t.

172
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,120
Look.

173
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,160
This is a needle holder.

174
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,000
And these’re hemostatic forceps.

175
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,640
Needle holder?

176
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,320
When you’re stitching,

177
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,680
you gotta hold it like this

178
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,000
and stitch in this way.

179
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,720
OK.

180
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,680
Thank you.

181
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,080
Alright. It’s nothing.

182
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,320
Grandpa. Grandma. Breakfast time.

183
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,080
Come on.

184
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:36,960
Come on. Hurry up.

185
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,960
Grandpa.
Let’s get up and grab some breakfast.

186
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,280
Grandpa.
Let’s get up and grab some breakfast.

187
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,680
Get up. Get up.
Have some breakfast.

188
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,160
Breakfast. Breakfast. Breakfast.

189
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,440
Be careful. Breakfast.

190
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,480
Breakfast. Breakfast.

191
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,160
OK.

192
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,360
Xia.

193
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,240
Thank you so much.

194
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,600
We had a fight

195
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,880
the other day

196
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,040
and he left in a fit of rage.

197
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,160
It was you
who brought him back

198
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,600
or I will…

199
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,840
…not be able to live without him.

200
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,960
Grandma. That’s

201
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,240
what we should do.

202
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,280
However, you should not quarrel

203
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,800
with grandpa in the future.

204
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,800
It hurts feelings.

205
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,200
Angry words make people upset.

206
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,080
You’re right.

207
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,240
Folks.

208
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,640
Come and listen to me.

209
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,080
The aftershock caused
the loosening of the mountains

210
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,280
in the north side of Linjia Village.

211
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:19,790
There is a danger

212
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,560
of a landslide.

213
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,760
So let’s evacuate immediately.

214
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,720
Come on.

215
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,480
What’s going on? What’s going on?

216
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,320
Why?

217
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,240
Folks.

218
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,080
The aftershock caused
the loosening of the mountains

219
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:29,760
in the north side of Linjia Village.

220
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,000
There is a danger of a landslide.

221
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,480
Let’s get out of here immediately.

222
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,720
You’ve finished the surgery?

223
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,280
Come on. Take a break.

224
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,680
Have you seen Keyao?

225
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,880
She has left.

226
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,160
It seems there were some supplies

227
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,360
for which she needed to coordinate

228
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,200
with those people in person.

229
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,480
She’s been so helpful these days.

230
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,560
She asked me to remind you.

231
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,000
Don’t forget to take the medicine.

232
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,160
She’s been here all these days?

233
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,280
Yeah.

234
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,400
Helping to register the wounded.

235
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,600
Organizing volunteers.

236
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,640
Doing medical training.

237
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,040
She did it all by herself.

238
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,800
I’m off to work.

239
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,460
You take a break.

240
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,120
OK. I will.

241
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,160
Take a good rest.

242
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,480
Grandma.

243
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,320
Young man.

244
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,680
Do we still have time to go back

245
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,240
to pack our valuable belongings

246
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,200
and take them away?

247
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,480
OK. Quickly.

248
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,560
Go back and pack your things.

249
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,080
We’ll meet here in half an hour.

250
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:51,960
-OK.
-Hurry up.

251
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,120
OK. OK. OK.

252
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,840
Darling.

253
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,720
Let’s go.

254
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,240
Let’s go home and get
the Marriage Licenses.

255
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,440
Mar…Marriage.

256
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,480
Marriage Licenses. Marriage Licenses.

257
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,200
Marriage Licenses.

258
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,080
Slow down. Slow down.

259
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,840
Watch out. Watch out.

260
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,510
Marriage Licenses.

261
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,260
(Earthquake Relief)

262
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,440
Marriage Licenses

263
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,160
are the most precious thing for them?

264
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,640
So far,

265
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,680
all of the villagers of Linjia Village

266
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,440
have moved to here.

267
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,280
But we’re short of tents.

268
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,440
Let’s rest

269
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,300
in this open space

270
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,280
tonight.

271
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,240
Yes, Sir.

272
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,040
Now, rest where you are.

273
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,680
Dismissed.

274
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,640
Xia.

275
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,800
Why are you here?

276
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,240
There’s no room inside.

277
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,200
So, I came out

278
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,640
to find a place to sleep.

279
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,400
Why don’t you go over there?

280
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,720
It’s warmer there.

281
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:23,920
OK.

282
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,070
What about here?

283
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,120
It feels warmer.

284
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,640
Sit down on my backpack.

285
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:06,960
Thank you.

286
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,920
My pleasure.

287
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,440
Captain Shu.

288
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,040
Here you are.

289
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,400
Thank you.

290
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,640
Xia.

291
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,000
Here you come.

292
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,960
Captain Shu.

293
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,680
The report is almost done, right?

294
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,320
Luckily we brought

295
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,240
two cameras.

296
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,160
Even though mine is broken,

297
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,280
we can still use yours.

298
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,400
That’s a good picture.

299
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,360
I remember we still got another one

300
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,800
which caught

301
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,880
Captain Shu’s front side.

302
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,400
I suppose that one feels better.

303
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,440
Why not use that one?

304
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,160
This one more likely shows

305
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,040
the group portrait

306
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,440
of all the rescue workers.

307
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,440
You see the heartfelt joy of everyone

308
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,240
after they successfully

309
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,160
rescued the little girl.

310
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,120
Rescuing

311
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,600
is not a single person’s work.

312
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,560
So I believe

313
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,560
this one is better.

314
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,600
Right.

315
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,320
You still have a long way to go.

316
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,640
Xia.

317
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,680
Go ahead.

318
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,120
I’ll go make sure the memory card
has enough space to store the images.

319
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,400
What’s on your mind?

320
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,760
I never expected to see

321
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,120
you can bear such hardships.

322
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,400
And you’re quite professional actually.

323
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,320
Captain Shu.

324
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,600
How come you looked at people

325
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,200
through colored-spectacles?

326
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,160
I’m sorry.

327
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,440
I don’t mean it.

328
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,680
Save it.

329
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,360
How many times did you apologize to me?

330
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,600
In fact, in the past few years,

331
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,600
I never thought that

332
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,840
two cookies

333
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,680
could make up a meal.

334
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,760
Let alone sleeping

335
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,280
in the open air.

336
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,200
So, I guess the willpower of people

337
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,880
are forced out

338
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,560
under such extreme circumstances.

339
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,160
But I’ve never been more identified

340
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,120
with my work

341
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,120
and my values

342
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,640
than I am now.

343
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,240
Your teammates

344
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,080
are all fresh out of school, right?

345
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,600
They all look pretty young.

346
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,640
Yeah.

347
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,080
They’re all fresh recruits

348
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,720
who just got into the Special Police.

349
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,320
All of them were beloved
and treasured at home

350
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,200
before they came here.

351
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,640
When I get back,

352
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,120
I’ll make sure that all the footages
I filmed

353
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,440
would be edited into a documentary.

354
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,480
I want everyone to see

355
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,070
they are

356
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,680
the real young idols of this era.

357
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:11,830
Good.

358
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:12,680
I’m with you.

359
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:14,800
By the way,

360
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,070
can I take the essays you wrote
in the last few days

361
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,400
for reference?

362
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,040
We call them reports.

363
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,960
Can I take a look?

364
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,070
Why do you have to read it?

365
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,760
I’m a dumb person.

366
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,400
I can hardly write articles.

367
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,600
Actually, I’m pretty envious

368
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,280
of you guys

369
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,880
who have unusual literary talents.

370
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,560
No problem.

371
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:38,720
I’m envious of you

372
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,920
who can hold a gun.

373
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,480
What a hero!

374
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:47,740
Here you are.

375
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,960
Alright. Thank you.

376
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:57,840
Xia.

377
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:58,880
Grandma.

378
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,480
You’ve stayed outside all night.

379
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,760
It’s been freezing.

380
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,200
Have something hot.

381
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,280
Thanks. Grandma.

382
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,440
It’s nothing.

383
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,840
Xia.

384
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,600
Here you come.

385
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,040
Grandma.

386
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,160
Have some noodles.

387
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,920
Did you have a good sleep last night?

388
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,400
Can’t be better.

389
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,160
You’ve given all the tents you got

390
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,400
to us.

391
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,280
You must have been exhausted

392
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,040
as someone has rested her head

393
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,040
upon your shoulder all night.

394
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,840
Well, are you done eating?

395
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,880
The new supplies have arrived.

396
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,080
I’ll go get the supplies.

397
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,120
Alright.

398
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,920
You stay here and keep eating.

399
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,080
I’ll go get the supplies.

400
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,800
I’m done. I’ll go help.

401
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,300
Then…

402
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,480
Let me help you.

403
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,120
My co…coat.

404
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:43,760
Thanks. Grandma.

405
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,260
I’ll take it.

406
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,160
My pleasure.

407
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,360
Be careful. Be careful.

408
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,080
Don’t rush. Don’t rush.

409
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,360
Everyone has a share.

410
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,320
Lu Feng.

411
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,480
What brings you here?

412
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:06,720
Well.

413
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,200
You’re not the only ones
who can rush into the disaster area.

414
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,880
Although I don’t work
as a police officer anymore,

415
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,680
I still got hot blood running
in my body.

416
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,880
I called a couple of friends
to come here

417
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,080
to deliver supplies.

418
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:14,790
Nice work.

419
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,240
My buddy.

420
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,800
Thanks. Thanks.

421
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,200
Be careful.

422
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,840
I never knew that

423
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,080
a rich young man like you

424
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:25,960
would do

425
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,360
such good deeds.

426
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,080
There’re way more things about me
for you to find out.

427
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:29,960
Captain Shu. Captain Shu.

428
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:30,920
We have relocated many victims

429
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,880
in Fu’an Village,

430
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,760
where is still in short of water
and food.

431
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:33,640
The command center asked us

432
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,640
to transfer a vehicle to offer support.

433
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,040
Yes, Sir.

434
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,600
OK. I’ll arrange it immediately.

435
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,160
Lu Feng.

436
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,280
You’re here at the right time.

437
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,560
I’d like to requisition your car.

438
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,960
There are many victims

439
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,280
from the earthquake being relocated
in Fu’an Village,

440
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,480
where is in short of water
and food.

441
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,680
We don’t have cars available
to transfer now.

442
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,680
So, you have to do me a favor.

443
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,000
Use your car to deliver some supplies
for me.

444
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,720
Am I gonna do this alone?

445
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,760
Count me in.

446
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,840
I’d like to take some pictures

447
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,240
of other villages.

448
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,600
Sure.

449
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,520
It’s not hard to drive there.

450
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,920
Pay attention to safety.

451
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,160
Don’t worry.

452
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,480
I’ll take care of Xia’s safety.

453
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,440
Wait for me.

454
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,600
How is the situation down there?

455
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:32,800
We’re all exhausted.

456
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,480
With only a few people here,

457
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,080
God knows
when we can reach to their location.

458
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,560
Jiangning Special Police.

459
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,760
I heard some people were trapped
down there.

460
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,280
Yes.

461
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,360
I’m the Mine Director here.

462
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,200
My name is Liang Dong.

463
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,120
We have eight miners

464
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,320
who have been trapped down there
for almost five days.

465
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,560
And the exit of the mine

466
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,840
has been blocked after the earthquake.

467
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,000
Is anyone injured?

468
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,360
The situation down there is unclear yet.

469
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,240
There are a few injured people up there.

470
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,640
They’re over there in the shed.

471
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,560
Doctor, come with me.

472
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,440
OK.

473
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,120
Do you have an access to the Internet?

474
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,160
No.

475
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,440
Then how can you send emails?

476
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,280
I’ll write it down first

477
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:06,640
and send it

478
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,760
until we get to a place
connected to the Internet.

479
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,600
Don’t look at me.
Look ahead and watch the road.

480
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,520
Pull over.

481
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,640
There is a pregnant woman over there.

482
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,280
Is there any water and food down there?

483
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,120
They took some food with them

484
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,400
when they went down there.

485
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,280
But it’s certainly not enough

486
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,720
for them to carry on a few more days.

487
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:35,840
Here’s the plan.

488
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,760
The firefighters and I

489
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,040
go down to check it out.

490
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,240
Do you have a floor plan?

491
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:39,960
Shall we go down from here?

492
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,400
Yes, I have it.

493
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,320
This is the secondary mine shaft
for people to get out.

494
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,240
The power supply system is broken.

495
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,200
We are now

496
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:49,840
relying on our backup generator

497
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,760
to generate electricity.

498
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,480
There’s a tunnel between the main
and secondary mine shafts.

499
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,680
We’ll go down
from the secondary one.

500
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,320
If we can’t make it through,
we’ll go back to the main one.

501
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,080
I worry if there will be

502
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,040
a collapse occurring down there.

503
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,080
Hold on.

504
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,720
Let’s find a place to lean on.

505
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,280
Let’s go.

506
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,760
Easy.

507
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,080
Be careful. Be careful.

508
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,160
Be careful. Watch your step.

509
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,800
Watch your step.

510
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,960
Lean on it.

511
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,640
Lu Feng.

512
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,160
Her water broke.

513
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,680
She’s about to give birth.

514
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,840
So, what should we do?

515
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,480
How am I supposed to know what to do?

516
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,320
Let’s transfer her to the hospital.

517
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,160
She can’t go to the hospital.

518
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,240
It’s impossible.

519
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,800
You can’t deliver…

520
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,560
…the baby, can you?

521
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,040
-Come on.
-Me?

522
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,010
For the time being,

523
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,280
all the wounded has made it through.

524
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,640
But

525
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,720
we may not have enough medicine.

526
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,600
Yu Feng.

527
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,880
Check with Doctor Mi

528
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,640
and see what she needs.

529
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,120
Contact the command center

530
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,040
for backup by the way.

531
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,120
Yes, Sir.

532
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,040
Then please lead the way.

533
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,280
OK. This way.

534
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,880
Why are your hands so hot?

535
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,560
Probably because I’m a man
who keeps people warm.

536
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,320
Be careful.

537
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,480
Director Liang.

538
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,800
Come on.

539
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,000
Take a deep breath.

540
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,640
It’s not coming out!

541
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,520
You can do it!

542
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,420
The baby

543
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,720
comes into this world

544
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,720
at such a life-threatening moment,

545
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,000
with everyone’s

546
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,240
blessings and hopes.

547
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,160
You must be able to bring it

548
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,160
into this world.

549
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,360
Just push. All right?

550
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,480
Come on. Come on. Come on.

551
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,400
One. Two. Three.

552
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,720
This way.

553
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,800
Captain Xing.
It’s too narrow here.

554
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,240
It can only allow six or seven people
to dig at the same time.

555
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,760
And we can’t blast it

556
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,760
because it may cause
the collapse again.

557
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:48,560
Right.

558
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,320
How about this?

559
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,680
We split into three units

560
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,480
and work in shifts.

561
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,240
It’ll be more efficient this way.

562
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,440
That’s right.

563
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,680
We can find a loose spot

564
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,800
and work together to break it through.

565
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,400
Send the water and food in first.

566
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,760
Li Nian.

567
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,120
Go up and ask for some glucose.

568
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,240
OK.

569
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,040
I’ll help you.

570
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,320
Take a break, you guys.

571
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,440
Leave it to us.

572
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,840
Xia. Are you sure you can do it?

573
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,760
Shut up.

574
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,840
Take a deep breath. Take a deep breath.

575
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,440
One. Two. Three.

576
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,520
Come on.

577
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,040
We’re close. We’re quite close.

578
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,880
Take a deep breath.

579
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,600
Right. Right.

580
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,600
OK. OK.

581
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,520
It’s coming. It’s coming.

582
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,720
It’s a beautiful girl.

583
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,880
I…

584
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,120
Lu Feng.

585
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,120
Is there anything

586
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,080
that can wrap her up?

587
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:36,960
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

588
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,720
Come on.

589
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,520
OK.

590
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,040
Come on.

591
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,720
Take it easy. Easy.

592
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:02,000
Come on. Shift.

593
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,440
OK.

594
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,480
Take it easy.

595
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,000
You gotta love

596
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,360
your mother from now on.

597
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,280
She fought for her life

598
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:29,800
to bring you

599
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,440
into the world.

600
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,080
Thank you.

601
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,100
Sure.

602
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:36,610
Thank you guys.

603
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,560
No worries.

604
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,880
It’s nothing.

605
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,080
Come on. Hurry up.

606
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,280
Xia.

607
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,480
You really got something.

608
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,920
You faced danger fearlessly.

609
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,880
Awesome.

610
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,000
Half of the credit goes to you.

611
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,760
Did you update your impression

612
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,360
on me?

613
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,400
Actually, I have a lot…

614
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,920
True.

615
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,240
It’s the first time I get to know

616
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,400
that people outside the labor room

617
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,600
would get shocked

618
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,600
and scream

619
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,000
when hearing the other woman
giving birth to a baby.

620
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,000
Thank you for stimulating my potential
by doing so.

621
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,920
Me? Are you sure that I screamed

622
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,960
and got shocked?

623
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,480
No way.

624
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,320
What’s wrong with a man screaming?

625
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,120
Alright.

626
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,720
You’re the Boss.

627
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,640
Wenbo.

628
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,840
I heard that

629
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,880
you’ve delivered a baby for someone.

630
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,640
I’ve delivered a baby for someone?

631
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,680
Right. I did deliver the baby for her.

632
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,080
I bear the baby with Xia.

633
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,520
What’re you talking about?

634
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:53,740
No.

635
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,920
Your language isn’t so good, is it?

636
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,800
How come you can make
each of your sentences sound ambiguous?

637
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,960
How can this be ambiguous?

638
00:28:59,280 --> 00:28:59,920
We helped the lady

639
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,720
deliver her baby in the open air.
How cool it is!

640
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,680
That was the first time

641
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,680
for me to witness

642
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,960
the birth of a new life.

643
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,120
You’ll never know

644
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,120
how nervous I was

645
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,280
when I was holding her.

646
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,880
I was so afraid that I’d drop her

647
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,840
or hurt her with her in my arms.

648
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,560
Wasn’t that so exciting?

649
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,880
You are the second person in the world

650
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,440
who has held her.

651
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:16,840
Yeah.

652
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,880
Then,

653
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,640
I’m gonna be her godfather.

654
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,840
Well, I was the first one who held her.

655
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,480
So, does that make me her godmother?

656
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,000
No.

657
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,480
Yes. You’re her godmother.

658
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,640
I gotta buy something

659
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,640
for my…

660
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,680
…our goddaughter.

661
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,160
And tie the knot by the way.

662
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,760
What do you mean by our goddaughter?

663
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,960
But we can buy her

664
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,040
some little clothes,

665
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,560
little shoes or something.

666
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,280
She can wear them sooner or later.

667
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,800
I happen to know an online store.

668
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Let me show you.

669
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,320
Come on.

670
00:29:59,080 --> 00:29:59,920
It’s cute, right?

671
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,040
Yes, it is.

672
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,600
This one.

673
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,240
Shu Wenbo. Check it…

674
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,800
I know another store
selling baby pro…

675
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,200
Take the blood pressure
for people over here.

676
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,040
OK.

677
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,240
Yu Feng.

678
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,920
It’s been almost eight hours
since they dug.

679
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,640
What’re we looking at?

680
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,320
Still digging.

681
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,040
I’ll grab some food and take it down.

682
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,000
Stop.

683
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,240
There’s a sound.

684
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,640
The direction is right.

685
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,680
Careful.

686
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,680
Take it easy.

687
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,400
Are you OK, Captain Xing?

688
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,680
Do you need to take a break?

689
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,840
I’m fine.

690
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,040
Come on. Give it to me.

691
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,360
Be careful.

692
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,040
Anyone there?

693
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,800
Yes.

694
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,040
We’re down here.

695
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,320
What’s going on down there?

696
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,280
We’re all right.

697
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,800
But we’ve suffered starvation
for two days.

698
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,880
There’s only water in here.

699
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,040
I see.

700
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,600
Is there any food?

701
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,600
Food. Food.

702
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,680
Food!

703
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,480
Come on! Come on!

704
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,840
Come on!

705
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,760
Come on! Captain Xing.

706
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,720
Don’t worry.
We’ll pull you out immediately.

707
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,160
How is Captain Xing?

708
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,000
He’s still down there.

709
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:15,520
He asked us to come out

710
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,200
to take a break

711
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,640
and replace him later.

712
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,840
Thank you for your hard work.

713
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,640
What happened?

714
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,920
Doctor Mi.

715
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,120
I’ve just spoken to the mine people.

716
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,280
They’re running out of diesel.

717
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:26,980
Once the diesel is burnt out,

718
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,080
the backup generator
won’t be able to work.

719
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,600
So, the cage can’t be used either.

720
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,310
That’s why we need to take

721
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:30,840
people up here.

722
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,880
Can it be fixed?

723
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:32,800
Yes, it can be fixed.

724
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:33,760
But the road is still blocked.

725
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,600
I don’t know

726
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,400
when the serviceman will arrive.

727
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,920
Great! Great!

728
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,080
It’s unblocked.

729
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:58,920
What is going on?

730
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,640
We’ve finally cleared the obstacles.

731
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,760
People down there will be able
to come up soon.

732
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,640
Great!

733
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:22,580
Captain Xing.

734
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,200
Are you the last unit?

735
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,000
Yes, he’s the last one, the eighth.

736
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,840
Han, our team leader has also gone
into the mine.

737
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,480
He has been working
at the innermost working face,

738
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,720
where it collapsed as well.

739
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,800
I’m not sure if he’s OK now.

740
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,320
Would you please go check
on him?

741
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,840
OK.

742
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,280
You two. Come with me.

743
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:43,960
OK.

744
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,720
Be safe.

745
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,600
Take it easy.

746
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,120
Are you OK, Captain Xing?

747
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,840
I’m OK.

748
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,400
Go. He’s inside.

749
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,680
There’s one more wounded person
down there

750
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:05,960
who is in danger.

751
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,600
I need a doctor to go down there
with me.

752
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,760
I’ll go.

753
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,350
OK.

754
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,360
Doctor Mi. Right in front.

755
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,120
Supervisor Han.
How’re you doing?

756
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,520
I can’t breathe.

757
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,880
Does it hurt?

758
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,200
He may have a fractured rib.

759
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,040
I need to fix his thorax.

760
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,400
Otherwise, the fracture will displace.

761
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,880
It’ll get worse

762
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,960
if the broken bones puncture
his pleura and lung tissue.

763
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:00,840
You guys. Help me lift up

764
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:01,640
the top half of his body.

765
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,520
Easy. Easy.

766
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,600
I forgot my first-aid kit.

767
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,920
You guys go first.

768
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,760
You guys go first. I’ll go with her.

769
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,160
Be safe. You guys.

770
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,240
They’re coming.

771
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:38,910
Are they?

772
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,800
They’re coming.

773
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,520
Supervisor Han.

774
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,640
Come on. Duty shift.

775
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,320
Supervisor Han.

776
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,000
Be careful.

777
00:36:54,120 --> 00:37:01,120
Han.

778
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,640
Han. Are you all right? Han.

779
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,320
He’s gonna be okay.

780
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,600
He just got a painkiller.

781
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,240
Really?

782
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:06,760
He’s asleep now.

783
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,800
Don’t worry.

784
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,920
Don’t worry. Don’t worry.

785
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,680
Han.

786
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,840
Luo Ting. Did you go up?
How is it going up there?

787
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,400
It’s aftershock.

788
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:25,800
Take care of the wounded!

789
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,400
Guys. Take care of the wounded.

790
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,280
Take shelter
from the high-rise buildings.

791
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,520
Calm down!

792
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,620
(Beware of falling!)

793
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,840
Captain Xing!

794
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,840
Doctor Mi!

795
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,200
Captain Xing!

796
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,920
The cage was stuck.

797
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,280
The diesel was burnt out.

798
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,120
This cage couldn’t be used anymore.

799
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,000
Captain Xing! Captain Xing!

800
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,160
Doctor Mi!

801
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,320
Captain Xing!

802
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,880
Doctor Mi. Please respond.

803
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,400
Please respond.

804
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,720
There might be no signal down there.

805
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,280
Or…

806
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,360
…or their radios were broken.

807
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,480
Director Liang.

808
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,200
Is there any other way down to there?

809
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:12,960
The main shaft.

810
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,320
There’s an air-vent at the main shaft.

811
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,200
Over there is the inclined shaft.

812
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:15,990
We can follow the tracks

813
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:16,580
to go down there.

814
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,480
Yes.

815
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,360
Captain Xing saw the floor plan

816
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,120
and said that the tunnel below
is connected.

817
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,120
Let’s go over there.

818
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,000
Go get your equipment.

819
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:21,720
Come on. Let’s go.

820
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,880
Come on.

821
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,040
Help me hold it.

822
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,600
OK.

823
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,160
You take it easy.

824
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,080
Take it easy.

825
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,640
It’s blocked.

826
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,560
I’ve seen the floor plan.

827
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,040
There’s another exit.

828
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:04,920
I’ll take you out.

829
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,040
Let’s go.

830
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,140
(150 Meters Below The Surface)

831
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:15,300
(All lives matter, including yours.
Alertness prevents accidents.)

832
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,660
(Emergency Supplies)

833
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,440
Take this with you.

834
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:39,960
Are you OK?

835
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,640
Nothing.

836
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,600
You have a fever.

837
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,400
I didn’t get much sleep.

838
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,200
Pack these things.

839
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,680
This way.

840
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,520
Take your time.

841
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,560
This is

842
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,760
the air-vent of the main shaft.

843
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,960
It is likely to have
a collapse down below.

844
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:51,680
Let’s go down to check it out.

845
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,440
Digging as we go.

846
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,600
OK. OK. Let’s go.

847
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,360
Be safe. Everyone.

848
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,430
Be careful.

849
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,840
Take it easy. Take it easy. Be careful.

850
00:40:59,040 --> 00:40:59,920
Be safe. Everyone.

851
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,960
Pay attention to your safety.

852
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:02,960
The steps are somehow loosened.

853
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,240
Watch your step.

854
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,640
OK.

855
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:06,640
Be careful.

856
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,480
Take it easy.

857
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,560
Watch out.

858
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,720
Be careful.

859
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,840
Come on.

860
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,760
Take your time.

861
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,080
Watch out.

862
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,880
Are you OK?

863
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,160
Here’s the plan.

864
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,440
I’ll go check the way ahead

865
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,040
and you can stay here for a while,

866
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,280
OK?

867
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,840
Let’s go together.

868
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,920
Don’t split up.

869
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,760
This way.

870
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,160
Are you sure

871
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,200
this is the exit you were talking about?

872
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,640
Yes.

873
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,200
Where’s the radio?

874
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:00,960
