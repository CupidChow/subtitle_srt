=You Are My Hero=

19
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,940
=Episode 24=

20
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,520
These are the images

21
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,640
of your

22
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,040
head MRI.

23
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,240
We found a

24
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,400
space-occupying lesion.

25
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,600
Based on your symptoms

26
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,960
and the results of your hormone test,

27
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,880
we think it’s pituitary adenoma.

28
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,360
What’s that?

29
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,840
In the early stage of this tumor,

30
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,520
there are no other symptoms

31
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,440
except for the endocrine symptoms.

32
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,280
But after it grows into

33
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,440
a certain size,

34
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,160
there will be some

35
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,000
compressive symptoms,

36
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,720
like the optic nerve

37
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,840
compression you have.

38
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,800
But don’t worry too much.

39
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,720
Pituitary adenoma

40
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,880
is mostly benign.

41
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,750
It’s unlikely to be malignant.

42
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,680
But the problem is

43
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,720
your tumor is too big

44
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,840
and you need treatment
as soon as possible.

45
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,960
We suggest

46
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,720
a craniotomy.

47
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,520
How risky

48
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,600
is this surgery?

49
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,560
There is no minor surgery

50
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,600
in terms of neurosurgery craniotomy.

51
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,200
There are certainly some risks.

52
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,480
However,

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,480
this kind of surgery

54
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,920
is relatively mature.

55
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,360
Based on the previous cases,

56
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,880
the success rate is very high.

57
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,400
Will there be any

58
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,480
sequelae?

59
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,720
It depends on the individual situation.

60
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,920
I understand your concerns.

61
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,080
Because of the specificity of
your profession,

62
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,000
you worry that

63
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,240
the convalescence

64
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,480
would affect your work.

65
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,640
I suggest

66
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,840
you do a clerical job for a while.

67
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,520
How long will it

68
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,480
take me to recover?

69
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,320
Under normal circumstances,

70
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,040
we recommend no strenuous exercise

71
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,360
for six months after the surgery.

72
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,960
Six months?

73
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,560
Do I have to do the surgery?

74
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,280
It would be the best to do it now.

75
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,000
If the tumor keeps growing,

76
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,480
it will constrict other nerves.

77
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,800
And the consequences
will be unimaginable.

78
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,560
Is there any other way?

79
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,760
There are some patients

80
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,320
who use medication.

81
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,520
But in your case,

82
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,920
medication is not enough.

83
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,520
Considering the location of your tumor,

84
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,800
a minimally invasive surgery

85
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,000
can hardly remove it completely.

86
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,080
And it would be more likely

87
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,560
to have postoperative complications.

88
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,440
I see, thank you.

89
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,800
I need to think about it.

90
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:35,860
Okay.

91
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,920
Think it through.

92
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,760
But I need your reply
as soon as possible.

93
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,200
I understand your concerns.

94
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,200
Because of the specificity of
your profession,

95
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,960
you worry that

96
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,680
the convalescence

97
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,080
would affect your work.

98
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,360
I suggest

99
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,600
you do a clerical job for a while.

100
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,580
(Mr. Xing)

101
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,380
(Mr. Xing 8 missed calls)

102
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,520
Where are we going to play later?

103
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:51,600
Any place will do.

104
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,490
Okay, let me see which is
the nearest place.

105
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,040
Oh my god.

106
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,600
Don’t mess with me

107
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,720
right now.

108
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,200
Mr. Shao.

109
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,920
When did you come?

110
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,360
When you called god.

111
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,480
I heard about it.

112
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,160
You must be discouraged, right?

113
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,040
I have done a research

114
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,280
on a similar subject before.

115
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,920
There are

116
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,000
some data

117
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,320
and cases I collected.

118
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,240
It might help you.

119
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,120
Thank you, Dr. Shao.

120
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,040
The experimental data

121
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,240
is the basis for writing a paper.

122
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,360
Make a backup next time.

123
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,280
I will.

124
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,080
Mr. Shao.

125
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,320
Thank you.

126
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,800
It’s up to you whether

127
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,520
you can submit the paper in time.

128
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,720
I’ll try.

129
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,840
There is memory loss

130
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,840
after the craniotomy.

131
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,760
I can’t remember many people

132
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,520
I knew before.

133
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,800
I’m a football player.

134
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,360
I suffered from frequent dizziness
after the surgery.

135
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,880
I had to give up my career dream.

136
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,240
Guys, take care of yourselves.

137
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,800
I had no epilepsy before the craniotomy.

138
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,120
But I suffered from epilepsy
after the surgery

139
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,240
and I have to use medication.

140
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,120
Take a look.

141
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,440
Xia uploaded the video

142
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,160
of our boss on Tik Tok.

143
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,920
It has 100,000 likes now.

144
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,480
Captain Xing has become
a Tik Tok celebrity now.

145
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,240
Captain Xing never lets us down.

146
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,320
I’m proud of you.

147
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,560
Captain Xing is so cool.

148
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,440
Captain Xing.

149
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,600
You have a good job
and a girlfriend now.

150
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,320
We are still single

151
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,440
and we are really jealous of you.

152
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,560
It is my will to become

153
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,360
People’s Police

154
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,800
of the People’s Republic of China,

155
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,720
and devote myself to the noble cause

156
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,280
of the public security.

157
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,080
I will be loyal to the Party,

158
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,600
serve the people,

159
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,080
enforce laws impartially,

160
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,560
and be highly disciplined.

161
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,720
I will unswervingly

162
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,960
be a builder

163
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,000
and a defender

164
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,280
of the cause of socialism
with Chinese characteristics.

165
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,400
I will work hard to maintain
the overall stability of the society,

166
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,480
promote social fairness and justice,

167
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,840
and ensure that the people

168
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,760
live and work in peace and contentment.

169
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,720
Mi Ka?

170
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,740
(Mi Ka)

171
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,640
Hello.

172
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,360
The phone you’re calling is powered off.

173
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,160
Hello.

174
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,280
The phone you’re calling is powered…

175
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,040
Why are you here?

176
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,160
You didn’t answer my phone.

177
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,120
I’m here to see

178
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,960
if you eloped with someone else.

179
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,640
I was writing my paper.

180
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,080
So I silenced my phone

181
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,560
and it ran out of power.

182
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,040
You can charge it, can’t you?

183
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,800
I didn’t bring my power bank.

184
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,240
I was anxious.

185
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,880
I lost the materials for my paper.

186
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,600
I was muddleheaded

187
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,160
and I forgot to tell you.

188
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,120
Sorry, don’t be mad at me.

189
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,040
What’s wrong?

190
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,600
Nothing.

191
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,280
You ignored me all night.

192
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,360
Can’t I even hug you?

193
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,920
You miss me that much?

194
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,060
No.

195
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,960
What do you want to eat?

196
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,000
Anything will do.

197
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,440
I like all of your cooking.

198
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,480
What about your paper?

199
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,000
I made up one.

200
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,160
Let’s go home.

201
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,440
It smells so good.

202
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,080
Unfortunately, I won’t be able to

203
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,200
eat any of your cooking for a while.

204
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,960
But in order to let you

205
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,600
show your heroic bearing,

206
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,800
I’ll just make a compromise.

207
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,880
Captain Xing.

208
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,800
Turn around.

209
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,560
The way you cook in an apron

210
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,560
is really cute.

211
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,200
Thanks to you.

212
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:12,760
By the way,

213
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,800
why did you call me

214
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,880
at noon yesterday?

215
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,060
Nothing.

216
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,760
Look.

217
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,000
They uploaded the video of you

218
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,080
when you were training on Tik Tok.

219
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,560
A lot of girls gave you likes.

220
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,160
Look.

221
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,480
They said you are so handsome and brave,

222
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,040
just like a hero.

223
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,640
They are all praising you.

224
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,280
If one day, I won’t be

225
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,400
that handsome

226
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,720
and I won’t be a policeman,

227
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,320
will you stop liking me?

228
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,480
How is it possible?

229
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,200
How is it impossible?

230
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,880
It’s just impossible.

231
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,000
Let me ask you something.

232
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,920
I have a friend

233
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,840
who has a pituitary adenoma

234
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,280
in the brain,

235
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,680
about five centimeters.

236
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,280
The doctor suggested a craniotomy.

237
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,080
What do you think?

238
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,000
Of course a craniotomy is necessary.

239
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,360
What if my friend doesn’t want to do it?

240
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,560
Illness needs treatment.

241
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,680
It doesn’t matter whether
your friend wants to do it or not.

242
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,160
Who is that? Do I know that friend?

243
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,320
A childhood friend, you don’t know.

244
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,920
A man or a woman?

245
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,360
A man.

246
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,160
How can I cook

247
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,320
with you hanging on me?

248
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,720
Alright.

249
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,320
Tell your friend

250
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,600
to get treatment as soon as possible.

251
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,760
It’s not a big problem.

252
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,360
The technology is advanced now.

253
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,600
I’ll leave you to cook.

254
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,560
Shu Wenbo!

255
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,700
You are here.

256
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,880
Do you owe me any money?

257
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,160
Why do you avoid me?

258
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,280
I’m not avoiding you.

259
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,040
8 PM tonight,

260
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,040
I have something to tell you.

261
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,200
I will send you the address.

262
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,060
Tonight, I...

263
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,400
I don’t care if you have
anything to do tonight.

264
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,200
Anyway, see you at 8 PM tonight.

265
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,400
If you don’t come,

266
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,360
I will keep waiting.

267
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:02,980
I...

268
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,620
Hello.

269
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:36,960
What’s up?

270
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,680
My friend came back from Thailand

271
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,920
and brought me a few boxes of plasters.

272
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,200
Didn’t you say
your mother has rheumatism?

273
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,040
I’ll give you two boxes.

274
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:45,880
Don’t bother.

275
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,920
No trouble.

276
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,960
We are brothers. Just take it.

277
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,960
I heard that the plaster
works really well.

278
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,520
It can treat rheumatism.

279
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,240
It can also treat strain

280
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,480
if you and Kelei get

281
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,160
when you are training.

282
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,760
I’ll deliver them to you later.

283
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,180
Don’t bother...

284
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,920
Shu Wenbo.

285
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,800
I love you long time.

286
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,160
You must know it.

287
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,520
But sometimes I feel

288
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,640
that you also like me.

289
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,480
If you don’t like me,

290
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,560
why would you try so hard

291
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,640
to pick up my camera?

292
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,640
If you don’t like me,

293
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,680
why didn’t you push me away

294
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,360
when I leaned on your shoulder?

295
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,080
If you don’t like me,

296
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,120
why did you make porridge for me?

297
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,440
Shu Wenbo,

298
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,360
do you like me or not?

299
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,540
You...

300
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,840
You’re here.

301
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,160
Waiter!

302
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,240
Serve the dishes.

303
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,320
Okay.

304
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,760
The Spanish food here

305
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,320
is quite famous online.

306
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,400
So I want you to have a try with me.

307
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,080
Okay.

308
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,480
If you are not used to the food here,

309
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,880
we can go to the food stall next time.

310
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:48,880
Okay.

311
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,280
-I...

312
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,160
You first.

313
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,070
I have something for you.

314
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,480
What?

315
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,560
You like taking pictures.

316
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,590
I think this

317
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,720
goes well with

318
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,880
your old camera.

319
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,120
It’s so lovely.

320
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,600
But the shutter of my camera

321
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,360
was broken during the earthquake.

322
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,240
I haven’t found one

323
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,320
for the camera yet.

324
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,760
I’m using my friend’s camera.

325
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,160
I’ll find one for you some day.

326
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,240
Really?

327
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:45,940
Thank you.

328
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,600
You’re welcome.

329
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,720
Xia.

330
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,200
I don’t have

331
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,920
many friends here

332
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,720
except for those
in the special police team.

333
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,480
You are my good friend.

334
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,240
I want you to be happy.

335
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,320
What do you want to say?

336
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,080
I want to say

337
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,320
that you are very nice to me.

338
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,040
And you also take care of my mom.

339
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,320
I’m very happy

340
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,720
to have a friend like you.

341
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,080
So I’ve been looking for

342
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,720
a chance to thank you.

343
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,160
I will treat you

344
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,360
to this meal.

345
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,160
You came today,

346
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,160
and you gave me this,

347
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,480
just because you want to tell me

348
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,560
that we are good friends?

349
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,080
We are best friends.

350
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,480
Best friends?

351
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,720
Are you sure you want to
treat me to this meal?

352
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,360
Don’t regret it.

353
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,440
It’s very expensive here.

354
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,440
It’s okay.

355
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,520
As long as you are happy.

356
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,320
Come on.

357
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,600
To our friendship.

358
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,440
Why don’t you drink?

359
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,880
I’ll go back to the team tonight.

360
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,160
So I can’t drink.

361
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,920
It’s okay.

362
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,520
I’ll drink it for you.

363
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,000
-Good friend.
-Xia...

364
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,120
Thank you for the camera strap.

365
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,560
Thank you for...

366
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,840
Thank you for making porridge for me.

is mostly benign.

It’s unlikely to be malignant.

426
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,720
your tumor is too big

427
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,000

as soon as possible.

who use medication.

00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,680
But in your case,

434
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,040
medication is not enough.

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,120
it really feels uncomfortable.

459
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,160
But I believe no matter
how deep the wound is,

460
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,160
it can be cured by time.

461
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,320
I don’t know the reason

462
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,680
I cried so hard

463
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,720
is because

464
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,200
I really like him,

465
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,840
or because I’m too proud

466
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,720
to accept the result.

467
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,360

478
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,800
I don’t think she will...

What are you talking about?

480
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,240
Nothing.

00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,240
It’s nothing.

483
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,080

484
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,360
of the excellence evaluation.

485
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,200
It’s Yanshan.

486
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,160
Yanshan’s academic ability
is strong indeed.

487
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,800
I think she totally deserves it.

488
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,260
But I think

489
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:10,900
if your paper

490
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,880
didn’t go wrong,

491
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,000
you would also stand a chance.

492
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,480
Maybe I’m still

493
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,520
not as good as Yanshan.

494
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:16,840
You are here.

495
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,480
Congratulations.

496
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,960
You all knew it?

497
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:20,920
Of course.

498
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,240
It’s a great thing.

499
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,800
You’re going to
spend some money this time.

500
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,160
We want a fancy meal.

501
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,280
Okay.

502
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,640
Keep your word.

503
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,240
Show me your paper

504
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,160
when you have time.

505
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,960
I want to draw close to
the outstanding doctor.

506
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,280
Is that necessary?

507
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,200
Time to work. Come on.

508
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,680
Come in.

509
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,200
What for this time?

510
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,040
Thank you for your data disk.

511
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,120
It saved my life.

512
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:50,920
But you still

513
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,920
failed to be selected.

514
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,080
I’m quite clear about

515
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,720
my own academic ability.

516
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,840
It’s no surprise

517
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,960
that I didn’t get selected.

518
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,280
But without your

519
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,320
data disk,

520
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,440
I couldn’t submit my paper

521
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,200
before the deadline.

522
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,720
I’m going to

523
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,080
do more research and revise the paper.

524
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,840
Maybe I can try to
publish it in the journal.

525
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,440
The ultimate purpose

526
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,360
of writing a paper

527
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,320
is not just

528
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,520
for the excellence evaluation, right?

529
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,400
You are

530
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,320
quite optimistic.

531
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,400
Anyway, thank you, Mr. Shao.

532
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,080
Have you ever thought about

533
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,600
why the data

534
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,080
in your computer

535
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,240
was deleted?

536
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,240
I asked the staff
of the Technical Department.

537
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,240
They said it might be
deleted by mistake.

538
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,280
Or maybe it’s because

539
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,920
the Inpatient Department is too busy.

540
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,560
And I...

541
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,200
I deleted it myself by mistake.

542
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,920
It’s not like someone else

543
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,960
deleted it.

544
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,360
Mr. Shao.

545
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,040
There is your file
at the Nurse Station.

546
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,400
My file?

547
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,960
Okay, I’ll get it now.

548
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,040
Mi Ka.

549
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,280
You can ask Dr. Xu

550
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,480
about your deleted data.

551
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,120
I saw her use your computer.

552
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,720
Xu...Yanshan?

553
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,720
On the day you and Dr. Zhang

554
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,720
went to see the patient,

555
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,800
I saw her in your seat.

556
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,000
I see.

557
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,280

558
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,960
I want to ask you something.

559
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,760
What’s the matter?

560
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,400
Let’s talk somewhere else.

561
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,680
Well, Mi Ka.

562
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,120
What do you want to say to me?

563
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,720
Did you delete

564
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,920
my experimental data?

565
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,680
Are you kidding?

566
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,560
Don’t blame me

567
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,920
for not getting selected.

568
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,920
I’m not blaming you.

569
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,560
I’m asking you.

570
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,280
Did you delete it?

571
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,120
I didn’t.

572
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,040
Xiaoxiao said

573
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,520
after we left

574
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,600
that room,

575
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,360
you used my computer.

576
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:20,600
Oh yeah?

577
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,040
Even if I used your computer,

578
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,440
do you have any evidence to prove

579
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,600
that I deleted your data?

580
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,920
Are you going to tell on me

581
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,680
that I deleted your data

582
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,000
just by her few words?

583
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,800
I won’t.

584
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,560
And I don’t want to do it.

585
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,760
It’s a fact that my

586
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,240
professional ability
is not as good as yours.

587
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,200
But you are my best friend

588
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,320
in college.

589
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,000
I just want you to tell me in person.

590
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,280
Don’t pretend to be

591
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,400
righteous.

592
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,080
Even if I did something,

593
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,280
you are the one who

594
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,080
broke the rules first.

595
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,200
You used Dr. Shao

596
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,520
and made him like you
and be partial to you.

597
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,560
Finally, you pretended to

598
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,680
know nothing.

599
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,520
Why do you think in that way?

600
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,960
What should I think?

601
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,160
He only asked you to attend

602
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,240
his academic gathering.

603
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,440
You were not in the Neurosurgery,

604
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,920
but he still allowed you to enter into
the operating room to observe.

605
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,920
You went to the ER,

606
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,560
and he got you back.

607
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,120
You could help perform the surgery
as soon as you came back.

608
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,320
Do you think it’s fair to me?

609
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,800
So you deleted my data?

610
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,800
I can only tell you

611
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,760
that I didn’t pull the string,

612
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,200
and I didn’t try to

613
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,360
fawn on anyone.

614
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,720
I just want to learn from

615
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,800
Mr. Shao’s surgery.

616
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,000
You want to perform the surgery,
so do I.

617
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,560
I didn’t play any tricks.

618
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,000
You are such a good friend of mine.

619
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,160
We should play fair.

620
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,920
Why did you do that to me?

621
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,500
Mr. Shao.

622
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,120
Just sit.

623
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,120
Congratulations.

624
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,400
Your paper is well written.

625
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,760
The argument is novel,

626
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,320
and the logic is clear.

627
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,680
Thank you, Mr. Shao.

628
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,480
Mi Ka is not as good as you
in this respect.

629
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,680
She just threw

630
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,200
something together to write her paper.

631
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,600
I think she is too careless.

632
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,680
She didn’t even

633
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,040
back up such an important thing.

634
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:49,880
You are right.

635
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,160
She is quite careless.

636
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,800
But I think

637
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,080
it’s mainly because Mi Ka didn’t expect

638
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,400
that her data in the office computer

639
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,520
can be deleted.

640
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,320
Mr. Shao.

641
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,360
My computer got laggy

642
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,280
on that day,

643
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,600
and I needed to see an important report.

644
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,080
So I used her computer.

645
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,400
I didn’t do anything else.

646
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,440
Don’t be nervous.

647
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,200
Mi Ka

648
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,440
didn’t tell me anything.

649
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,760
As your teacher,

650
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,040
I just want to know

651
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,080
what my student did.

652
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,400
Xu Yanshan.

653
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,280
I’ll only ask you once.

654
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,960
Did you do it?

655
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,720
Why did you do it?

656
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,240
All of you

657
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,520
came to ask me why.

658
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,720
But have you ever thought about

659
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,360
what you have done?

660
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,920
Mr. Shao, I know,

661
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,520
in your heart,

662
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,920
Mi Ka is better than me in everything.

663
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,600
Everything she does is right.

664
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,360
She can be forgiven

665
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,360
even when she makes a mistake.

666
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,560
But you can’t see

667
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,880
what I have done for you at all.

668
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,080
You did a lot for me,

669
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,040
and I didn’t respond to you.

670
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,600
That’s because I know

671
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,320
you want something else.

672
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,600
But Mi Ka is not like you

673
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,440
in this regard.

674
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,960
She doesn’t want anything.

675
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:20,960
She is pure.

676
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,680
She just wants to be a good doctor.

677
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,840
To be honest, Xu Yanshan,

678
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,560
your paper is well written this time.

679
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,720
It’s better than Mi Ka’s paper.

680
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,720
Unfortunately, you did

681
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,960
something superfluous.

682
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,200
Do you think I’m better than her?

683
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,240
I always think so.

684
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,640
In terms of academic ability
and talents,

685
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,160
you are much better than Mi Ka.

686
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,240
But unfortunately,

687
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,080
till this moment,

688
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,200
you still don’t know

689
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,720
how to be a good doctor.

690
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,640
Since the surgery in the elevator,

691
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,280
you’ve been

692
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,360
thinking from

693
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,400
your own perspective.

694
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:01,960
Let me ask you,

695
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,040
what makes a good doctor?

696
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:04,840
Xu Yanshan.

697
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,760
A patient’s life

698
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,120
is more important than everything.

699
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,480
It’s more important than your fame,

700
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,280
and your gains and losses.

701
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,400
A patient’s life

702
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,960
is always in the first place!

703
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,800
Always.

704
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:23,880
What about you?

705
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,800
All you have been

706
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,150
thinking about is yourself,

707
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,190
your own interest,

708
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,150
and your gains and losses.

709
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,400
It’s true that,

710
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,400
as a doctor,

711
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,960
I don’t think every doctor

712
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,760
needs to be a moral model.

713
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,400
But there is one thing,

714
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,360
if you want to be a good doctor,

715
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,960
you must have the courage

716
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,040
to save the patient

717
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,230
in crisis

718
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,630
with everything you have.

719
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,800
Courage

720
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,000
is what

721
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,400
you don’t have.

722
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,280
This is what disappoints me the most.

723
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,920
That’s also why

724
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,000
you are not as good as Mi Ka.

725
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:33,760
Thank you.

726
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,200
Miss, here is your drink.

727
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,200
Thank you.

728
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,920
It should be here.

729
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:48,780
See.

730
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,760
Why are you here?

731
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,440
I checked your Weibo.

732
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,480
Didn’t you say

733
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,360
that you would come here today

734
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,440
to check this place?

735
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,400
Are you serious?

736
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,280
I don’t feel that way about you.

737
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,920
Stop wasting your efforts.

738
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,040
Feeling is like

739
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,480
an electrical socket.

740
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,680
Just plug it in and there it is.

741
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,080
So,

742
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,840
do you want to spend more time

743
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,480
to get to know me?

744
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,440
Why should I know you?

745
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,720
I’m not going to spend my life with you.

746
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,000
Then let me be your counselor.

747
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,920
I promise you can get the highest score.

748
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,760
No need, I can do it.

749
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,440
You lost.

750
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,000
Let me try.

751
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,560
Alright, go ahead.

752
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,060
Try it.

753
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:32,920
Let me see how good you are.

754
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,800
Am I good?

755
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,760
Yeah, you are great.

756
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,000
But I prefer

757
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,040
to play Anipop by myself.

758
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,500
Sir.

759
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,720
What do you want to drink?

760
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:53,900
Hello.

761
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,040
Separate checks.

762
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,600
We only share one table.

763
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,960
How about I give you a treat?

764
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,320
Why would I need your treat?

765
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,120
Actually, as a friend,

766
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,600
I’m not a fussy person.

767
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,160
But you are someone

768
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,360
who tends to think too much.

769
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,720
That’s why

770
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,840
we should make it clear.

771
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:12,720
I’m leaving.

772
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,320
Xia.

773
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,200
You just finished training.

774
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,080
I also finished my training.

775
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:57,720
After you take a bath,

776
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,480
we can have a meal together.

777
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,320
How great it is.

778
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,680
No need, I’m not hungry.

779
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,160
What a coincidence.

780
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,640
Don’t tell me

781
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,960
you are stalking me.

782
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,760
This is called fate.

783
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,320
What do you want to do?

784
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,000
To pursue you.

785
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,280
Didn’t I tell you about it

786
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,280
at first?

787
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,440
I also told you at first

788
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,440
that I don’t like you.

789
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,200
Pay attention to the tense.

790
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,120
There is present continuous tense

791
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:07,960
and future tense.

792
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,800
You don’t like me for now.

793
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,760
Tell me.

794
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,800
What the hell do you want?

795
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,760
To create chances to meet you.

796
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,120
Maybe we can

797
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,200
watch a movie,

798
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,520
go to the KTV,

799
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,800
or play role playing games together

800
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,160
to know each other better.

801
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,280
I prefer to

802
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,480
keep my love life simple.

803
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,320
I never get any backup.

804
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,120
Do I become a backup
if we hang out together?

805
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,680
I don’t enjoy being a backup.

806
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,040
We are both off today.

807
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,480
You are alone and I’m alone, too.

808
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,560
Let’s hang out together.

809
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,800
You can order more dishes,

810
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,720
and I can give you advice

811
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,440
when you go shopping.

812
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,640
It’s even better to watch a movie.

813
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,240
The two-person package
is really cost-effective.

814
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:51,760
Right?

815
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,480
Well,

816
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,320
don’t you even want to be my friend?

817
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,160
Not a friend,

818
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,520
I can also be your playmate.

819
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,880
Just friends.

820
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,120
No problem.

821
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:10,920
Gemini Man is on.

822
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,800
Do you want to watch it?

823
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,480
Okay.

824
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,760
I like action movies best.

825
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,280
Go dutch.

826
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,160
Okay, whatever you want.

827
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,120
Gemini Man is on.

828
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,500
I know.

829
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,880
Lu Feng posted a picture on his Moments.

830
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,120
Do these two pictures look alike?

831
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,640
It’s not just alike.

832
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,360
It’s almost the same.

833
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,480
Even the location is the same.

834
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,680
Did they

835
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,480
watch the movie together?

836
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,200
No question.

837
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,800
It’s affirmative.

838
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,680
Are they dating?

839
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,280
Was Captain Shu sent off by a red card?

840
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,840
How could Captain Shu

841
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,200
be sent off by a red card?

842
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,080
However, Captain Shu,

843
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,440
I think you’d better
pay more attention to it.

844
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,480
It looks like

845
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,120
they went to watch the movie together.

846
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,120
Otherwise you are going to be overtaken

847
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,280
by Lu Feng in the second half.

848
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,440
Their business

849
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,360
is not my concern.

850
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,680
Well...

851
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,080
Why is it not your concern?

852
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,600
Alright.

853
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,040
Didn’t you say you want to take a bath?

854
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:29,800
Hurry up.

855
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:30,600
Come on.

856
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,520
Captain Shu.

857
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,200
Take more care with it.

858
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,360
Captain Shu!

859
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:48,060
(Ruan Qingxia’s Moments)

860
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,040
What do you need?

861
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:26,940
Beer.

862
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,840
I... I don’t drink beer.

863
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,160
Me neither.

864
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,800
I’ll drink myself.

865
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,520
What should we eat?

866
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,320
How about

867
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,160
shrimps?

868
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,400
Okay.

869
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,720
We’ll have some shrimps.

870
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,280
How about

871
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,360
some sushi?

872
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,160
He loves sushi. Order it.

873
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:50,780
Sushi.

874
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,680
How about

875
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,800
saury?

876
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,280
He loves fish. Order it.

877
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,400
Can you order

878
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,320
some good dishes?

879
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,040
Saury and hot pot.

880
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,360
Okay, please wait for a moment.

881
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,320
How about

882
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,000
we watch a movie this afternoon?

883
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,920
Which one?

884
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,040
Gemini Man.
