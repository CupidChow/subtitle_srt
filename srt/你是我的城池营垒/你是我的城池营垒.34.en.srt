Daily training is for the combat.

22
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,080
Who can tell me

23
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,200
what the four Invincibles are

30
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,760
Training is for battling better.

31
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,040
And combat

32
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,320
is the presentation of daily training.

33
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,760
So, I hope

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,920
you can show yourself

the combat

38
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,280
or the exercise.

39
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,240
Use me for the first battle.
It will surely win.

40
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,160
Use me for the first battle.
It will surely win.

OK. OK.

Mi Ka.

47
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,480
Mr. Shao.

48
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,880
What’s wrong?

49
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,840
You are looking soulless.

50
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,320
I’ve worked for over 48 hours.

51
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,520
Now I even have black eyes,

52
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,160
looking like a panda.

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,920

Ye Xiaoman went

56
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,080
wants an intern

57
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,320
to study there.

58
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,280
If you are interested in it,

59
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,200
here are the documents.

60
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,760
Are you serious?

61
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,640
Of course, I’m interested in it.

62
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,480
This is my dream during my school days.

63
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,280
Or else?

64
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,200
Do you think I’m kidding you?

65
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,950
I think the course fits you.

66
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:18,800
Of course,

67
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,120
this is my subjective opinion.

68
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,680
Your opinion is very important

69
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,600
to me.

70
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,520
I will study it

71
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,840
after I get back.

72
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,400
Thank you, Mr. Shao.

73
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,360
Just “Thank you”?

74
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,240
I will treat you coffee.

75
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,560
How much will it be?

76
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,440
For the whole life.

77
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,600
Enough.

78
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,160
Jianing.

79
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,920
She grinned cheekily

80
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,000
while she talked to Mr. Shao.

81
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,520
They are like that in public places.

82
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,640
Maybe there is truly an affair

83
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,720
between them.

84
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,960
She’s not simple.

85
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,800
When she is dating Xing Kelei,

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,360
she is also with Mr. Shao.

87
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,200
Jianing, I forgot to ask.

88
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,400
Is Xing Kelei really so heartless?

89
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,680
He didn’t come recently?

90
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,720
I don’t know.

91
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,440
I doubt

92
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,320
it’s Mi Ka playing tricks.

93
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,000
We’ve underestimated her.

94
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,480
I thought she’s a silly girl.

95
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,400
She cheated me.

96
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,080
It must be because of her.

97
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,920
Xing Kelei has accompanied you

98
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,960
all the time.

99
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,800
But he didn’t come all of a sudden.

100
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,880
Listen,

101
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,880
we can give her a hard time

102
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,360
when Xing Kelei is not here.

103
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,720
What can we do?

104
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,760
She has done a very good job.

105
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,400
Nobody can find fault with her.

106
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,200
Otherwise, I’ve complained against her.

107
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,960
I won’t wait till now.

108
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,940
(Sirius Assault Team)

109
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,840
I didn’t think I could meet you again.

110
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,680
Seems you are recovering well.

111
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,680
I’m lucky.

112
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,400
Don’t give ground to me.

113
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,560
See you at the match.

114
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,120
See you.

115
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,000
You are so insensible.

116
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,600
I just knew the institute

117
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,600
starts to hire employees.

118
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,680
No.

119
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,960
You are the heroine of rumor

120
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,280
of this floor again.

121
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,040
It’s not about you and the captain,

122
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,000
but you and Mr. Shao.

123
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,480
What is it?

124
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,520
It’s really ridiculous.

125
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,240
They said Mr. Shao is very good to you.

126
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,680
You must have extraordinary

127
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,840
private relationship.

128
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,200
Who said that? Are they crazy?

129
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,000
Hey, no hurry.

130
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,240
Have you

131
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,240
offended anybody

132
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,080
recently?

133
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,280
Me?

134
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,760
Who can I offend?

135
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,960
For example,

136
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,440
Bed 15.

137
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,360
Bed 15. Ordinary call.

138
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,240
See?

139
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,040
I will go.

140
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,640
Bed 15. Any problem?

141
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,280
Will we transfuse today?

142
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,600
How many bottles do we need?

143
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,520
Not for today.

144
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,800
Jianing can’t sleep well.

145
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,000
Dr. Mi. Tell me what we will do.

146
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,040
You didn’t sleep well?

147
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,680
Is it hard to fall asleep

148
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,280
or do you wake up very often?

149
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,640
Nobody would count the sleeping time.

150
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,360
She just hasn’t slept well.

151
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,280
Very awful.

152
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,880
It’s bad for the recovery.

153
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,240
How about offering Jianing

154
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,280
a private room?

155
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,920
I have to check it out

156
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,240
if there is an empty bed.

157
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,640
Check it out!

158
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,560
You began to check

159
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,600
since we were hospitalized.

160
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,720
But there isn’t any so far.

161
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,600
Are you bullying us?

162
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,440
You must

163
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:50,880
have been

164
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,120
playing.

165
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,900
(MRI Application List)

166
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,760
I’ve check it.

167
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,720
All indexes of her

168
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,800
are normal for today.

169
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,400
It’s a good day today.

170
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,360
How about you

171
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,720
helping her to walk around downstairs?

172
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,760
She just left us here like that.

173
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,520
She found our aim out.

174
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,240
We don’t need to hide anymore.

175
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,880
Do what you should do.

176
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,200
What if Xing Kelei comes back?

177
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,600
She will tell him that, right?

178
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,160
We can tell him something, too.

179
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,320
Great!

180
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,080
You are using tactics.

181
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,760
If not,

182
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,680
we can’t win with my status.

183
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,000
You are not requested to be the winner.

184
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,440
Try your best to have the best score.

185
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,920
But you have to

186
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,760
protect yourself first.

187
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,200
Got it!

188
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,360
Why are you still coming here?

189
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,040
Can’t I come here?

190
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,440
Don’t go there. Too many people there.

191
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,760
Even people in ER are talking

192
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,400
that you and Mr. Shao

193
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,240
have abnormal relationship.

194
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,880
It’s not real.

195
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,760
I know it’s just a rumor.

196
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,040
But they don’t know it.

197
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,560
Half of those
buying steamed stuffed buns

198
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,840
are spreading the rumor.

199
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,920
Standing here?

200
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:45,960
You are in the way.

201
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,840
Mr. Shao, why are you buying so much?

202
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,840
Braised mutton with soy sauce.
Let’s eat together.

203
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,640
OK.

204
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,160
How about you?

205
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,360
Uh.

206
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,520
Then I don’t queue up for the buns.

207
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,000
Let’s go.

208
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,320
I’ll buy some drinks.

209
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,680
OK.

210
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,240
Thank you.

211
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,120
You see it, right?

212
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,000
Sure.

213
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,080
What do you want to do?

214
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,360
Make it clear.

215
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,600
You didn’t fear just now.

216
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,760
You even wanted to buy the buns.

217
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,680
It’s different.

218
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,800
I won’t let this kind of thing

219
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,040
affect my life

220
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,920
and my job.

221
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,280
But I won’t let it

222
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,440
be bygones in a perfunctory manner.

223
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,080
How will you make it clear?

224
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,040
No idea.

225
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,960
Mr. Shao.

226
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,760
Look, if you have

227
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,800
a true girlfriend,

228
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,200
and take her here,

229
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,000
the rumor will end, right?

230
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,360
Eat first.

231
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,840
After finishing the meal,

232
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,200
buy 250g buns for me.

233
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,800
Why still me?

234
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,800
Do as what I said.

235
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:05,760
Fine.

236
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,360
Here you are. Drink some.

237
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,000
Here you are.

238
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,920
Thank you, Captain Hao.

239
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,120
You have good meals recently.

240
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,160
Here.

241
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,440
Drink some.

242
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,880
All mine.

243
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,200
Sir.

244
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,000
Every time you come,

245
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,960
we have Yakult.

246
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,160
So please come more often later on.

247
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,320
He’s No.1 in the world in eating.

248
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,760
Why are you still drinking?

249
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,200
The last half day.

250
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,480
The team match will be wonderful.

251
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,600
Till now,

252
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,760
the three teams

253
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,640
are about the same.

254
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,280
Seems it’ll be settled in one game.

255
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,600
I’m very confident

256
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,760
of you Tiger.

257
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,200
We are confident too.

258
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,280
OK.

259
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,520
Go ahead.

260
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,640
Go ahead!

261
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,480
Captain Xing.

262
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,840
Team competition and

263
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,120
individual one will go in succession.

264
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,440
Will your hand be OK?

265
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,000
Team competition first.

266
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,160
Good luck.

267
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,040
Captain Zhuang, good luck.

268
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,520
-Good luck, Captain Xing.
-Captain Xing, good luck.

269
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,840
Good luck.

270
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:20,800
-Captain Zhuang.
-Captain Xing.

271
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,400
Captain Xing, good luck.

272
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,040
Captain Zhuang, good luck.

273
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,600
Captain Xing, good luck.

274
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,240
Captain Zhuang, good luck.

275
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,760
Captain Xing, good luck.

276
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,280
Captain Zhuang, good luck.

277
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,800
Captain Xing, good luck.

278
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,320
Captain Zhuang, good luck.

279
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,840
Captain Xing, good luck.

280
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,560
Captain Zhuang, good luck.

281
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,240
Captain Xing, good luck.

282
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,840
Captain Zhuang, good luck.

283
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,800
Captain Xing, good luck.

284
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,000
Captain Zhuang, good luck.

285
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,360
Captain Xing, good luck.

286
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,000
Captain Zhuang, good luck.

287
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,560
Captain Xing, good luck.

288
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,280
Captain Zhuang, good luck.

289
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,000
Captain Xing, good luck.

Captain Xing, good luck.

294
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,720
Captain Zhuang, good luck.

295
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,440
Captain Xing, good luck.

296
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,320
Good luck.

297
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,160
Captain Zhuang, good luck.

298
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,440
OK. OK. OK.

299
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,880
(Office of Director)
See you, Mr. Shao.

300
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,480
This is Mr. Shao’s

301
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,280
girlfriend.

302
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,560
So beautiful.

303
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,840
Rumors are eventually scotched.

304
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,640
You can’t help smiling.

305
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,320
Do you know why

306
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,400
I ask you here?

307
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,800
Of course.

308
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,560
To see

309
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,200
the one who started your rumor.

310
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,830
You are really smart.

311
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,280
I

312
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,480
want to avoid some

313
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,480
unnecessary troubles.

314
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,920
In that case,

315
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,310
Mi Ka can focus on her work.

316
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,240
Don’t you need to focus on your work?

317
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,350
You think about it.

318
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,120
Everyone is saying

319
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,880
Shao Yuhan has no affair with Mi Ka.

320
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,960
His true girlfriend is here.

321
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,480
Seems she and Mi Ka

322
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,360
are good friends.

323
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,760
Is Mi Ka that popular?

324
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,320
How could she solve all problems?

325
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,280
Ke… Keyao.

326
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,240
Keyao, it’s been a while.

327
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,520
Nice to meet you.

328
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,480
We didn’t want to disturb you,

329
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,320
so, we didn’t let Kelei tell you.

330
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,520
Look, Jianing and I…

331
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,000
Kelei didn’t tell me about that.

332
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,120
Mr. Shao working here

333
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,360
is my friend from college.

334
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,880
I’m here today to see him.

335
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,440
Then I knew you are here.

336
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,880
Thank you, Keyao.

337
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,720
Jianing, take a good rest.

338
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,640
There are many ways for recovery.

339
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,480
Mr. Shao said

340
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,480
there is definitely no problem.

341
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,040
Thank you for your concern, Keyao.

342
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,960
You must follow the doctor’s advice.

343
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,480
Don’t think too much about

344
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,760
those you shouldn’t think.

345
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,720
Take a good rest.

346
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,920
Keyao, you are right.

347
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,560
I have to leave for my business.

348
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,760
See you, Keyao.

349
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,320
She wasn’t here to see her friend.

350
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,080
It must be Mi Ka telling her that.

351
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,760
The woman

352
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,240
isn’t as simple as we think.

353
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,600
She even knew

354
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,320
Xing Keyao doesn’t

355
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,400
like us.

356
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,180
(Nationwide Public Security
System Combat)

357
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,400
Now I’m announcing

358
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,760
Team No.1,

359
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,080
Tiger Assault Team.

360
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,680
Team No.2,

361
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,560
Black Panther Assault Team.

362
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,400
No.1 of individual shooting,

363
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,840
Zhuang Zhiwen.

364

00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,560

367
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,400
Xing Kelei.

368
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,080
-Great!

369
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,480
I just knew you were injured.

370
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,040
The rank doesn’t count.

371
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,360
Of course, it counts.

372
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,520
You

373
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,800
are a respectable rival.

374
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,680
Let’s continue next year.

375
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,920
Great!

376
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,520
Captain, you are so amazing.

377
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,680
Our team got No.1

378
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,720
thanks to your hard work.

379
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,320
Team competition is close in time

380
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,680
with individual competition.

381
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,520
Captain Xing is the only one

382
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,920
competing in succession.

383
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,400
Enough.

384
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,000
Put me down. I have things to do.

385
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,440
Put Captain down. Quickly.

386
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,600
His waist isn’t good.

387
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,520
Later, Captain Hao

388
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,840
will treat us a meal.

389
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,720
OK.

390
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,600
Captain Xing, the competition is over.

391
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,680
What’s the business?

392
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,760
You don’t understand it.

393
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,000
Captain Xing hasn’t met

394
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,840
Dr. Mi for days.

395
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,680
You blabber.

396
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,120
I… I’m making a phone call.

397
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:29,920
Keyao.

398
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:30,560
What’s wrong?

399
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,440
Warrior, combat finished?

400
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:33,960
You know what?

401
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:34,600
I won…

402
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,400
Let’s talk about that later.

403
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,360
Go home tonight.

404
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,360
I have something to tell you.

405
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,360
What’s it?

406
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,680
Don’t ask. Go home first.

407
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:44,920
What’s it?

408
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:45,680
Is everything going well?

409
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,800
Something happened at home.

410
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,640
I have to leave now.

411
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,600
Take them to have the meal.

412
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,200
OK.

413
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,840
What’s it? Why so hurry?

414
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,480
You made the awful mess.

415
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,600
Of course, I’m anxious.

416
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,880
So, I have to ask you to come back.

417
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,520
What’s wrong?

418
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,360
In order to repay

419
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,440
Captain Shen’s help and encouragement,

420
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,280
you left the two girls here

421
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,280
for illness treating.

422
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,800
But they are now embarking on a venture.

423
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,400
They’ve made a lot of troubles,

424
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,320
finding fault with Mi Ka,

425
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,360
and making affair

426
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,080
of Shao Yuhan and Mi Ka.

427
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,920
Mi Ka didn’t tell me that.

428
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,720
That’s not the point.

429
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,040
What’s your plan now?

430
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,120
If they are daughters

431
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,080
of other people,

432
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,720
things won’t be that hard.

433
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,440
But they are daughters of your captain.

434
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,840
You can’t bear

435
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,120
to let them leave.

436
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,760
They’re insatiable if we let them stay.

437
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,960
You tell me what to do.

438
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,240
But, the thing…

439
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,680
How about

440
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:56,960
you deal with it?

441
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,520
How can I?

442
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,640
No, it’s not just

443
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,720
for my concern.

444
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,160
Captain Shen is

445
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,360
our dad’s friend, right?

446
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,880
You are the one doing that.

447
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,480
The two have always been like that.

448
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,400
It’s not convenient for me.

449
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,560
Please me first.

450
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,480
Please.

451
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,720
The pistachio nut is for you.

452
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,720
Be happy.

453
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:26,760
Here you are.

454
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,560
I will think of it.

455
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,480
Bed 15. Ordinary call.

456
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,360
Why did she ring it again?

457
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,320
Is there an end?

458
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:48,960
Something

459
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:49,960
must be wrong with Bed 15.

460
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,440
They ring the bell five times
in two minutes.

461
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,440
But they are just petty things.

462
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,840
Bed 15. Ordinary call.

463
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,680
Don’t go.

464
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,480
They want me.

465
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,160
I don’t go?

466
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,360
They want you,

467
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,240
so, don’t go.

468
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,560
-It’ll kill me.
-Jianing.

469
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,040
Call the doctor.

470
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:08,960
Doctor.

471
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,600
Call the doctor.

472
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,440
Doctor.

473
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,600
Doctor in charge of beds.

474
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,720
Where is the doctor?

475
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,400
Why isn’t the doctor coming?

476
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,320
Bed 15 family.

477
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,760
What did you say?

478
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,800
Bed 15 family.

479
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,920
You rang the bell five times

480
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,800
within two minutes.

481
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,200
We went to your ward every time.

482
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,240
But there hasn’t been

483
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,240
any real thing happening.

484
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,040
You are interfering

485
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,160
our work, you know?

486
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,920
Jianing doesn’t feel comfortable.

487
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,160
What should we do?

488
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,160
It’ll kill me. Someone!

489
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,440
Come on.

490
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,680
We just went there.

491
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,320
But nothing happened.

492
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,120
Let’s go.

493
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,640
Jianing.

494
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,960
Ouch! Dr. Mi.

495
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,280
-Help.
-Come on! Quick.

496
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:56,920
Take a look.

497
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:58,880
Jianing.

498
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,920
What’s wrong? Jianing.

499
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,360
I have a headache.

500
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,200
What’s wrong with her?

501
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,720
You are standing here. Can’t you see?

502
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,120
How could you be a doctor?

503
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,400
-Jianing.
-Can you tell me

504
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,160
what your name is?

505
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,800
Xiaoxiao, call the attending doctor.

506
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,360
I… I’m Shen Jianing.

507
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,400
Still sober.

508
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,000
Just headache?

509
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,800
What’s your problem?

510
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,240
Jianing is hurting seriously.

511
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,720
No examination. No medicine.

512
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,640
No injection.

513
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,640
Even no single-bed room

514
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,640
for her.

515
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,680
Come on.

516
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,040
Everyone, take a look.

517
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:26,920
Bed 15 family.

518
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,240
How can you make up stories?

519
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,440
I’m not making up stories.

520
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,040
Can’t you see it yourself?

521
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,480
Bed 15 family.

522
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,000
The headache of the patient

523
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,240
has been diagnosed.

524
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,480
It’s stress headache.

525
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,440
If you think

526
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,800
there is a problem with the diagnosis,

527
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,920
please discuss with

528
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,560
your attending doctor.

529
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,120
Maybe he can enlarge the scope

530
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,040
from Neurosurgery

531
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,000
to other departments

532
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,400
and let doctors from other departments

533
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,560
diagnose it as well.

534
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:48,760
Anyway, I believe

535
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,440
your attending doctor

536
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,240
has reminded you that

537
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,640
the patient needs a good rest.

538
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,160
Shen Jianan.

539
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,680
As the family member of the patient,

540
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,640
you’ve been shouting here

541
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,480
and affecting other patients.

542
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,600
It has no good

543
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,840
to Jianing’s recovery.

544
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,080
Do you mean

545
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,960
I’m making a mistake?

546
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,160
Just talk.

547
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,160
No fighting.

548
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,880
Why are you fighting?

549
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,560
Right. What are you doing?

550
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,240
Jianan.

551
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,440
It kills me.

552
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,080
Jianing.

553
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,200
Is your head

554
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,200
hurting badly?

555
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,200
Yes.

556
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,560
I will ask the attending doctor

557
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,680
to get you some

558
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,280
painkiller

559
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,200
like Demerol.

560
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,360
You have to keep calm.

561
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,280
Or it won’t be good

562
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,040
to your headache.

563
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,200
What’s more,

564
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,680
there isn’t a single-bed room available.

565
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,080
I should apologize.

566
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,600
But I have to act according to

567
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,640
the processes of the hospital.

568
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,080
You just get out.

569
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,560
Jianing.

570
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,320
Xiaoxiao.

571
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,840
Call the security section.

572
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,320
OK.

573
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,880
Hello, security section.

574
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,920
This is Inpatient Department
of Neurosurgery.

575
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,440
Family member of Bed 15, Ward 3

576
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,840
is emotionally instable,

577
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,840
greatly affecting

578
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,680
regular work

579
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,520
of the medical staff.

580
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,680
Please arrange people

581
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,480
to take her away.

582
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:52,680
OK.

583
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:53,840
Good.

584
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,840
Come on.

585
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,680
Ask every one of your hospital to come.

586
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,840
Shen Jianan.

587
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,160
I have my breaking point.

588
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,240
Xing Kelei is my boyfriend.

589
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,320
You are daughters of his mentor.

590
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,000
You can come for help

591
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,040
when you need.

592
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,280
But I can’t believe

593
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,680
you are so ungrateful.

594
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,440
I don’t make trouble.

595
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,880
But I also don’t fear of anything.

596
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,680
If you keep bullying me,

597
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,080
I won’t yield to you.

598
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,040
If you keep spreading rumors,

599
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,840
I will call the police
instead of security.

600
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,560
Are you threatening me?

601
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,960
Kelei is a special policeman.

602
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:26,920
Call him.

603
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,280
OK. I will ask him to come.

604
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,520
I don’t think this thing

605
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,600
is beyond the law.

606
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,680
Every word you are saying now

607
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,000
is heard by the patients, their families

608
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,040
and my colleagues.

609
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,320
They all can give evidence.

610
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,680
If you want to say,

611
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,000
stand here

612
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:40,920
and keep saying it.

613
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,120
I won’t stop you.

614
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,200
Let’s go.

615
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,360
-Enough.
-Come…

616
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,360
The families are of poor moral quality.

617
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,680
What are you doing?

618
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,360
Ask Mr. Zhang to make a prescription

619
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,200
of Demerol for her.

620
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,000
Hey, you knew

621
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,520
she’s pretending.

622
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,560
It should be judged

623
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,760
by her attending doctor.

624
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,480
Enough.

625
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,240
Look at her attitude.

626
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,480
Shen Jianan, family member of Bed 15?

627
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,880
-Who are you?
-Come with us.

628
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,280
Come with us.

629
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,080
What are you doing?

630
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,160
What’s wrong, sir?

631
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,600
I don’t know you.

632
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,080
Why should I go with you?

633
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,920
Sir. Sir.

634
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,280
Let go of me.

635
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,480
Don’t touch me.

636
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,440
Don’t go.

637
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,800
Where are you bringing me to?

638
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,640
Let go of me.

639
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,280
Don’t take my sister away.

640
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,120
What’s going on?

641
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,320
Make way.

642
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,160
Sir.

643
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,160
Let go of me.

644
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:34,920
Don’t quarrel here.

645
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,080
Kelei.

646
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,200
Kelei. You finally come.

647
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,480
What’s going on?

648
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,000
Dr. Mi called the security section

649
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:41,960
and asked us to take away

650
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,040
the patient’s family
disturbing the order.

651
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,600
I didn’t.

652
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,600
What did you do?

653
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,880
I didn’t do anything.

654
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,880
She didn’t do anything.

655
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,080
Jianan was just in a fit rage.

656
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,400
She spoke a little louder.

657
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,480
It’s not just being louder.

658
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,440
It’s extremely harsh.

659
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,160
What are you saying?

660
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,640
She said Mi Ka
didn’t care about the patients

661
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,520
but stayed in the hospital

662
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,280
by having affairs with men.

663
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,800
-I didn’t.
-Shut up.

664
00:27:59,200 --> 00:27:59,960
Stop shouting.

665
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,160
Sir, please take her away.

666
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,120
Just punish or teach her a lesson

667
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,080
according to the rules.

668
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:04,920
-Kelei.
-No.

669
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,080
Keyao. Keyao.

670
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,760
Kelei, I don’t dare to do so anymore.

671
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:08,760
Kelei.

672
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,680
Please.

673
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,640
If Captain Shen knows

674
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,600
what you are like now,

675
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,280
he would be very sad.

676
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,640
We’ve done everything we could.

677
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,520
Try to do your best.

678
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,360
Kelei, wait for me outside.

679
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,800
Kelei.

680
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,960
Lei.

681
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:25,760
Sir.

682
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,480
Leave her to me.

683
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,440
Thank you.

684
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:28,840
OK. Let’s go.

685
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,240
Well, just go back.

686
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,080
Leave here. Stop looking.

687
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,160
I’m very clear about

688
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,040
what you are thinking.

689
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,320
But I have to tell you

690
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,360
it’s impossible.

691
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,040
Xing Kelei has never been

692
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,960
like what you think.

693
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,960
So, don’t put effort

694
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:48,920
into breaking up him and Mi Ka.

695
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,080
Even if Mi Ka didn’t appear,

696
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,920
it won’t be you never ever.

697
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,680
I’ve arranged it for you.

698
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,400
You will be transferred back

699
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,040
to the hospital in your hometown
tomorrow.

700
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,040
It’s convenient

701
00:28:59,200 --> 00:28:59,920
for rehabilitation.

702
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,760
I will pay for it.

703
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,280
And you,

704
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,160
I’ve got a job for you.

705
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,360
Go back to work after being trained.

706
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,520
Captain Shen had been good to Kelei
before his death.

707
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,760
So, we will surely help

708
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,000
when you have troubles.

709
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,920
But please

710
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:09,920
don’t do anything

711
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,400
good to none but worse to yourselves.

712
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,680
Mi Ka is very important to Kelei.

713
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,000
Don’t challenge the bottom line

714
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,240
of Kelei and me.

715
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,280
Dr. Mi.

716
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,280
Take this back to the office for me.

717
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:27,800
OK.

718
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,840
You must have suffered pains.

719
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,320
I’m OK.

720
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,080
You are lying.

721
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,800
Is everything well arranged?

722
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,960
Keyao will deal with it.

723
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,960
I can’t believe

724
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,960
they’ve become like this.

725
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,600
Anyway, I’m sorry

726
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,080
for your sufferings.

727
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,480
Find a way to make me happy.

728
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,760
Make…

729
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,720
Make you happy?

730
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,960
Make…

731
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,080
Booming.

732
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,880
How is the combat?

733
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,320
The third place.

734
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,520
Great.

735
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,160
Treat me dinner after work.

736
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:19,840
OK.

737
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,040
Then I’m leaving now.

738
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,520
Welcome.

739
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,640
Eat as much as you can.

740
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,520
You’d better become

741
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,760
like the chubby girl

742
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,720
in the New Year pictures.

743
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,640
Then I will be happy.

744
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,200
Please sit down.

745
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,040
Waiter, order please.

746
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,320
Excuse me.

747
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,440
Thank you.

748
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,720
How much delicious food can I eat

749
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,080
with my limited stomach?

750
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,720
Order anything you want.

751
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,760
I will finish it if you can’t.

752
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,400
I’m waiting for the word from you.

753
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:23,640
OK.

754
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,200
This.

755
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,680
This one.

756
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,280
OK.

757
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,400
And this one.

758
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:31,600
OK.

759
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,560
This one.

760
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,400
OK.

761
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,080
Two for this.

762
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:35,920
OK.

763
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,920
You ordered two main courses.

764
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,600
Is the second one

765
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,520
for this gentleman?

766
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,400
No.

767
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,960
It’s all for me.

768
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,120
He will have it if I can’t finish.

769
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,400
Yes, I will finish it.

770
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,520
OK. OK. OK.

771
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,080
Yes.

772
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,160
Thank you.

773
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,200
They all take photos

774
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,480
before having the meal.

775
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,400
How about we take some too?

776
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,240
I will shoot you.

777
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,320
No.

778
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,400
Let’s be together.

779
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:10,720
OK.

780
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,640
How is it?

781
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,640
Will we edit it?

782
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,080
Not necessary.

783
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,960
It’s been perfect.

784
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,480
Let me see.

785
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,080
Am I perfect?

786
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,300
(Ruan Qingxia)

787
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,360
Wait for a moment.

788
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,360
Xia.

789
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,400
What’s wrong?

790
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,720
Mi Ka.

791
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,800
Where are you?

792
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,640
Can I come to you?

793
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,000
I’m very fiery.

794
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,040
I extremely need to talk to someone.

795
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:39,840
I’m bursting with anger.

796
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,040
I’ll take a taxi to your home.

797
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,360
What’s wrong with you?

798
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,480
Does the psycho… What is it?

799
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:46,960
Well,

800
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,480
the combat is over.

801
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,320
Where is Shu Wenbo?

802
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,480
Don’t mention him anymore.

803
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,280
I have to see you right now.

804
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,040
Right now.

805
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,080
OK. OK.

806
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,680
We are having dinner outside.

807
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,000
I will pack the dishes now.

808
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,560
Let’s go. Xia wants me.

809
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,600
What’s wrong?

810
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,200
It must be related to Shu Wenbo.

811
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,320
Waiter.

812
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,680
Please pack the dishes I just ordered.

813
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:06,440
OK.

814
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,880
I will ask Shu Wenbo to compensate

815
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,880
for this meal.

816
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,520
What a silly guy!

817
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,440
It seems Shu Wenbo

818
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,720
still needs to learn more

819
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,080
about loving and dating.

820
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,080
Their colors change
after the dishes are heated.

821
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,160
Why are you home today?

822
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,920
It’s Thursday today.

823
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,360
We are on holiday.

824
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,880
Holiday?

825
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,280
He refused me even on holiday.

826
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,560
Why did he do that?

827
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,160
I…

828
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,080
Eat the dishes.

829
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:39,680
I’m angry.

830
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,240
I don’t want it. It makes me mad.

831
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,920
At the most, it means

832
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,240
Shu Wenbo

833
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,800
is dating for the first time.

834
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,040
He doesn’t have any experience.

835
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:47,760
Yes.

836
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,080
Xing Kelei said

837
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,000
it’s his first time, too.

838
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,480
It’s true.

839
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,680
What’s more, there won’t be

840
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,080
too many splendid guys like me.

841
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,560
What’s wrong?

842
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,280
Your boyfriend spares

843
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,400
no effort to praise himself.

844
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,320
After listening to the joke,

845
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,800
are you feeling better now?

846
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,360
Joke?

847
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,320
Come on. Have the dishes.

848
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,630
What’s the matter now?

849
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,760
Look, Shu Wenbo behaved like that.

850
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,670
I should also take the responsibility

851
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,630
as the captain.

852
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,960
I will take him out tomorrow,

853
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,280
and give you

854
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,960
a good-looking boyfriend,

855
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,480
with high IQ and EQ.

856
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,120
OK?

857
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,440
Happier now?

858
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,040
He will punish him.

859
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,440
Come on.

860
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,400
Fine.

861
00:34:59,080 --> 00:34:59,920
I finally have a holiday.

862
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,000
Now I’m the third person.

863
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,680
Excuse me, your coffee.

864
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,360
Thank you.

865
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:15,960
My pleasure.

866
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,760
Do you know why you are here?

867
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,400
I can take your car

868
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,600
when we return tonight.

869
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,240
Don’t you realize

870
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,440
any mistake?

871
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,840
Hao criticized me?

872
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,080
I’d ask you a question.

873
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,320
You went to see a movie

874
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,400
with Xia, right?

875
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,040
What have you done?

876
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,520
Nothing.

877
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,280
It’s an affectional film.

878
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,160
I even bought a set of popcorn.

879
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,760
The seats are great, too.

880
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,600
I didn’t ask you about that.

881
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,520
What did you do?

882
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,920
Hand in hand?

883
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,640
How many buckets did you buy?

884
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,480
Why didn’t you buy all of them

885
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,440
to make you full?

886
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,720
It is like this.

887
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,040
Put a bucket of popcorn here.

888
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,520
And then you two eat it together.

889
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,640
Understand?

890
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,560
Like this?

891
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,160
After the combat,

892
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,640
what did you do?

893
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,560
After the meal,

894
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,800
I went out

895
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,840
and invited Xia for dinner.

896
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,200
Xia was very happy.

897
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,800
She said anything would be OK.

898
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,120
She wanted to go to the mountain top.

899
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,600
I said it’s too late.

900
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,840
It will affect rest.

901
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,200
And it’s blowy

902
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,440
during night.

903
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,560
She would catch a cold.

904
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,080
I said I send you back early.

905
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,880
Then…

906
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,720
Then I went to the rest room.

907
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,840
After I went out,

908
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,560
she was lost.

909
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,360
Hey, if you were afraid she was cold,

910
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,480
why didn’t you take her

911
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,320
to take a sauna?

912
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,760
Captain Xing, no kidding please.

913
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,960
I’m not kidding.

914
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,760
Let me figure it out this way.

915
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,000
All wrong.

916
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,480
Why?

917
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,760
Don’t focus on that.

918
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,080
You were wrong.

919
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:58,920
I…

920
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,040
It’s just the time.

921
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,120
See the rain?

922
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,480
Even the God is helping you.

923
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,240
Go buy an umbrella and pick up Xia.

924
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,520
OK. OK.

925
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,040
Quickly.

926
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:11,840
Now?

927
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,400
Hurry.

928
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,920
Come on. Hurry.

929
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,560
-Go.

930
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,240
OK. OK.

931
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,560
Oh my God!

932
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,760
You know

933
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,920
I’m a treasure now?

934
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,240
Treasure?

935
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,280
Turn waste into wealth.

936
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,000
The numskull.

937
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,360
To my surprise,

938
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,360
he can be like this.

939
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,080
It seems he’s from

940
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,240
the last century.

941
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,520
If things go in this way,

942
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,880
I need to pay more attention.

943
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,400
Otherwise,

944
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,680
it’s hard to get one for him.

945
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,160
You are really like the captain.

946
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,360
Right?

947
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,040
Yes.

948
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,920
You bought two umbrellas. Huh?

949
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,560
We are two persons.

950
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,160
Xia will use one to go home.

951
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,320
I will use one to return the team.

952
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,000
Should I buy one more?

953
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,440
You don’t have one, right?

954
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,200
I will buy another one.

955
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:15,920
Sit!

956
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,200
Umbrella!

957
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,480
Go!

958
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,960
Pick up Xia. She will get off work.

959
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,120
Quickly.

960
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,120
OK. OK. I’m leaving. See you.

961
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:29,640
Go.

962
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,880
He’s really a numskull. God!

963
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,440
But I think

964
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,080
he’s just slow.

965
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,880
Maybe he’ll be better later on.

966
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,640
I don’t think there will be

967
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,800
a problem for today.

968
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,760
After getting off work,

969
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,520
Xia sees her beloved one

970
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,880
at the building gate,

971
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
waiting for her with an umbrella,

972
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,040
and everyone will see it.

973
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,840
She will be very happy.

974
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,080
But I am not sure about it.

975
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,320
Xia.

976
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,480
What’s wrong?

977
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,520
Why? Why are you unhappy again?

978
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,320
Xia walked very fast.

979
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,560
I will use the washroom.

980
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,640
What did you do this time?

981
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,000
Nothing.

982
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,040
I held the umbrella for her.

983
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,360
How?

984
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,240
I…

985
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,040
She walked in front.

986
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:03,680
I was behind her.

987
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,280
She was under the umbrella.

988
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,000
I was out of it.

989
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,000
What’s wrong?

990
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,800
We gave you one umbrella

991
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,280
so that you can

992
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,520
use it this way.

993
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,000
Or this way.

994
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,120
This way?

995
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,560
The umbrella is small.

996
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,040
If the rain is heavier,

997
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,480
Xia would get wet.

998
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,320
-Not that.

999
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,360
Sit down.

1000
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,680
My words may not be right.

1001
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:31,840
But listen,

1002
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,240
since you’ve invited Xia

1003
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,480
to see a film,

1004
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,720
if you want to lead her by the hand,

1005
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,640
you should be active, right?

1006
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,840
You would enjoy the night scene
on the mountain.

1007
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,640
Xia cherished the time

1008
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,720
being with you.

1009
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,160
But what did you do?

1010
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,320
Oh, I see.

1011
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,120
I don’t think he’s understood.

1012
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,040
Let’s speak it this way.

1013
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,160
You are a couple.

1014
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,560
If Xia wants to

1015
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,320
do something,

1016
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,720
you just accompany her.

1017
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,840
Don’t have too many opinions.

1018
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,440
Plus,

1019
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,480
think it over

1020
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,280
how you two

1021
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,080
fell in love with each other.

1022
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,600
What did you do that day?

1023
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,800
I see, Captain.

1024
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,720
Really?

1025
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,760
I will go home.

1026
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,440
Let me accompany you.

1027
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:16,880
No.

1028
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,440
Yes.

1029
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,520
He does better than his master.

1030
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,440
A fast learner.

1031
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,160
Better than his master?

1032
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,000
Then I will be like that too.

1033
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,480
No.

1034
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,360
