Beer.

22
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,160
I don’t drink alcohol.

23
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,640
Me neither.

24
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,200
I’ll drink alone.

25
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,880
What do you like to eat?

26
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,560
Why not have some shrimps?

27
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,760
Fine.

28
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:02,960
Serve us some shrimps.

29
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,840
Why not have some sushi?

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,440
He likes sushi. Order some sushi.

31
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,360
Sushi.

32
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,000
Why not have some

33
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,320
pacific saury?

34
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,760
He likes fish.

35
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,840
Order some.

36
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,440
Can you order a more appetizing dish?

37
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,600
Saury and a hot pot.

38
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,400
Why not go and watch
a movie this afternoon?

39
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,320
Which movie?

40
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,360
Gemini Man.

41
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,840
I can book the tickets.

42
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,000
At what time?

43
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,560
Now it’s 1:00 PM.

44
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,640
We can buy tickets around 3:00 PM.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,120
3:00 PM?

46
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,400
Three tickets?

47
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,480
Yes.

48
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,240
Three tickets.

49
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,960
And a big bucket of popcorn.

50
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,800
A big bucket of popcorn.

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,480
You eat like a horse.

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,720
I think

53
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,280
based on his current situation,

54
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,440
we will be

55
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,680
too late for the movie.

56
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,440
It’s already late.

57
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,920
Three tickets, over one hundred yuan.

58
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,200
And a big

59
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,840
bucket of popcorn.

60
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,840
How about

61
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,480
we go to watch the movie first?

62
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,840
Perhaps when we’re back,

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,960
he’s still drinking here.

64
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,280
I think it’s a good idea.

65
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,720
We’re not in

66
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,440
his world now.

67
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,480
He’s in another world.

68
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,680
I know.

69
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:16,950
Be careful. Be careful.

70
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,480
No...

71
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,120
-No worries.
-What’s wrong?

72
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,920
I’m fine.

73
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,760
-You are not fine at all.
-Luo Ting,

74
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:21,380
you hold him.

75
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,560
I’ll fetch the key.

76
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,240
Be careful. Be careful.

77
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,600
The key is in the door.

78
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,920
The key. Key.

79
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,800
I know.

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,080
Watch your head.

81
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,440
Hold him.

82
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,280
Hold his arm.

83
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,520
Yes.

84
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,160
My gosh.

85
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,560
He said that has

86
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,920
nothing to do with him,

87
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,200
but he just got himself drunk.

88
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,960
That means he likes her.

89
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,920
He should tell her if he likes her.

90
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,240
But he won’t tell

91
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,160
and just suffers here.

92
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,600
Not everyone is like you.

93
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,800
I know him better.

94
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,920
It sounds you

95
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,080
have some untold

96
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,920
stories.

97
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,440
Xia, don’t leave me.

98
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,280
Xia,

99
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,960
listen to me.

100
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:22,960
Wenbo,

101
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,120
I am not Xia.

102
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,400
Xia.

103
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,360
Since I was a kid,

104
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,560
I... never woo...

105
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,120
I have never

106
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,680
wooed a girl

107
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,920
or had any romance.

108
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,600
I only want to get married.

109
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,040
Get married.

110
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,920
But,

111
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,280
forget about you.

112
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,160
You can’t.

113
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,120
No. No.

114
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,640
I can’t.

115
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,880
I can’t, either.

116
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,760
I can’t.

117
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,880
Why I can’t, Xia?

118
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,440
Why I can’t?

119
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,720
Captain Shu, I am not Xia.

120
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,920
I’m Nian.

121
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,240
Xia, listen to me.

122
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,480
I...

123
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,280
What a poor man.

124
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,000
Look at him. I nearly cried.

125
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,720
Let’s go.

126
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,080
Thankfully we’re single.

127
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,760
This kind of tumor

128
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,920
is mostly benign.

129
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,720
It’s unlikely to turn malignant,

130
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,360
but the problem is that

131
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,600
it has grown too big.

132
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,800
You must have treatment right now.

133
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,080
We suggest you have

134
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,880
a craniotomy as soon as possible.

135
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:00,800
Captain Xing,

136
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,560
why are you here?
I’m looking for you.

137
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,000
What’s up?

138
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,280
Don’t you remember?

139
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,680
Xia will interview you

140
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,880
and all of us are
in the conference room

141
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,440
waiting for you.

142
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,160
Be quick and change your clothes.

143
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,400
(Tiger Assault Team)
You must film this part

144
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,160
as the background.

145
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,920
All right?

146
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,920
And adjust the horizontal axis.

147
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,840
Don’t get off balance at the beginning.

148
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,400
All right, Xia.

149
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,880
Hello.

150
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,080
I am here today

151
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,560
to interview your Captain Xing.

152
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,560
Do you have any questions to ask him

153
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,960
but you’ve been shy to ask?

154
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,040
I can do you a favor.

155
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,080
I don’t have any questions.

156
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,520
Don’t make trouble.

157
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,040
Don’t be hard on him.

158
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,880
You’ll surely dump me for him.

159
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,080
-Captain Hao.
-Can’t talk.

160
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,120
I’ll hang up. Bye-bye.

161
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,040
Captain Hao.

162
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,320
You’ve put on airs,

163
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,160
right?

164
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,520
Many people are waiting for you.

165
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,720
Sorry.

166
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,080
What were you doing last night?

167
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,640
Why do you look so tired?

168
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,920
I didn’t sleep well.

169
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,840
Hmm... I’m not used to interviews.

170
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,000
Why not let her interview you?

171
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,400
Not used to it?

172
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,000
You need to get used to it from now on.

173
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,440
You’ve been the youngest captain

174
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,280
of our Tiger Assault Team.

175
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,480
You’ll go to the police competition

176
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,000
on behalf of us.

177
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,520
There are a lot of interviews
waiting for you.

178
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,680
We’re ready.

179
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,800
Relax.

180
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:24,920
Go ahead.

181
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,760
Come on, Captain Xing.

182
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,360
Let’s begin.

183
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,360
Okay.

184
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,360
Begin.

185
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,670
Captain Xing,

186
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,030
as the youngest captain since

187
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,200
the founding
of the Tiger Assault Team,

188
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,150
Jiangning Special Police,

189
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,960
can you talk about

190
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,880
what makes you become

191
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,320
a special policeman?

192
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,560
I started practicing shooting
in high school

193
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,080
and later I won
the national champion.

194
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,640
Then I went to the police academy

195
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,520
where I became a special policeman.

196
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,800
We know that

197
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,640
special police is a stressful

198
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,840
and dangerous job,

199
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,200
so why did you choose it

200
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,640
as your profession?

201
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,440
We need someone to bear

202
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,760
the hard work and the dangers.

203
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,680
Has it occurred to you

204
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,880
to give up

205
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,920
the job?

206
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:15,960
No.

207
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,100
Stop.

208
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,800
Captain Xing,

209
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,000
your answers are too simple.

210
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:23,960
It’s difficult for us to make
a story out of it.

211
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,440
Can you say a bit more?

212
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,280
Okay. Okay.

213
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,680
I’ll try.

214
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,080
Begin.

215
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,960
The national security police competition

216
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,000
draws near.

217
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,470
You’ve led

218
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,240
the Tiger Assault Team

219
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,640
to win two consecutive champions

220
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,240
and yourself have been

221
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,920
a double winner of the shooting event.

222
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,480
Do you have the confidence

223
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,480
to win a third time?

224
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,840
Yes.

225
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,480
We’ll try our best

226
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,080
and live up to

227
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,280
everyone’s high expectations on us.

228
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,800
You’ve always been

229
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,960
working on the front line.

230
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,280
But I also hear that

231
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,760
you’re the visiting professor
at one police academy,

232
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,080
giving field training lessons

233
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,080
to students.

234
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,640
You’ve already been so busy
with the work at the front line.

235
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,760
If you get married in the future,

236
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,640
will you give up your work

237
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,080
at the front line?

238
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,720
Captain Xing?

239
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,600
I...

240
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,680
I don’t know.

241
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,160
I never thought of

242
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,840
what else I could do

243
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,560
if I was no longer a policeman.

244
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,480
Sorry, I think we can stop here.

245
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,000
So, let’s call it a day.

246
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,160
Miss Xia,

247
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,360
if you haven’t gotten enough materials,

248
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,800
can we make them up another day?

249
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,400
Okay, we’ll stop here.

250
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,720
I’ll go back and sort them out.

251
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,760
Okay.

252
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,080
-Come here, Shu Wenbo.
-Edit the video

253
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:58,720
we recorded today.

254
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,360
We can film more in another day
if that’s not enough.

255
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,440
Your captain looks not
in the right mood.

256
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,160
Take care of him.

257
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,720
Don’t give him too much pressure.

258
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,660
Okay.

259
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,000
I’ll check up on him.

260
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,040
Xia.

261
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,280
Aren’t you going to eat?

262
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,800
Your canteen’s food

263
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,920
doesn’t taste good.
Don’t you know it?

264
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,040
Miss Xia.

265
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,840
I can get in the car first.

266
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,840
Is Captain Xing all right?

267
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,960
He has been under stress recently.

268
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,880
Sorry.

269
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,800
You may need to come here again.

270
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:46,960
Never mind.

271
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,920
It’s my work.

272
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,160
You look nice today.

273
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,880
Not as nice as before.

274
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,360
I need to do more practice.

275
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,120
I think you’re good today.

276
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,520
Drop the act.

277
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:24,960
Captain Xing,

278
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,680
do you like a round?

279
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,560
I won’t play with him.

280
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,200
I got a heavy fall last time.

281
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,320
My back still hurts.

282
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,440
I won’t play against him.

283
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,640
Then why not practice
as you haven’t been good enough?

284
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,000
Go on.

285
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,240
-I’ll go.
-Okay.

286
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,480
Come on.

287
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,920
The fracture lies in a higher position.

288
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,160
The higher,
the more difficult it will be.

289
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,680
And he also has other
underlying diseases.

290
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,600
How is it?

291
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,680
Is everyone here?

292
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,960
Yanshan hasn’t arrived.

293
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,840
Mr. Shao.

294
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,040
Come here.

295
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,800
And he may develop complications
of the surgery,

296
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,470
so we decide to...

297
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,120
Xu Yanshan sent

298
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,520
a resignation letter to the President.

299
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,720
She just came
and packed up her things.

300
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,840
I know.

301
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,200
Anything else?

302
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,680
Mi Ka.

303
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:22,870
Any questions?

304
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,320
Let’s go.

305
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,400
Shouldn’t we wait for Yanshan?

306
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,680
No need. She’s resigned.

307
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,120
Why did she quit the job?

308
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,240
The hospital will arrange

309
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,240
the following shifts.

310
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,080
For the following days,

311
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,080
we may have more work to do.

312
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,720
It’s still in the morning.
Cheer yourselves up.

313
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,600
Check on the patients.

314
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,820
(Outpatient)

315
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,040
The rain is pouring down.
Let me give you a ride.

316
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,800
I don’t need your pity.

317
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,560
Why do I need to pity you?

318
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,360
You quit the job yourself.

319
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,800
Now everybody here thinks

320
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
that Mi Ka and Mr. Shao

321
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,590
have forced you to leave.

322
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,680
Who has been more pitiful?

323
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,280
Then you can go and tell everyone

324
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,320
what you know!

325
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,920
Mi Ka hasn’t spoken

326
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,840
one more word

327
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,040
on this matter.

328
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,680
Why should I boast it around?

329
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,240
Chen Tao,

330
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,480
you don’t have the right

331
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,240
to criticize me.

332
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,760
Yes.

333
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,960
I don’t have the right to criticize you.

334
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,280
I’m not a professor

335
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,320
that came back from abroad.

336
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,000
I’m just an ordinary doctor

337
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,080
who spent a whole night

338
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:47,820
waiting for you

339
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,760
but you wouldn’t give me a further look.

340
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,360
Xu Yanshan.

341
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,920
Yes,

342
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,640
I’m a vulgar man.

343
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,880
I like you.

344
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,880
I like you because you’re excellent

345
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,240
and beautiful.

346
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,520
But I don’t understand.

347
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,480
You’ve already been so good,

348
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,040
why do you have to

349
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,320
compete with Mi Ka?

350
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,400
Do you think it’s funny?

351
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,960
I don’t need you
to teach me what’s right.

352
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,640
Yuhan,

353
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,440
I hope you can temporarily

354
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,760
leave your job.

355
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,160
Because of the rumor?

356
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,360
No.

357
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,720
It’s true that there is a rumor

358
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,000
saying Xu Yanshan resigned

359
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,000
because you were
discriminatory against her.

360
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,840
I’ve known you for a long time.

361
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,080
Others may misunderstand you,

362
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,280
but I will not.

363
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,120
Thank you, President Zhang.

364
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,400
It’s because...

365
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,440
We have an international
neurosurgery

366
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,480
conference in Hainan

367
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,000
discussing the new trends.

368
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,720
You were abroad for a long time.

369
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,080
You know many foreign experts.

370
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,440
So I think

371
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,960
I can send you to there
on behalf of our hospital.

372
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,440
All right, no problem.

373
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,560
By the way, President Zhang,

374
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,200
we just talked about Xu Yanshan.

375
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,800
I hope the hospital

376
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,680
can be more

377
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,200
discreet about her resignation.

378
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,720
Although she has some problems,

379
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,600
she is gifted.

380
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,800
I don’t like to see our hospital

381
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,920
lose such a good candidate

382
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,880
because of some misunderstanding.

383
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,400
I’m thinking the same thing.

384
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,360
I’ll talk to her.

385
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,520
Thank you.

386
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,400
Go ahead with your work.

387
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:51,960
Okay.

388
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,400
I was just told that

389
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,560
I’ll go to Hainan for a conference.

390
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,240
I can’t join you

391
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,200
at this weekend’s party.

392
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,440
Okay, we can have it some other time.

393
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,040
Hello.

394
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,400
Ms. Xing, what’s up?

395
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,680
I changed my mind.

396
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,920
I’ll go to the conference in Hainan

397
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,000
this weekend myself.

398
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,590
Please book a ticket for me.

399
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,480
Isn’t that Xia?

400
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,280
What’s up?

401
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,920
The tire blew out.

402
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,640
Perhaps it has a puncture.

403
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,440
Li Nian.

404
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,040
I don’t know.

405
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,200
Place it properly.

406
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,240
How come?

407
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,600
I don’t know.

408
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,400
I was

409
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,000
driving and it...

410
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,280
Come on, let me help you.

411
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,200
One, two, three.

412
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,120
Yes.

413
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,240
Be careful!

414
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,200
Well.

415
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,280
I’ll go send the materials.

416
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,160
No, Li Nian.

417
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:49,790
Come back, Li Nian.

418
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,640
-Hmm...
-Don’t care about me.

419
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,640
Are you Okay?

420
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:55,880
You just...

421
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:56,800
I’m fine.

422
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,760
You’ve replaced it, right?

423
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,960
Yes.

424
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,480
It’s replaced.

425
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,880
Your face

426
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,200
got dirty.

427
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:13,960
Where?

428
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,000
Really?

429
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,800
Your hand got dirty, too.

430
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,480
Use this.

431
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:24,960
Thank you.

432
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,320
Will Li Nian

433
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,920
come back and pick you up?

434
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,040
He may come back to pick me up.

435
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,280
So...

436
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,240
I’m in a hurry. I need to go now.

437
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,360
Thank you for your help today.

438
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,480
You’re welcome.

439
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,800
I can help...

440
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,040
Be careful.

441
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,360
Be careful... while driving.

442
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,480
Hello.

443
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,200
Come back and pick me up.

444
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,600
No, she has left.

445
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,600
I didn’t lie. She’s gone.

446
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:35,240
Don’t play with me.

447
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,960
Hello? Hello? Hello?

448
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,680
Yes. Yes.

449
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,400
Thanks.

450
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,520
Thank you, sir.

451
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,880
As I said,

452
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,240
-be aware of
-Lightly.

453
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:06,920
the intracranial infection.

454
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,320
It’ll be a big trouble
if he has an infection.

455
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,240
I never thought that

456
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,440
we can share a business trip.

457
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,640
I don’t want to go with you.

458
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,400
It’s you that want to book

459
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,480
the same hotel with me.

460
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,440
Fine, it’s my impudence

461
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,720
to follow Mr. Shao here, all right?

462
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I’ve been so worried about you,

463
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,120
but you’re still so cold to me.

464
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,200
I beg you.

465
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,720
Don’t worry about me, okay?

466
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,960
Look what

467
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,800
you and Mi Ka

468
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,520
have done last time.

469
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,680
Don’t you know how you

470
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,600
have embarrassed Keyao?

471
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,400
We’re no longer important in your heart

472
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,600
compared with Keyao.

473
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,520
No, I was wrong.

474
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,080
She is always more important.

475
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,320
I’ll check in.

476
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,360
It’s crowded here

477
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,680
and a lot of food is served.

478
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,200
There are many cakes

479
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,480
which I like.

480
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,240
Look, who is that?

481
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,840
Why are you here?

482
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,520
It’s such a big exchange event.

483
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,200
I just come and see

484
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,800
if there is anything
we can collaborate on.

485
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,120
You didn’t mention it to me.

486
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,480
Didn’t you say you won’t come?

487
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,360
The plan can’t catch up
with the change

488
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,880
and the plan should be changeable.

489
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,160
Keyao, right?

490
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,920
Tracy.

491
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,000
Hi, Steven.

492
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,880
-Long time no see.

493
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,800
You know she is here.

494
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:31,920
No.

495
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,800
It’s not in my plan.

496
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,680
Yeah, my schedule has been crazy.

497
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,760
Do you have a minute?

498
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,880
I have so many plans

499
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,000
about our business.

500
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,320
You’re not going to refuse me again,
aren’t you?

501
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,240
Of course not.

502
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,640
-Listen to me,
-We had dinner together that night.

503
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,520
-perhaps we can have a drink
-Yes. Yes. Yes.

504
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,920
to discuss

505
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,520
products.

506
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,720
I think we’ve known

507
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,760
your products very well.

508
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,320
As for the details,

509
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,640
we’d better discuss them

510
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,440
in my office.

511
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,600
So, for the response plans,

512
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,920
-we can start
-Yes.

513
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:06,760
-to prepare for them earlier.

514
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:07,840
You’re quite right.

515
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,400
Stop looking at her.
You are wearing your eyes out.

516
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,120
I know you like

517
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,640
to work with the Shebaider College.

518
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,320
Actually I’m familiar

519
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,760
with their CEO of the head office.

520
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,320
I know one good cocktail bar

521
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,840
around the corner.

522
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,360
Wanna try?

523
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,440
Sorry.

524
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,400
I’m suffering from jet lag.

525
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,320
Tracy, come on.

526
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,800
Sorry.

527
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:35,920
Keyao,

528
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,920
have you finished?

529
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,680
Yes.

530
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,760
Excuse me, I have to go.

531
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,880
Thank you for your help.

532
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,280
I may not easily get rid of him

533
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,070
if you didn’t come.

534
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,000
Is that Steven

535
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:04,760
your client?

536
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,720
He was the head of

537
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,360
Shebaider Europe.

538
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,120
He knew I was considering

539
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,360
setting up a branch in China.

540
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,400
Actually, I also had some cooperation

541
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,280
with Shebaider College.

542
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,560
I can introduce them to you

543
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,680
if you need.

544
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,080
Actually,

545
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,720
I’m not that keen

546
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,800
on that project.

547
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,080
I thought you thought highly

548
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:30,840
of that project.

549
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,000
I’m on the 9th floor.

550
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,360
What about you?

551
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,680
The 12th.

552
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,560
I’ve arrived.

553
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,320
Good night.

554
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,480
Chen Tao,

555
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,720
-what happened?
-Mi Ka,

556
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,070
the patient had ear discharge

557
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:49,740
from the right ear one week ago.

558
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,960
The Otolaryngology Department
administered antibiotics

559
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:51,720
but it didn’t take effect.

560
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,880
She’s come for a further consultation

561
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,200
and just fainted in the bathroom.

562
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,520
Hello, Zhang Yajun,

563
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,280
tell me

564
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,640
where ails you?

565
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,760
My whole body is feeling unwell.

566
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,480
When I tilt my head like this,

567
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,840
my head aches.

568
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,680
Is there any other situation
where your head aches?

569
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,320
No.

570
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,000
Do you have a fever?

571
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,200
I just checked.
It’s 37 degrees Centigrade.

572
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,320
37 degrees Centigrade.

573
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,200
The right mastoid

574
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,040
has red spots and ulcers.

575
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,960
The external auditory canal

576
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,560
is blocked with purulent drainage.

577
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,960
The auricle is pushed forward.

578
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,240
Why do I feel like it’s encephalitis?

579
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,080
Last week,

580
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,680
the doctor said it was tympanitis.

581
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,680
It’s just my guess.

582
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,400
You need further examinations.

583
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,520
Last week,

584
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,440
you might haven’t gotten
the symptoms.

585
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,120
But now,

586
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,680
something may have changed.

587
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,880
So, you need to be hospitalized

588
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,120
for further examinations.

589
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,720
Wait till my daughter comes.

590
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,480
Wait for her daughter.

591
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:05,960
Mom,

592
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,680
are you okay?

593
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,280
Yanshan,

594
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,880
how can I be fine? I just fainted.

595
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,240
I’ve called you several times.

596
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,360
Aren’t you just working upstairs?

597
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,440
I didn’t notice them.

598
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,280
We thought she might

599
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:23,960
have encephalitis,

600
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
and she needs to be hospitalized
for further examinations.

601
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,720
Then I’ll handle the procedures.

602
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,800
Why didn’t you wear the white coat?

603
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,760
I...

604
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,720
You were on the night shift
yesterday, right?

605
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,080
Are you just off duty?

606
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:39,800
Yes.

607
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,920
Come on, Mother.

608
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,880
I’ll go handle the procedures.

609
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,800
Go have a sleep.

610
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,480
You’ve been working overtime
for one week.

611
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,800
I’m fine.

612
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,120
I’ll wait for the result.

613
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,320
Auntie,

614
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,360
according to the MRI

615
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,560
and CT scan,

616
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,600
you do have an abscess

617
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,760
in your epencephalon.

618
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,120
We suggest you have surgery
as soon as possible

619
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,000
to drain the abscess.

620
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,280
Then arrange the operation
as soon as possible.

621
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,400
How can I have an operation so soon?

622
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,320
Can my brain be opened casually?

623
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,360
Give me the report.

624
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,680
Her cousin

625
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,560
is a famous brain surgeon

626
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,360
in a foreign private hospital.

627
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,600
I’ll give this to him.

628
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,760
Mom,

629
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,600
I know what the report says.

630
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,080
You don’t have to give it to my cousin.

631
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,080
You know?

632
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,720
You’re an expert?

633
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,600
Shame on you.

634
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,040
Fine.

635
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,320
You can ask him to take a look at it

636
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,640
and have the surgery as soon as possible.

637
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,320
I can’t have the surgery here.

638
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,120
We’ve already gotten a doctor abroad.

639
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,560
Your cousin is abroad.

640
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,130
He is...

641
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:44,760
-He is a famous...
-Mom,

642
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,520
the domestic technologies

643
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,440
are already advanced now.

644
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,280
They don’t have such
a big population

645
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,960
and so many cases.

646
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,160
An ordinary case here

647
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,840
may be complex to them.

648
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,480
Our hospital can handle

649
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,600
this operation easily.

650
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,480
Who will be my surgeon?

651
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,680
You?

652
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,280
I’m afraid you haven’t

653
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,480
gotten the right to

654
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,560
hold the scalpel.

655
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,360
Auntie,

656
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,400
your physical conditions

657
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,320
may not allow you to travel by plane.

658
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,480
If you need

659
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,320
a group consultation,

660
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,320
we can arrange it for you.

661
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,120
I know.

662
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,280
I’ll show it to my nephew first.

663
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,620
(Shao Yuhan, Dong Lide)

(Doctors of
the Neurosurgery Department)

670
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,040
Are you off today?

671
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,680
Wanna have some fun?

672
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,560
Two glasses of Whisky.

673
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,720
Wenbo doesn’t know

674
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,520
I invite you to a drink, right?

675
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,480
Why can’t I tell him?

676
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,760
Because I need your help.

677
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,960
If he were here,
I might feel embarrassed.

678
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,960
What are you going to do?

679
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,480
Loving someone is tough.

680
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,520
Xia

681
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,120
finally agreed to go out with me.

682
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,360
But my Thailand hotel is just to open

683
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,280
and I have to stay
in Thailand for one month.

684
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,520
Look,

685
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,080
Xia and Mi Ka are good friends.

686
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,920
So, I hope

687
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,600
you can help me keep an eye

688
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,340
on what she’s been doing.

689
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,080
No.

690
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,280
You can’t just refuse me

691
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,120
so brutally.

692
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,040
Why should I intervene

693
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,040
in others’ love affairs?

694
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,000
Then why did you set

695
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,400
your sister and

696
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,680
that doctor up?

697
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:11,960
So I know

698
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,680
it will only be messier if I intervene.

699
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:28,840
What?

700
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,880
Something’s wrong with you.

701
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,760
No.

702
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,000
We’re friends.

703
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,800
Tell me if there is anything.

704
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,920
Why must I tell you

705
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,400
if there is anything?

706
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,320
Of course you should tell me.

707
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,000
It must be hard to keep it to yourself.

708
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,800
But you still need to
choose the right man.

709
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,360
Your friends will
always be the most reliable.

710
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,640
Forget about women.

711
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,440
Why?

712
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,320
A man should bear it himself.

713
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,040
What’s the use of telling women?

714
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,800
To make them sad,

715
00:32:59,080 --> 00:32:59,800
upset,

716
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,080
or nervous?

717
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,760
I’ll never let my woman

718
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,120
shed tears for me.

719
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,200
They only need to admire me.

720
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,440
Why didn’t I see you on duty

721
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,760
as I’ve moved in for two days?

722
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,160
The ER lacks hands.

723
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,560
I was transferred there to help them.

724
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,720
What a coincidence.

725
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,440
You were transferred out
when I moved in.

726
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,160
When will you go back?

727
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,760
It depends on the leaders.

728
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,680
I don’t know, either.

729
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,440
How long are you gonna lie to me?

730
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,720
Have you resigned?

731
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,280
Why did you resign?

732
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,520
It must be you can’t
meet their requirements

733
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,760
and you were afraid of being fired.

734
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,320
That’s why you resigned, right?

735
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,640
Do you insist that

736
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,320
I can’t meet their requirements?

737
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,520
Was I wrong?

738
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,520
Look,

739
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,160
your father

740
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,120
was a brain surgeon.

741
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,240
Your uncle

742
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,280
is a brain surgeon.

743
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,040
And your brother,

744
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,600
he’s a brain surgeon recognized
by another country.

745
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,360
But look at you,

746
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,000
why can’t you do it?

747
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,960
Look at what has become of you.

748
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,080
If I died,

749
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,400
how could I face your father

750
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,230
in heaven?

751
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,190
Yes.

752
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,360
You raised me up

753
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,520
because you want me

754
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,400
to be a good doctor like my father,

755
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,320
so you can be proud

756
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,360
before others.

757
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,040
Have you ever asked me

758
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,040
what kind of person

759
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,560
I like to be?

760
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,960
What do you like?

761
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,230
What do you want?

762
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,960
What else can you do?

763
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,440
How can I have

764
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:27,960
such a useless daughter!

765
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,360
Yes.

766
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,400
I’m useless.

767
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,880
Are you satisfied?

768
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,080
My classmates and I

769
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,120
were once

770
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,670
envious of Xu Yanshan.

771
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,880
She was born into a medical family.

772
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,240
Her father, grandfather, and uncle

773
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,880
are all brain surgeons.

774
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,640
But,

775
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,800
when I saw her
and her mother together,

776
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,160
I knew why she needed

777
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,280
others to recognize her.

778
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,080
Have you forgiven her?

779
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,880
I was angry when

780
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,080
I knew that

781
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,560
she had cheated on me.

782
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,160
I really regarded her

783
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,360
as my best friend.

784
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,520
But now,

785
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,960
I feel sorry for her.

786
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,680
Why was she so eager to win?

787
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,520
Perhaps she doesn’t want you
to be worried about her.

788
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,240
But families and friends

789
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,160
are to share your burden, right?

790
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,760
What do you think?

791
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,640
Mi Ka,

792
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,280
a man should bear it himself.

793
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,560
What’s the use of telling women?

794
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,280
To make them sad,

795
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,360
upset,

796
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,640
or nervous?

797
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,560
I’ll never let my woman

798
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,040
shed tears for me.

799
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,240
This is delicious.

800
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,520
Then buy this.

801
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,520
Let’s go.

802
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:26,340
(Outpatient)

803
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,080
Yanshan,

804
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,240
are you here to visit your mother?

805
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,120
Please give these to her.

806
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,800
Anyway, she is your mother.

807
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,760
You can’t refuse to see her
for the rest of your life.

808
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,400
It’s fine if you won’t help me.

809
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,680
I didn’t say that.

810
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,760
I am...

811
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,920
Sir.

812
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,840
Can you hear me?

813
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:03,880
Sir.

814
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:05,560
-Why did he fall suddenly?
-How is he?

815
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,680
No heartbeat,

816
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,600
nor breath.

817
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,960
I’ll do CPR.

818
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:09,840
Go fetch emergency doctors.

819
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:10,640
Okay.

820
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,560
Excuse me!

821
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,640
Make some room!

822
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,080
-Make way.
-Excuse me.

823
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,440
The bed is here.

824
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,040
Please help move him on.

825
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,080
Come on.

826
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,120
Watch the head.

827
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,720
Be careful.

828
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,040
Okay.

829
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,520
Go.

830
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,080
Excuse me.

831
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:42,960
-Make way.

832
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,160
Excuse me.

833
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,040
Make room for us.

834
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,400
Excuse me.

835
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,400
Excuse me, please make way.

836
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,600
Make way. Be careful.

837
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,320
-Make way.

838
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,480
How is he?

839
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,280
We saved him.

840
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,000
A heart attack.

841
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,720
Now he’s in the ICU.

842
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,560
Thank you, Doctor Xu.

843
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:24,960
Be careful.

844
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,040
Walk slowly.

845
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,040
Be careful with the catheter.

846
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,080
Yanshan,

847
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,200
you must be tired after the long CPR.

848
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,600
Here.

849
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,520
Have a candy to raise your blood sugar.

850
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,360
Thank you.

851
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,480
You can’t solve it

852
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,360
if you don’t face it.

853
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,120
I think

854
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,040
you should calmly talk

855
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,120
with your mother.

856
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,000
You can do it.

857
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,360
Hello, Auntie.

858
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,800
-I...

859
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,200
You speak first.

860
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,360
I’m hungry.

861
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,640
I’ll take you to eat something.

862
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,200
Is the food for doctors delicious?

863
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,600
Not bad.

864
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,400
Put it on.

865
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,080
The food for doctors

866
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,040
is not much better than
that for patients.

867
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,640
You can’t compare the food

868
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,320
with those in the restaurants.

869
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:01,960
Mom,

870
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,640
my cousin just called me.

871
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,360
He said you need

872
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,880
to have the surgery as soon as possible.

873
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,080
Just in China. Do you agree?

874
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,400
You’re the doctor.

875
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,800
I’ll listen to you.

876
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,800
Then I’ll arrange it for you.

877
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,080
I brought some fruits

878
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,240
to you,

879
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,920
but I lost them.

880
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,320
I’ll buy some

881
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,480
for you again later.

882
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,560
I saw them.

883
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,120
Before your father died,

884
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,080
he always said that a doctor

885
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,600
must not lose his conscience.

886
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,360
The first thing is to save people

887
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,920
and others are not that important.

888
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,680
When I saw you

889
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,960
try everything to save that man,

890
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,240
it reminded me of your father.

891
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,400
Mom.

892
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,360
For so many years,

893
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,640
I’ve ignored your feelings.

894
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,800
That’s why your life has been hard

895
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,000
and you’re unhappy.

896
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,520
I’m sorry.

897
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,000
Mom.

898
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,880
It’s my fault.

899
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,600
You’ve been good enough.

900
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,600
It’s me who has

901
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,040
restricted you a lot.

902
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,120
From now on,

903
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,600
I won’t make any decision for you.

904
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,960
If you don’t want to be a doctor,

905
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,720
you can do whatever you like.

906
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,760
Actually I want to

907
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,120
be a doctor.

908
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,640
Then no matter what
trouble you run into,

909
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,360
never give it up.

910
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:58,960
What are you looking at?

911
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,920
A video of intracranial abscess surgery.

912
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,120
Xu Yanshan’s mother

913
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:05,760
is having surgery tomorrow.

914
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,600
I will be Dr. Wang’s assistant.

915
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,840
Is she okay with that?

916
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,160
It’s the basic quality

917
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,880
of every doctor

918
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,080
to treat patients equally.

919
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,320
She should at least

920
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,360
have some faith in me.

921
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,320
Your hand...

922
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,120
How did you injure your hand again?

923
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,840
I cut myself during training.

924
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,040
It’s just a minor injury.

925
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,560
A minor injury again?

926
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,160
You call every injury a minor injury.

927
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,080
But it has never been a minor one.

928
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,640
Worry about me?

929
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,560
I worry about you.

930
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,120
You are the captain
of the Tiger Assault Team.

931
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,840
Your health

932
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,640
concerns everyone’s safety.

933
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,000
It’s not that serious.

934
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,520
It is that serious.

935
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,280
Think about it.

936
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,080
When I was holding a grenade in my hand,

937
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,600
you were the only person

938
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,760
I can trust.

939
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,920
I basically

940
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,240
entrusted my life to you.
