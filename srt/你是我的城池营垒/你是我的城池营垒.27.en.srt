=Episode 27=

20
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,480
What’s up?

21
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,520
We’ve discussed

22
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,360
and settled on a plan.

23
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,240
Mr. Shao said he will give you

24
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,040
the endonasal transsphenoidal surgery,

25
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,240
so, the recovery time

26
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,960
is shorter

27
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,400
and it only leaves a minor cut.

28
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,280
Perhaps you can still

29
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,560
participate in the competition.

30
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,600
It’s late and you just
asked me out for this?

31
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,240
Yes.

32
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,280
I know you care about it,

33
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,640
but you just pretend you don’t care.

34
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,240
Your tumor has grown big

35
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,520
and the location is not
favorable for surgery.

36
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,120
To be honest,

37
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,720
endonasal transsphenoidal surgery

38
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,240
has some risks,

39
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,840
but Mr. Shao said

40
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,480
he could minimize

41
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,640
the risk.

42
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,280
Craniotomy will be safer

43
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,600
but the minimally invasive

44
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,720
surgery has a shorter recovery time.

45
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,040
I’ll leave

46
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,640
the decision

47
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,800
to you.

48
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,160
Whatever your decision is,

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,280
I’m on your side.

50
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,440
No need of thinking.

51
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,320
I choose minimally invasive surgery.

52
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,400
You are in no hurry to make a decision.

53
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,880
You still have days to think about it.

54
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,720
I have faith in you.

55
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,880
Come in.

56
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,680
Sit.

57
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,720
I was just looking
at Xing Kelei’s report.

58
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,360
I’ve seen his

59
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,800
CT scan and MRI.

60
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,320
It seems the minimally

61
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,160
invasive surgery
is not easy to operate.

62
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,960
Are you afraid that I may fail?

63
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,480
No.

64
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,440
I understand.

65
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,350
It’s your brother

66
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,980
who will be lying

67
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,160
in the operation table.

68
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,280
If you have doubts

69
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,480
or worries,

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,920
that’s understandable.

71
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,400
I was worried about him,

72
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,920
but I’ve never questioned

73
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,080
your ability.

74
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,840
But I was just thinking

75
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,200
if this would put too much

76
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,440
pressure on you.

77
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,440
Sure I have some pressure,

78
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,160
because the surgery

79
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,400
won’t be that easy,

80
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,600
but you should know

81
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,390
that I won’t perform any surgeries

82
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,340
that I think I can’t succeed.

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,160
Life is always the first thing

84
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,120
with me.

85
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,760
But his condition

86
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,000
hasn’t been so critical

87
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,840
to force you to make the decision.

88
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,270
Look.

89
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,320
Whether to have the surgery or not

90
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,760
depends on the interests

91
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,280
of the patient,

92
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,280
that is, your brother, Xing Kelei,

93
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,400
not mine.

94
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:26,960
It’s important to him

95
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,240
to be a policeman.

96
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,000
If he wants to continue

97
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,480
his career,

98
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,200
then I have to give him the surgery,

99
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,520
so he can soon

100
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,800
fully recover himself.

101
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,080
This is my duty.

102
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,000
Thank you.

103
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,000
I’ll try my best whatever.

104
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,200
Please rest assured.

105
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,000
You said you have packed all things.

106
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,120
What did you pack?

107
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,800
You even forgot the brush
and the toothpaste.

108
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,610
Come on.

109
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:55,800
I still need them tonight.

110
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,960
You’re right.

111
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,200
This is the lotus root powder I bought.

112
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,440
You need fluids after the surgery.

113
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,040
Make some of it, all right?

114
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,520
What’re you doing?

115
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,440
Can you rest for a while?

116
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,760
Don’t busy yourself with them.

117
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,280
I am packing things.

118
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,120
You act as if

119
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,760
I was a pupil who had a spring outing.

120
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,040
Pocket money.

121
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,960
I’ll give you two yuan.

122
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,080
Anything else?

123
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,640
Are you nervous?

124
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,200
Why?

125
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,880
Do you lack the confidence
in Mr. Shao?

126
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,720
I’m very confident in him,

127
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,000
but it’s you who will lie there.

128
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,680
-Mi Ka is here.
-Keyao,

129
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,560
I am helping him pack things.

130
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,560
Do you need my help?

131
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,560
No.

132
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,520
Take the food with him.

133
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,680
Okay.

134
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,840
Well, you two.

135
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,120
Can you leave me in peace?

136
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,800
I won’t bother myself to care for you.

137
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,480
I need to watch over you.

138
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:11,760
Keyao,

139
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,120
will you accompany him
to the hospital tomorrow?

140
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,170
Didn’t he say

141
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:14,800
it is just an examination,

142
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:15,800
not a big deal?

143
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,080
I’m sure he will listen to you.

144
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,280
I have a meeting tomorrow.

145
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,720
I’ll go the day after tomorrow
when he has the surgery.

146
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:22,880
Just pack your things.

147
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,160
I have a call.

148
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,100
Why not eat this

149
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,160
tonight?

150
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,560
Fine.

151
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,700
(White Sugar)

152
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,240
What’s up?

153
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,040
Nothing.

154
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,560
Done.

155
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,880
Do you deliberately add

156
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,440
so much sugar?

157
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,520
I just mistook it

158
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,760
as salt.

159
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,000
Perhaps it’s because

160
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,680
I look sweet.

161
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,680
Captain Xing makes

162
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,200
mistakes, too.

163
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,640
Why can’t I make a mistake?

164
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,640
I even have a problem with my brain.

165
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,320
Will there be a day

166
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,880
that I even can’t recognize you?

167
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,400
No, I was joking.

168
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,000
I didn’t mean that.

169
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,080
Think about it,

170
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,880
who will give me surgery?

171
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,960
Mr. Shao.

172
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,120
Mr. Shao

173
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,800
is my sister’s ex-boyfriend.

174
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,200
He’s just like a family to me.

175
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,480
Will he be negligent
with my surgery?

176
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,160
Don’t cry.

177
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,280
No worries. I’ll be fine.

178
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,320
I’ve always
been worrying about you.

179
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,600
I know Mr. Shao

180
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,120
has performed many surgeries

181
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,960
under more critical
conditions than this,

182
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,150
but as long as I think

183
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,720
that it’s you who will be
lying on the operation table,

184
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,080
I’ll be fearful.

185
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,320
No matter how good you’ve been,

186
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,680
and even if you’re a sharpshooter

187
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,760
or you won number one,

188
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,760
I’ll still be nervous

189
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,560
when you’re sent on an errand.

190
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,320
I can’t control myself.

191
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,880
That day, Li Nian and others

192
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,880
sent me some fruits.

193
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,760
I was scared to death.

194
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,040
I don’t like the feeling
of worrying about you.

195
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,480
I hope I can

196
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,680
support every decision you made,

197
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,080
but I...

198
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,920
but

199
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,640
I’m really scared.

200
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,160
I can’t help worrying about you.

201
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,200
I feel happy to hear

202
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,120
that you’re worried about me,

203
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,800
but,

204
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,000
I want to give you a lesson.

205
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,960
As a doctor,

206
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,120
you should stay calm.

207
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,040
Look, what if one day

208
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,080
you’re my surgeon?

209
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,200
Will you continue with it?

210
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,440
I won’t let you have
any other surgeries.

211
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,320
Okay, I won’t have another surgery.

212
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,960
But,

213
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,280
I haven’t had
my wisdom teeth pulled out.

214
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,680
You should let me
have them pulled out.

215
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,560
Just a minor surgery, okay?

216
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,920
Don’t cry.

217
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,760
Eat something.

218
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,320
I don’t have the appetite.

219
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,360
You don’t have the appetite?

220
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,880
But you get my clothes wet.

221
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,440
You can eat some. Not all is sweet.

222
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,760
The salted vegetable is not sweet.

223
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,960
Let me feed you.

224
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,400
Open my mouth.

225
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,080
No, open your mouth.

226
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:41,840
Let me feed you.

227
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,920
Quick.

228
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,640

Don’t cry.

379

I think I’d better not let them know.

380
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,310
They’re abroad.
They can’t help with anything.

381
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,440
It will make them nervous

382
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,760
if I tell them.

383
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,760
I can tell them

384
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:14,590
after the surgery.

385
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:18,400
You haven’t changed

386
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,640
for so many years.

387
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,240
You’re afraid of others being worried,

388
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,440
so, you bear

389
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,920
all burdens.

390
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,560
Well.

391
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,590
You,

392
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,080
go back and have a good rest.

393
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,600
Leave the rest

394
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,320
to me.

395
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,560
All right?

396
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,600
Okay.

397
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,880
Looking at stars,

398
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,880
are you thinking about other girls,

399
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,760
or thinking

400
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,920
you may be nervous tomorrow?

401
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,320
I’m wondering

402
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,320
why all these beautiful girls

403
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,640
have gotten married.

404
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,320
You don’t worry about anything.

405
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,840
And I’m not nervous.

406
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,560
I see it.

407
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,320
You didn’t pretend it.

408
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,600
You’re still thinking about beauties.

409
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,240
Are you really not nervous?

410
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,200
Not at all. You can touch me
if you don’t believe me.

411
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,640
Here.

412
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,080
What do you feel?

413
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,080
I can only feel your chest muscles,

414
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,640
but I can’t tell your heart rate.

415
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,160
Can you feel that my heart
is in absolute peace?

416
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,480
It sounds

417
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,160
you’re in a good
mental state before surgery.

418
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:58,840
You’re right.

419
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,520
There is always gain and lose in life.

420
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,280
And I’ve already gained

421
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,280
too much.

422
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,680
I suggest you not stay
in the operation room

423
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,960
when I have surgery tomorrow.

424
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,720
Why?

425
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:18,840
I think that might not be

426
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,040
pleasant to look at.

427
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,400
What if I make a hairstyle

428
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,720
and dress me up before then?

429
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,160
Why have you been so narcissistic?

430
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,440
Okay, I promise you.

431
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,000
I hope you can promise me
one more thing.

432
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,640
I hope when I wake up

433
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,720
and open my eyes,

434
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,000
the first one I see is you.

435
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,400
Okay.

436
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,720
Xing Kelei,

437
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,240
today we’ll perform the minimally

438
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,320
invasive surgery to drain your tumor.

439
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,320
Are you clear with it?

440
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,840
Yes.

441
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,840
Now, we’ll let the anesthetist

442
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,480
administer anesthetics to you.

443
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,760
Try to relax as much as possible.

444
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,840
Thank you.

445
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:31,340
(Family Waiting Area)

446
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,980
(Xing Kelei, under surgery)

447
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,120
Don’t worry. Just a minor surgery.

448
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,400
I know.

449
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,920
The pituitary adenoma.

450
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,000
Yes.

451
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,200
Mr. Zhang, what happened?

452
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,320
Don’t get nervous.

453
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,480
We’ve just administered anesthetics.

454
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,520
There is a patient in the ER.

455
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,390
I need to see him.

456
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,400
Okay.

457
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,160
Don’t worry.

458
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,720
Just administered anesthetics.

459
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,320
Anesthetics.

460
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,280
One, two, three, four.

461
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,080
Strict training, fight for the country.

462
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,720
One, two, three, four.

463
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,000
One, two,

464
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,160
three, four.

465
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:53,830
What time is it?

466
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,680
One, two, three, four.

467
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,760
3:00 PM.

468
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,680
They started the operation,
didn’t they?

469
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,200
It should be.

470
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,920
No news coming out.

471
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,200
They just pushed him in.

472
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,480
What news can we get?

473
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,600
Captain Shu,

474
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,280
don’t be too anxious.

475
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,720
He should be fine.

476
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,560
Although Captain Xing
is having an operation,

477
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,520
we can’t be slack with the training.

478
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,840
Everyone,

479
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,240
meet in the shooting range.

480
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,320
Captain Shu,

481
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,920
the shooting range is in this direction.

482
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,800
One, two, three, four.

483
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,940
(Xing Kelei, under surgery)

484
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,080
I’m fine.

485
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,640
I’ll go.

486
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,000
You also bring coffee.

487
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,640
I’ve given her a cup.

488
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,360
She’s fine. We can go.

489
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:02,880
She’s fine?

490
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,880
No worries.

491
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,920
Let’s go.

492
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,880
No worries.

493
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,720
Director He.

494
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,760
I’m going to

495
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,080
the day surgery ward.

496
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,560
I just pass here.

497
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,800
Give me a message

498
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,200
when the surgery finishes.

499
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,680
Thank you, Director He.

500
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,800
Don’t worry.

501
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:50,300
(Xing Kelei, under surgery)

502
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,560
Why hasn’t it finished?

503
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:10,840
The surgery

504
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,800
generally takes two hours.

505
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,880
It’s two and a half hours now.

506
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,720
It should soon be finished.

507
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,880
Each surgery

508
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,920
has to deal with different conditions

509
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,640
and the time may vary.

510
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,040
Yes.

511
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,480
His tumor lies in a bad location

512
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,000
and it has been large.

513
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,680
The surgery needs to

514
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,240
do a thorough cleaning.

515
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,840
It does take a lot of time

516
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,000
and may be longer.

517
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:03,960
Why is there no news coming out

518
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,480
after such a long time?

519
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,560
Perhaps he’s come out.

520
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,360
Mi Ka must be busy.

521
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:10,970
She doesn’t have time

522
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,280
to text us.

523
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,400
Why didn’t Captain Xing allow us

524
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,760
to send people to wait there?

525
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,280
Now

526
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,520
I can’t be more

527
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,000
anxious.

528
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,000
It’s true.

529
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,520
I didn’t sleep well last night.

530
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,640
What about I ask them on WeChat?

531
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,040
I think it’s fine.

532
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,800
We’d better not.

533
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,640
If he’s come out,

534
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,520
Mi Ka is busy around.

535
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,640
If he hasn’t come out,

536
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,440
your message will only

537
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,040
disturb them.

538
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,520
I agree.

539
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,360
Then forget it.

540
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,240
I don’t have the appetite.
I’ll give it all to you.

541
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,680
Don’t give me.

542
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,920
Can’t there be any accidents?

543
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,280
It has been four hours.

544
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,390
(Under surgery)

545
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,240
No.

546
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,840
I’ll change my clothes and go see him.

547
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:19,680
(Surgery finished)

548
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,160
It’s finished. Quick.

549
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:21,910
Quick.

550
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,880
We go to the ICU.

551
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,800
Where?

552
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,880
Go.

553
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:49,560
Xing Kelei.

554
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,240
Can you hear me?

555
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,400
Xing Kelei, please answer me.

556
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,640
Is there anything that ails you?

557
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,320
Can you see me clearly?

558
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,680
It’s over. You’ll be fine.

559
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:44,180
(ICU)

560
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,240
How is he?

561
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,480
He’s good.

562
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,600
Just being weak.

563
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,360
Mr. Shao.

564
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,680
I told you

565
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,400
just trust me.

566
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,880
Thank you.

567
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,560
But generally such surgery

568
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,200
only takes over two hours.

569
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,000
Why has it been four hours

570
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,000
in my brother’s surgery?

571
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,720
His tumor was in a bad location

572
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,080
and he had a CSF leak.

573
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,160
It took some time to suture it,

574
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,040
and he has several hemorrhages

575
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,840
which we also need

576
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,540
to treat carefully,

577
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,920
so, it’s been longer than others.

578
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,600
Keyao, go back and have a rest.

579
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,800
I’m on the night shift.

580
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,040
I can keep him company.

581
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,680
I can’t go to sleep even if I go back.

582
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,280
I’ll be here.

583
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:24,760
Don’t stay here.

584
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,400
Go to my office.

585
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,360

586
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,680
it’s convenient for you to come here.

00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,800
Okay.

You haven’t eaten anything for the day.

589
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,520
I’ll buy you some food.

590
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,840
No need. I’m not hungry.

591
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,000
What’re you saying?

592
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,800
Xing Kelei still needs you
to look after him.

593
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,520
Sit here and wait for me.

would perform surgeries
for their families

00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,120
your assignment for the following days.

763
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,840
Wenjing and I will cook.

764
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:03,800
I’ve told

765
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,480
the workers in the canteen

766
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,240
that they will buy ingredients
in my recipe.

767
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,160
We should work shifts

768
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,840
to make nutrient meals for Captain Xing.

769
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,760
Okay.

770
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,640
What will Luo Ting and I do?

771
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,400
You take turns to

772
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,200
take the nutrient meals to the hospital.

773
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,120
And ask them

774
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,160
what else they need.

775
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,360
Keep a note of what we should
buy and send to them.

776
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,440
Dr. Mi and Keyao are busy.

777
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,600
Don’t affect their work.

778
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,320
Yes.

779
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,640
Okay, work on your task.

780
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,160
Yes.

781
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,480
Is a half pot of water enough?

782
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,240
Good.

783
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,400
Green onion.

784
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,720
Chop green onions, right?

785
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,560
Excellent!

786
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,960
Xia,

787
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,040
can you be more serious with it?

788
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,120
Unbelievable.

789
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,400
I’ve already been serious.

790
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,640
I teach you how to cook

791
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,400
while playing the Anipop.

792
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,320
Hello.

793
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,120
Keyao.

794
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,880
Okay, I’ll be there right now.

795
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,040
Xing Kelei has a fever.

796
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,760
I must go right now.

797
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,080
Please look after it here.

798
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,240
Me?

799
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,320
I can’t do it myself.

800
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,480
I’ll find someone

801
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,820
to help you.

802
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,360
-Take it.
-No, I...

803
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,760
Mi Ka asked you here

804
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,120
to help me cook soup?

805
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,480
She only asked me to cook soup.

806
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,560
She didn’t say whom I was to help.

807
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,440
Come in.

808
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,720
I need your help badly.

809
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,480
I’ve tried

810
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:05,840
my best.

811
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,480
I’ll leave the rest to you.

812
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:13,880
First of all,

813
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,680
you need enough...

814
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,240
First, you need enough water

815
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,040
and pour it into the pot.

816
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,840
After that,

817
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,720
just put the chicken pieces in it.

818
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,280
And then,

819
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,960
two slices of ginger.

820
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,560
Then, shift to the fierce-fire

821
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,520
to cook it for 30 minutes.

822
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,600
And, shift to the slow-fire

823
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,520
for 30 minutes.

824
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:45,800
Then,

825
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,480
add mushroom and milkvetch root

826
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,920
to stew for another 30 minutes.

827
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,000
Captain Xing

828
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,080
taught me these.

829
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,040
It’s troublesome.

830
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,960
We can buy soup if we want.

831
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,560
No.

832
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:58,920
They may use bad ingredients

833
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,160
and add a lot of aginomoto to it.

834
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,440
Where is

835
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,440
the cooking wine?

836
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,280
Cooking...

837
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,000
It seems I’ve put it in that cabinet.

838
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,080
I remember...

839
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:07,880
It’s there.

840
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,960
That one?

841
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,640
-You got it?
-You...

842
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,960
Yes.

843
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:28,880
-You can go out.
-Okay.

844
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,080
I’ll clean up the kitchen.

845
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,240
It smells good.

846
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,760
Add some salt.

847
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:04,600
That’s enough.

848
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,280
He can’t eat too much salt.

849
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,240
It should be lighter.

850
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,600
How is it?

851
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,400
It looks good, isn’t it?

852
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,400
How is it?

853
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:19,880
It’s the right flavor.

854
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,480
Let me taste.

855
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,440
Wait.

856
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,440
Be careful. It’s hot.

857
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,280
How is it?

858
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,480
Hot but delicious.

859
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:38,760
Not bad.

860
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,720
It’s the right flavor,

861
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,480
isn’t it?

862
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,200
Not bad.

863
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,040
You’re good at cooking.

864
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,760
Pack it up

865
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,840
and send it to Xing Kelei.

866
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,760
Yes.

867
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,360
He has a fever.

868
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,360
Mi Ka is waiting there.

869
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,400
Yes. You’re right.
