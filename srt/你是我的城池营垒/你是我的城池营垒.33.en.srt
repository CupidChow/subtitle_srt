=You Are My Hero=

19
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,940
=Episode 33=

20
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,520
Excuse me.

21
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,880
Why are you running?

22
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,320
The meeting took so long.

23
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,480
I still haven’t finished my case report.

24
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,440
Captain Xing came today.

25
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,120
Was he here to visit Bed 15?

26
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,320
No, he didn’t see her.

27
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,040
Bed 15

28
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,400
went downstairs for the examination.

29
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,560
He left a few words.

30
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,520
Listen carefully.

31
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,360
The thing has been settled.

32
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,000
Please keep your mind on your work.

33
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,640
Thank you for your hard work, Dr. Mi.

34
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,360
Finished?

35
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,000
Isn’t it enough?

36
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,560
It took me a long time to remember it.

37
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,800
OK. Thank you.

38
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,680
What was settled?

39
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,440
I have no idea.

40
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,600
Anyway, there is a strange thing.

41
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,520
After he came here,

42
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,680
there are no gossips any longer.

43
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,960
Two nursing workers

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,320
just discussed that

45
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,760
Dr. Mi

46
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,000
is very kind,

47
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,880
trying her best to take care

48
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,440
of her boyfriend’s relative.

49
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,760
They now knew that

50
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,800
Bed 15

51
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,160
is not his ex-girlfriend.

52
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,760
Did Xing Kelei do that?

53
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,960
I don’t know.

54
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,680
After he came here,

55
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,400
things have become like that.

56
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,480
One more thing,

57
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,520
Bed 15’s operation

58
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,880
was arranged on Wednesday.

59
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,320
Thank you, Xiaoxiao.

60
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,200
Xia, there is a parcel for you.

61
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,600
OK. Thank you.

62
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,040
I’ll use the scissor.

63
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:02,720
OK.

64
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,800
Chinchilla.

65
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,280
Hope you can like it.

66
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,720
My dearest Xia.

67
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,880
I’ve always been with you.

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Xia, Xia, Xia, Xia.

69
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,200
Xia.

70
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,920
What’s wrong?

71
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,560
I…

72
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,080
The crazy follower on Weibo

73
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:38,640
sent it to me.

74
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,920
Too disgusting.

75
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,920
Is the man still harassing you?

76
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,480
You know what?

77
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,360
He kept visiting my account
with different IDs.

78
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,200
Once I blacklisted it,

79
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,600
he changed a different one.

80
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,200
I can’t find a way to deal with it.

81
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,560
Xia, after getting off work,

82
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,800
go back home early

83
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,040
before it gets dark.

84
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,440
You may also stop updating your blog.

85
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,960
How can I be controlled

86
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,920
by a freak?

87
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,400
I will let him know

88
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,480
that I don’t care about him.

89
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,440
I will keep

90
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,680
living my own normal life.

91
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,820
(Parcel Signed)

92
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,120
(Hope you can like it.)

93
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,180
(It’s a gift
I carefully picked for you.)

94
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,800
What a freak!

95
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,960
That man sent

96
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,280
a parcel to my home.

97
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,080
Oh my gosh!

98
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,560
What a haunting guy!

99
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,440
I swear

100
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,720
I won’t like chinchilla anymore.

101
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,160
It’s disgusting.

102
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,320
What are you doing?

103
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,200
Put me down.

104
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,920
You are taking exercise?

105
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,360
You scared me!

106
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,200
I thought you aren’t in.

107
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,680
Look upward.

108
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,440
Look at my face.

109
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,880
The…

110
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,920
The operation has been arranged.

111
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,760
Mr. Shao will do it.

112
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,800
Don’t worry.

113
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,080
Once she gets better,

114
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,080
we two will be free.

115
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,240
Why are you blushing?

116
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,240
Are you so shy to see me?

117
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,800
Do you have a guilty conscience?

118
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,960
Keep hanging there.

119
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,560
Her situation is not that complicated.

120
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,160
Both the preparative examination

121
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,320
and conversation have been finished.

122
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,800
And her family is cooperative.

123
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,480
Be watchful

124
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,880
about the mental state of Bed 15.

125
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,440
Ask her to ease her mind

126
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,720
and take a good rest.

127
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,920
OK.

128
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,040
Bed 15, it’s time for the operation.

129
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,000
We have to take your temperature.

130
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,120
Jianing. Jianing. Jianing.

131
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,160
Jianing. Please be cooperative.

132
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,560
Let’s take your temperature, OK?

133
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,600
I’m Mi Ka.

134
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,480
What’s wrong?

135
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,920
She doesn’t let us take the temperature.

136
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,000
Jianing. Jianing.

137
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,240
Lei.

138
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,720
Lei. You’re finally here.

139
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,550
What’s wrong?

140
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,200
Jianan.

141
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,200
Jianan disappeared.

142
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,120
Let me talk to her.

143
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,480
Where is Jianan?

144
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,120
I don’t know.

145
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,040
She was fine at noon.

146
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,560
She said Dr. Zhang asked her to

147
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,120
have the preparative conversation
in the afternoon.

148
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,600
She was fine when she came back.

149
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,200
She even signed the operation permit.

150
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,440
But…

151
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,560
If Jianan doesn’t come back,

152
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,800
what should I do by myself?

153
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,800
She might have gone out for fun.

154
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,880
She is just 20.

155
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,480
It’s normal to be playful.

156
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,040
She won’t run away.

157
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:30,920
What’s more,

158
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,720
your operation

159
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,960
is the most important thing.

160
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,240
Take the operation first.

161
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,160
What should I do

162
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,680
if she doesn’t come back

163
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,280
after the operation?

164
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,360
You still have Mi Ka and I.

165
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,320
Don’t worry. Jianan will be fine.

166
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,480
Lei. You’re the boss.

167
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,200
Then take the examination first.

168
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,800
Sorry for bringing you trouble.

169
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,360
Never mind.

170
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,080
That’s my job.

171
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,000
I will get a nursing assistant for her.

172
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,640
Today I will have to take care of her.

173
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,240
The first night

174
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,800
after the operation is most tiring.

175
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,120
I will be with you.

176
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,360
Where on earth

177
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,200
is Jianan?

178
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,920
It may because

179
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,280
she is under too much pressure.

180
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,160
I will send a WeChat message
to her later

181
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,680
to check if she’ll reply.

182
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,120
If Captain Shen could see this,

183
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,080
he’ll feel thankful.

184
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,080
Don’t get yourself

185
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,760
overburdened.

186
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,920
I’m with you no matter what happens.

187
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,280
The temperature is fine.

188
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,440
Have a good rest.

189
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,480
Jianing.

190
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,160
Did you check in?

191
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,760
Don't be cheap

192
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,000
and get an unsafe inn.

193
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,560
Take it easy. I’m alright.

194
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,000
How do you feel?

195
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,520
Great.

196
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,400
It’s just that Xing Kelei

197
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,000
kept talking about Mi Ka.

198
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,000
What will you do?

199
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,720
Let’s see after the operation.

200
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,320
Jianing, after the operation

201
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,360
when you can use the phone,

202
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,240
contact me immediately.

203
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,680
If Xing Kelei sends you a message,

204
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,840
tell him you are leaving

205
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,920
for great pressure.

206
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,200
Ask him to take care of me.

207
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,640
Remember to mention our father.

208
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,680
OK. Got it.

209
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,520
Ask him about the operation result.

210
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,640
Don’t be afraid of contacting him.

211
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,480
He’s a special policeman.

212
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,720
Will he check out

213
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,640
my place?

214
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,280
That’s only in the plays.

215
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,160
Well. I have to hang up.

216
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,640
Jianing.

217
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,320
Don’t be nervous during the operation.

218
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,320
What else can we do?

219
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,520
Let’s just wait and see.

220
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,920
Coffee, please.

221
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,320
OK. One minute please.

222
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,780
(Shen Jianan: How’s Jianing?
Is the operation finished?)

223
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,360
Jianing is having an operation.
Where are you?

224
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,400
If she can be out,

225
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,280
please tell me

226
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,160
if she’s fine.

227
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,120
Why did you leave?

228
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,280
Kelei, I can’t stand it.

229
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,520
If Jianing

230
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,040
really can’t stand up,

231
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,560
I don’t know what to do.

232
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,080
If my father is alive,

233
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,560
we won’t be so helpless

234
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,600
like now.

235
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,840
Nobody in the family

236
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,440
can make a decision.

237
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,960
Kelei.

238
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,960
For my father’s sake

239
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
of taking care of you,

240
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,520
please take care of Jianing.

241
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,400
She’s really weak.

242
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,080
She even didn’t

243
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,280
want to live.

244
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,280
So please take good care of her.

245
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,640
You are the only one

246
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,280
she can rely on now.

247
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,280
How is she?

248
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,920
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

249
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,440
The operation is quite successful.

250
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,440
The part needs to be treated

251
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,040
has been treated well.

252
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,920
The cut is not big.

253
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,280
If there is no problem,

254
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,320
she can be carried to the ward.

255
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,520
Then it depends on

256
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,960
her recovery.

257
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,040
One more thing.

258
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,040
She hasn’t exercised

259
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,880
her legs for a long time.

260
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,760
So she doesn’t have

261
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,680
enough muscle strength.

262
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,920
In this way,

263
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,320
you need to push her

264
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,640
to take more exercises.

265
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,400
I see.

266
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,200
Psychological reconstruction
is important too.

267
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,400
Psychological reconstruction?

268
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,560
Yes. Psychological reconstruction.

269
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,080
The patient should admit there are

270
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,840
enough possibilities for her to recover

271
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:14,640
and believe that she

272
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,800
can be back on her feet.

273
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,000
I see.

274
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,280
OK.

275
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,480
Thank you.

276
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,520
It’s alright.

277
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,440
Jianan ran away and asked me
to take care of her.

278
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,600
She’s afraid she can’t get up.

279
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,200
What’s your plan?

280
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,400
I have to go back to the team on Friday.

281
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,360
But we can’t leave her alone.

282
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,160
Do as what you said.

283
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,120
Am I entrapping you again?

284
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,160
It’s not the first time

285
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,440
for you to do that.

286
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,720
It’s OK.

287
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,360
Don’t be garrulous.

288
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,960
Then…

289
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,440
I will take care of her tomorrow.

290
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,800
But there is one thing.

291
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,600
You know

292
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,760
she used to like me before.

293
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,120
Maybe she will

294
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,200
stick with me.

295
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,280
Don’t worry. I will…

296
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,080
Excuse me.

297
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,600
OK.

298
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,760
I will be with you.

299
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,120
I will take a campstool

300
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,440
and be with you.

301
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,320
OK?

302
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,760
Did she really like you?

303
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,480
Yes. She did.

304
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,600
Many people did.

305
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,520
It’s normal.

306
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,360
Make way, please.

307
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,960
I got you the food.

308
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,160
Get up.

309
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,680
Don’t touch me.

310
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,000
Eat something.

311
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,160
No.

312
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,280
-A little.
-No.

313
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,720
Go!

314
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,070
Thank you.

315
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,240
You’re welcome.

316
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,760
Jianing. Let’s take the temperature.

317
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,720
Jianing.

318
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,680
Jianing, take the temperature.

319
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,560
Go away.

320
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,640
37 degrees. It’s normal.

321
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,840
Take more rest.

322
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,000
Thank you.

323
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:54,960
Lei.

324
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,960
Please stay, OK?

325
00:17:59,160 --> 00:17:59,880
I can’t.

326
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,360
You know how important the combat is.

327
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,920
I know.

328
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,520
But…

329
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,480
If you don’t care about me,

330
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,400
my life will be meaningless.

331
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,160
Don’t speak like that.

332
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,360
How about this?

333
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,160
You go to bed now.

334
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,280
I will leave after you fall asleep.

335
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,560
Where are you going later?

336
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,160
Later, I will have a

337
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,000
mobilization meeting.

338
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,720
I will go home later then.

339
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,960
I haven’t been so tired for long.

340
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:08,840
How about

341
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,680
going to the rest room for a break?

342
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,040
I just want to

343
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,520
lean on you.

344
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,760
You are so nice.

345
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,120
I also think so.

346
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,800
You are nice, too.

347
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,000
I know.

348
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,760
What are you doing?

349
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,120
Leave a way for the singles.

350
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,760
-Showing our love.

351
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,760
It’s so hard to practice this.

352
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:09,680
Xia.

353
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,760
What are you doing?

354
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,680
I’m checking if

355
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,760
the freak is following me

356
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,840
here.

357
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,680
It’s great if he moves here

358
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,160
for the sake of me.

359
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,680
Then Xing Kelei can catch him,

360
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,400
beat him,

361
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,040
and send him to the police station.

362
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,520
He’s still harassing you?

363
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,680
Why don’t you call the police?

364
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,960
How could I call the police?

365
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,320
He hasn’t met me face to face.

366
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,600
Then you can move

367
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,960
to our house.

368
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:36,960
Forget it.

369
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,080
You are even

370
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,440
in the most urgent situation.

371
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,800
Look.

372
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,520
You even have dark circles

373
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,320
because of a sick weak woman.

374
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,440
It’s serious.

375
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,240
I don’t think you have time for me.

376
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,120
Your words

377
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,560
don’t comfort me.

378
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,240
But it’s true that the elder sister

379
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,520
isn’t that simple.

380
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,600
Of course she isn’t simple.

381
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,960
Seriously,

382
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,520
how about letting me

383
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,440
meet the Shen...?

384
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,640
Shen Jianing.

385
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,640
I will make her expose immediately.

386
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,640
Please don’t cause any trouble.

387
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,480
I’m begging you.

388
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,720
Anyway,

389
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,200
she can’t hide for long.

390
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,240
Why?

391
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,680
Xing Kelei is living

392
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,320
at the team.

393
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,760
A one-woman show

394
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,720
won’t last long.

395
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,720
Let me ask,

396
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,280
she has been looking for trouble,

397
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,880
but at last,

398
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,000
she ate meals,

399
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,920
took medicines,

400
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,480
had the examinations,

401
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,440
did all the thing that needs to be done

402
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,520
and nothing has been missing, right?

403
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,480
That’s it.

404
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,160
She doesn’t really want to die.

405
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,200
She cherishes her life.

406
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,360
She still wants to stand up

407
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,520
and fight for Kelei against you.

408
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,600
She has a great desire

409
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,480
for survival, you know?

410
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,960
Oh my gosh!

411
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,600
According to what you said...

412
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,120
It seems the two girls

413
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,480
are here for

414
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,720
blackmail.

415
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,640
Am I right?

416
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,080
Kind of.

417
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,080
But in my opinion,

418
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,440
I’m a doctor,

419
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,720
I should

420
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,440
take good care of her

421
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,880
when Xing Kelei is not there.

422
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:22,760
Right?

423
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,320
That’s my duty.

424
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Are you a saint?

425
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,360
I’m not a saint.

426
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,680
I’m not that noble.

427
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,400
I don’t want to make myself that tired.

428
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,240
That’s because of the combat.

429
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,120
Xing Kelei

430
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,440
can’t come

431
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,360
at the critical moment,

432
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,080
so I have to take his place.

433
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,720
That’s what a couple should do

434
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,880
for each other.

435
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,000
You are really different now.

436
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:46,920
You are

437
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,600
shining

438
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,120
with holy light.

439
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,520
Really?

440
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,800
Then enlighten me.

441
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,440
Please let me

442
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,960
grow up as quickly as you.

443
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:55,840
Come on.

444
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,520
Can you make the soup for me now?

445
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,960
He’s coming back soon.

446
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,280
I just praised you.

447
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,760
You can’t be praised more.

448
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,440
Love you.

449
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,680
Captain Xing.

450
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,120
Zhuang Zhiwen’s team has put

451
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,480
great efforts in training recently.

452
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,400
They started closed training last week.

453
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,920
Don’t worry.

454
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,120
I won’t be softhearted to you, too.

455
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,080
That’ll be fine then.

456
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,840
Captain Hao didn’t ask us
to ensure a winner,

457
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,720
but we need to ensure it ourselves.

458
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,640
-And I…
-I’d take a nap.

459
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,200
Then stew it

460
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,640
with a gentle simmer.

461
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,040
And put

462
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,640
the seasonings such as pepper at last.

463
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,600
Don’t add it too early.

464
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,520
OK.

465
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,960
It’s almost done.

466
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,800
What’s it? It smells nice.

467
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,440
You are back.

468
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,480
I smelled it at the doorway.

469
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:05,840
Extra meal?

470
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,720
Xia made it.

471
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,840
It’s definitely not dark cuisine.

472
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,080
Just be at ease to have it.

473
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:10,600
Take a seat.

474
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,720
Will you…?

475
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,760
Come on.

476
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,560
Captain Xing, you’ve had a long day.

477
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,560
Please take the soup.

478
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,320
Xia is good at cooking.

479
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,120
Is it OK?

480
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,640
Not second to Wenbo, right?

481
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,960
Please help me

482
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,800
improve Mi Ka’s cooking skill.

483
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,920
OK.

484
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,000
I have finished my task for today.

485
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,240
I’m leaving now.

486
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,280
Remember to turn off

487
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,000
the fire later.

488
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,200
Are you leaving?

489
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,800
You…

490
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,960
Be careful.

491
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:47,760
OK.

492
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,040
Bye-bye.

493
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,280
Tell me after you arrive home.

494
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,280
What’s wrong?

495
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,600
There is a freak

496
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,680
keeping harassing her.

497
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,920
He delivered gifts

498
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,160
and bought takeouts for her.

499
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,120
He knows her home address.

500
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,400
Ask her to move here

501
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:07,840
and live with you.

502
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,480
I’ve talked about that, but she refused.

503
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,800
Oh.

504
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,240
Have a taste.

505
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,680
You’d take more.

506
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,400
Here you are.

507
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,080
You just take it.

508
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:17,760
Don’t stand on ceremony.

509
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,960
You…

510
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,800
Feed me.

511
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,600
I knew it.

512
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:28,660
I will make another bowl to you.

513
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,280
Take it quickly.

514
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,080
No. Take it all.

515
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,720
Go to bed after having it.

516
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
It’s still early.

517
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,440
You are tired for the training. Come on.

518
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,280
OK.

519
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,640
Your mouth is watering.

520
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,600
I will make one bowl to you.

521
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,760
No. I will just watch you eat.

522
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,600
It’s mainly because you are handsome.

523
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,880
I’m not watering for the soup.

524
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,920
Xing.

525
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,160

Turn left.

557
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,000
Report. Captain.

558
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,040
Tiger Assault Team is assembled.

559
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:27,800
One. Two.

560
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,200
Welcome back, Captain.

561
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,160
Li Nian.

562
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,360
Yes!

563
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,080
Are you getting fatter?

564
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,880
Report! No!

565
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,640
Maybe I’m swollen.

566
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,680
Over!

567
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,440
You’ve had comfortable days.

568
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,680
I’m back now.

569
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,600
It means

570
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,400
your good days end.

571
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,000
We must get

572
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,320
better grades in the combat

573
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,400
than that of the last year.

574
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,800
The sunlight is perfect now.

575
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,000
Come on. Prone position for one hour.

576
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,040
Yes!

577
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,120
Xing Kelei is back.

578
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,160
He’s still the same.

579
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,520
I know the problem of his hand.

580
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,760
The most important thing is

581
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,680
he can get over it.

582
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,000
It’ll be a

583
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,680
wonderful combat.

584
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,840
Are you OK today?

585
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,480
Fine. I’m great.

586
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:33,600
How do you feel?

587
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,640
You look good.

588
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,560
I’m weak.

589
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,440
You can’t be lying like this.

590
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,840
It’s easy to have lower limb thrombus.

591
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,240
You’d better get out of bed early

592
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,200
and take some walk.

593
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,680
It’s good for your recovery.

594
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,600
I’ll wait for Lei

595
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,680
to help me have a walk.

596
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,480
He has a closed training for the combat.

597
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,920
What?

598
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,400
He didn’t tell you about that?

599
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,480
Anyway, I changed the shift.

600
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,520
I will be on duty at night.

601
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,000
I’m out there all the time.

602
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,760
Don’t worry.

603
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:08,920
Take some food.

604
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:09,840
I will help you

605
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,360
walk outside when I have time.

606
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,440
Thank you, Mi Ka.

607
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,080
I want to have a rest.

608
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:16,760
OK.

609
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,280
When will Lei come back?

610
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,720
For the training and combat,

611
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,120
it will take

612
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,880
at least ten days.

613
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,240
It’s weird today.

614
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,440
Bed 15

615
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,520
seems to be another person.

616
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,720
She made no trouble at all

617
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,680
but acting very cooperatively

618
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,680
for blood drawing and injection.

619
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,200
It’s like she’s become another one.

620
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,600
She made inaudible sounds.

621
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,600
In my opinion,

622
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,320
it’s because Captain Xing doesn’t come.

623
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,720
There is no audience.

624
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,160
No audience will watch her show any more.

625
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,560
That’s great.

626
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,720
Dr. Mi will be free.

627
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,280
Have some.

628
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,520
Thank you.

629
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,880
You can feel your legs?

630
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:02,960
That’s good then.

631
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,720
It means the operation is successful.

632
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:05,960
Don’t have too much burden.

633
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,680
Laugh more. Be relaxed.

634
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,280
Stand up if it’s OK.

635
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,920
Yeah. Stand up and take a walk.

636
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,320
You will recover soon.

637
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,710
You can hold here,

638
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,280
and this place is OK too.

639
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,440
Right?

640
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,280
Jianan, where have you been?

641
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,360
Mi Ka.

642
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,800
I shouldn’t have

643
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,630
left Jianing here alone.

644
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,600
I can’t believe nobody has taken

645
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,440
care of her once I left.

646
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,840
How can you say that?

647
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,360
I’m here to take her

648
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,360
to walk around.

649
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,880
Let me do it.

650
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,190
She still hasn’t forgiven me.

651
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,880
I need to do more

652
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,400
so she’ll believe there are still

653
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,080
people caring about her.

654
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:57,840
Jianing.

655
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,280
OK.

656
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,680
Take care.

657
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,080
She…

658
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,920
Xia has been harassed recently.

659
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,040
You know?

660
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,840
I don’t know it.

661
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,640
Recently, there’s someone

662
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,200
who’s always sent gifts to her office

663
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,800
as well as her home.

664
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,040
It’s boring.

665
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,760
Mi Ka and I have persuaded her

666
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,120
into living with Mi Ka for a while.

667
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,440
But she doesn’t listen.

668
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,000
No way. I will go and see her

669
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,160
after the training.

670
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,640
Once he knew the address,

671
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,000
this kind of people will go to the site.

672
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:41,920
OK.

673
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,280
By the way,

674
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,680
I saw your hand was shaking

675
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,440
when you were training today.

676
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,480
How do you feel now?

677
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,560
It’s hard even after a long time.

678
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,440
So attention should be paid

679
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,560
to the training pace.

680
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,840
Also there should be

681
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,040
a plan for the combat.

682
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,160
You should be protected.

683
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,560
Don’t affect your recovery

684
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,400
for days because of the combat.

685
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:01,840
I know.

686
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,360
Excuse me.

687
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,520
Is No. 7 building this way?

688
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,240
It’s over there.

689
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,280
Thank you.

690
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,880
Ruan Qingxia.

691
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,760
I’m here actually for you.

692
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,640
Do you like the gifts

693
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,600
I sent you?

694
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:34,520
Don’t run. Stop there.

695
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,600
Don’t follow me.

696
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:39,920
Don’t come.

697
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,080
You learnt that especially for me?

698
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,600
Don’t come.

699
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,320
You are really good to me.

700
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,000
Don’t panic! I will help you.

701
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:52,880
Don’t come.

702
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:53,640
I will help you.

703
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,080
Don’t come.

704
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,320
-Don’t panic!
-Don’t come.

705
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,800
I just want to kiss you.

706
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,720
Don’t…

707
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,040
Don’t come.

708
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,000
Don’t panic!

709
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:03,640
Don’t come.

710
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,080
-Don’t panic!
-Don’t come.

711
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,600
I only want to hug you.

712
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,280
Don’t come. Don’t. No.

713
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,600
Who are you?

714
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,760
Why did you follow her?

715
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,800
I’m her fan.

716
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,600
I’m pretending to be a psycho

717
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,880
to play a trick on her.

718
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,480
Cut off the shit!

719
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,560
Be gentle.

720
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,680
Xia, are you alright?

721
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,120
Be gentle.

722
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:22,960
Cut the crap!

723
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,040
I was pretending to be a psycho

724
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,880
to play a trick on her.

725
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,800
Don’t. Don’t. Don’t.

726
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,840
You bastard!

727
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,560
Freak!

728
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,360
You…

729
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:47,620
(Police)

730
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,640
Are your shoes OK?

731
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,760
No problem.

732
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,160
Come on. Let me send you home.

733
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,320
No. I…

734
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,240
I’d treat you a dinner.

735
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,720
You just saved me.

736
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,400
It’s my turn to thank you.

737
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,720
No need.

738
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,240
How could you be downstairs of my home?

739
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,000
Xing Kelei told me about the matter.

740
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,400
We talked about that.

741
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,440
Since he knew your office

742
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,400
and home address,

743
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,120
he will surely

744
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,280
appear near there.

745
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,160
He even sent me

746
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,040
my favorite chinchilla.

747
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:20,800
I swear

748
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,520
I will never like it anymore.

749
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,280
It’s disgusting!

750
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,520
Chinchilla?

751
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:27,840
You don’t know it.

752
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,120
It’s just a toy.

753
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,640
A little cat.

754
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,760
It’s almost like that.

755
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,920
It’s like this, right?

756
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,120
Yes.

757
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,440
How do you know it?

758
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,720
I sent one

759
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,800
to your home.

760
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,600
It’s OK. It’s been in the past.

761
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,800
It proves that the thing

762
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,080
isn’t fated to be yours.

763
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,240
You… You sent it to me?

764
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,760
How did you know I like it?

765
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,560
You even didn’t know it.

766
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,440
Moreover,

767
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,920
where did you buy it?

768
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,240
It’s hard to buy one.

769
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,960
I put some effort.

770
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,080
So I knew it.

771
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,040
I…

772
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,000

00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,440
Xia.

774
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,920
What’s wrong? Don’t be angry.

775
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,160
It’s just a chinchilla.

776
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,080
Just a toy.

777
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:27,920
I will buy another one for you.

778
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,560
No.

00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,240

783
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,600
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

784
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,640
It’s my fault.

785
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:47,440
It’s my problem.

786
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,120
