=Episode 37=

20
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,440
Why don’t you buy one for Mi Ka?

21
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,640
What?

22
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,440
Aren’t you going to propose to her?

23
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,280
Look at you.

24
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,360
How insincere you are!

25
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,720
Mi Ka is so nice to you.

26
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,360
But you don’t even buy her a ring?

27
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,160
I’m not insincere!

28
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,280
Group-buying a diamond ring with you

29
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,000
will make me insincere.

30
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,640
Wait a second.

31
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,400
Do you really not want to

32
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,280
propose to her?

33
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,280
Of course I will propose to her.

34
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,720
Then why don’t you buy her a ring?

35
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,280
Come on.

36
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,800
Are you a shill of this store?

37
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,200
Is it you or I that come to buy a ring?

38
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,200
Me… Me.

39
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,120
How about this?

40
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,800
Pick a necklace.

41
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,080
I’ll buy it as your wedding gift.

42
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,630
What a big gift it’ll be!

43
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,280
Shut up.

44
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,560
Please show me

45
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,400
the necklaces.

46
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,840
Okay. Come this way, please.

47
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,860
(They both look good. Why do you ask?)

48
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,320
This one is over 7,000 yuan?

49
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,840
That one looks good, too.

50
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,720
Yes, it does.

51
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,920
(I’m accompanying Shu Wenbo
to buy a proposal ring for Xia.)

52
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,220
(I want you to give some advice.
Keep it secret.)

53
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,000
(Don’t tell her.)
They both look good.

54
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,080
The prices are perfect.

55
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,900
(Mi Ka)

56
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:38,960
Hello?

57
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,280
Something came up
in Zhang Yang’s family,

58
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,600
so he wanted
to change shifts with me.

59
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,600
I’ll be on a night shift tonight.

60
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,120
All right.

61
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:48,840
Get to work.

62
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,520
Have something nice to eat.

63
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,400
Okay.

64
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,720
Okay. Bye-bye.

65
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,560
Bye-bye.

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,640
Wait a second.

67
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,360
Do you really want to

68
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,240
propose to her?

69
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,160
Of course I will propose to her.

70
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,800
Then why don’t you buy her a ring?

71
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Xing Keyao. Xing Keyao!

72
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,000
Open the door.

73
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,480
Wait a minute.

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,520
Xing Keyao!

75
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,440
Coming!

76
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,760
Can’t you put in the password?

77
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,800
My hands are full.

78
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,920
Hello?

79
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,200
I see.

80
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,400
Well,

81
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,520
I’m coming back tomorrow.

82
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,320
We can still enjoy the concert.

83
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,720
All right, I’ll hang up.

84
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,360
At last, you have some romance.

85
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,480
Xing Kelei.

86
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,640
Xing Kelei!

87
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,840
Are you asking for a punch?

88
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,720
No.

89
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,680
I come to bring you

90
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,040
some soup.

91
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,040
Soup?

92
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,160
Can you be so kind?

93
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,120
I’m sure Mi Ka is either on night shift

94
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:23,760
or quarreled

95
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,920
with you.

96
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,160
Even if she wants to quarrel with me,

97
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,600
I won’t do that.

98
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,000
You’ve got a strong survival instinct.

99
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,920
I haven’t seen her

100
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,640
for nearly two weeks.

101
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,160
We hardly have time to enjoy a meal together,
not to mention a quarrel.

102
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,240
A resident doctor is always busy.

103
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,920
Isn’t it better

104
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,760
when she serves in Neurosurgery.

105
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,720
She would be busier if she were in ER.

106
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,280
When Shao Yuhan was abroad,

107
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,560
there was a training course

108
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,040
in Allen Medical Center.

109
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,880
The life was horrible there.

110
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,280
I have a senior.

111
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,240
After a two-year training course there,

112
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,920
he lost his thick hair

113
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,280
and became bald.

114
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,240
Even his girlfriend

115
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:02,960
left him for another guy.

116
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,880
Wasn’t he miserable?

117
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,120
It sounds like

118
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,320
he was in a prison.

119
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,280
Kind of.

120
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,240
It was normal to work 18 hours a day.

121
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,160
It was not even weird

122
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,720
if they didn’t leave the hospital

123
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,560
for 36 hours.

124
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,680
When they were tired,

125
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,120
they could have a nap of two hours

126
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,240
in a room of the hospital.

127
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,440
They had only one day off

128
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,000
within a month.

129
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,440
They had to spend a whole day sleeping

130
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,560
and could do nothing else.

131
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,720
What cruel capitalists!

132
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,280
But,

133
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
all doctors from that place are great.

134
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,240
When they come back to China,

135
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,600
they got offers from the best hospitals.

136
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,760
Because teachers

137
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,280
in Allen Medical Center

138
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,960
are top experts.

139
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,040
Also, the latest operation proposals

140
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,920
and therapies

141
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,840
will first be tried

142
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,160
in that place.

143
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,320
If it’s such a good place,

144
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,120
why doesn’t Mr. Shao go back there?

145
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,840
Mr. Shao enjoys

146
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,680
a lifelong employment there.

147
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,240
He can go back whenever he wants.

148
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,680
But he thinks

149
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,800
the medical science in China

150
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,760
is developing fast

151
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,440
where there’re many cases.

152
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,120
So, he’ll stay for a few more years.

153
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,080
I think he simply doesn’t want to leave.

154
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,480
Be serious.
We’re talking about you and Mi Ka.

155
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,600
I think

156
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,280
I feel very secure

157
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,120
when I’m with her.

158
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,760
When I go out on a mission

159
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,760
or a training,

160
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,360
I don’t feel stressed out.

161
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,120
But...

162
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:26,760
But

163
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,200
you enjoy acting like a spoiled boy.

164
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,760
I don’t.

165
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,080
You don’t?

166
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:31,800
Xing Kelei,

167
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,600
you’re always rude

168
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,680
to others.

169
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,720
As a real man,

170
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,440
why can you act like a spoiled boy

171
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,840
whenever you see Mi Ka?

172
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,120
You asked her to feed you

173
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:38,840
and button your shirt.

174
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,760
Don’t you feel cheesy?

175
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,920
I don’t.

176
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,960
You don’t?

177
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,000
I’ll record it next time

178
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,880
and show you.

179
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,280
I’m talking business to you.

180
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:48,920
Don’t interrupt.

181
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,040
Go ahead.

182
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,360
Look.

183
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,360
I’ve been with Mi Ka for a long time

184
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,440
and we love each other.

185
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,120
Also, we experienced life and death.

186
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,920
Shouldn’t I...

187
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,960
Propose to her?

188
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,320
Are you coming

189
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,520
to ask for permission?

190
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,160
You don’t need to.

191
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,680
Our parents said that

192
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,000
they wanted you to get married.

193
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,760
It doesn’t matter who you marry.

194
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,840
I wonder if I might scare her

195
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,160
when I suddenly propose to her.

196
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,040
Xing Kelei,

197
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,040
Mi Ka has totally

198
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,160
changed you.

199
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,680
You are worrying
about pains and losses now!

200
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,600
You know,

201
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,240
getting married is a solemn decision.

202
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:34,790
I don’t want her

203
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:37,030
to feel forced.

204
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,030
It’s been nearly six months

205
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,600
since you were in a relationship, right?

206
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:43,880
If we also consider

207
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,360
what happened before,

208
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,560
it’s been three years.

209
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,320
But she wasn’t your girlfriend

210
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,320
at that time.

211
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:51,880
What would you like to do?

212
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,120
Tell me your plan.

213
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,560
Buy a ring, propose to her, get married

214
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,560
and have a baby.

215
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,600
You won’t have a baby so soon.

216
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,920
Ring, first.

217
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,000
Well,

218
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,840
I’m going to Hong Kong in a day or two.

219
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,160
Which ring would you like?

220
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,840
Send me the photo.

221
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,160
I’ll buy it for you.

222
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,160
But you should pay for it.

223
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,520
All right.

224
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,280
Well,

225
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,960
I’ll bring her ring to you.

226
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,120
No. Don’t bother.

227
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,280
The other day,

228
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:20,840
she wore a ring of mine.

229
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,800
I know

230
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,200
her size.

231
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,360
Have you already got a plan

232
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,440
for this?

233
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,920
Why are you more anxious than me?

234
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,000
Am I?

235
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,040
Didn’t I tell you?

236
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,400
Our parents said that

237
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,960
one of us

238
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,640
must get married.

239
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,080
You’re getting married soon

240
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,560
and you’ll solve my problem.

241
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,160
Hurry up

242
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,560
with Mr. Shao.

243
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,680
You need love, anyway.

244
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,080
None of your business.

245
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,600
Go get the soup for me.

246
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,800
Mr. Shao.

247
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,400
On night shift again?

248
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,520
No.

249
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,640
I’m reorganizing some cases.

250
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,280
I’m leaving soon.

251
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,480
What happened?

252
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,240
You look haggard,

253
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,520
but you used to be energetic.

254
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,960
No.

255
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,960
I haven’t told Xing Kelei yet.

256
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,240
He’s been working lately

257
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,400
and I haven’t seen him.

258
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,440
But I think I should tell him about this

259
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,000
face to face.

260
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,120
I don’t want to call him.

261
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,760
To be honest,

262
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,040
I never expected my application

263
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,600
to be accepted.

264
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,800
If I knew it,

265
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,680
I would have told him earlier.

266
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,760
Now...

267
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,440
Now I feel that

268
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,760
I’m not showing enough respect for him.

269
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,200
You’re right.

270
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,480
How about this?

271
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,080
Let me help you explain to him.

272
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,040
Don’t bother.

273
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,400
I’ll tell him personally.

274
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,280
Fine, then.

275
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,160
You’re not in a good condition.

276
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,720
Go back home early after work.

277
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,280
Thank you, Mr. Shao.

278
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:11,880
I’m fine.

279
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,420
(Xing Kelei: Still working?)

280
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,940
(Have you had dinner?
It’s cold. Go back home early.)

281
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:40,220
(Mi Ka: I’m going back home soon.)

282
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,220
(I had dinner in the canteen.)

283
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:48,220
(Tomorrow is the weekend.
Can you come back?)

284
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:54,540
(Xing Kelei: I will come back,)

285
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:59,540
(unless there’s an unexpected mission.
Miss me?)

286
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:07,780
(Mm.)

287
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:16,340
(Does it mean yes or no?)

288
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:24,460
(Yes.)

289
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,440
Hello, Yuhan?

290
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,080
You’ve arrived?

291
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,200
All right. I’m coming down.

292
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,360
Wait a second.

293
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,680
Will you fail the negotiation?

294
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,240
Don’t scare me, all right?

295
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,520
I’m already nervous.

296
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,400
The point is...

297
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,800
Xing Kelei is different

298
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,400
from Shu Wenbo.

299
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,880
He considers a lot.

300
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,920
Shu Wenbo is

301
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,760
a very simple-minded man.

302
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,480
He wears his heart on his sleeve.

303
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,960
If you fail to express yourself well,

304
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,600
he...

305
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,160
he’ll not gonna make it.

306
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,200
It’s hard to tell

307
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,120
if you can get over it.

308
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,320
What do I do, then?

309
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,280
Do you really want to study

310
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,600
in Allen Medical Center?

311
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,320
I’ll be lying

312
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,080
if I tell you I don’t.

313
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,480
Allen Medical Center

314
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,760
is a place

315
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,560
where every doctor wants to go.

316
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,560
You want to go there,

317
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,840
even if you may

318
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,640
lose Xing Kelei?

319
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,920
I don’t want to lose him.

320
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,520
Even thinking that

321
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,160
I might break up with him

322
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,120
makes my heart ache.

323
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,920
Let’s not think about it, then.

324
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,840
Maybe Xing Kelei will support you.

325
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,640
He’s not an ordinary man.

326
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,560
He’s a special policeman!

327
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,560
He’s quite broad-minded.

328
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,240
Well, I’ll stop thinking about it.

329
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:26,840
All right.

330
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,360
I have to go.

331
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,120
Go ahead.

332
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,480
I had an appointment with Shu Wenbo.

333
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,720
Enjoy the dishes

334
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,120
with Xing Kelei.

335
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,320
Okay?

336
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,280
Okay.

337
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,320
I’ll heat the dishes and wait for him.

338
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,400
Call me if you need anything.

339
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,560
All right.

340
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,080
See you.

341
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,840
Bye-bye.

342
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,240
Isn’t it a funny joke?

343
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,040
I don’t think so.

344
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,520
What would you like, tea or coffee?

345
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,200
Coffee, please.

346
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,880
Didn’t you say

347
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,600
you had something to tell me?

348
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,120
Are you free this Saturday?

349
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,280
If you are,

350
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,120
go check the flat with me.

351
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,640
Flat?

352
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,040
What flat?

353
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,160
I’m renting a flat

354
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,040
for the moment, right?

355
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,040
The landlord said that

356
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,160
he wanted to sell the flat

357
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,760
and I can no longer rent it.

358
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,920
Then I think

359
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,320
now that I’ve made up my mind

360
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,680
to stay in China for a long time,

361
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,070
I’d rather buy a flat.

362
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,240
Isn’t it

363
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,720
a very important thing?

364
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,310
Simply because it’s very important,

365
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,960
you must be satisfied with the flat.

366
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,680
What you said

367
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,400
makes me wonder

368
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,440
what I should say.

369
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,000
You’re wondering what you should say?

370
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,800
I’m offering a possibility

371
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,680
and some preparation I may do

372
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,280
for this possibility.

373
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,960
What possibility?

374
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,800
You and I

375
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,280
may live in the flat together.

376
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,560
Are we

377
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,440
close enough

378
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,080
to live together?

379
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,720
If we hadn’t broken up seven years ago,

380
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,720
we would have lived together,

381
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,440

You must understand

383
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,200
the word “if”

384
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,160
isn’t convincing

385
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,440
from time to time.

386
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,440
I know

387
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,480
it’s a hypothesis.

388
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,680
But sometimes,

389
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,360
it’s also a wish

390
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,480
and an expectation.

What?

416
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,480
Today, I...

417
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,400
Come on. Look at the game.

418
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,600
I don’t play it.

419
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,560
You always play the game.

420
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,600
Is it fun?

421
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,840
Yes.

422
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,360
You’re a special policeman

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,120
But you may not play the game
as well as me.

425
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,120
Come on.

426
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,000
If you don’t believe me, have a try.

427
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,240
-I want to...
-Have a try.

428
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,760
Be quick.

429
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,880
I don’t play the game.

430
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,440

433
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,120
Then do this.

434
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,720
Then...

435
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,080
Awesome, isn’t it?

436
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:13,880
Like this?

00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,680
You can’t...

438
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,600
You really can’t play it.

439
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,440
What...?

440
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,640
Xia,

441
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,640
I...

442
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,640
I don’t know if you’ll like it.

443
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,520
I...

444
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,240
I went shopping for it.

445
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,800
I asked Xing Kelei to go with me.

446
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,000
Xia,

447
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,240
I fell in love with you long ago.

448
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,360
But I wasn’t brave enough

449
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,680
to confess my love to you.

450
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,080
It’s not until today

451
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,840
that I allow myself

452
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,040
to experience

453
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,280
what you told me

454
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,080
and what you did.

455
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,920
It’s you

456
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,960
who has totally changed my life.

457
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,720
In the earthquake-stricken area,

458
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,400
I thought about that.

459
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,000
No matter how much time we have,

460
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,760
five minutes

461
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,600
or fifty years,

462
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,520
I’ve made up my mind

463
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,720
to spend the rest of my life

464
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,600
with you.

465
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,400
Ruan Qingxia, thank you

466
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,520
for teaching me how to love someone

467
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,200
and how to be loved.

468
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,600
Ruan Qingxia,

469
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,440
will you marry me?

470
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,520
Yes.

471
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,160
What makes you laugh?

472
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,400
I’m thinking

473
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,760
Kelei will propose to Mi Ka.

474
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,760
You’re also telling me that

475
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,760
you want to

476
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,720
be with me.

477
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,760
Did my mother use

478
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,680
some marriage tricks?

479
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,480
Why don’t you ask her?

480
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,360
Kelei will propose to Mi Ka?

481
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,360
Yes.

482
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,280
They talked about the trip

483
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,280
to Allen Center?

484
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,800
What Allen Center?

485
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,560
Allen Medical Center.

486
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
The training course

487
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,680
for resident doctors.

488
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,800
I recommended Mi Ka

489
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,320
and she passed the primary election.

490
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,760
Hello, Keyao? What happened?

491
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:41,400
Kelei,

492
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,200
come to my place.

493
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:42,800
Immediately.

494
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,320
Shao Yuhan,

495
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:48,640
why are you still doing this

496
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,800
after so many years?

497
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,080
What’s the problem with me?

498
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,360
What do you think?

499
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,560
You only care for your profession,

500
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,400
don’t you?

501
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,080
You care for nothing else,

502
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,360
do you?

503
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,760
What do you mean?

504
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,640
Is there any problem

505
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,880
that I recommended Mi Ka

506
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,720
to Allen Medical Center?

507
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,360
I’ve done nothing wrong.

508
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,560
This will do good

509
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,640
to her future.

510
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,000
Have you thought about it?

511
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,120
If Mi Ka leaves,

512
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,440
she may break up with Kelei

513
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,040
like we did before.

514
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,440
I guess

515
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,680
Shu Wenbo left the ring

516
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,920
in this place

517
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,120
in case Xia might see it.

518
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,120
Xia has a happy ending.

519
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,600
Hello, Xia?

520
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,240
Honey,

521
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,120
have a look.

522
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:04,960
How does it look?

523
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,000
Shu Wenbo proposed to me.

524
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,360
He bought the diamond secretly.

525
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,280
Mi Ka?

526
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,840
Why is it stuck?

527
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,280
Bad signal?

528
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,440
I don’t know.

529
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,720
No, no, no.

530
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,360
Did you see it?

531
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,200
I said that

532
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,640
he proposed to me

533
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,640
and he bought the diamond ring.

534
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,320
He also said that

535
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,840
he couldn’t afford a very expensive one

536
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,280
and he didn’t want me to feel bad.

537
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,720
Congratulations, honey.

538
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,440
You’re the first one

539
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,480
I want to share the news with.

540
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,720
Let’s meet tomorrow

541
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,720
and celebrate it.

542
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,280
Bye-bye.

543
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,520
I did recommend Mi Ka,

544
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,960
because this is a rare opportunity.

545
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,600
It does great good

546
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,760
to her future development.

547
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,880
Today, she was informed that
she passed the primary election.

548
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,840
Later,

549
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,080
she’ll have a video interview.

550
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,720
But she hasn’t told me about it.

551
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,800
Maybe she thinks

552
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,200
the competition is too fierce

553
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,760
and very few people can pass it.

554
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,920
Then she didn’t tell you.

555
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,360
Keyao said it would take two years.

556
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,240
The first course takes two years.

557
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,040
But if she does a good job,

558
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,840
she can apply

559
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,240
for a three-year senior course.

560
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,760
It’ll be five years in total.

561
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,800
It must be very hard, isn’t it?

562
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,680
Kelei,

563
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:34,960
you’re getting on very well with Mi Ka,

564
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,240
aren’t you?

565
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,520
You don’t quarrel, either.

566
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,840
Mi Ka is a straightforward girl

567
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,960
and she’s simple-minded.

568
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:40,600
If you want to know something,

569
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,480
ask her directly.

570
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,760
Don’t beat around the bush.

571
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,400
Where are you going?

572
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,120

573
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,040
What did you try to say?

574
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,120
I wanted to tell him that

575
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,440
when Mi Ka went to school,

576
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,000
it didn’t mean they would break up.

577
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,640
He shouldn’t think

578
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,880
with such a hypothesis.

579
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,880
Why didn’t you tell him just now?

580
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,920
Weren’t you...?

581
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,040
What should I say?

582
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,120
Go tell him now.

583
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,000
I’m not going.

584
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,600
Go.

585
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,680
I’m not going. I...

I’m a doctor.

619

A surgeon. I just graduated.

620
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,080
I really hope

621
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,880
I can help people
with what I’ve learned.

622
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,540
(Climbing Building)

623
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,320
Please try

624
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,200
to get me in.

625
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,520
I’m a doctor.

626
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,240
I can stop him from bleeding.

627
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,040
What are you doing?

628
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,440
Going to save him.

629
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,640
I’m a doctor.

630
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,480
This is my duty.

631
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,640
When I grow up,

632
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,120
I want to be a doctor.

633
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,640
I want to cure every single patient

634
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,440
in this world.

635
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,800
Later I think

636
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,240
I must keep being a doctor.

637
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,200
Then I can save more people

638
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,800
and cure more patients.

639
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,680
It’s the same with you.

640
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,360
Because of you,

641
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,160
more people

642
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,800
will be safe.

643
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,800
Hope you can give this gift

644
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,320
to the little girl

645
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,360
who wanted to cure every single patient

646
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,080
in this world.

647
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,400
Look at me!

648
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,480

649
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,160
you’ll be alright!

00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,960
Even if there’s a little bit danger,

651
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,800
I won’t let you go there.

652
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Put on the mask

653
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,400
and leave immediately.

654
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,520
Do not stay.

655
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,320
Trust me.

656
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,760
When I’m here,

657
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,480
you’ll be alright.

Where’s Kelei?

666
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,760
He... he isn’t back yet.

667
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,480
He went to see you, didn’t he?

668
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,150
He knew

669
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,230
I was going abroad,

670
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,280
didn’t he?

671
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:23,190
Yes. Yes.

672
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,320
I’ll go find him.

673
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,150
All right.

674
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,760
I’m not going abroad.

675
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,520
I’m sorry.

676
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,440
I shouldn’t have kept it from you.

677
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,240
But I didn’t mean that.

678
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,400
First of all,

679
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,400
I didn’t expect
to pass the primary election.

680
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,560
Indeed,

681
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,280
it’s my dream

682
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,640
to go to Allen Medical Center.

683
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,520
But when I knew

684
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,080
I passed the primary election,

685
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,040
I wasn’t as happy as I had expected.

686
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,560
I’m more scared to leave you.

687
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,680
So, I decide not to go.

688
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,280
I’ll tell Mr. Shao tomorrow.

689
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,160
Silly girl.

690
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,640
Who told you going abroad

691
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,960
will do us part?

692
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,600
Do you have no confidence in me

693
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,360
or in yourself?

694
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,480
We’ve experienced life and death

695
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,960
so many times.

696
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,040
What else

697
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,200
can do us part?

698
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,400
So, you’re willing to let me go?

699
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,760
I’m not willing to.

700
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,000
I even want to lock you in the room

701
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,040
so that you can’t go anywhere.

702
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,040
I don’t want you to go,

703
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,440
mainly because

704
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,760
when you’re abroad alone,

705
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,200
you can’t eat or sleep regularly

706
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,320
and no one will take care of you.

707
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,520
Then how will you live?

708
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,720
But I think about it in your shoes.

709
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,360
If I were you

710
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,960
and I would go abroad for further study,

711
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,960
you would definitely let me go.

712
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:02,920
Right?

713
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,200
Yes.

714
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,640
But I would feel sad, too.

715
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,520
I really don’t want you

716
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,440
to regret.

717
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,880
It’s your dream, after all.

718
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,880
I want you to go and experience it.

719
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,760
So,

720
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,600
this is for me?

721
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,480
Well,

722
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,080
I’ve made up my mind before.

723
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,080
I wanted to ask you

724
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,600
if you would like

725
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,880
to marry me.

726
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,080
But when I knew this,

727
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,680
I felt confused.

728
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,200
I didn’t dare to propose to you

729
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,160
in case you felt stressed out

730
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,560
and gave up the chance

731
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,640
simply because of my proposal.

732
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,400
You saw it, anyway.

733
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,880
What are you going to do?

734
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,440
Xing Kelei,

735
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,280
will you marry me?

736
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,880
For richer, for poorer,

737
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,920
in sickness and in health,

738
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,440
will you love me, take care of me,

739
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,240
respect me and accept me

740
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,720
until death do us part?

741
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,240
If you want it,

742
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,200
hold out your little finger

743
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,640
and make a pinkie promise with me.

744
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,480
When I come back in two years,

745
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,600
you shall give me

746
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,840
a formal proposal ceremony.

747
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,280
As a policeman,

748
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,040
I’m always loyal.

749
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,600
I’ll wait for you.

750
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,040
Captain Xing,

751
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,360
when will you

752
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,480
and Shu Wenbo arrive?

753
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,280
It’s not appropriate to be late

754
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,000
on such an important day.

755
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,120
We’ll be right there. We’re on our way.

756
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,480
Please understand policemen

757
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,480
like us.

758
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,040
I see.

759
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,680
Does this one look good on me?

760
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,920
Is it too old-fashioned?

761
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,840
Kind of.

762
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,520
Would you like to try another dress?

763
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,000
May I

764
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:49,640
try this one on?

765
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,240
All right.

766
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,400
This one?

767
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,400
Yes, yes.

768
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:54,840
Thank you.

769
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,160
I think this one looks good.

770
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:05,840
It does?

771
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,240
I think so, too.

772
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,560
I’ll take this one.

773
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,400
Okay.

774
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,840
This one fits you.

775
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,400
Let me check the size.

776
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,000
I’ll have your dress made in this size.

777
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:14,640
Wait a second.

778
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,560
I’ll go get the sheet.

779
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,560
Okay. Thank you.

780
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,400
You won’t hold a wedding

781
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,320
in this city?

782
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,240
His father is in poor health.

783
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,360
So, we’re going to hold the wedding
in his hometown.

784
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,160
But we’ve decided

785
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,400
to take wedding photos here.

786
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,000
Then we’ll hold a small party

787
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,480
to entertain our colleagues

788
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,560
and friends.

789
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,280
Then we’ll hold the wedding
in his hometown.

790
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,720
My parents agree with us, too.

791
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,640
Ruan Qingxia,

792
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,440
you’re a spoilt princess.

793
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,000
Why are you so considerate now?

794
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,200
He’s a nice guy.

795
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,600
I don’t want him to be embarrassed.

796
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,280
He’s a nice guy?

797
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,800
Then what are you?

798
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,280
-I’m a good girl, too.
-You know?

799
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,360
You love him so much.

800
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,080
All right. All right.

801
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,600
I know.

802
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,360
Where are they now?

803
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,280
On their way.

804
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,680
On their way?

805
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,840
I think

806
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,920
that wedding dress suits you a lot.

807
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:14,920
Would you like to try it on?

808
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,920
Why would I try on a wedding dress
when you’re getting married?

809
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,680
We have plenty of time, anyway.

810
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,840
Go try it on.

811
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,360
Xing Kelei allowed you

812
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,640
to go abroad for further study.

813
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,600
But he’s as eager to get married

814
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,920
as Shu Wenbo.

815
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,120
Go try the dress on.

816
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,480
I want to see my best friend
in a wedding dress,

817
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,000
all right?

818
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:35,600
Go try it on.

819
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,320
Go ahead.

820
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:37,800
All right. I’ll go.

821
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:38,920
Stop that.

822
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:39,760
Disgusting.

823
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:40,800
I’ll go.

824
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,720
Be quick. We’re late.
