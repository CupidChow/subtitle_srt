19
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,480
Boss, the car is fine.

20
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,400
Okay.

21
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,400
Get ready to leave.

22
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,400
Laoliu,

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,760
you carry Jun.

24
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,760
Okay.

25
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,840
Peel.

26
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,800
Grab the injured policeman

27
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,800
and make the hostages

28
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,360
walk around us.

29
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,920
You guys get off the bus

30
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,600
back to back.

31
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,720
Then the snipers

32
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,560
won’t dare to shoot.

33
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,360
Grab one hostage,

34
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,040
so they won’t dare to
make a surprise attack.

35
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,440
Boss, what about you?

36
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,190
I’ll guard these two lovebirds.

37
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,960
I’ll get her.

38
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,280
You,

39
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,440
lead the way.

40
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,480
The hostages are too close
to them.

41
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,320
Group One can’t shoot.

42
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,840
Group Two can’t shoot either.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,560
Roger that.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,840
Put your hands behind your head.

45
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,200
Hold on.

46
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,280
Peel.

47
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,520
Come over.

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,760
Move on.

49
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,520
Slow down.

50
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,320

51
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,720

55
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:10,840
Get in there!

56
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,680

57
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,520
-Get in there!
-Big bro!

58
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,160

62
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,600

63
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,000

64
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,600

66
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:18,640

68
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:19,920

75
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,400

Get in!

77
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,520
Get in now!

78
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,480
I...

79
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,360
Withdraw! Hurry up!

80
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:51,840
Come on!

81
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,680
Xing Kelei.

82
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,320
Doctor!

83
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:11,800
Xing Kelei.

84
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,400
Doctor!

85
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:13,680
What’s wrong?

86
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,040
You can’t breathe?

87
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,120
Look at me.

88
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,920
I’m here.

89
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,800
The first aid kit.

90
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,000
He must have been
stabbed in the left lung.

91
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,720
That caused a leak in the alveoli

92
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,200
and a tension pneumothorax.

93
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,040
The saline bottle.

94
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,680
Use a tube to release the air.

95
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,680
The Infusion needle and tube.

96
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,200
Just a second.

97
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:54,960
Hang in there.

98
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,720
I can do it.

99
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,720
Just a second.

100
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,880
It will be all right.

101
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,760
You can do it.

102
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:38,640
Xing Kelei.

103
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:47,960
Doctor!

104
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,080
You are awake.

105
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,800
When did you wake up?

106
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,800
Why didn’t you call me?

107
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,520
Who are you?

108
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,240
Do you really not know who I am

109
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,400
or are you faking it?

110
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,440
Who am I?

111
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,480
Where am I?

112
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,040
Xing Kelei.

113
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,760
I am your mother.

114
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,560
Don’t laugh.

115
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,520
How can you still make a joke

116
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,040
even now?

117
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,240
It hurts. It hurts.

118
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,200
Don’t laugh.

119
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,880
You were stabbed.

120
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,680
What a fool.

121
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,120
How long have I been sleeping?

122
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,760
You were in a coma
for a day and a night.

123
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,120
Haven’t you slept since then?

124
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,520
I dare not sleep
when you were in a coma.

125
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,880
When I close my eyes,

126
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,000
I can’t stop picturing
that bad guy stabbing you.

127
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,600
I’m scared.

128
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,920
What are you doing?

129
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,800
I haven’t seen you for two years.

130
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,880
I want to know

131
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,640
if there is anything missing.

132
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,280
It’s okay.

133
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,280
They are still there.

134
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,200
Are you talking about
the fat on my belly?

135
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,280
-Do you miss me?

136
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,720
I miss you.

137
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,680
I know.

138
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,840
Look.

139
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,960
In this case,

140
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,960
you have saved me twice.

141
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,720
I only saved you once.

142
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,680
A drop of water in need,
shall be returned with a spring in deed.

143
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,600
Now I can only

144
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,160
offer myself to you.

145
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,560
Dr. Mi, just take me in.

146
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,840
I can take you in.

147
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,000
But you got hurt

148
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,600
to save me this time.

149
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,800
We are even.

150
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,680
Why have we

151
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,800
been through

152
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,800
so many trilling things

153
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,760
since we were together?

154
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,920
It’s like a movie.

155
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,480
Perhaps it’s because

156
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,840
you are a doctor

157
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,680

I heard that Mi Ka
took half a month’s leave

194
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,680
to stay with Kelei.

195
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,920
How do you think if I give Yi Qian

196
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,200
the coffee cup we just saw?

197
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,240
The coffee cup? Forget it.

198
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,120
I gave him one
for his birthday last year.

199
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,480
Who would have thought

200
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,560
the bachelor Yi Qian

201
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,720
chose a flash marriage.

202
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,240
It’s not just a flash marriage.

203
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,520
He’ll be a dad in half a year.

204
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,040
He did a good job in the overtaking.

205
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,160
Quite fast and impressive.

206
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,840
Whom did he overtake?

207
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,880
Don’t you know it?

208
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,880
I don’t know.

209
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,920
Let’s go to
the Civil Affairs Bureau tomorrow.

210
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,360
Why are we going there?

211
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,840
To get

212
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,760
a marriage certificate.

213
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,350
Dr. Shao.

214
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,110
I think you are really insincere

215
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,350
when you talk about

216
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,160
getting a marriage certificate.

217
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,590
And also the wedding ring.

218
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,920
You bought

219
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,040
the wedding ring

220
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,240
while taking a walk in the mall.

221
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,310
Now you are talking about
getting married

222
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,640
like having a meal.

223
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,680
Do you do everything

224
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,000
in a flash of inspiration?

225
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,000
We have known each other well

226
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,520
after all these years.

227
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,880
We don’t need those tricks.

228
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,920
I need them.

229
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:28,880
Are you serious about it?

230
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,040
You want a sense of ritual, right?

231
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,080
Okay. I can get down on one knee.

232
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,880
No problem.

233
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,840
What? A lot of people here.

234
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,200
It doesn’t matter.

235
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,280
Get up now.

236
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,080
I want you to marry me.

237
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:38,720
Get up.

238
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,360
Will you marry me or not?

239
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,200
Get up.

240
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,520
All right, what else do you want?

241
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,040
Yi Qian likes red wine.

242
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,960
Buy him a red wine glass.

243
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,600
No more kneeling?

244
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,320
You...

245
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,920
I’ll be like this if you kneel again.

246
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,200
Pick one. They all seem good.

247
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:56,880
You choose one.

248
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,800
Is this a champagne glass?

249
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,440
Just this one.

250
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,480
Okay, they are all quite good.

251
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,840
This one suits him well.

252
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,200
Pay for it.

253
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,840
You have such a good taste.

254
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,320
You always choose the perfect one,

255
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,360
just like you chose me.

256
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,120
Yeah. It’s mainly because I chose

257
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,280
Dr. Shao.

258
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,360
We’ll go to
the Civil Affairs Bureau tomorrow.

259
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,900
(Outpatient)

260
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:00,140
(Jiangning Renxin Hospital)

261
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,760
Haven’t we seen each other
for a long time?

262
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,040
It wasn’t that long.

263
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,160
Just two years,
one month and three days.

264
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,520
When did you come back?

265
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,400
Yesterday.

266
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,240
Why didn’t you tell me?

267
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,240
I could have picked you up.

268
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,640
No need.

269
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,120
It’s not easy to ask for leave in ER.

270
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,440
Aren’t you afraid of Director Wei

271
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,760
eating you alive?

272
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,880
I’m not the person I used to be.

273
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,640
I am her competent assistant now.

274
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,080
She can’t do it without me.

275
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,280
Keep bragging.

276
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,880
How long are you
going to stay this time?

277
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,400
I don’t know.

278
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,880
It depends on whether

279
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,560
Renxin would accept me.

280
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,280
Are you going back to Renxin?

281
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,800
You won’t go back to school?

282
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,160
I’ve submitted the resume.

283
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,600
I’m waiting for the result.

284
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,160
You can make it.

285
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,840
You trust me that much?

286
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,040
I’ve always trusted you.

287
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,400
Good Places for Weekends.

288
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,400
Dear friends.

289
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,640
That’s our show

290
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,320
for today.

291
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,440
Next time Xia will take you

292
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,160
to find the Manchu Han Feast
in the alley.

293
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,440
Okay.

294
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,000
Okay?

295
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,320
We got it.

296
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,200
Xia!

297
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,280
We really like you!

298
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,040
We watch

299
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:26,880
your show every time.

300
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,280
Thank you.

301
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:27,600
Can we take a photo together?

302
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,880
Okay.

303
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,120
Thank you!

304
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:30,600
Where shall we...

305
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,120
How about there?

306
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,800
Right here.

307
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,160
Come on.

308
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,840
Three, two, one.

309
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,880
Okay.

310
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:38,960
Thank you, Xia!

311
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,960
Thank you. Thank you.

312
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,880
Bye-bye.

313
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,800
Xia.

314
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,440
Your personal driver is here.

315
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,560
Hurry up. Get it done for me.

316
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:48,800
Thank you.

317
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,800
Bye-bye.

318
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,480
My husband!

319
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,400
It’s a public place.

320
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,880
Why are you so dramatic?

321
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,120
Am I dramatic?

322
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,240
I know how to behave

323
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,680
in a public place.

324
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,880
Otherwise...

325
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,680
Stop.

326
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,240
You’ve been talking the whole morning.

327
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,080
Have some water
to moisturize your throat.

328
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,160
Honey, you’re so nice.

329
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,480
Do me a favor

330
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,240
if you have nothing else to do later.

331
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,120
What do you need me to do?

332
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,320
Don’t ask about it.

333
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,560
You’ll know it when you are there.

334
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,760
All right.

335
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,080
I’m so tired.

336
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,640
I’ll give you a massage later.

337
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,520
Really?

338
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,520
Keep your words.

339
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,760
No problem.

340
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,480
What’s wrong?

341
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,560
Are you uncomfortable?

342
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,000
I...

343
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,040
Do you want to throw up?

344
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,640
All right.

345
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,720
I’m getting dizzy.

346
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,920
Put me down.

347
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,840
Put it there.

348
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,320
I’ll tidy it up.

349
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,400
Don’t move.

350
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,360
You just had the operation.

351
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,800
Come on, let me do it.

352
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,840
I’m glad

353
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,640
you can tidy yourself up.

354
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,400
I don’t expect you to do it for me.

355
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,120
I haven’t seen you

356
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,160
open this suitcase

357
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,400
since you came back.

358
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,960
But I still brought it back in one piece

359
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,840
from abroad.

360
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,640
It’s normal.

361
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,880
The suitcase

362
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,880
would also get airsick.

363
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,400
Exactly.

364
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,440
I’ll tidy it up.

365
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,680
How can it be so messy?

366
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,560
Let me do it.

367
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,440
How can it be so messy?

368
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,600
What are you looking at?

369
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,000
What a virtuous man.

370
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,600
How are you going to reward me?

371
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,920
I...

372
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,320
I’ll play with you.

373
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,200
Just play with me?

374
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,560
In order to go abroad this time,

375
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,240
I haven’t taken one day off
in the last 18 months.

376
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,400
You should be my maid.

377
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,720
Be your maid?

378
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,240
Do you bear to let me do it?

379
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,280
Yes.

380
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,240
By the way,

381
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,880
why do you bring the soymilk machine?

382
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,400
Didn’t you say

383
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,960
the food abroad is not tasty?

384
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,120
I packed a lot food,

385
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,400
so I can cook for you over there.

386
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,600
Captain Xing, you are a must-have

387
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,280
for home or travel.

388
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,120
After this project,

389
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:21,720
I promise

390
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,960
I won’t leave you again.

391
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,880
Stop saying that. I don’t believe it.

392
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,040
You won’t fool me.

393
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,480
By the way,

394
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,480
I might need to

395
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,280
go back to the team later.

396
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,280
Come with me.

397
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,240
Why do you need to go back to the team?

398
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,840
There are a lot of procedures
to go through to go abroad.

399
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,200
Go by yourself.

400
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,160
Are you going or not?

401
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,560
No.

402
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,040
Going or not?

403
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,040
Why are you threatening me?

404
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,520
Change your clothes. Hurry up.

405
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,280
-Come on.
-No.

406
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,640
Why do you need me to go with you?

407
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,720
Hurry up.

408
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:17,840
Let’s go.

409
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,080
Where’s my ring?

410
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,120
Your ring...

411
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,520
-Where did you put it?
-I just...

412
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,480
I put it on the table

413
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,040
before I went to the bathroom.

414
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,720
The bathroom?

415
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,880
Could you drop it in the toilet?

416
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,640
I’ll go to check it.

417
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,320
Don’t.

418
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,640
We have no time for that. Let’s go.

419
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,560
It won’t be lost anyway.

420
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:39,960
It’s somewhere at home.

421
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:40,480
It’s really expensive.

422
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,160

Don’t you need to get something?

455
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,640
I didn’t bring the key.

456
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,520
I’ve asked someone to send it here.

457
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,880
Do you still remember this building?

458
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:30,460
(Climbing Building)

459
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,720
I would never forget it.

460
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,960
I think I’m the only trainee

461
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,040
who failed it.

462
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,400
You are.

463
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,480
Are you going to

464
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,640
laugh at me for the rest of my life?

465
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,480
No.

466
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,160
Stop laughing.

467
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,920
Didn’t you

468
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,920
overcome it later?

469
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,640
Look.

470
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,120
You even climbed on

471
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,240
such a dangerous truck.

472
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,440
That’s why I decided to

473
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,760
give you the certificate.

474
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,280
Thank you.

475
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,380
(Certificate of Completion Mi Ka)

476
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,880
I was thinking

477
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,200
why this girl is so stubborn?

478
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,800
How would she live a life in the future?

479
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,080
What do you mean?

480
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,720
I’m a doctor.

481
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,360
It’s my responsibility.

482
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,080
What’s more,

483
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,880
I got you by my side.

484
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,440
Did you fall in love with me

485
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,480
at that time?

486
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,000
What?

487
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,320
You heard me.

488
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,640
I really didn’t.

489
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,400
Do you dare to

490
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,640
go up again?

491
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,920
Are you asking me

492
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,720
to rappel down?

493
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,160
I’m wearing high heels.

494
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,240
I’m going to get you up there.

495
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:31,800
Let’s go.

496
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,200
Isn’t that the place

497
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,200
where Instructor Li taught me
how to rappel down?

498
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,640
Listen,

499
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,920
I saw everything

500
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,920
you two did here.

501
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,080
What did we

502
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,440
do here?

503
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,800
He taught you about the rope.

504
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,320
Look how

505
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,040
petty you are.

506
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,880
I wanted to

507
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,200
teach you by myself.

508
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,720
I was going to see you.

509
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,200
I didn’t expect

510
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,280
that brat to take a step ahead of me.

511
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:16,840
Have more.

512
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,640
The lamb chop is very nutritious.

513
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:18,520
Come on.

514
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,360
Thank you. Thank you.

515
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:19,480
Here.

516
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,160
Mr. Luo, have some too.

517
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:21,640
Dr. Mi.

518
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,920
You are really considerate.

519
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,640
The person who can be your boyfriend

520
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,080
must be really lucky.

521
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,440
That’s true.

522
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,560
Really. Really.

523
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,520
Then you used your power
for your private revenge.

524
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,080
You had a free combat with him

525
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,200
and kicked him down,

526
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:34,800
didn’t you?

527
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,760
He deserved it.

528
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,920
Besides,

529
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,400
you were not nice to me

530
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,560
at that time.

531
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,680
You didn’t treat me well either.

532
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,200
You were really strict with me.

533
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,840
You even made me cry.

534
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,440
You asked me to clean the toilet

535
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,920
and the bathroom.

536
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,320
I asked you to clean the bathroom

537
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,400
because I wanted to give you a reason
to take a shower.

538
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,000
Okay?

539
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,780
(Bathroom)

540
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,960
You don’t how nice I was to you.

541
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,720
What a fool.

542
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,000
So,

543
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,920
you kind of had a crush on me

544
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,240
at that time, right?

545
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,800
I guess.

546
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,240
What do you mean?

547
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,160
Take it as a yes.

548
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:43,760
Look there.

549
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:45,880
What?

550
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,720
The gate.

551
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,000
Do you remember

552
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,520
the time you ran to me

553
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,760
and hugged me?

554
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,920
You cried all night

555
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,320
without saying anything.

556
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,280
I didn’t cry all night.

557
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,880
Sometimes I feel helpless

558
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,600
and aggrieved

559
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,720
when it’s too stressful at work

560
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,600
or something goes wrong with the patient

561
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,360
but I can’t solve it.

562
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,080
I didn’t know what to do,

563
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,440
then I think

564
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,360
it would be nice

565
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,440
just to hug you

566
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,360
without saying anything.

567
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:24,840
You always

568
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,680
feel sad because of

569
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,160
other people’s illness.

570
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,200
But I like

571
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,240
the way you smile.

572
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,960
Every time when I go on a mission,

573
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,720
no matter how dangerous it is,

574
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,640
I can handle it calmly

575
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,480
when I think about your smile.

576
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,280
Therefore,

577
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,640
try to smile often.

578
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,320
Do you dare

579
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,800
to take a look over there?

580
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,040
Right now?

581
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,040
Right now,

582
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,760
I’m Captain Xing’s girlfriend.

583
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,440
I do.

584
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,940
(Dr. Mi Marry me)

585
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,230
You told me

586
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,190
that nothing good ever happened

587
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,680
since we’ve been together.

588
00:34:59,040 --> 00:34:59,920
It turns out

589
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,440
you are right about it.

590
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,760
But for me,

591
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,320
it’s the happiest thing

592
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,720
in this world

593
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,920
to meet you.

594
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,320
I want to make

595
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,400
this happiness last.

596
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,080
I wonder

597
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,640
if this ring

598
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,680
and a handsome me

599
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,160
are enough to ask Dr. Mi

600
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,640
to let me be your husband.

601
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,480

are doing up there.

625
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,000
It has been a long time.

626
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,040
It’s cold in the heights.

627
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,080
I think the wind is quite strong.

628
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,240
It’s a good move.

629
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,640
I’ll use this move

630
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,880
when I marry

631
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,840
my husband.

632
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,000
What’s wrong?

633
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,400
No. No.

634
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,360
This way.

635
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,480
That one.

636
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,040
Put it over there.

637
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,320
Yeah.

638
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,120
Move this one.

639
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,080
Okay.

640
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,160
Look at this.

641
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,680
Do it as that one.

642
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,200
Yeah.

643
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:18,640
Great.

644
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,880
Move it back a little bit.

645
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,920
Move it back.

646
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:21,600
Put it here.

647
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,480
Is it all right?

648
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,080
Here.

649
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:24,920
Come on.

650
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,400
Is this okay?

651
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:26,920
Okay.

652
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,960
Make it face the front.

653
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,840
No, that won’t work.

654
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,200
Take a look.

655
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,240
Look.

656
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,760
It’s too romantic.

657
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,020
(Dr. Mi Marry me)

658
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:48,920
Withdraw.

659
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,520
Wenjing, we are almost finished.

660
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,600
Roger that.

661
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,640
They must be

662
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,240
really sweet now.

663
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,320
Well, aren’t we sweet?

664
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Just so so.

665
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,520
What are you looking at?

666
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,200
Captain Xing.

667
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,000
This is a happy event.

668
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,760
Shouldn’t you

669
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,600
treat us to dinner?

670
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,400
Yeah, treat us to dinner.

671
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,360
What does it have anything
to do with you?

672
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,200
We’re leaving.

673
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,800
So stingy.

674
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,040
Look at him.

675
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:45,920
Captain Shu.

676
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,800
Didn’t he promise to

677
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,920
treat us to a meal?

678
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,600
He forgets loyalty when in love.

679
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,760
Honey.

680
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,360
You are off today.

681
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,240
Shouldn’t we go back

682
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,720
to my parents’ house for dinner?

683
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,320
Did you forget it?

684
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:58,960
I didn’t.

685
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,360
Did you forget it?

686
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,640
You must have forgotten it.

687
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,480
Let’s go to

688
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,360
have a meal together.

689
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,080
We... we are

690
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,800
going to play game

691
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,560
this afternoon, right?

692
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,340
-Let’s go.
-Yeah.

693
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,230
Let’s go. Let’s go.

694
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:09,160
Wait for me.

695
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,280
Zhuo Wenjing, let’s...

696
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:11,960
I also have an appointment.

697
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,120
Very good.

698
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,560
Let’s go to have something delicious.

699
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,520
Who do you have an appointment with?

700
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,440
I have an appointment!

701
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,080
I’ve always wanted to

702
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,240
take you here.

703
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,680
My parents weren’t around me

704
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,840
when I was young.

705
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,400
So, I don’t have

706
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,200
a deep understanding of family.

707
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,440
But every time I come here,

708
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,920
seeing all these lights

709
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,360
and the busy people

710
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,680
inside this city,

711
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,280
I’ll have

712
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,480
a special sense of belonging.

713
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,000
It turns out that there are

714
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,080
so many people

715
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,720
who are guarding us silently

716
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,560
in places we can’t see.

717
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,520
There are doctors like you.

718
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,240
Also firefighters.

719
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,160
Teachers.

720
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,040
Delivery guys.

721
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,520
And I

722
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,640
chose to be

723
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,600
a policeman.

724
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,440
But also because of my identity,

725
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,920
I feel

726
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,280
guilty in some ways.

727
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,320
Because I can’t

728
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,840
always put you first.

729
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,480
Are you willing to accept me

730
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,520
who is not entirely yours?

731
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,800
What else can I do
if I don’t want to accept it?

732
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,920
I can’t stop

733
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,400
liking you.

734
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,960
I can’t stop

735
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,680
worrying about you.

736
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,640
We have no control over birth and death.

737
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,160
It’s like sometimes a doctor

738
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,800
can’t control

739
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,560
the result of an operation.

740
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,480
There are too many things

741
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,560
we can’t control.

742
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,760
Let’s just do our best.

743
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,840
I understand you.

744
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,480
I’m not the only one

745
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,600
you are to protect.

746
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,200
You are also to protect the whole city.
