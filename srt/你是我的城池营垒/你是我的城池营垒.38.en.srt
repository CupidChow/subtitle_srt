Yes.

00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,160
-Really beautiful.
-They are so happy!

70
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,200
This one, he is handsome.

71
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,000
He’s so handsome.

72
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,840
Do you mean the bridegroom

73
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,080
or the groomsman?

74
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,760
Wordy! The groomsman of course.

75
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,080
Groomsman.

76
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,000
Mi Ka, how about you?

77
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,440
When will you get married?

78
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,320
Right.

79
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,560
He’s such a handsome captain!

80
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,840
Make him yours quickly.

81
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,600
Yes.

82
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,560
It…

83
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,400
It depends on his performance!

84
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,320
It depends?

85
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,480
-Mi Ka is shy.
-She’s shy.

86
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,080
Only that?

87
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,960
Thank you, Mr. Shao.

88
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,150
They officially admitted you.

89
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,720
Did you get the admission letter?

90
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,920
Are you worrying about him

91
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,160
for the coming separation?

92
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,480
I know he’s suffering pain.

93
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,280
But he’s afraid I’ll be sad,

94
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,920
so he pretends

95
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,440
to be careless.

96
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,600
I really envy you,

97
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,080
making allowance for each other

98
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,560
and understanding each other.

99
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,960
If Keyao and I

100
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,280
can be like you two years ago,

101
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,880
we probably wouldn’t have separated.

102
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,320
Wanna listen to the story?

103
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,800
Both she and I

104
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,560
were young and aggressive.

105
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
We both

106
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,000
were unwilling

107
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,880
to tell each other about

108
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,240
our own ideas and feelings.

109
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,640
When she mentioned

110
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,320
she would give up her studies

111
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,640
and go home

112
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,160
for the family business,

113
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,040
I thought she had given me up

114
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,480
in mind.

115
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,360
I was too proud

116
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,120
to detain her.

117
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,720
Meanwhile,

118
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,560
I thought letting her go

119
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
should be good for her.

120
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,800
She just left like that.

121
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,640
I’ve been thinking these years

122
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,320
that maybe she just

123
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
wanted to listen to one word from me.

124
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,720
“Please stay!”

125
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,720
Then she probably wouldn’t leave.

126
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,480
If that truly happened,

127
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,000
you’d call me brother-in-law.

128
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,040
Mr. Shao.

129
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,360
You don’t really like expressing

130
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,680
at ordinary times.

131
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,120
You said so many things to me

132
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,160
because you want me

133
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,000
to tell Keyao about this?

134
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,800
I did a right thing

135
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,080
by recommending you

136
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,320
to go to Allen Medical Center.

137
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,880
What is the reason?

138
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,640
You are

139
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,720
smart.

140
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,160
I see.

141
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,520
Every single word I just said

142
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,160
is from Mr. Shao’s mouth.

143
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,520
He’s trying to apologize

144
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,880
through your mouth.

145
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,600
I don’t think he’s apologizing.

146
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,120
He’s expressing his love.

147
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,920
We’ve been at odds with each other

148
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,960
because of recommending you

149
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,160
to go to Allen Medical Center.

150
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,360
You don’t think
he should recommend me, right?

151
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,480
Exactly.

152
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,280
I’m afraid

153
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,400
Kelei and you

154
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,080
would become like he and I.

155
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,160
Mi Ka.

156
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,080
You know what?

157
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,920
You are amazing.

158
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,040
You could tell Kelei

159
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,160
you couldn’t leave him.

160
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,760
But

161
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,240
both your Mr. Shao and I

162
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,480
didn’t speak that out.

163
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,560
I’m a

164
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,920
cool-headed person,

165
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,840
worrying a lot.

166
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,040
I had to take my parents’ feelings

167
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,320
and his mindset

168
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,240
into consideration.

169
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,160
He told me

170
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,040
he couldn’t ask me

171
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,360
to stay

172
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,320
because

173
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,600
he had high self-esteem.

174
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,000
So was I.

175
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,240
I thought if I told him

176
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,000
that I would stay,

177
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,800
it seemed I would

178
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,480
stick to him the rest of my life.

179
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,880
Now thinking about it,

180
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,200
love

181
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,240
needs courage and impulsion.

182
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,120
I can’t understand it.

183
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,240
Is pride

184
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,560
really that important,

185
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,520
even more important than being in love?

186
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,520
Every time Xing Kelei went out
for a mission at night,

187
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,880
I stayed awake all night.

188
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,680
I’ve kept watching the phone

189
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,560
to see if he sent me message

190
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,680
about his safety.

191
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,280
If I couldn’t receive any message,

192
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,200
I would have a bee in my mind.

193
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,640
Is he injured?

194
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,280
What’s the matter with him?

195
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,800
Did you sleep lightly

196
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,240
at night?

197
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,040
You felt upset on thinking

198
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,560
there might be an accident, right?

199
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,120
Did you feel the same?

200
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,400
Sister and girlfriend

201
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,840
would worry about the same thing.

202
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,840
In the coming two years,

203
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,520
you need to psych yourself up.

204
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,960
You can’t meet

205
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,920
but you are worrying.

206
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,560
It’s really hard.

207
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,200
I know.

208
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,040
Kelei told me

209
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,480
you cried when

210
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,360
you said you wouldn’t go.

211
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,480
He was really sad.

212
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,520
He doesn’t want

213
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,800
to ruin

214
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,560
your future.

215
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,760
So

216
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,080
he said he’s sad.

217
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,120
How could he think so?

218
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,960
I didn’t see him feeling angry.

219
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,920
I feel really very

220
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,240
sorry for him.

221
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,080
So,

222
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,360
please love Kelei more

223
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,400
no matter where you are going,

224
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,280
how long time you will go.

225
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,400
Cherish him well.

226
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,520
Kelei is really a good man.

227
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,960
I will, Keyao.

228
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,960
Please

229
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,440
also take Mr. Shao’s thing

230
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,000
into consideration, will you?

231
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,880
OK.

232
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,900
(Xing Keyao)

233
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,560
Hello.

234
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,680
Uh, are you at home?

235
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,040
No, I’m in the hospital.

236
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:35,840
Anything wrong?

237
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,440
You, you said you want

238
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,000
to buy a house.

239
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,080
My friend

240
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,600
recommended me a building.

241
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,080
I’ve checked it out.

242
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,960
The house type is great.

243
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,720
It’ll be completed before the New Year.

244
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,080
It fits you well.

245
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,960
Maybe you can go have a look.

246
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,680
Does it

247
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,080
only fit me?

248
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,640
It fits us.

249
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,760
OK. This Saturday.

250
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,360
Let’s go check it together, OK?

251
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,600
OK.

252
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,560
Welcome. Welcome.

253
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,640
Thank you. Thank you.

254
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,360
Come on.

255
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,200
Congratulations.

256
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:47,960
Thank you.

257
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,600
You are beautiful, too.

258
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,680
Thank you. Thank you.

259
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,720
Shu Wenbo.

260
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,920
Busy?

261
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,000
Bridegroom, you are so handsome.

262
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,400
Come on. Let’s hug.

263
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,520
OK. Go ahead.

264
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,400
Enjoy yourself.

265
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,240
Try to help us.

266
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,880
No problem.

267
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,070
Congratulations.

268
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:09,480
Hello.

269
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,110
Xia, you look so beautiful today.

270
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:11,880
Thank you.

271
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:12,800
It’s been a while.

272
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,520
Be happy.

273
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,480
Enjoy yourselves.

274
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,160
Thank you.

275
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,000
Happy wedding. Love for all seasons.

276
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:18,920
Let’s hug.

277
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,830
Oh my Goodness!

278
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,960
Captain Xing. Captain Xing.

279
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:24,760
-Dr. Mi.

280
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,680
Hello.

281
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,040
It seems your

282
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,680
wedding is near.

283
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,000
What a great diamond!

284
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,080
Captain Xing. You are great.

285
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,360
Hey.

286
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,880
Seems you are jealous.

287
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,360
Just try your best.

288
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,880
Don’t compare to me.

289
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,760
It’s just because

290
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,640
my parents have worked hard.

291
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,560
It’s just a small amount.

292
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,280
A small amount?

293
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,160
Captain Xing.

294
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,120
As a policeman

295
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,520
serving the people, you should

296
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,040
raise your ideological awareness.

297
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:54,920
Yes. Yes.

298
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,840
You should learn from Zhuo Wenjing.

299
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,120
She’s still performing a task.

300
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,120
She’s my idol.

301
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,560
Dr. Mi.

302
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,520
I think you should teach Captain Xing

303
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,280
ideological and moral lessons.

304
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,440
What lessons?

305
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,360
Really?

306
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,400
Do you want to be defeated?

307
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,000
Right.

308
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,360
It’s your wedding.

309
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,680
We will have a talent show for you.

310
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,840
Come on. Let’s compete.

311
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,320
No, please.

312
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,080
Have a show.

313
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,760
It’s a big day.

314
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,400
Don’t hesitate.

315
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,400
Great!

316
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,360
Thank you

317
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,600
for coming here.

318
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,600
It’s not a formal wedding.

319
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,960
So let’s have the party

320
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,640
a bit simple.

321
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,960
Welcome you to gather here.

322
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,000
I have to say,

323
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,960
we don’t receive money as a gift today.

324
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,240
You didn’t prepare any, right?

325
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,440
OK.

326
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,920
Please enjoy the party.

327
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,840
Be happy.

328
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,680
Great!

329
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,080
Great! Great!

330
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,000
The bridegroom-to-be,

331
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,520
will you say something?

332
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,720
Yes.

333
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,680
Come on. Say something.

334
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:06,920
Say it.

335
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,560
Great.

336
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,280
What a good speech!

337
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,200
It’s the first time I get married.

338
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,400
I’m a bit nervous.

339
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,200
Me too.

340
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,120
Hey, Captain Shu.

341
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,560
How many times do you want
to get married?

342
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,200
No. No. No.

343
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,520
No, I didn’t mean that.

344
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,920
I want to say,

345
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,440
I’m very grateful to Xia.

346
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,280
Because of her persistence,

347
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,960
I…

348
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,240
Think twice.

349
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,840
We still haven’t held the wedding.

350
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,440
I can regret at any time.

351
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,880
No. It’s not persistence,
but determination.

352
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,240
Because of her determination,

353
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,400
I got enough courage.

354
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,760
But Xia,

355
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,720
if there is

356
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,240
one more chance,

357
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,040
I would never

358
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,360
hesitate and avoid,

359
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,200
nor make you hurt.

360
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,200
I would tell you I love you

361
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,600
in the first place.

362
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,080
Meeting you

363
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,080
is the luckiest thing

364
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,320
in my lifetime.

365
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,000
Since I met you,

366
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,680
I want to become a better self.

367
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,240
Thank you, Xia.

368
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,040
OK. OK.

369
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,680
OK.

370
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,800
Kiss her.

371
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,600
Kiss her. Kiss her.

372
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,640
-Kiss her.
-Kiss her. Kiss her.

373
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,800
Great!

374
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,720
Are you OK?

375
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,440
They are really a good match.

376
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,600
Wenbo can hold

377
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,080
Xia’s enthusiasm

378
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,320
and can tolerate her.

379
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,040
They will certainly be happy.

380
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,560
I want to say one last word.

381
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,200
I especially want to share

382
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,960
my happiness with my best friend,

383
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,040
Mi Ka.

384
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,840
I hope

385
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:07,800
you are the next one

386
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,240
gaining happiness.

387
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,400
Xing Kelei.

388
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,880
Treat our Mi Ka well.

389
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,280
You know?

390
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,760
Yes.

391
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,720
Come on.

392
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,760
Everyone.

393
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,240
Come on.

394
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:21,960
Let’s toast.

395
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:22,840
Cheers.

396
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,880
Wait a minute.

397
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:24,880
Since we are drinking,

398
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,360
how about you two

399
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,840
drinking “cross-cupped wine”?

400
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,440
Cross?

401
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:33,200
“Cross-cupped wine”!

402
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,160
It’s your party.

403
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,600
I don’t mind.

404
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,640
Do you mind?

405
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,280
I…I don’t mind.

406
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:39,960
You are the boss.

407
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,280
OK.

408
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:42,920
Come on.

409
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,600
I don’t mind, either.

410
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,440
Come on.

411
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,840
“Cross-cupped wine”!

412
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,400
Come on.

413
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,160
Let’s drink together

414
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,960
with our Captain Shu.

415
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,080
Come on. Captain Shu.

416
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:56,880
Captain Shu.

417
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,640
Don’t restrain yourself.

418
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,680
Be happy.

419
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,320
Cheers. Cheers.

420
00:21:59,320 --> 00:21:59,880
Be careful.

421
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,840
Cheers. Cheers.

422
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,560
He drinks like a fish.

423
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,200
Listen.

424
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,600
Our mission for today

425
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,920
is making Captain Shu happy.

426
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:07,720
OK?

427
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,360
I will bottom up first.

428
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,000
Then you go one by one.

429
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:09,760
Time to revenge!

430
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,520
OK. OK.

431
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,240
Come on. Captain Shu.

432
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:11,960
Cheers.

433
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,400
-I’ll do it myself.
-Cheers.

434
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,280
You really can drink a lot.

435
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,880
OK. Cheers.

436
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,640
Revenge.

437
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,040
-Captain Shu.
-Cheers.

438
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,560
No. It’s a bit fast.

439
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,720
No. It’s not.

440
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,560
You’ve never thought it’s fast before.

441
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,120
How about this, Captain Shu?

442
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,120
I’d make a toast to you.

443
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,800
But you have to bottom it up.

444
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:27,920
Say it frankly.

445
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:28,880
What’s it?

446
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,480
Think it over.

447
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,160
Let’s wait and see

448
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,080
what he will say.

449
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,760
Many happy returns

450
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,720
of the day!

451
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,520
You are speaking like that!

452
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,920
Watch your mouth!

453
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:39,840
You are leading

454
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,880
my husband astray, aren’t you?

455
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,120
No.

456
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,560
It’s not a thing

457
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,480
with many happy

458
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,720
returning of the day!

459
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,280
I was just kidding.

460
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,480
Come on.

461
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,040
Let’s toast.

462
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,040
Cheers. Cheers.

463
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,200
The last one.

464
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,240
Enough. That’s it.

465
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,720
Don’t force my husband to drink.

466
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,560
You know?

467
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,520
Husband!

468
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,120
-So sweet!
-Our…

469
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,320
Our Captain Shu is now

470
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,760
cared and concerned by one.

471
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,800
Yes. He has a wife now.

472
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,560
So romantic. Let’s go.

473
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,160
Let’s go!

474
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,080
Just leave.

475
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:06,760
We are leaving, bro.

476
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,880
See you, bro.

477
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,680
Bye-bye.

478
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,400
Go ahead.

479
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,880
You may continue.

480
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,520
Come on. Please sit.

481
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,640
We are leaving. Please sit.

482
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,960
OK. Just go.

483
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,440
What boys!

484
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,920
Is the liquor that nice?

485
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,000
They’ve gone. You are still drinking.

486
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,400
Of course it’s nice.

487
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,840
My mom once told me

488
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,520
the liquor has a good message.

489
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,440
Your heart and my heart

490
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,880
have mutual affinity.

491
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,720
Now it becomes true.

492
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,880
Mutual affinity?

493
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,960
But he just wished you

494
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,160
many happy

495
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,920
returning of the day!

496
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,560
It’s just you,

497
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,720
not anybody else.

498
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,600
Why not?

499
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,280
Because my heart

500
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,680
only has mutual affinity with yours.

501
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,480
Xia.

502
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,080
I really want to thank you.

503
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,240
Thank you for

504
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,120
giving me a home

505
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,520
in this strange city.

506
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,680
I’ve given you a home.

507
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,200
But you still

508
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,840
call me Xia?

509
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:39,440
Darling.

510
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:48,880
Happy.

511
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,760
It’s good since you are happy.

512
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,040
Shu Wenbo just said

513
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,640
he loves Xia.

said you love me.

517
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,600
Do you love me?

518
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,120
You should ask

519
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,320
how much I love you.

00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,840
but you can’t reach me.

580
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,680
Fine.

581
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,960
In this case, I won’t worry about it.

582
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,240
Nobody else will like you except me.

583
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,880
That’s wrong.

584
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,640
You know what?

585
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,800
David, the guy

586
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,800
from our lab,

587
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,800
a handsome senior,

588
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,240
and a Taro from Japan,

589
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,280
they all like me.

590
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,040
Ask them

591
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,520
if they are shameless.

592
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,320
What do you mean?

593
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,560
Do you mean

594
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,200
nobody will like me

595
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,840
except you, do you?

596
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,480
Then why were you nervous?

597
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,600
I... I wasn’t… I…

598
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,440
You weren’t?

599
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,680
You know what?

600
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,800
I can see it.

601
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,960
When a person is nervous,

602
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,280
he will repeat one word.

603
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,080
Don’t worry.

604
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,000
Once I find they

605
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,040
have a bit feelings,

606
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,040
I will show them

607
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:56,840
the screensaver

608
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,120
of my phone.

609
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,920
I use the same photo.

610
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,160
Do you have two phones?

611
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,600
No.

612
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,040
I have three.

613
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,240
But I don’t use those two anymore.

614
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,400
I won’t add

615
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,720
any other females to friends, either.

616
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,080
That’s great!

617
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,600
White peach flavor, my favorite.

618
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,720
Yes.

619
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,400
You are not home.

620
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,440
So I drink it for you.

621
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,960
Are you missing me?

622
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,960
Seeing it makes me think of you.

623
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,480
I’m not a dead person.

624
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,280
It’s a deep creepy feeling!

625
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,360
I’ve become like this for you.

626
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,160
Will you give awards to me?

627
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,880
Award?

628
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,200
The award is,

629
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,320
next month,

630
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,840
I can return early.

631
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,640
Forget it.

632
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,640
No. No. No.

633
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,600
Really?

634
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,920
Yes.

635
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,160
There will be a Medical Charity Forum.

636
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,320
I will go back

637
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,080
with my advisor,

638
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,960
and do some translations.

639
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,360
What do you think?

640
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,880
Are you satisfied with this award?

641
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,560
Enough.

642
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,360
That’s amazing!

(Tiger Assault Team)

644
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,680
All are in storage?

645
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,640
Yes.

646
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,840
OK.

647
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,440
Go back and go to bed early.

648
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,040
Captain Shu.

649
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,080
Where are you going?

650
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,680
His wife is at home.

651
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,960
It’s the weekend.

652
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,040
He will surely go home for his wife.

653
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,880
You really talked too much.

654
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,560
Ouch!

655
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,680
Two more circles tomorrow.

656
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:37,760
Captain Shu!

657
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,840
You are directed against me.

658
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,960
I will tell Xia about it.

659
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:43,880
Captain Shu.

660
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,920
Captain Xing went to Changgang

661
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:46,680
for exchanging.

662
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,880
When will he come back?

663
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,240
He will be there

664
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,600
as an instructor for three months.

665
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,080
It’s been a while later.

666
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,080
Nice.

667
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,200
What’s wrong?

668
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,320
I’m not harsh enough to you?

669
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,200
Fine.

670
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,680
I will discuss about it
with Captain Xing.

671
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,520
Maybe he will help me

672
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,240
make a training plan.

673
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,800
No. Unnecessary.

674
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,720
Just go home for your wife.

675
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,480
Come on.

676
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,400
You go home first.

677
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,480
Your wife is waiting, Captain Shu.

678
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,360
I will call you then.

679
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,320
-Uh.
-There is no rush.

680
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,320
-Bye-bye, Captain Shu.
-Go, quickly.

681
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,960
Darling.

682
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,960
I’m back.

683
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,190
How could you make it such a mess?

684
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:58,920
Darling.

685
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,280
Let’s go to bed in the room.

686
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,320
You may catch a cold by sleeping here.

687
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:10,920
I’ve told you

688
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,000
not to wait for so long.

689
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,800
Go sleep in the room.

690
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,000
Comrade Xia.

691
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,360
I found you like telling lies now.

692
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,960
You are wrong by doing so.

693
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:34,760
Get down and walk yourself.

694
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,640
No.

695
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,000
Are you sure?

696
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:37,960
I won’t.

697
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:38,960
Then I will let go.

698
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,160
You dare not.

699
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,760
Hey, Shu Wenbo.

700
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,760
You even dare to trick me.

701
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,400
I’m not.

702
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,000
Believe it or not,

703
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,520
you will be punished

704
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,400
till you realize your fault.

705
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,120
I don’t believe it.

706
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,040
You don’t believe it?

707
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,960
No.

708
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,560
How could you

709
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,000
behave like a hoodlum?

710
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,800
You know how to cheat me now.

711
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,200
Where did you learn it from?

712
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,280
OK. Fine.

713
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,760
It’s my fault.

714
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,960
120.

715
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,200
121.

716
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,200
122.

717
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,120
12…

718
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,520
What’s for?

719
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,560
How can you be so stubborn?

720
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,800
One day’s missing
won’t cause any trouble.

721
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,280
I can’t miss the exercise

722
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,080
even for one day.

723
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,120
A good habit

724
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,280
is developed within 23 days.

725
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,560
Isn’t it within 21 days

726
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,840
to form a habit?

727
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,120
It’s about over 20 days anyway.

728
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,200
I think you should form

729
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,240
a habit.

730
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,400
Look what you have done

731
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,400
to the living room.

732
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,800
Thank you for helping me to tidy it up.

733
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,120
Xia.

734
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,120
Darling, please keep

735
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,960
taking care of me in the future.

736
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,200
Don’t affect my exercise.

737
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,360
Look.

738
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,920
Don’t affect your exercise?

What are you doing here?

743
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,320
I accompany my advisor on the forum.

744
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,240
I saw your name

745
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,640
on the list yesterday.

746
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,200
So I come here especially for you.

747
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,320
I’m here with Dr. Smith.

00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,480
Are you living here?

749
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,640
Thank you.

00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,440
How about you?

751
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,200
I’m living here, too.

752
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:38,720
Do you have any time?

753
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,680
Let’s have a cup of coffee.

-OK. Let’s go.

Your project

756
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,600
will end within half a year.

757
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,840
Will you continue in the next round?

758
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,960
Maybe

759
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,120
not.

760
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,880
Hold on.

761
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,760
I see the reason.

762
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,240
He’s so strict.

763
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,160
Please hold on. I will answer the phone.

764
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,480
Hello.

765
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,760
You should be training

766
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,760
at the moment, aren’t you?

767
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,560
There should be a break in the training.

768
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,080
I just pinched it out.

769
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,080
You are almost

770
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,960
at the hotel now, so…

771
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,360
You know what?

772
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,560
The picture is clearer

773
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,720
after you returning.

774
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,040
By the way,

775
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,240
the meeting will be over in three days.

776
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,920
Then my advisor will go to Shanghai

777
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,080
for his friends.

778
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,680
I don’t need to accompany him.

779
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,560
Then I can go for you.

780
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,800
Another three days?

781
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,000
It’s really a long time.

782
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,360
Sir,

783
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,280
please don’t act as a spoiled child, OK?

784
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,000
Tell me your location.

785
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,080
You finally come back.

786
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,160
But I didn’t go to pick you up.

787
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,560
It’s alright.

788
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,080
Make compensation after coming back.

789
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,800
OK. I can do anything.

790
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,360
Really? I will think it over.

791
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,560
I’m still with Yanshan.

792
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,880
There is a meeting later.

793
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,400
So I’m hanging up.

794
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,320
OK.

795
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,600
Bye-bye.

796
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,400
It’s great to have you work with me.

797
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,360
Me, too.

798
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,880
OK. See you then.

799
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:30,520
See you.

800
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,040
Thank you.

801
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,000
OK. Thank you. Bye-bye.

802
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,000
-Thank you.
-Bye-bye.

803
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,240
See you.

804
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,760
One. Two. Go!

805
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:06,800
Captain Xing.

806
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,720
They have a two-day holiday
this weekend.

807
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,360
You may take a break, too.

808
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,520
They’ve practiced for three months.

809
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,040
It’s time to take a break.

810
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,360
Did I hear it wrong?

811
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,360
Captain Xing agreed

812
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,240
to give us a holiday.

813
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:19,800
I thought…

814
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,960
I thought he wouldn’t take a break.

815
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,480
Did I say Dissolve?

816
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,960
You can’t bear it only for a while.

817
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,680
Climbing six ropes

818
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,640
of 6 meters in succession

819
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,480
is not the aim.

820
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,440
The purpose is making you

821
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,720
able to climb for 20m

822
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,440
or 30m once.

823
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,800
This is the basis.

824
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,400
Hope you can

825
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,480
practice more.

826
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,240
Take a break this weekend. Dissolve.

827
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,120
You agreed to accompany me one more day.

828
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,840
But you insist on going to Changgang.

829
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,280
Dr. Smith went to Shanghai.

830
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,800
I can’t keep

831
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,160
staying here with you.

832
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,280
What I should do is of course

833
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,680
going for Xing Kelei as a surprise.

834
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,760
One day in advance.

835
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,320
Surprise?

836
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,560
Where is Changgang?

837
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,560
Over 80km away from here.

838
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,200
It’s near the border.

839
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,200
He has a training exchange

840
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,040
there.

841
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,600
Aren’t you afraid
the surprise becomes a scare?

842
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,560
The man of my family won’t.

843
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,080
Your man?

844
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,680
Isn’t it too early to say so?

845
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,080
You want to marry him

846
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,120
so eagerly.

847
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,120
Yes.

848
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,400
Yes?

849
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,360
I’ll check the taxi.

850
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,880
Just in time. It’s coming.

851
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,800
Be careful on the way.

852
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,720
Don’t worry.

853
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,600
I’m leaving.

854
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,960
Bye-bye.

855
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,480
See you.

856
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,560
It still has 82km away from Chaozhou.
