Mr. Shao,

26
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,680
I am Lin Zhifeng, a chest surgeon.

27
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,280
You must know the two nurses.

28
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,880
They are Yang Yuan and Liu Yu.

Mr. Shao.

30
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,390
-Hello, Mr. Shao.
-We are heading for

31
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,440
Xinguan Village in Linan County.

32
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:56,080
It is seventy kilometers

33
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,360
from here.

34
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,160
We will drive for a distance

35
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,400
and then must walk to the destination.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,080
Do you have any problem?

37
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,200
No problem.

38
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,440
Have you checked the equipment?

39
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,480
We are ready.

40
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,880
We have prepared two bags and

Just don’t worry.

45
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:13,920

Yes.

57
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,920
Is there any problem with your hand?

58
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,400
It is okay now.

00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,680
We will continue

Beware of falling stones.

76
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,640
Okay.

77
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,480
Is the path accessible ahead?

78
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,240
No.

79
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,080
The mudflow

80
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,600
has intercepted

81
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,400
the path ahead. Only walk is possible.

82
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,880
Okay, thanks.

83
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,600
No car is accessible ahead.

84
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,320
Take your belongings and get off.

85
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,120
It’s a long way to walk.

86
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,360
Beware of falling stones overhead.

87
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,760
You must ensure your safety.

88
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,350
Okay.

89
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,160
Give it to me.

90
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,760
It is okay for me.

91
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,640
Come on.

92
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,880
Thanks.

93
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,280
Captain Xing,

94
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,320
let’s take a rest

95
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,840
and have some food.

96
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,360
Yes,

97
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,560
it is okay for us.

98
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,720
But the young nurses are tired.

99
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,160
I suggest we take a rest here.

100
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,400
This section is too dangerous.

101
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,160
Just hold on. We will get there soon.

102
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,160
Let’s hold on for a while.

103
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,200
Hold on for a while.

104
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:00,920
Let’s go.

105
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,280
-Go.

106
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,360
-Come on, follow me.
-Take care.

107
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,190
-It is okay.

108
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,180
Mind your steps.

109
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:05,900
Slow down.

110
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,800
Dear all,

111
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,840
I am heading for Linan

112
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,000
near Qiushan County.

113
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,280
It was badly hit by the earthquake.

114
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,400
(Linjia Village Primary School)
Many rescue teams

115
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,560
are working against time here.

116
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,760
As you can see now,

117
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,720
we have special police,

118
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,560
doctors and nurses

119
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,600
and many other volunteers

120
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,640
for the rescue work

121
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,320
behind me.

122
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,560
Hello, are you Captain Hu?

123
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,390
Yes.

124
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,400
I am from the Tiger Assault Team.

125
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,080
We are coming to rescue.

126
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,240
Thank you so much.

127
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,400
The aftershocks

128
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,920
caused the people taking shelter

129
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,440
in schools to be buried.

130
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,840
Everybody, form groups of three

131
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,080
and start rescuing right away.

132
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,480
Notify the firefighters immediately

133
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,800
if you find anyone buried.

134
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,640
Song,

135
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,680
remember to

136
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,280
video the delivery of victims.

137
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,640
Xia, take care.

138
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,360
I will go there.

139
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,320
Okay.

140
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:54,080
Uncle!

141
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,920
Girl!

142
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,520
Do you hear me?

143
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,840
Girl!

144
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,600
Everyone come here.

145
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,560
There is a victim here.

146
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,840
There is a girl. Come here.

147
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,440
Here! Hurry up!

148
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,160
Go.

149
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,000
-Come here.
-Hurry up!

150
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,360
-Here!
-Please come here.

151
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,280
-Somebody, please come here.

152
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:15,840
Take care.

153
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,640
Find a way

154
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,640
to move away the board on there and

155
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,600
cut the prefabricated board below.

156
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,240
Come on, excuse me.

157
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,160
Find the load-bearing point.

158
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,120
Take care.

159
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,800
-What’s wrong with the victim now?
-Take care. Take care.

160
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,000
Can you please

161
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,840
introduce the rescue measures?

162
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,920
Whatever the solution may be,

163
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,360
please make way first.

164
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,200
The No. 1 priority of interview

165
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,080
is not to affect the rescue work.

166
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,240
But you are also a journalist.

167
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,280
Am I making an Interview now?

168
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,680
Go. Let’s withdraw first.

169
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,890
-Okay, irrelevant people out of here!
-Make way.

170
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,690
-Girl.
-Come on.

171
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,800
Girl, hold on.

172
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:37,650
Hold on.

173
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,440
You two

174
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,240
go and lift it up.

175
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,080
You come here.

176
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,000
There, there, there.

177
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,660
Take care.

178
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:42,200
Come on.

179
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,200
Lift it up. Lift it up.

180
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,720

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,320
Come on. Three.

182
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,440
One, two, three.

183
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,160
Go.

184
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,160
Back out. Back, back, back.

185
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,600
Lift it up, one, two.

186
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,360
Handle with care.

187
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,320
Give him a hand. Hurry up.

188
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,320
Come on, this one.

189
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,240
Come on, hurry up!

190
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,360
One, two, three.

191
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,200
Take care.

192
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,670
Hold on.

193
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,400
Girl.

194
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,640
Come on, hurry up!

195
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,490
Girl, take care.

196
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,120
-Take care. Take care.
-Handle with care.

197
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,830
Hold on.

198
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,720
One, two, three.

199
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,080
Excuse me.

200
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,440
Handle with care.

201
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,520
Stretcher, please.

202
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,640
Pliers!

203
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,480
Here you are. The pliers!

204
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,640
Take care.

205
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,680
The stretcher is here.

206
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,520
Handle with care.

207
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,880
Girl, don’t be scared. Come on.

208
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,720
-Pay attention to your legs, girl.
-Uncle, it hurts.

209
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,480
Be strong.

210
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,960
Girl, hold on.

211
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,720
Come on, handle with care.

212
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,880
Come on. Pay attention to her legs.
Take care.

213
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,920
Stretcher, please.

214
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,040
Take care.

215
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,040
Come on. Take care.

216
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,080
Uncle, thank you for saving me.

217
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,200
You are the best.

218
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,200
Come on. Hurry up.

219
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,800
Okay, make way, please.

220
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,520
Take care.

221
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,520
Take it over.

222
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,080
-Just take it over.
-Make way, please.

223
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,040
Come on.

224
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,320
Dear folks, there are still aftershocks.

225
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,640
The buildings are instable.

226
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,680
Please don’t stay at home.

227
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,560
Go to an open space with us.

228
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,120
Folks,

229
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,320
there are still aftershocks.

230
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,360
The buildings are instable.

231
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,240
Please don’t stay at home.

232
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,360
Go to an open space with us.

233
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,720
Folks,

234
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,250
there are

235
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:19,980
-Governor.
-still aftershocks.

236
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,090
-There isn’t any
-The buildings

237
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:21,920
-open space near here
-are instable.

238
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,680
suitable for a tent.

239
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,540
-It is close to mountains here
-Please don’t stay at home.

240
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,080
-and plains are limited.
-Let’s go to an open and flat space.

241
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,000
Bali Hope Primary School

242
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,120
has a big playground.

243
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,920
Let’s go and have a look.

244
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,000
If it is possible,

245
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,520
we can set up tents there.

246
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,440
(For Relief Only)

247
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,880
Many buildings in the village

248
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,440
are cracked but haven’t collapsed.

249
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,280
The villagers are still in there.

250
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,560
We need more hands now

251
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,440
to withdraw them

252
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,960
to the temporary aid station.

253
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,160
Okay, I will ask for hands.

254
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,040
Okay.

255
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,160
Captain Shu,

256
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,280
I need your hand.

257
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,240
Go ahead.

258
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,080
Frankly,

259
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,440
most of the victims

260
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,760
were caused

261
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,720
by the aftershocks.

262
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,720
So we want to produce

263
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,280
a video

264
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,040
and tell everybody

265
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,160
that many buildings’ structures

266
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,720
have been damaged by the earthquake

267
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,400
and it is very dangerous.

268
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,640
We hope to call upon all

269
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,400
to go outdoors.

270
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,760
We will produce it around here

271
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,080
and won’t delay your rescue work,

272
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,680
okay?

273
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,410
Okay.

274
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,160
Thanks!

275
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,200
Pack them up.

276
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,760
Is it fully charged?

277
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,680
Captain Xing, what are you looking at?

278
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,240
I am checking the mountain cracks.

279
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,760
The longitudinal ones are okay

280
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,560
but the cross cracks

281
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,680
may cause landslides easily.

282
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,720
Also check the brooks on the mountain.

283
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,160
If the water flow stops suddenly,

284
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,280
there may be cracks

285
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:38,920
somewhere

286
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,920
that take in the flowing water.

287
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,840
Exhale.

288
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:42,840
Inhale.

289
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,080
Okay, hold your breath.

290
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,560
Okay.

291
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,200
There are some murmurs of lungs.

292
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,120
The lower respiratory tract

293
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,200
may have been infected.

294
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,280
The blood pressure is basically normal.

295
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,360
But the diastolic pressure is still low.

296
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,840
What did you have for today?

297
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,000
The building collapsed

298
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,920
and all foods were buried.

299
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,440
I ate some sweet potatoes yesterday

300
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,240
but nothing today.

301
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,280
I have a bag of pilot biscuits here.

302
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,040
Thank you. Thanks!

303
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,480
The water supply system

304
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,320
must have failed, right?

305
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,560
So I am afraid

306
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,600
the water sources nearby

307
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,400
have also been polluted.

308
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,480
We have brought some purifying tablets

309
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,680
and teach your people to use them.

310
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,360
Okay.

311
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,720
Follow Dr. Shao now.

312
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,640
-Go and help. Hurry up.
-Just follow me.

313
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,560
-Over there.
-Okay.

314
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,160
There.

315
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:29,960
Governor,

316
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,000
how about our village’s grains?

317
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,200
Most houses in the village collapsed

318
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,960
and all grains were buried.

319
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,480
Those whose houses haven’t collapsed

320
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,360
have food

321
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,200
but it is not enough for so many people.

322
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:41,880
Luo Ting.

323
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,470
Yes.

324
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,560
Distribute some grains to all.

325
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,600
Yes.

326
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,080
This way.

327
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:53,820
Luo Ting.

328
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:54,920
It is leaking.

329
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,360
No.

330
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,840
My husband hasn’t come back.

331
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,240
I must wait for him here.

332
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,280
Madam, just follow us first.

333
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,760
We have tents and a temporary

334
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,080
rescue station at the village entry.

335
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,000
I will notify you immediately

336
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,120
once your husband returns,

337
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,400
okay?

338
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,640
My husband is ill

339
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,960
and he isn’t quick-witted enough.

340
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,480
He usually forgets to carry

341
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,200
the cell phone for a trip outside.

342
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,640
He only remembers the way back home.

343
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,480
No.

344
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,360
Madam,

345
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,680
we will contact with all rescue stations

346
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,600
to look for him together.

347
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,760
Don’t worry, okay?

348
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,440
My house hasn’t collapsed. No.

349
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,920
I must wait for him here.

350
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,300
Just go and do your work.

351
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:38,960
Let me have a try.

352
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,320
Okay.

353
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,240
Madam, I have an idea.

354
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,120
Please

355
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,400
hold your husband’s photo in hand and

356
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,000
I will produce a video in search of him.

357
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,200
In this way, all the rescue teams

358
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:48,830
and liaison stations

359
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,120
can help you look for him together.

360
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,760
Who are you?

361
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,000
I am a journalist

362
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,400
and I can help you convey a message.

363
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,400
Many people

364
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,320
will see it this way.

365
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,560
Even if you wait for him here,

366
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,560
he may not necessarily

367
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,560
walk back by himself.

368
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,080
All roads are blocked by the earthquake.

369
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,720
Let’s look for him together.

370
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,080
People have greater powers together

371
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,560
and the probability is higher, okay?

372
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,760
Yes.

373
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,920
Okay.

374
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,200
Let’s go out first.

375
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:10,920
Come on, madam.

376
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,720
Just go out.

377
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,640
I will help you find him.

378
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,400
Will he come back?

379
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:14,290
-Yes.

380
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,360
It starts again.

381
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,760
Madam.

382
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,920
Hurry up!

383
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,000
Madam.

384
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:19,920
Take care!

385
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,800
Run away.

386
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,360
-Hurry up!
Come on, hurry up!

387
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,240
Take care, Xia.

388
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,160
Xia, Xia, Xia.

389
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,000
Hurry up!

390
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,040
-Are you okay?

391
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,880
I am okay.

392
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,560
Just take her to the rescue station.

393
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,640
There must be people in there.

394
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,600
Everybody, come with me.

395
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,440
Shu Wenbo!

396
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,730
-Take care.
-My husband can’t find the way back.

397
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,600
My husband can’t find the way back.

398
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,960
-What can I do?
-Madam.

399
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,020
(Relief Materials: Iodine)
Yes, handle with care

400
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,040
as they are all fragile.

401
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,670
Okay.

402
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,360
Take care.

403
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,440
Handle with care.

404
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,560
The box!

405
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,840
Put it here.

406
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,400
Yes. Put it here too.

407
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,700
Handle with care.

408
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,760
Handle with care. Handle with care.

409
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,400
Chen Tao, what is in it?

410
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,280
Iodine, gauze and antibiotic.

411
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,440
Also thrombin.

412
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,800
The warehouse is full.

413
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,080
Where to keep these medicines?

414
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,200
Put them there, in the white tent.

415
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,520
The tent where the doctors rest.

416
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,960
-Okay.
-Okay, okay.

417
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,880
Come on. Do it together.

418
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,840
-One, two, three.

419
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,680
Come on.

420
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,440
Come. Do it together.

421
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,280
One, two, three, go.

422
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,520
Handle with care.

423
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,720
Yao, Yao.

424
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,880
Wei Lan.

425
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,440
Thank you!

426
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,760
You are welcome.

427
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,200
Thanks.

428
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,240
My husband is Liu Aiguo.

429
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,800
He is 82 years old.

430
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,160
He left home

431
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,560
in a brown coat

432
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,880
and a pair of black pants.

433
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,360
Six years ago,

434
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,840
he started to suffer

435
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,560
a disease called… Alzheimers.

436
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,040
I mean the senile dementia.

437
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,800
He is sometimes sober

438
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,400
but sometimes not.

439
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,400
I hope anyone who sees him

440
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,920
can tell him

441
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,800
I am his wife

442
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,520
Zhang Guihua

443
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,440
and I have prepared the food for him.

444
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,960
Ask him to come back for a meal.

445
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,880
Captain Xing.

446
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:13,800
We have checked it.

447
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,800
Nothing abnormal.

448
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,240
Okay.

449
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,440
My husband is Liu Aiguo.

450
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,080
He is 82 years old.

451
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,680
He left home

452
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,840
in a brown coat

453
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,520
and a pair of black pants.

454
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,280
Six years ago,

455
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,120
he started to suffer

456
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,100
-a disease called… Alzheimers.
-Xia!

457
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,640
I mean the senile dementia.

458
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,810
-We have biscuits.
-He is sometimes sober

459
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,150
I have taken some for you.

460
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,840
I will put some here.

461
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,850
-I have to leave first.
-I hope anyone who sees him

462
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,560
can tell him

463
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,840
I am his wife

464
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,120
Zhang Guihua

465
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,290
-and I have prepared the food for him.
-I know you don’t expect to see me.

466
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,520
-Ask him to come back for a meal.
-But I must admit

467
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,440
my mistake.

468
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,840
I was too arbitrary

469
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:04,760
and discretionary

470
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,280
to misunderstand you last time.

471
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,400
I not only misunderstood you,

472
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,040
but also looked down upon you.

473
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,070
You can rely on your specialty

474
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,000
-to settle anything
-if you can

475
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,160
-that I can’t settle.
-see it,

476
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,880
just come back right away.

477
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,960
You are an excellent journalist.

478
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,200
Sorry.

479
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,160
Captain Shu!

480
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,280
Why did he come here?

481
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,400
I saw him

482
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,600
talking to you for long.

483
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,320
He didn’t call me at all.

484
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,640
Maybe he thought

485
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,280
you didn’t wish to see him.

486
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,080
No, I had earphones on.

487
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,400
I couldn’t hear it.

488
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,680
Do you miss anything?

489
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,000
No.

490
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,880
All people are here. Let’s set out.

491
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,160
Okay.

492
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,560
Go. There.

493
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,120
There is no landslide nearby.

494
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,760
It seems things aren’t very bad.

495
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,200
Is there anyone

496
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,160
who needs treatment?

497
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,360
Do you have a medical team?

498
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,520
We are doctors.

499
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,320
I am from the local clinic.

500
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,480
We have a victim

501
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,160
whose conditions seem to be worsening.

502
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,320
Please go and check.

503
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,920
Go.

504
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:04,960
Here.

505
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,720
Give me a pair of gloves.

506
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,490
Okay.

507
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,080
Wait for me out there.

508
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,080
Is he awake?

509
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,040
Yes.

510
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,240
When was he wounded?

511
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,640
Two days ago.

512
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,800
In the beginning,

513
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,960
the wound wasn’t serious

514
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,520
and so we applied medicines
and bandaged it.

515
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,040
But he started to develop a fever

516
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,120
and sweat yesterday.

517
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,360
He also said he was painful.

518
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,040
Not even pain killer injections worked.

519
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,320
I am afraid it is worsening.

520
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,040
The sclera is getting yellowish.

521
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,080
Where is the wound?

522
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,240
Right thigh.

523
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,000
Can I examine it?

524
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:48,820
Yes.

525
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:50,770
Right thigh.

526
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,280
Already treated?

527
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,360
Yes.

528
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,880
Answer me.

529
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,480
Did you have any hematuria

530
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,920
these two days?

531
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,680
Yes?

532
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,520
Come out with me, please.

533
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,440
Don’t touch them.

534
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,720
It is emphysematous gangrene.

535
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,080
All the gauzes used on him

536
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,640
must be burned.

537
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,280
All the medical devices in contact

538
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,000
with him must be deeply disinfected

539
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,720
and properly marked.

540
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,600
Okay.

541
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,120
The patient

542
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,080
is severely dehydrated

543
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,920
and shows symptoms of toxemia.

544
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,160
I must operate on him right away

545
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,320
and cut off

546
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,560
the bad flesh on his thigh.

547
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,520
Otherwise,

548
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,920
both his leg and his life will be lost.

549
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:35,960
Got it.

550
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,360
Do you know what are needed
for an operation?

551
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,120
Yes.

552
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,080
In the absence of any 3%

553
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,240
hydrogen peroxide solution,

554
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,360
use 1:4000 potassium
permanganate solution

555
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,400
as a substitute.

556
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,480
Moreover,

557
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,800
don’t use our materials.

558
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,840
Our materials will be

559
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,760
used for emergencies later on.

560
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:47,800
Use the materials of the clinic

561
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,600
if possible.

562
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,720
Have you got everything needed?

563
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,440
Yes.

564
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,210
Go and take them.

565
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,050
Okay, follow me.

566
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:46,180
(Infected zone. No entry)

567
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,920
We have notified

568
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,580
the command center

569
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,360
and someone will arrive soon

570
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,040
to clean it up.

571
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,730
Okay.

572
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,240
The patient has been transferred

573
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,240
to another isolated room.

574
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,320
His wound must be left open.

575
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,960
We have installed a drainage tube

576
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,080
to drain the blood pus.

577
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,880
You must pay close attention to

578
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,680
his wound

579
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,640
and flush it

580
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,280
once every half an hour.

581
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,440
Give him injections of

582
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,840
penicillin if necessary.

583
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,170
-Okay.
-After the path is cleared,

584
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,000
rush him to the rear the soonest

585
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,400
for subsequent treatment and test.

586
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,440
Okay.

587
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,840
You also know his illness conditions.

588
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,200
Take care and protect yourself.

589
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,240
Okay, I see.

590
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,040
We will leave first.

591
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,520
-Thanks.

592
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,480
It is so stuffy today.

593
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It must be raining nearby.

594
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,040
If the rainwater flows here,

595
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,680
landslides will occur easily.

596
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,040
We must hurry up.

597
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,520
Come on. Hurry up.

598
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,120
Hurry up!

599
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,120
Come on, follow me closely.

600
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,360
The earthquake caused

601
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,800
a high-level dammed lake between

602
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,560
Baishi Mountain and Fang Mountain.

603
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,200
According to meteorological forecast,

604
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,160
there will be

605
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,680
continuous strong rainfalls in this area

606
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,240
and the water level of the dammed lake

607
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,560
will continue to rise
until its bank breaks.

608
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,680
In that case, the ten-plus villages

609
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,400
on the way from here

610
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,560
to Qiushan County

611
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,720
will be flooded,

612
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:08,840
including

613
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,480
one newly-repaired path

614
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,880
leading to the epicenter.

615
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,120
Is there a solution?

616
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,240
The irrigation experts have seen it.

617
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,000
They believe

618
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,080
blasting can be done at this place

619
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,920
for flood discharge

620
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,560
and to allow the flood

621
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,630
(Earthquake-hit Area’s Basic Conditions)
to flow into Qipan River.

622
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,880
This is the solution

623
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,040
to minimize the losses.

624
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,520
How many villages

625
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,120
will be affected by the flood discharge?

626
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,160
Six villages, including

627
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,680
Xinguan Village, Wangliu Village

628
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,160
Xiatang Village, Liwan Village

629
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,240
Guolin Village, Shaxi Village.

630
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,400
They need to withdraw upstream

631
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,360
to Nanyang Town

632
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,440
at an altitude of

633
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,600
over 2,500 meters.

634
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,400
Is there a rescue team in there?

635
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,520
Yes.

636
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,840
Contact the rescue team

637
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,400
to assist the local inhabitants

638
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,240
to withdraw uphill.

639
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,040
Yes.

640
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,800
Many houses collapsed at our village.

641
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,320
Luckily it was in the afternoon

642
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,200
when most of our people

643
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,040
were working in the field and not hurt.

644
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,040
Most of them managed

645
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,240
to evacuate

646
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,360
but some old villagers

647
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,560
were left behind.

648
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,920
I have gathered them here

649
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,520
on this grain-sunning ground

650
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,600
and erected a few

651
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,760
sheds as their shelter.

652
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,120
Okay.

653
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,020
Li Nian,

654
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,920
take Mr. Shao there for a look.

655
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:21,960
Okay.

656
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,520
Luo Ting.

657
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,480
Make a report on the radio.

658
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,240
Okay.

659
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,000
It seems it is going to rain again.

660
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,240
Commander.

661
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,600
It is confirmed six rescue teams

662
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,240
are near these villages, including

663
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,320
A2, A3, A5

664
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,840
A8, A9 and A10.

665
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,160
How long will it take for the discharge?

666
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,920
According to the forecast rainfall,

667
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,720
it shall not be over 5 hours.

668
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,720
We recommend a discharge time

669
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,880
not later than 3:00 PM.

670
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,200
Contact right away.

671
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,320
Notify them

672
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,080
the flood discharge time

673
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,880
is half past two in the afternoon.

674
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,080
Yes.

675
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,880
Calling A2, calling A2.

676

It is okay now.

695
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,400
-Neither inflammation nor pus.
-It is much better now.

696
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,920
Much better. Come on, give me five.

697
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,520
The medicine has been changed.

698
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,400
It is okay now, sir.

699
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,720
Just have a rest.

700
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,040
Take care.

701
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,800
Okay.

702
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,840
Come on, excuse me.

703
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,160
Excuse me. Please!

704
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,240
Face the head in this direction.

705
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,280
What’s up?

706
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,040
He fell on a slippery mountain road,

707
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,360
had his stomach hit on a rock

708
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,840
and fainted away.

709
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,200
No breath

710
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
and no pulse.

711
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:28,800
Stomach?

712
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,800
Yes.

713
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,040
There is hemorrhage in the abdomen.

714
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,480
Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation.

715
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,640
Open the intravenous access;

716
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,640
inject 80mg dopamine;

717
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,880
expand blood capacity;

718
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,400
and prepare for defibrillation.

719
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,120
Mr. Shao, the battery of

720
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:43,840
the automatic in-vitro defibrillator

721
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,920
is running out of power.

722
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,200
Out of power now?

723
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,680
Whose pickup is it out there?

724
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,000
Whose pickup is that?

725
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,520
Captain Xing.

726
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,840
Excuse me!

727
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,200
200 joules.

728
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,440
Ready for electric shock.

729
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,840
Charge. Move the bed.

730
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,280
Ready?

731
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,400
Continue.

732
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:28,760
Again.

733
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,480
Charge.

734
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,600
Move the bed.

735
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,480
Continue.

736
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,160
Pulse and breath resumed.

737
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,280
Well done!

738
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,440
He is back to life.

739
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,880
Great job!

740
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,400
Mr. Shao,

741
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,840
his blood pressure is still very low.

742
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,320
His abdomen is still bleeding.

743
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,200
If we can’t find the bleeding point,

744
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:56,960
he won’t hold on for long.

745
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,000
Is there a clinic at the village?

746
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,040
It collapsed.

747
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,600
Is his relative here?

748
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,880
Do you know his blood type?

749
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,240
I am his elder brother.
His blood type is B.

750
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,260
Type B?

751
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:05,780
Type B.

752
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,460
Are you sure?

753
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,080
Yes.

754
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,560
Attention, everybody.

755
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,800
We will have an operation here

756
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,960
and we need blood transfusion.

757
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,120
Is there anyone

758
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,640
whose blood type is B?

759
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,840
We need a blood donator here,

760
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,470
okay?

761
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,080
I have Type B blood. I wish to donate.

762
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,200
My blood type seems to be B.

763
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,130
I wish too.

764
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,080
-Okay.
-My blood type is also B.

765
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:20,730
I wish to donate too.

766
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:23,640
Mine is also B. I wish too.

767
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,800
We all have Blood Type B.

768
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,520
I wish too.

769
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,320
They don’t seem to know

770
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,640
their blood type exactly.

771
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,240
It will be a trouble
if they get it wrong.

772
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,120
I am sure my blood type is B.

773
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,000
I am sure my blood type is B too.

774
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,080
Use our bloods.

775
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,120
Extract 300ml bloods each.

776
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:40,960
Prepare for cross blood matching.

777
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:41,940
-Okay.

778
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:42,600
Wait a minute.

779
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,840
The hygienic conditions are bad here.

780
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,080
What if there is any infection?

781
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,320
We have no time to consider it now.

782
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,440
We need to find

783
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,100
his bleeding point now

784
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:48,640
and stop it.

785
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,720
This is his only chance of survival.

786
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,600
Er…

787
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,840
I will be the operator. Dr. Lin,

788
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:52,840
you just assist me.

789
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:53,880
If any problem really happens,

790
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:54,720
I will take the responsibility.

791
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,600
Prepare for the operation.

792
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,520
Yes.

793
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,720
Can we dispatch a helicopter

794
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,240
to call for evacuation above?

795
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,680
The weather conditions now

796
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,400
are not suitable for it.

797
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,200
No helicopter can fly there.

798
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,840
Calling A3, calling A3.

799
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,440
This is the command center.

800
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,840
Have you reached A8?

801
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,000
Please reply upon receipt.

802
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,320
Yes.

803
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,040
A3 has notified A8 to evacuate.

804
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,840
Great job.

805
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,560
Captain Xing.

806
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,880
Excuse me!

807
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,240
Captain Xing.

808
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,600
Just received a notice from A3.

809
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,640
The earthquake generated

810
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,800
a high-level dammed lake.

811
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,200
The flood will be discharged in 3 hours.

812
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,520
The command center just sent
an emergency order

813
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,520
for us to evacuate

814
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,600
to Nanyang Town

815
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,840
at an altitude of over 2,500m.

816
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,200
Mr. Shao,

817
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,600
the flood will be discharged

818
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,160
in three hours.

819
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,600
We must evacuate right away.

820
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,520
My operation

821
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,680
will start right away.

822
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,600
He will die if I give up.

823
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,760
You said there were still 3 hours

824
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,280
before the discharge.

825
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,960
I will finish it
in two and a half hours.

826
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,280
It takes one hour for us

827
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:14,960
to leave the flood discharge area.

828
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,200
We don’t have time in that case.

829
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,640
Leave with others and I will

830
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,840
perform the operation with them.

831
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,160
We will evacuate together after it.

832
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,400
You can’t leave here

833
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,000
in just half an hour with him.

834
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,000
I am a doctor.

835
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,280
My duty is saving people.

836
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,120
I am a policeman.

837
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,800
My duty is taking you out of here.

838
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,480
He will die on the way if we leave now.

839
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,600
You can’t risk the life of all

840
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,160
just for him alone.

841
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,560
One and a half hours.

842
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,280
I will finish the operation
in one and a half hours.

843
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,200
One and a half hours later,

844
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,240
I will come again.

845
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,760
This path leads southward

846
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,600
directly to Nanyang Town.

847
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,960
Just evacuate with all the villagers.

848
00:30:59,160 --> 00:30:59,800
Okay.

849
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,400
When you get there,

850
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,200
contact with the command center

851
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:01,830
and see if they can

852
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:02,520
delay the flood discharge time.

853
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,800
Yes.

854
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,320
Folks, listen to me.

855
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,840
For flood discharge,

856
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,000
we need to evacuate to

857
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,080
Nanyang Town right now.

858
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:09,920
You have five minutes

859
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,920
to pack up

860
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,000
all the things

861
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,160
you need urgently, preferably

862
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,320
your umbrella and rain gears, okay?

863
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,320
Okay!

864
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:16,880
Okay, let’s go

865
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,490
in that direction now.

866
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,080
Hurry up!

867
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,600
Hurry up, everybody.

868
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,320
Li Nian.

869
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,590
Stay behind with me

870
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,440
until they are over.

871
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,620
Go, go.

872
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,000
Take care! Come on.

873
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,080
Take care!

874
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,320
Sorry.

875
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,560
Sit stably.

876
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,080
It is raining now!

877
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,920
It started out of expectation indeed.

878
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:41,720
Report!

879
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,320
Most people of Xinguan Village

880
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,440
have evacuated towards Nanyang Town.

881
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,720
But a critically-ill patient

882
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,600
is having an operation.

883
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,760
Two special policemen

884
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,600
and five medical personnel

885
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,240
are still in Xinguan Village.

886
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,080
A8 asks

887
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,040
if it is possible

888
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,320
to delay the flood discharging time.

889
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,280
Ask them

890
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,720
how long it will take
for the evacuation.

891
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,160
We have no time.

892
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,280
The raining area is becoming bigger

893
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,720
and the water level is rising

894
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,480
faster than we expected. I am afraid we

895
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,440
have to discharge ahead of schedule.

896
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,560
Notify all remaining people of A8

897
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,480
to evacuate right away. Hurry up!

898
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,520
Yes.

899
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,880
The operation is completed.

900
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,480
Report!

901
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,720
All A8 personnel have evacuated

902
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,000
and arrived at the safe place.

903
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,480
Notify them

904
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,440
to start blasting.

905
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,480
Yes.

906
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:22,340
(Nanyang Town)

907
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,800
Take care. Take care.

908
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,840
Take care.

909
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,520
Come on, comrades, take care.

910
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,840
I am sorry.

911
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,000
Okay, take care.

912
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,840
Take care.

913
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,880
Xia, I will go there and check first.

914
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,880
Okay.

915
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,120
You are fully soaked on this side.

916
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,160
Dry it.

917
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,320
No. I am too dirty all over.

918
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,480
Your scarf will be polluted.

919
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,600
It doesn’t matter. Just dry it.

920
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,680
Okay, thanks!

921
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,440
In the evening
when you gave me the biscuits…

922
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,160
Captain Shu, Captain Shu,

923
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,400
someone called

924
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,560
and claimed to have found

925
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,080
Zhang Guihua’s husband.

926
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,600
Got it. Where is he?

927
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,240
He has been delivered to the temporary

928
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,120
rescue station at Mingyue Village.

929
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,840
Okay, I will get there soon.

930
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:44,790
Mingyue Village shouldn’t

931
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,320
be far from here, right?

932
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:45,860
Let’s go.

933
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,600
Go.

934
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,600
Come on. Give me the key.

935
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,620
(Temporary Gathering Place)
There is no problem here now.

936
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,370
All materials are in place.

937
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,960
Just have a good rest.

938
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,840
You don’t need to worry about others.

939
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,080
Is there a new task?

940
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,240
The miners have been trapped

941
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,120
in the Pingxiang Mine for long.

942
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,360
I will go and check it with them.

943
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,520
Mr. Shao.

944
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,800
How are things going on now?

945
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,200
Five to six victims

946
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,000
are in a bad condition.

947
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,800
I must rush them back to the base camp

948
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,360
for further treatment.

949
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,360
The mine

950
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,840
has some miners trapped

951
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:00,840
for a few days

952
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:01,880
and doctors are needed there.

953
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,480
I want to go there with Captain Xing.

954
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,600
Just go there with Dr. Lin.

955
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,360
It is enough for me to

956
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,400
deliver the victims back alone.

957
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,810
Okay.

958
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,720
Mr. Shao, I will arrange the car

959
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,480
to deliver you back first.

960
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,400
Thanks!

961
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,680
Take good care of her.

962
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,600
Dear,

963
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,320
where have you been?

964
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,400
Why did you come back so late?

965
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,280
You really made me so worried.

966
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,520
Come on, have a look.

967
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,800
I… I…

968
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,760
I bought

969
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,760
your favorite apples for you.

970
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,960
You… Why are you crying?

971
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,680
I am happy.

972
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,840
Who made you unhappy?

973
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,440
I am happy.

974
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,960
You should smile if you are happy.

975
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,000
Just smile.

976
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,080
I enjoy your smiles.

977
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,880
You look so pretty in smiles.

978
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,080
I will smile.

979
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,960
This apple

980
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,840
is big and red.

981
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,200
Just take it to your office tomorrow.

982
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,440
I will certainly take it with me.

983
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,960
Come back earlier next time.

984
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,880
I am hungry.

985
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,720
Okay. Okay.

986
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,880
It feels so great

987
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,000
to grow old

988
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,840
hand in hand like this.

989
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:52,960
Is it here?

990
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,160
Yes, here.

991
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:02,800
Come on, madam.

992
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,080
Take care!

993
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,000
Come on, sir!

994
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:06,840
-Take care.
-Xia.

995
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:07,760
Xia.

996
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,050
Find a settlement for them.

997
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,200
-Okay.
-I must go to the command office.

998
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:10,840
-Okay.

999
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:11,620
-Madam.
-Sir.

1000
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,600
Please wait for me.

1001
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,920
-Wait.
-Madam.

1002
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,520
Come on, madam!

1003
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,410
Take care.

1004
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,920
-Take care.
-Okay.

1005
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,500
(Earthquake Relief)

1006
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,800
Zhang, have a good rest.

1007
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,760
We are here.

1008
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,440
Keyao!

1009
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,240
You have done a good job.

1010
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,880
But you’d better be stronger

1011
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,360
if you come to rescue next time.

1012
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,360
Cover it.

1013
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,560
Thanks!

1014
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,560
You will be okay after the sleep.

1015
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,960
You are still here.

1016
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,960
Haven’t gone back?

1017
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,560
What’s up? Caught a cold?

1018
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,600
I may have caught a cold

1019
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,760
on the way back.

1020
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,680
Shall I prepare some medicines for you?

1021
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,280
Okay, thanks!

1022
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,400
Take it as it is still hot.

1023
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:12,720
Mr. Shao.

1024
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,920
A patient has a very poor condition.

1025
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,680
Please go and check it.

1026
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,240
Okay, I will be there right away.

1027
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,960
Shu Wenbo.

1028
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,200
What’s up?

1029
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,440
You were soaked in water just now.

1030
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,880
Ginger tea, to dispel cold.

1031
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,920
Thank you!

1032
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,000
Drink it as it is still warm.

1033
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,160
It doesn’t work if it is cold.

1034
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,480
Okay.

1035
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,200
Thanks!

1036
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,720
Have you found a settlement for them?

1037
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:11,920
Yes.

1038
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,720
They are having a rest now.

1039
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,280
Just now, her husband insisted on

1040
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,640
eating oil-covered noodles

1041
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,920
like a child.

1042
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,360
Nobody could comfort him.

1043
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,840
She settled the problem

1044
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,640
in just two minutes.

1045
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,760
How do you think about it?

1046
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,520
Love is really a very strange thing

1047
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,000
as the lover is just your inborn master.

1048
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,840
Her husband forgot

1049
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,520
many things and people

1050
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,240
after he fell ill.

1051
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,560
He only remembers

1052
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,800
his lover is Zhang Guihua.

1053
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,360
The people of the rescue station

1054
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,880
of Mingyue Village told me

1055
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,560
he had said to all people

1056
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,040
his wife is Zhang Guihua

1057
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,280
before I arrived.

1058
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,880
He kept looking for her.

1059
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,680
Even if he forgets the whole world,

1060
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,040
he can’t forget his lover.

1061
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,120
Exactly!

1062
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,920
Sit down.

1063
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,520
Okay.

1064
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,040
I have a question for you.

1065
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,080
Go ahead.

1066
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,480
What did you say

1067
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,520
that night

1068
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,800
when you delivered biscuits to me?

1069
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,280
I was wearing earphones and editing

1070
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,000
the video clips and heard nothing.

1071
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,000
I raised my head
and found you were away.

1072
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,400
I see.

1073
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,200
What on earth did you say then?

1074
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,520
I went there

1075
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,360
to say sorry to you.

1076
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,640
I thought you had refused to talk to me

1077
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,200
because you were angry.

1078
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,800
And then you left?

1079
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:34,960
Er…

1080
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,520
You weren’t sincere at all

1081
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,440
to apologize to me.

1082
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,720
Listen,

1083
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,280
I will give you another chance.

1084
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,880
Do it again.

1085
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,560
Ruan Qingxia,

1086
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,320
I was too arbitrary previously

1087
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,440
and misunderstood you.

1088
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,480
The rescue work

1089
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,760
proves your real abilities.

1090
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,840
I am so sorry.

1091
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,880
Today, I will apologize to you formally.

1092
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,760
I am sorry.

1093
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,840
I will accept your apology.
