=Episode 11=

20
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,960
If things like yesterday happen again,

21
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,720
can you fire?

22
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,240
In fact, we can.

23
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,720
For example,

24
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,840
if a criminal is injured,

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,680
will you offer him

26
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,360
medical treatment?

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,880
Yes, we will.

28
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,640
The same for us.

29
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,120
No matter how serious

30
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,920
the crime is,

31
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,800
as long as the criminal is not

32
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,760
completely hopeless,

33
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,840
as police officers,

34
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,880
we must treat every life

35
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,120
with discretion.

36
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,600
Enough talks. Have some food.

37
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,240
When will you rejoin the unit?

38
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,480
The force has given me

39
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,800
three days off.

40
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,960
Three days off?

41
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:26,630
Yes.

42
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,800
So, I don’t go back today.

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,520
You…

44
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,640
You won’t go back?

45
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,440
Here,

46
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,560
a toast to you.

47
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,600
I can’t drink anymore.

48
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,960
I’m full.

49
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,040
I… I…

50
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,240
I’m going to the bathroom.

51
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,120
What’s on my mind?

52
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,280
You’ve cleaned up the table quickly.

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,680
What...?

54
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,320
What are you going to do tonight?

55
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,120
Nothing.

56
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,680
I just… just go to bed.

57
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:50,960
So early?

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,400
I-It’s not early.

59
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,040
You said you are going to look up

60
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,320
some information, didn’t you?

61
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,520
Do you need my help?

62
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,080
No. No, no, no.

63
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,040
I’m not going to look up anything.

64
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,200
I’m tired today.

65
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,480
I’ll do it tomorrow.

66
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,240
You worked too hard
in the daytime, right?

67
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,240
You know, working in the emergency room

68
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,800
can be exhausting.

69
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,240
I’m always sorry

70
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,920
about you having to work
in the emergency room.

71
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,400
It wasn’t because of you.

72
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,840
Why are you sorry?

73
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,400
Dr. Mi,

74
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,080
I’m, uh, I’m going to

75
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,840
the hospital for new dressing.

76
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,480
How about I give you a lift?

77
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,200
The same way, anyway.

78
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,720
It’s pretty early.

79
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,440
I’m used to it.

80
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,720
OK, thanks.

81
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,640
Dr. Xu.

82
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,800
You’re off duty.

83
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,480
Bye-bye.

84
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,080
Dr. Xu,

85
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,280
why don’t you go inside?

86
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,800
I’m waiting for someone.

87
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,440
Alright, see you later.

88
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,280
Bye-bye.

89
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,400
I’m scheduled to do a surgery
on Tuesday morning.

90
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,040
You ask him to make time and come.

91
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,120
I’ll diagnose him.

92
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,320
Director Shao.

93
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,080
Are you waiting for me?

94
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:04,800
No.

95
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,000
It’s cold today.

96
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,440
You should have put on
more clothes, Director Shao.

97
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,400
It’s OK. I drove here.

98
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,240
Are you feeling cold?

99
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,440
I’m fine.

100
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,280
Director Shao.

101
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,920
Morning.

102
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,480
What’s the plan for tonight?

103
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,520
Tonight?

104
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,840
Nothing.

105
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,080
I have a party at home tonight.

106
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,040
You will come, right?

107
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,000
Oh, here you are.

108
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,960
I am looking for you.

109
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,240
Yi and I have made an agreement.

110
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,600
We’ll be there at 7:00 PM.

111
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,440
7:30 PM.

112
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,060
7:30 PM?

113
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,880
-Yeah.
-Got it.

114
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,880
Director Wei is going as well?

115
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,430
Yeah.

116
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,200
It’s a reunion party

117
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,860
of my medical schoolmates.

118
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,000
I’ll wait for you

119
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,960
at the parking lot after work.

120
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,320
OK, I’ll go. Don’t worry.

121
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,120
Let’s go.

122
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,240
Director Shao,

123
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,240
do you often hold parties

124
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,200
where neurologists

125
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,560
talk about cases?

126
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,080
We’re just friends.

127
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,160
It’s just a casual gathering.

128
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,200
You talk about

129
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,800
professional stuff, though, don’t you?

130
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,920
I wish I could learn something

131
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,640
from you at a party like this.

132
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,480
I may invite you in the future.

133
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,480
Your dressing is changed.

134
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,560
I’m going to work.

135
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,030
Alright, bye-bye.

136
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:33,840
Bye-bye.

137
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,200
He plays favorites.

138
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,240
Mi Ka was unqualified for last surgery.

139
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,360
But he asked Mi Ka there.

140
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,360
Director Shao always leaves the

141
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,790
best opportunities to Mi Ka.

142
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,600
Not really.

143
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,000
Other doctors also get opportunities.

144
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,720
Look…

145
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,200
You’re making a big deal out of it.

146
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,400
This is different.

147
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,680
It’s a private party.

148
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,160
All the elites and experts
will be there.

149
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,520
A resident doctor never gets such

150
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,520
a great opportunity.

151
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,640
Mi Ka is the first one who gets it.

152
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,400
He said he’d invite you in the future.

153
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,840
Just chill.

154
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,200
Sister.

155
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,520
Dinner?

156
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,080
Mi Ka,

157
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,160
allow me to introduce.

158
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,160
This is Yi Qian,

159
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,440
a classmate of Dr. Shao.

160
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,000
The three of us all

161
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:17,840
graduated from the same school.

162
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,680
Nice to meet you, Mr. Yi.

163
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,800
Nice to meet you, too.

164
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,320
I’m not as formal as Dr. Shao

165
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,040
and this isn’t working hour.

166
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,760
Thanks.

167
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,160
You’re welcome. Please enjoy.

168
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,960
Are all special police officers

169
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,280
very cool?

170
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,200
Do you just knock down

171
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:31,920
bad guys

172
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,960
pretty much effortlessly?

173
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,720
Not really.

174
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,920
Sometimes, we’d

175
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,160
hide in a bin or something.

176
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,040
Uh,

177
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,040
she just came back from abroad.

178
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,600
She studies art.

179
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,720
She doesn’t know much

180
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,640
about the work of special police.

181
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,400
Is there a particular
painter that you like?

182
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,120
No.

183
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,840
Gustav Klimt

184
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,080
is my favorite painter.

185
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,520
I just went to his art show

186
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,320
in Austria not long ago.

187
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:02,960
Uh, how about

188
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,760
artists? Anyone?

189
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:11,840
No one.

190
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,040
No time for them.

191
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,080
Um,

192
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,560
let’s eat.

193
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

194
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,920
Just, just tuck in.

195
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:23,720
Dinner, finally.

196
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,680
Tuck in, tuck in.

197
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,520
Let’s begin.

198
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,840
Let’s begin, Shao.

199
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,300
(Case briefing)

200
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,720
This is the dinner you
wanted to have with me?

201
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,200
You, me, dinner.

202
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,120
Anything wrong?

203
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,040
Come on.

204
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,880
This is pretty awkward, don’t you think?

205
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,920
You’ll get to know each other over time.

206
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,920
You’re both adults.

207
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,480
What do you mean, awkward?

208
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,800
But the girl

209
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,480
was talking about some Klimt guy.

210
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,080
She and I aren’t even
living in the same world.

211
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,280
Xing Kelei,

212
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,920
who lives in the same world
with you, then?

213
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,760
The person who

214
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,520
lives next door, right?

215
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,600
How do you know?

216
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,480
Do you take me for a fool?

217
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
Why did you take

218
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,800
so many of my facial masks?

219
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,120
Listen,

220
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,760
I came back with a task on me.

221
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,960
Mom said

222
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,920
either one of us must get married.

223
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,720
If not,

224
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,680
she’ll come back and personally

225
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,200
see to it.

226
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,080
You get married, then.

227
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,520
You’re old anyway.

228
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,000
Fine.

229
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,080
I’m old. I get married first.

230
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,840
Then I have a baby.

231
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,960
You resign

232
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,640
and be the manager of the company.

233
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,840
Sister,

234
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,400
come on.

235
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,040
How about this?

236
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,680
We work together against mom.

237
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,240
Do you think she’s

238
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,800
an idiot?

239
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,000
Thanks, Director Shao. Thanks.

240
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,080
See you.

241
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,240
Uh, I...

242
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,760
Shut up.

243
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,600
Hello.

244
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,520
Oh, look at the clothes steamer.

245
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,800
It looks quite familiar.

246
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,400
Here are

247
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,800
my facial masks.

248
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,440
No wonder.

249
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,160
I thought my stuff

250
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,040
had their own will

251
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,800
and started running around

252
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,720
by themselves.

253
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,280
Look at me, Xing Kelei.

254
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,240
So?

255
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,240
Are you happy with the house?

256
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,760
It’s OK. Just...

257
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,080
-I’m not asking you.
-In winter, it...

258
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,080
Y-Yeah.

259
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,720
One of my colleagues
knows Instructor Xing

260
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,800
and told me about the house for rent.

261
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,440
Uh, only one room,

262
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,600
other rooms are not for rent.

263
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,120
It’s close to

264
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,240
the hospital that I work in

265
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,760
and the rent is reasonable,

266
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,800
so, I took the room.

267
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,800
When I took the room,

268
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,360
I didn’t know

269
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,200
it was Instructor Xing’s house.

270
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,880
Let me introduce myself.

271
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,600
I’m

272
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,960
Xing Kelei’s

273
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,680
sister, Xing Keyao.

274
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,120
Hi.

275
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,160
Mi Ka, right?

276
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:36,000
Xing Kelei told me

277
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,200
that you rented one room

278
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,640
in his house

279
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,240
and that he was your instructor.

280
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,560
You’re a doctor, correct?

281
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,320
me too, major on medicine.

282
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,040
I didn’t become a doctor

283
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:45,962
because I need to join the
business for my family.

284
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,040
If you need anything

285
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,520
from me,

286
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,040
just let me know.

287
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,480
I live next to you

288
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,720
OK.

289
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,840
It’s late now,

290
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,440
You’d better go to bed.

291
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,120
Thanks.

292
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,720
If you like these, just take them.

293
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,280
Let’s go, Xing Kelei.

294
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,640
Day off tomorrow?

295
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,280
I’ll take you out for fun.

296
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,920
I didn’t see that coming.

297
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,590
You know what?

298
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,680
Xing Kelei has a sister.

299
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,320
I thought she was her girlfriend

300
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,440
or wife.

301
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,640
The way she looked at me...

302
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,560
Jesus.

303
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,960
Do you feel like

304
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,880
being caught

305
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,440
as a mistress?

306
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,760
What mistress?

307
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,000
I’m not in a relationship.

308
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,240
I’m not a mistress.

309
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,480
Fine, fine.

310
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,880
You start using facial masks.

311
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,080
What?

312
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,600
Can’t I treat myself better?

313
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,920
You didn’t even look

314
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,040
yourself in the mirror

315
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,440
the whole day before.

316
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,520
Gosh, what happened?

317
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,480
I...

318
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,240
I’m going to hang out
with a friend tomorrow.

319
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,520
Xing Kelei.

320
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,560
No. A colleague of mine.

321
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,360
Really?

322
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,240
Stop gossiping.

323
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,360
Enough talks about me.
Let’s talk about you.

324
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,000
How are you doing?

325
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,080
Are you taking medical
treatment properly?

326
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,400
I’m OK. Don’t worry.

327
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,920
My mom has gone back to China.

328
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,760
I’m here

329
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,640
all by myself.

330
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,760
But

331
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,300
the hospital

332
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,640
has got me a caretaker.

333
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,640
Good.

334
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,760
You must be good

335
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,920
and take good care of yourself.

336
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,360
OK.

337
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,600
So, I wish you and your “friend”

338
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,280
have fun tomorrow.

339
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,160
Bye-bye.

340
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,480
Goodnight.

341
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,080
Out for fun.

342
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,920
A message from Captain Xing.

343
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,320
New mission?

344
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,840
Where do I take a girl for fun?

345
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,760
What kind of a mission is this?

346
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,320
Something’s up.

347
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,040
Something’s up, captain.

348
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,360
Who is the target?

349
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,680
Do you have a girlfriend?

350
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,310
Who will be Mrs. Xing?

351
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,240
Let us see the picture.

352
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,350
We’re a bunch of single guys.

353
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,280
How do we know anything
about dating places?

354
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,260
(Best dating places)

355
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,460
(Lu Feng)

356
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,560
I didn’t expect that

357
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,560
our invincible Captain Xing

358
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,720
would be beaten by this small problem.

359
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Aren’t you a cool guy?

360
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,120
You make fool of yourself

361
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,280
when you’re going to have a date?

362
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,040
Will you tell me or not?

363
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,520
When we were in University of Police,

364
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,440
you were the chief,
so, I listened to you.

365
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,280
But not now.

366
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,360
What? You’re a boss now.

367
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,640
I’m nothing to you?

368
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,640
Will you tell me or not?

369
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,000
OK, OK.

370
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,600
I was joking.

371
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,300
Well,

372
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,720
I’m going to forward some

373
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,600
popular places to you.

374
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,800
Many couples go

375
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,560
to check up these places.

376
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,260
(Jiangning Love Museum)

377
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,900
(Jiangning West End Lavender Garden)

378
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,160
You’ve been to many places, huh?

379
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,240
I...

380
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,000
I went to do surveys.

381
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,360
For my business.

382
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,800
Survey?

383
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,440
In the past couple of years,

384
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,880
every time I saw you,

385
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,080
you had a different girl with you.

386
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:13,760
Jerk.

387
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,120
Those are old stories.

388
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,040
I was young.

389
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:18,840
Right?

390
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,560
But now, I’ve changed.

391
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,440
My business is my everything.

392
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,320
Let’s see

393
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,680
who wins your heart in the end.

394
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,520
Don’t talk about me.

395
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,000
You, Xing Kelei,

396
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:31,920
used to claim that

397
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,800
you were immune to love.

398
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,320
What?

399
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,720
Your immunity is crushed?

400
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,520
Waiter, he’ll pay.

401
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,880
We haven’t finished drinking yet.

402
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,800
I may look fat in white.

403
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,160
Bad idea.

404
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,920
This one

405
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,280
seems too formal.

406
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,720
Which one?

407
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,840
Are you robbing me?

408
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,380
Too many bananas

409
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,680
will make you have diarrhea.

410
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,680
I won’t.

411
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,280
Quickly, quickly.

412
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,200
These cakes here

413
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,360
are sweeter.

414
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,190
If you don’t like

415
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:07,770
sweet ones,

416
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,350
you eat these.

417
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:08,890
I’ll take a less sweet one.

418
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,800
Me, me, me. I want this.

419
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,600
Wait, wait, wait.

420
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,160
This is mine.

421
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:11,760
Be careful. Be careful.

422
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,240
Give this to me. I’ll eat this one.

423
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:14,880
Sure.

424
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,520
How did you get through?

425
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,640
She’s pretty much

426
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,640
one of us.

427
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,920
Everyone knows her.

428
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,040
She

429
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,920
always came to see you.

430
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,440
Thanks to you, we get to eat the cakes.

431
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,240
Yes.

432
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,200
Thanks to Captain Shu.

433
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:28,760
Please come more often.

434
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,000
You must come more often.

435
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,560
Come with me.

436
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,640
Let’s go and have a look.

437
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,240
This is our training ground,

438
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,280
not a picnic ground.

439
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,240
What’s wrong with a bit of snack

440
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,960
during a break?

441
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,480
I bought a lot.

442
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,120
Everyone can have some.

443
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,680
Xia,

444
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,760
thank you,

445
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,320
but I don’t need these.

446
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,520
Take these.

447
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,360
I didn’t buy these

448
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,520
only for you.

449
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,160
I bought the cakes for everybody.

450
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,600
You can’t say no.

451
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,480
She’s right.

452
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,280
Anyway, you’ve got the stuff.

453
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,480
I’m going to work.

454
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,360
Xia!

455
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,960
-Bye. -Bye.

456
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,560
See you next time.

457
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,360
See you.

458
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,280
Captain Shu,

459
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,240
if you don’t want to eat these,

460
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,320
let us take care of them.

461
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,560
I didn’t say I don’t want them.

462
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:30,640
Uh...

463
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,960
You have them, then.

464
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,440
Thanks, Captain Shu.

465
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,040
Let’s go.

466
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,280
We’re taking them.

467
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:37,920
I’m taking it.

468
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,560
We’re leaving.

469
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,960
Save two for me.

470
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,760
Roger.

471
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,640
You don’t get

472
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,520
many days off, right?

473
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,960
We take shifts.

474
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,240
But we don’t really go out

475
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,320
on days off.

476
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,480
We just play basketball or something.

477
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,480
We’re a bunch of dudes,

478
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,680
and got nothing better to do.

479
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,000
What do you do

480
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,320
on your days off?

481
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,480
Taking naps, watching videos.

482
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,360
What videos?

483
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,760
Videos about surgeries or lectures.

484
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,320
Why do I feel

485
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,000
you’re interrogating me?

486
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,360
Sorry, uh,

487
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,480
work habit.

488
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,320
Have you been to art shows?

489
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,240
Art show?

490
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,680
Is there a painter you like?

491
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:45,800
Uh…

492
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,200
I know

493
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,600
a Monet exhibition

494
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,200
will be on next month.

495
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,720
Er,

496
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,120
my sister took me to
a blind date last night

497
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:58,880
and the girl

498
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,240
asked me the same question.

499
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,520
She asked me which artist I like

500
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,520
and I answered

501
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,760
I don’t have time for them.

502
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,360
I just...

503
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,720
Please

504
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,560
ignore what I said.

505
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,960
Anyway,

506
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,880
I never had a successful blind date.

507
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,760
I just like

508
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,960
what I like.

509
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,200
But as for the paintings,

510
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,600
I did see Monet’s Water Lilies

511
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,440
in France when I was little.

512
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,160
It was quite nice.

513
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,440
D-Do you want to have a look?

514
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,880
How about I go with you?

515
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,000
Sure.

516
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,320
I’ve never been abroad.

517
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,480
I went abroad often when I was little.

518
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,080
You know what?

519
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,960
My parents and you are

520
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,240
kind of in the same business.

521
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,680
My parents are

522
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,280
medical equipment agents,

523
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:51,930
so, I got to be abroad

524
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,200
when I was little.

525
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,080
Ever since I went to the medical school,

526
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,280
I haven’t gone home
for New Year for years.

527
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,040
My parents run

528
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,000
a small restaurant back at home.

529
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,520
They’re quite busy

530
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,840
and have no time for me.

531
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,760
Where are we going?

532
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,160
There is a very beautiful

533
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,640
lavender garden

534
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,480
in the west.

535
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,560
I’ll show you around.

536
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,440
Lavender garden?

537
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,680
I’m told

538
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,480
the lavender garden

539
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,120
is about 330,000 sqm in size.

540
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,360
The flower language of lavender

541
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,840
is waiting for romance.

542
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,760
As soon as you step into the garden...

543
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,440
As soon as you step into the garden,

544
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,960
you see an expanse of purple,

545
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,520
which is quite breathtaking.

546
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:38,960
The silly guy

547
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,800
has written it on his palm beforehand.

548
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:49,960
Damn it!

549
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,920
Lavender becomes crop.

550
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,080
I didn’t know it is

551
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,200
going to rain.

552
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,680
There’s nothing we can do.

553
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,120
It’s OK.

554
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,640
I get a plan B.

555
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,000
There’s a great restaurant nearby

556
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,680
that’s super popular on the Internet.

557
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,520
It’s a renovated building

558
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,440
from the Republic of China era.

559
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,880
Let’s go to the restaurant.
It isn’t far away.

560
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:09,760
Sure.

561
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,360
Hello? Captain Hao.

562
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,800
Chengdong District, right?

563
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,160
OK, I’ll be there soon.

564
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,440
An urgent duty call.

565
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,480
Right now?

566
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:34,920
Sorry.

567
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,760
It’s OK.

Mr. Lu,

593
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,400
you’re like a pro now.

594
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,800
I don’t need to teach you anymore.

595
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,680
I’m not a pro,

596
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,960
but since you’re standing next to me,

597
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,560
I have to be better than usual.

598
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,920
Do you say the same words

599
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,880
to every female trainer?

600
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,080
No.

601
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,600
Not every female trainer is

602
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,120
as good as you

603
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,600
or is able to arouse my potential.

604
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,880
There are several moves

605
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,390
that I still don’t

606
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,560
quite understand.

607
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,360
However, the class is almost over.

608
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,680
What can I do?

609
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,150
How about we

610
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,120
have dinner tonight?

611
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,440
Please break down every move

612
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,760
to me, OK?

613
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,760
Look at the outside.

614
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,200
The rain is crazy.

615
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,000
No cab is available at the moment.

616
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,200
Let’s have dinner together

617
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,440
and when the rain lets up,

618
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,920
I then drive you home.

619
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,840
Wait for me then.

620
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,040
I go change my clothes.

621
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,940
(Xing Kelei)

622
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:58,840
Hello?

623
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,040
Captain Xing,

624
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,640
how is your date going?

625
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,200
Now?

626
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,360
Bro,

627
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,160
do you know how heavy

628
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,760
the rain is out there?

629
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,600
Alright, alright, I got it.

630
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,600
I owe you this favor.

631
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,080
Sorry,

632
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,040
we can’t have dinner tonight.

633
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,520
I have an emergency mission.

634
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,160
Hello, babe.

635
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,240
I thought you were having a date

636
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,720
with Xing Kelei.

637
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,600
He asked me out

638
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,960
and now left me alone

639
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,240
for his mission.

640
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,160
No way.

641
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,560
The rain is heavy out there.

642
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,240
He just left you on the street?

643
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,280
Never mind that.

644
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,840
Come and pick me up.

645
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,520
Sure.

646
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,600
Where are you now?

647
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,840
I’ll send you my location.

648
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,160
Sorry,

649
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,200
the traffic is bad in the rainy day.

650
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,520
Where’s your car?

651
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,920
Your car hit something again?

652
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,200
I’m freezing.

653
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,560
Poor girl, poor girl.

654
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,160
How about I make it up to you?

655
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,840
Dinner? My treat.

656
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,360
I, uh...

657
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,080
Let’s go to the

658
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,560
restaurant that

659
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,640
we didn’t go.

660
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,320
Sure.

661
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,000
-OK.
-Let’s go.

662
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:43,600
-Come on.
-Let’s go.

663
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,760
Wait, wait a sec.

664
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,400
Hello?

665
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,640
Are you Dr. Mi?

666
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,800
Yes.

667
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:55,880
Hi,

668
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,880
I’m Xing Kelei’s friend.

669
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,200
I’m coming to pick you up.

670
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,400
I’m coming. I’m close.

671
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,240
I see you.

672
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:07,920
Get in the car.

673
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,480
Sorry

674
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,200
that you have to come in the rain,

675
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,680
but my friend is already here
to pick me up.

676
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,520
Are you the

677
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,000
reporter of First News

678
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,200
on Documentary TV Channel,

679
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,360
Ruan Qingxia?

680
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,960
You recognize me?

681
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,680
My name is Lu Feng,

682
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,520
I watch every episode that you report.

683
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,840
I like you very much.

684
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,480
Thanks.

685
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,080
Enough talks in the rain.

686
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:30,840
Get into my car.

687
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,720
Where are you ladies going?
I’ll drive you there.

688
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,800
No, it’s OK.

689
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,960
We’ll take a cab.

690
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,040
We won’t trouble you.

691
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,520
No.

692
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,320
Captain Xing gave me the order.

693
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,160
If you don’t come with me,

694
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,240
he’ll give me a hard time.

695
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,240
Miss, are you taking the cab or what?

696
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,720
Please...

697
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,220
Wait, wait.

698
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,120
I’ll cover the fee.

699
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,440
Sorry, sir.

700
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,400
Here.

701
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,600
Here, keep the change.

702
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,040
Thank you. We don’t need a cab.

703
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,240
Get in.

704
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,800
OK, OK.

705
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,150
Come on.

706
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,520
Thanks.

707
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,230
No hurry.

708
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,040
Get in, Dr. Mi.

709
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,150
Thank you.

710
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,920
The rain is crazy.

711
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,600
Here, dry yourselves.

712
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,840
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

713
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,880
Xing Kelei is an idiot.

714
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,320
How could he leave you alone?

715
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,710
It was an urgent duty call.

716
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,760
He had to be there.

717
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,120
This is the life of a special police.

718
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,480
His phone must be

719
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,360
on 24/7.

720
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,670
He must stand by all the time.

721
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,480
It doesn’t feel good to
be the girlfriend

722
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,150
of a special policeman.

723
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,920
But not me,

724
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,230
whenever my girl calls me,
I’m always available.

725
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,120
Your hair is wet.

726
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,280
You’ll get a cold.

727
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,080
It’s OK. I’m not that weak.

728
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,040
Dry yourself.

729
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,320
Your legs are wet.

730
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:52,800
It is quite cold.

731
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,560
President Lu.

732
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,520
-Please don’t call me that.
-Boss Lu.

733
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,200
No, no, no.

734
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:05,880
-Thank you.
-Seriously.

735
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,760
Thank you for

736
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,000
picking us up and taking us

737
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,000
to this restaurant.

738
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,320
We’ve been meaning to try

739
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,680
the food here.

740
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,800
It’s nothing.

741
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,920
We’re friends.

742
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:15,720
Listen,

743
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,360
if you want to eat here again,

744
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,480
just give me a call.

745
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,000
I know the owner
of the restaurant personally.

746
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,000
VIP room

747
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,320
is always open to you.

748
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,560
Thanks.

749
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,080
Thank you.

750
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,680
When we were in University of Police,

751
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,440
a martial champion
was transferred there.

752
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,320
As soon as Xing Kelei knew about him,

753
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,720
he got super psyched.

754
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,720
He immediately had a battle with the guy

755
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:41,800
on the drilling ground

756
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,600
and callously

757
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,280
took the guy down.

758
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,840
That was pretty cool.

759
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,370
Xing Kelei was the top student

760
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,800
in the University of Police.

761
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:48,800
But you know what?

762
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,120
The next day,

763
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,680
our instructor took

764
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,400
the guy who got defeated

765
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,520
to us

766
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,040
and told us that

767
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,080
he was our new coach.

768
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,640
Really?

769
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,240
Can you imagine

770
00:35:59,320 --> 00:35:59,880
the grimace

771
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:00,920
on Xing Kelei’s face?

772
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,160
Although he was worried that the new
coach would get back at him,

773
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,080
he acted like

774
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,800
he didn’t care.

775
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,240
I didn’t know he could be so silly.

776
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,440
He seems like

777
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,240
a super cool guy right now,

778
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,640
but he was pretty dumb in school.

779
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,040
I got loads of his silly stories.

780
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,760
How did he

781
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,600
get into the University of Police?

782
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,040
We both graduated from the
First Senior High School,

783
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,680
and our school had the best

784
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,240
swimmers and shooters.

785
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,160
In high school, Xing Kelei

786
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,080
already won national championship.

787
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:27,800
He was good at

788
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,360
all four swimming strokes.

789
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,840
He participated in school
sport competition every year.

790
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,520
In grade 12,

791
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,240
the University of Police

792
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,160
came to recruit students,

793
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,280
so, our coach asked us to try.

794
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,600
He was immediately enrolled

795
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,960
once his test results came out.

796
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:41,920
What about you?

797
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:42,840
I...

798
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,600
He tricked me.

799
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:48,840
He said to me,

800
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,040
“You can’t pass the test”.

801
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:50,960
I said “Nonsense,

802
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,120
you’re a champion,

803
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,400
but I’m not nothing”.

804
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,720
Then I got enrolled as well.

805
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,240
But later, he told me that

806
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,480
he’d get bored

807
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,440
if he went to the University of Police

808
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,280
on his own

809
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,600
and that he just wanted my company.

810
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,520
Shu Wenbo went to the same

811
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,080
school with you, right?

812
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,600
No.

813
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,600
He was in special army forces.

814
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,680
He got hired into special police later.

815
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,160
I knew him after he got
into the special police.

816
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,360
So... Then...

817
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,400
You were also

818
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,720
a special policeman, right?

819
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,520
Of course.

820
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,240
Xing Kelei and I both

821
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,840
passed the special police test,

822
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,240
but then...

823
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,120
My mom forced me to resign.

824
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,320
You don’t look like

825
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,200
a special policeman.

826
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,640
Look at Shu Wenbo.

827
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,320
He just stands there,
giving off the air of justice.

828
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,480
You...

829
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,600
Uh...

830
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,760
You mentioned the dude several times.

831
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,520
Do you two know each other well?

832
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,240
Kind of.

833
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,880
Kind of, huh?

834
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,000
Too well, I’d say.

835
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,520
Yeah, right.

836
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,200
We do know each other.

837
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,240
What’s more, I’m chasing after him.
So what?

838
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,160
You?

839
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,400
Chase after Shu Wenbo?

840
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,840
What’s wrong with you?

841
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,240
Yeah, something’s wrong with her.

842
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,680
I feel the same myself.

843
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,800
Look at me.

844
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,040
I’m beautiful, kind and graceful.

845
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,320
I got a good job.

846
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,440
I pay my own bills.

847
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,440
I’m local.

848
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,040
I get a car and a house.

849
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,080
But he doesn’t like me.

850
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,440
It makes no sense.

851
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,800
Right.

852
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,720
I can’t believe

853
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,880
he turns down

854
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,880
such an excellent and beautiful

855
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,560
girl like you.

856
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,520
Is something wrong with your head?

857
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,200
Tell you what,

858
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,400
no one ever turned you down,

859
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,600
and now this dude

860
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,160
has no feelings for you.

861
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,440
So, you can’t put up with it.

862
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,200
He’s a plain man.

863
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,520
Don’t mess with him,

864
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,360
got it?

865
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,960
I must nail him.

866
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,160
Don’t wind him up.

867
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,720
He never had a relationship.

868
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,960
He’ll take it seriously.

869
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,240
Well, he

870
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,600
electric-shocked me

871
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,880
when we first met.

872
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,240
What? He shocked you?

873
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,640
Don’t listen to her.

874
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,440
The first time she

875
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,840
went to record news
at the special police base,

876
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,800
Shu Wenbo showed her

877
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,600
the weapons and gears.

878
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,400
He electric-shocked her

879
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,400
with the stun gloves.

880
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,360
She insists that he
electric-shocked her.

881
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,440
Come on, it’s not the same thing.

882
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,800
He did.

883
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,000
He did electric-shock me.

884
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:12,960
Yeah, yeah.

885
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,560
I was electrified, you know?

886
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,600
Here.

887
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,320
Crazy.

888
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:19,840
Here.

889
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,000
Morning.

890
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,480
Dr. Mi.

891
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,480
A patient needs you.

892
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,480
Please go have a look.

893
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,280
Be quick.

894
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:41,920
OK.

895
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,980
(Xing Kelei: Morning)

896
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:58,820
(Mi Ka: Morning)

897
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:04,020
(Mi Ka: A long night)

898
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,200
Night duty, again?

899
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,920
The sun is up. Get some sleep.

900
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:27,630
I thought

901
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:28,680
we’d have several days off

902
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,880
after the inspection.

903
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:30,920
And this special communication training

904
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,480
follows right up.

905
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,000
We don’t even get

906
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:34,920
one day off.

907
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,080
So what? You’re single.

908
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,120
Is it important?

909
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:41,760
Our captain

910
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,360
has just started a relationship

911
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,360
with Mi Ka

912
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,920
and they don’t get to see each other
for so many days,

913
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,200
how bad does that feel?

914
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,080
Hey, watch it!

915
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,160
This is dangerous.

916
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,400
-You know?
-This is mine.

917
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,120
Piss off.

918
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:02,720
What? How...

919
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,720
How can you say that?

920
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,880
You nearly hit my car.

921
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:05,880
I... I saw

922
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,000
the parking space first.

923
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:07,880
How can you do this?

924
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,600
You saw it first, huh?

925
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:09,680
Does it have your

926
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,680
name on it?

927
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,600
Stop!

928
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,600
What are you doing?

929
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,760
What?

930
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,720
Knock it off, you!

931
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,640
Be civil, OK?

932
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,360
Piss off!

933
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,360
Can you be civil?

934
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,680
What are you doing? Stop!

935
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,520
Stop!

936
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,160
Police?

937
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,520
