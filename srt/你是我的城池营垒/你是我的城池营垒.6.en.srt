20
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:38,920
Okay.

21
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,160
Wash the tissues and stop the bleeding.

22
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,240
Yes.

23
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,680
Zhang Yang,

24
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,720
how are things going there?

25
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,600
Director Shao,

26
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:46,920
we’ve reached the point

27
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,560
and are ready for drainage.

28
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,800
There’s a lot of blood.

29
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,040
I can’t stop it from bleeding.

30
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,320
You take it up.

31
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,840
See if there are

32
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,560
any remains of the bullet

33
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,440
in his brain.

34
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,130
Yes.

35
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,770
I’ll go to the other side.

36
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,240
How is he?

37
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,720
Director, see.

38
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,080
As the hematoma strips from the skull,

39
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,080
there is a lot of blood
from the superior vena cava.

40
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,360
Don’t worry. Let me see.

41
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,200
No, you can’t stop
the bleeding like this.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,680
Apply the gelatin sponge
to the bleeding surface.

43
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,680
Gelfoam pieces can be suspended.

44
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,560
Director,

45
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,000
his blood pressure is decreasing.

46
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,120
Inject plasma.

47
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,160
Is this an aortic angioma?

48
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,640
Why we didn’t see it

49
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,840
on the CT film?

50
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,320
We didn’t have the time

51
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,440
to do the vascular assessment.

52
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,600
It’s a plain scan,

53
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,520
so we’re not sure
of his vascular conditions.

54
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:46,800
Director,

55
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,040
we’ve found

56
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:48,920
an aortic angioma here.

57
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,200
I can’t go over now.

58
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,960
Control his blood pressure

59
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,920
and don’t let the tumor rupture.

60
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,520
Okay.

61
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,840
We don’t have enough plasma.

62
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,080
How much plasma is left?

63
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,120
200 ml.

64
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,000
Tell the blood bank to send more.

65
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,000
Let Mi Ka help you

66
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,720
with the aneurysm clipping.

67
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,380
Okay.

68
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,160
Tell the blood bank to send more.

69
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,720
Okay.

70
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,040
Prepare for an aneurysm clipping.

71
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,280
Mi Ka,

72
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,720
dissect the aneurysms
adherent to adjacent vasculature

73
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,800
for a temporary arterial occlusion.

74
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,360
Yes.

75
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,920
No need for
a temporary arterial occlusion.

76
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,360
You can leave it

77
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,600
when the tumor ruptures.

78
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,280
Okay.

79
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,960
Dissect the aneurysms

80
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,760
so you can see the aneurysm neck.

81
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,960
Yes.

82
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,200
Director Shao,
we’ve stopped the bleeding.

83
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,400
Okay, Zhang Yang, take over my work.

84
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,030
Okay.

85
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,760
Drain the hematoma.

86
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,880
I’ll check on how Jia Li is going.

87
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,560
All right.

88
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,240
A successful aneurysm clipping.

89
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,440
No rupture.

90
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,240
Have you drained up the hematoma?

91
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,680
Yes.

92
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,280
Replace the bone flap.

93
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,280
Yes.

94
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:07,920
How is he?

95
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,200
Both surgeries were successful.

96
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,600
But they need to be sent

97
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,440
to the ICU

98
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,880
for further observations.

99
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,920
You can

100
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,880
rest now.

101
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,360
There’s another thing

102
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,270
I think I should tell you.

103
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,560
We found

104
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,800
an aortic angioma

105
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,880
in Xiaochao’s brain.

106
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,000
We’ve done what we should do,

107
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,320
but I can’t promise

108
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,040
there won’t be any side effects.

109
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,400
We need to check on him
when he wakes up.

110
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,920
We’ve been rude to you.

111
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,360
I’m sorry.

112
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,840
I’m a doctor.

113
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,520
My decision is based

114
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,600
on my ability and judgment.

115
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,440
You’re the police.

116
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,400
We see things differently.

117
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,360
So,

118
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,400
it’s understandable.

119
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,200
It’s not about right or wrong.

120
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,400
No need to apologize.

121
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,840
Thank you.

122
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,270
Certificate of Completion.

123
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,280
(Certificate of Completion, Mi Ka)

124
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,320
Mi Ka.

125
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:35,600
(ICU)

126
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,040
Why only you are here?

127
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,520
I’ve asked them to go home.

128
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,680
It’s no use staying here.

129
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,120
You can’t visit patients

130
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,240
in the ICU.

131
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,760
I know.

132
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,960
Have you eaten anything?

133
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,520
Thank you.

134
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,440
Just have some.

135
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,320
You must haven’t had

136
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,360
anything for the day.

137
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,600
I was as furious as Li Nian

138
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,480
when I heard the decision

139
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,000
Dr. Shao made.

140
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,360
They killed people,

141
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,160
sold drugs and robbed others.

142
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,480
But Xiaochao

143
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,960
is the best sniper

144
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,200
in our team.

145
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,280
We risked our lives

146
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,240
to catch them.

147
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,000
But what can we do?

148
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,040
We’re the police.

149
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,840
We have no choice.

150
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,720
A doctor has to carry out

151
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,440
the Hippocratic Oath which says that

152
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,200
“I’ll abstain from all intentional

153
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,640
wrong-doing and harm

154
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,000
to my patients

155
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,320
even if it’s for the sake
of justice and benevolence”.

156
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,240
All lives are equal.

157
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,440
As a doctor,

158
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,960
I’ll always cherish lives.

159
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,680
You’re a policeman.

160
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,880
You should uphold the law

161
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,280
and you did it.

162
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,320
I understand your choice.

163
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,320
But do you know that

164
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,880
Xiaochao was

165
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,120
a professional shooter?

166
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,680
He could have been chosen to

167
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,960
serve the national team,

168
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,600
but when he knew

169
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,240
that the police unit needs shooters,

170
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,360
he just came and joined us.

171
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,840
He was not that strong

172
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,160
and had nearly been dismissed.

173
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,520
I was with him

174
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,680
and kept cheering him up,

175
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,480
so he persevered.

176
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,640
Staying in Tiger,

177
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,120
he must feel proud.

178
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,400
Perhaps it would be better

179
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,480
if he has given it up.

180
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,600
At least,

181
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,920
he won’t be lying here.

182
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,880
He just told us

183
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,720
before he was sent to the mission

184
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,520
that he would soon get married

185
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,560
and he asked us to attend his wedding.

186
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,360
So, when I stood there this afternoon,

187
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,910
I was thinking

188
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,280
how I wish it could be me

189
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,080
who’s lying there.

190
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,160
I think he may

191
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,800
think the same as you.

192
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,120
He won’t like to see

193
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,440
you being pushed in.

194
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,440
Since the moment

195
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,160
I put on my police uniform,

196
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,960
I am ready

197
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,720
to die for justice.

198
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,800
But when I saw him like this,

199
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,440
I still couldn’t take it.

200
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,080
When I was a kid,

201
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,600
I was given some toy doctor kits.

202
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,560
And then

203
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,200
every time when I

204
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,680
played the doctor,

205
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,280
other kids would visit me.

206
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,320
And I was thinking

207
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,840
that I would be a doctor someday

208
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,040
when I could

209
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,520
cure all patients in the world.

210
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,760
But when I did grow up

211
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,240
and become a doctor,

212
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,920
I only find that

213
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,040
I feel helpless about most things.

214
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,040
The first year of my internship,

215
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,600
a family of three

216
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,960
had a car accident on the highway.

217
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,080
I failed to save anyone of them.

218
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,760
I felt guilty

219
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,760
and helpless.

220
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,440
But then I thought

221
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,760
I had to continue my career,

222
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,560
so I could help

223
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,080
and save more people.

224
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,200
It’s the same for you.

225
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,280
Because of you,

226
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,600
we can live in

227
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,320
a safer world.

228
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,280
You’ve done what you should do

229
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,840
to Xiaochao.

230
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,840
Now you need to

231
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,960
pull yourself together

232
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,880
and believe us.

233
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,960
The surgery will be successful

234
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,040
and he’ll wake up.

235
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,680
Thanks.

236
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,240
You’ve stayed up late

237
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,200
but you would still spend your time
chatting with me.

238
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,480
No worries. I’ve gotten used to it.

239
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,200
I always work at night.

240
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,200
I was uncomfortable

241
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,360
at my first

242
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,560
internship year

243
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,200
to stay up every day.

244
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,680
So I always called my mother

245
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,560
and she would always

246
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,360
comfort me,

247
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,520
and ask me questions.

248
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,080
So, I thought I’d better

249
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,800
not bother her,

250
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,000
or she won’t sleep well.

251
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,400
Then I no longer told her

252
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,920
my duty schedule.

253
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,880
I didn’t want her to worry about me.

254
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,120
What about you?

255
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,760
Your family must

256
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,560
worry more about you
as you’re a policeman.

257
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,520
My family is abroad.

258
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:22,880
It’s inconvenient

259
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,680
for a policeman to go abroad,

260
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,560
so we didn’t see each other much.

261
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,600
That’s why

262
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,240
you need to

263
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,480
take care of yourself,

264
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:31,960
so they won’t

265
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,400
worry about you.

266
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,840
How can he do this?

267
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,520
Yes.

268
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,800
How shall we handle it?

269
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,120
Do you have

270
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,000
any other opinions?

271
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,600
As the former director of the ND,

272
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,360
though

273
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,760
I’m the vice-president
of the hospital now,

274
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,680
I feel shocked to

275
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,800
what Director Shao has done,

276
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,200
and worry about

277
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,440
the future of the ND.

278
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,280
It takes us ten years

279
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,360
to build Renxin hospital’s reputation

280
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,080
nationwide.

281
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,040
I don’t want to see

282
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,040
anyone with his adventurous way

283
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,000
ruin our reputation.

284
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,040
Mr. Zheng, I don’t think
it will be that serious.

285
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,440
Anyway, both of the surgeries

286
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,720
have been done successfully.

287
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,760
President Zhang,
what’s your opinion?

288
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,280
It’s true that

289
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,960
a doctor should

290
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,040
not break the rules of the hospital

291
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,880
when treating

292
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,280
patients.

293
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,480
President,

294
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,400
can I have a word?

295
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,640
Sure.

296
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,440
I’m just a junior doctor

297
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,840
that helped Director Shao
in the operation.

298
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,400
We are inexperienced

299
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,000
and I know I should not

300
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,160
have spoken in such an occasion.

301
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,840
But I want to tell you

302
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,320
some of my feelings and thoughts.

303
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,640
It has been my dream

304
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,920
to work here

305
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,920
since I became a medical student.

306
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,200
Every doctor here is

307
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,520
excellent.

308
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,360
I thought as long as

309
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,080
I worked hard enough,

310
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,640
I would put on
the while coat someday,

311
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,240
but not until yesterday

312
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,200
did I know what’s the meaning of it.

313
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,720
If because of the rules or regulations,

314
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,960
a doctor has to

315
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,080
choose whom to live

316
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,360
between two lives,

317
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,360
then what’s our original purpose

318
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,480
of being a doctor?

319
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,560
I was there

320
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,720
throughout the operation.

321
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,120
I think Director Shao

322
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,160
was confident

323
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,920
when he made the decision.

324
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,760
I think it shows

325
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,960
the expertise

326
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,040
and courage of a doctor,

327
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,800
which also have contributed

328
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,440
to our hospital’s reputation.

329
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,280
That’s all.

330
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,000
This junior doctor

331
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,360
understands that

332
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,120
lives and patients will always

333
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,000
be the first consideration

334
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,080
when a doctor makes the decision.

335
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,840
The municipal special police unit

336
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,640
has contacted Director He

337
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,960
and said they would

338
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,000
send us a banner as a gift.

339
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,240
This is their acknowledgment

340
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,280
of our work.

341
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,000
All high-tech here

342
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,960
is to save people’s lives.

343
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:30,880
We can sit there.

344
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,860
-Okay.
-What are you looking?

345
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,710
Why are you looking?

346
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:33,560
Wasn’t it them?

347
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,300
Yes.

348
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,600
The ND, right?

349
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,920
Yes, it was them yesterday.

350
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,640
Did you see them?
Are they from the ND?

351
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,320
Yes.

352
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,160
It was them.

353
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:40,760
The ND doctors.

354
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,360
Yes.

355
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,520
That’s strange.

356
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,760
Yesterday, the whole hospital

357
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,520
had the rumor that
we were in trouble,

358
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,320
yet all of them are
praising us today.

359
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,920
Mi Ka, I’ve heard it that

360
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,280
you had convinced all of them

361
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,480
in the president’s meeting.

362
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,880
You’re amazing.

363
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,200
I just said what I thought,
all right?

364
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,760
Taste this.

365
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,720
Couldn’t you just focus on
your own food?

366
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,840
Isn’t it unhygienic

367
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,040
to clip dishes?

368
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,880
I haven’t used my chopsticks.

369
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,400
Mi Ka,

370
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,120
you’ll win Director Shao’s heart

371
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,200
as you’ve stood up for him.

372
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,160
I didn’t speak those words

373
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,680
to win his heart.

374
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,840
He Xiaoxiao,

375
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,920
you know nothing.

376
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,560
Mi Ka is honest and frank,

377
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,160
or silly and innocent.

378
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,020
You don’t know her.

379
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,760
Just shut up.

380
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,720
Did you just say I was silly?

381
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,520
Yes.

382
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,480
Just a joke.

383
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,440
Don’t worry.

384
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:43,040
(Outpatient)

385
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,570
Thanks.

386
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,120
No problem.

387
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,800
Xiaoman.

388
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,080
I’ve applied for

389
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,920
a domestic medical fund

390
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,280
and they can help you

391
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,360
with some living expenses.

392
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,360
Thank you!

393
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,240
Ye Xiaoman,

394
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,160
take care of yourself
when you’re abroad.

395
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,240
I want to see you

396
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,400
come back safe and sound.

397
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,480
Remember?

398
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,040
Mi Ka,

399
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,680
as I can’t make food
for you from now,

400
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,320
do have some other food
rather than instant noodles,

401
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,400
or you can

402
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,800
eat in the hospital canteen.

403
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,360
It’s almost the end

404
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,000
of the month.

405
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,880
Find someone to

406
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,960
share the rent with you.

407
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,680
Remember?

408
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,280
Don’t make me worry about you.

409
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,920
You can still make food
when you’re abroad.

410
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,800
And I’ll register
an official account with which

411
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,320
you can share the food photos
on the Internet.

412
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,680
Perhaps it will go viral.

413
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,400
Okay.

414
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,640
I’ll try.

415
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,120
Xiaoman.

416
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,120
It’s time to go.

417
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,720
See you.

418
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,040
Slowly.

419
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,640
Goodbye.

420
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,240
See you.

421
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,200
Let’s go back.

422
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,680
Isn’t he the new specialist of the ND,

423
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,720
Shao Yuhan?

424
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,760
That’s cool.

425
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,840
He has made a girl cry

426
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,520
only a few days after his arrival.

427
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,360
He was called by the president.

428
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,080
Perhaps he was in a bad mood.

429
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,240
Excuse me.

430
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,800
I’m not in a bad mood.

431
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,680
It’s fine to be sad.

432
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,440
But don’t indulge in it.

433
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,560
Don’t be like this

434
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,280
when you’re at work.

435
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,200
Okay, Director Shao.

436
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,200
Dr. Zhang,

437
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,320
this the examination report
of the eighth bed.

438
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:26,920
Please sign here.

439
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,880
I heard that Mi Ka was crying

440
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,200
after being scolded by Director Shao.

441
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,720
What happened?

442
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,560
I just passed by the ER

443
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,680
and they said

444
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,640
they saw Mi Ka crying

445
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,720
when followed Director Shao

446
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,120
into the elevator.

447
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,840
Our new director has gotten

448
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,120
an unpredictable temper.

449
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,920
Mi Ka has just spoken for him

450
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,680
before the president,

451
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,280
yet he forgot about it right away.

452
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:49,680
In my opinion,

453
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,520
I’d suggest Mi Ka

454
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,360
to stay away from him.

455
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,320
About turn.

456
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,960
Eyes front.

457
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,720
Attention.

458
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,280
Turn right.

459
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,040
-Finished?
-Yes.

460
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,520
-Kelei.
-Sir.

461
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:16,960
Let’s go.

462
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,120
There is a publicity campaign meeting

463
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,200
in the municipal office.

464
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,240
I’ll let you attend the meeting.

465
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,520
You can take it as a day off.

466
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,840
Anyone can attend the meeting.

467
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,960
I’d better go to the hospital

468
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,920
and visit Xiaochao.

469
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,400
What happened to him?

470
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,720
He had a fit after he woke up

471
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,720
and dismissed all nurses.

472
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,200
Why?

473
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,840
Because he won’t let any woman

474
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,000
wash his body.

475
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,840
A nurse has seen enough of that.

476
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,560
Where is his fiancée?

477
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,680
Looking after his mother.

478
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,280
You can find a male nurse for him.

479
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,160
No.

480
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,120
He’ll go crazy

481
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,360
if you find a male nurse for him.

482
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,480
It’s better to send me.

483
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,160
Okay.

484
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,760
It will ease my burden

485
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,160
if he can recover himself.

486
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,640
Mi Ka,

487
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,240
I can’t find my clothes.

488
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,360
Could you help me search for them?

489
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,720
Open the wardrobe

490
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,640
and find them yourself.

491
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,240
Is there any news

492
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,600
from Shu Wenbo?

493
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,320
I’m not him.

494
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,080
You should go

495
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,480
ask him yourself.

496
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,360
What’s this?

497
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,560
Have you changed your tastes?

498
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,680
Why did you buy

499
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,120
a vest?

500
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,000
I didn’t buy it.

501
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,720
Xing Kelei gave it
to me as compensation.

502
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,120
Xing Kelei gave it to you?

503
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,280
What’s going on?

504
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,240
We had an emergency rescue that day.

505
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,050
I just used my camisole

506
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:40,920
to dress his wound.

507
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,720
-And...
-What did you use?

508
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,560
My camisole.

509
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,000
Did you use your camisole
to bandage him?

510
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,000
It was an emergency.

511
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,480
I just fetched

512
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,480
what was by my hand.

513
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,840
Does it mean

514
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,920
that now you have

515
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,560
a vest of his

516
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,200
and he has a camisole of yours?

517
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,880
How special

518
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,960
your love tokens are.

519
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,320
Tell me the truth.

520
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,840
Do you anticipate

521
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,080
something to happen between you?

522
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,000
No, I won’t give you.

523
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,920
I have some news

524
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,240
from Shu Wenbo.

525
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,600
Didn’t you say you didn’t know?

526
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,920
I know now.

527
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,000
Give it back to me.

528
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,640
Fine.

529
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,800
Stop gossiping about me.

530
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,400
Listen,

531
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,600
he goes to the hospital a lot.

532
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,280
Is he ill?

533
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,360
No.

534
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,920
It’s his fellow man, Xiaochao.

535
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,840
He was injured

536
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:34,560
in a mission.

537
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,880
Some serious injury.

538
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,280
But his family

539
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,520
are not there.

540
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,200
So Shu Wenbo and others

541
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,560
will come to accompany him.

542
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,720
I know.

543
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,760
Now I have got a new plan.

544
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,560
All right.

545
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,640
You’re my born friend.

546
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,960
You should tell me immediately

547
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,920
if you have such information.

548
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,040
Are you taking advantage of me?

549
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,160
What’s a “born friend”?

550
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,320
Why hit me?

551
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,240
Go find your clothes.

552
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,160
If you need

553
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,040
a love consultant,

554
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,280
I’m 24-hour available.

555
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,280
You can deal with

556
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,560
that Shu Wenbo first.

557
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,520
All right.

558
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,060
Good.

559
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,340
(Outpatient)

560
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,400
Hello.

561
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,440
My father

562
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,800
is lying in the hospital.

563
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,000
Why didn’t you come and see him?

564
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:17,900
Are you waiting to

565
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,480
see him at his funeral?

566
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,760
Hello!

567
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,040
Did you hear me?

568
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,760
Hello.

569
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,000
Are you the family

570
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,360
for the 5th bed, Wu Jianguo?

571
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,680
Yes.

572
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,560
What’s up?

573
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,600
The doctor will

574
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,200
examine your father.

575
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,280
Please listen to
what the doctor will say.

576
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,080
And

577
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,480
don’t make calls in the ward.

578
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,160
You’ll disturb other patients.

579
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,520
If you have to,

580
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,480
you need to go out.

581
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,680
Doctor,

582
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,400
can you be faster?

583
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,320
I told you,

584
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,600
my father doesn’t feel well.

585
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,800
If anything goes wrong with him,

586
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,240
I’ll hold you accountable.

587
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,440
It’s better not to argue with

588
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,800
the patient’s family
under such circumstances.

589
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,760
But she had disturbed

590
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,080
other patients.

591
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,440
Leave the matter to nurses.

592
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,960
We have the patient satisfaction

593
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,320
indicator in our monthly
performance assessment.

594
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,560
Don’t make trouble for yourself.

595
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,760
Readings are in the normal range.

596
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,640
The blood pressure is a bit high.

597
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,800
I’ll give him some

598
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
hypotensive drugs.

599
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,400
Monitor the intracranial pressure,

600
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,480
or we can’t give him surgery.

601
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,720
Okay.

602
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:18,960
Xiaoxiao.

603
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,400
Change patients

604
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,440
on the 27th and 28th beds

605
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,600
to the secondary care

606
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,430
and tell their family

607
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,960
to do some hand massage for them.

608
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,740
-All right?
-Okay.

609
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,040
And take this.

610
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,960
Does he come for you?

611
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,240
I don’t think so.

612
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,800
He was waving at you.

613
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,560
Is he the one

614
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,360
who followed you to the meeting room

615
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,600
and gave you

616
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,520
the vest?

617
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,560
Crazy girl.

618
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,040
Go. Go. Go.

619
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,920
What brings you here again?

620
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,520
Thank you.

621
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,840
He took it back.

622
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,840
Why did he take it back?

623
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,440
I guess

624
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,240
you don’t have a boyfriend.

625
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,320
So what?

626
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,840
I haven’t asked you

627
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,320
why did you send me

628
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,320
a vest?

629
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,440
They all laugh at me now.

630
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,640
Is that funny?

631
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,880
Only a crazy man would

632
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,480
give others a vest.

633
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,360
If you want to give me the certificate,

634
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:38,080
you just give me a certificate.

635
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,600
Why did you put it within the vest?

636
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,480
Is it too big for you?

637
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,360
Where is Xiaochao’s ward?

638
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,760
He is in a general ward now.

639
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,520
I’ll take you there.

640
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,560
Okay.

641
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,400
You’re doing well.

642
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,320
You could speak now only after
a week in bed.

643
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,720
The doctor even said

644
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,000
the special policeman

645
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,680
was expectedly strong.

646
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,240
I...

647
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,880
I’ll have a speedy recovery.

648
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,040
You will.

649
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,320
Xia,

650
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,480
why did you come here?

651
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,920
We heard about

652
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,480
Xiaochao’s story

653
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,000
and I was sent on half
of our television crew

654
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,360
to visit the hero.

655
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,840
Keep your voice down.

656
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,640
He hasn’t fully recovered yet.

657
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,600
Why did you bring so many things?

658
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,440
Can I put them here?

659
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,520
Let me help you.

660
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,200
No problem.

661
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,400
Do you have time?

662
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,920
We can have lunch together.

663
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,800
I need to stay here

664
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:53,840
to keep him company.

665
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,120
I don’t have time

666
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,760
for lunch.

667
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:58,920
Okay, it doesn’t matter.

668
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,720
I’ll be here with you.

669
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,360
Is there anything

670
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,770
-I can help with?
-No, you don’t have to.

671
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,750
There is nothing

672
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,040
you can do.

673
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,960
Who says there’s nothing to do?

674
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,400
Captain Xing.

675
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,320
You can leave now and I’ll stay here.

676
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,440
That’s fine.

677
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,400
Now

678
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,200
do you have time for lunch?

679
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:23,780
I just remember that

680
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,760
I have a training course later.

681
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,720
See her off.

682
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,160
Well...

683
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,480
Okay.

684
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,600
Let’s go.

685
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,480
Wish you an early recovery.

686
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:35,920
See you.

687
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,200
Come on!

688
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,760
Text me on WeChat if you need me.

689
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,480
How can I text you?
That’s interesting.

690
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,080
Why do you keep following me?

691
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,400
I’m going back to the base.

692
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,920
What a coincidence!
I’m going there, too.

693
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,080
Haven’t you been there

694
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,040
last time to interview us?

695
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,520
I will do the training when I’m back.

696
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,440
Just like last time.

697
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,760
I’m not going to watch you
do your training.

698
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,000
I’m going to find Captain Hao.

699
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,720
He doesn’t have time.

700
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,760
Who said it?

701
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,580
(Captain Hao)

702
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,400
Hello, Captain Hao.

703
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,080
Hello.

704
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,520
This is Xia.

705
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,440
Our program team

706
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,240
just had a discussion today

707
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,840
and I have something to ask you.

708
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,280
Are you available for
a talk in your office?

709
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,160
Sure.

710
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,880
But it can’t be too long.

711
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,440
Fine. See you later.

712
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,120
Let’s go.

713
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,080
Get on.

714
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,880
Be careful.

715
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,680
Drive slowly. I’m scared.

716
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,320
Okay.

717
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,640
Don’t you think

718
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,560
Shu Wenbo is obtuse?

719
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,200
The girl has been attracted to him.

720
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,920
Is he going to stay single
for the rest of his life?

721
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,960
Don’t laugh.

722
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,320
Xing,

723
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,840
how is my mother?

724
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,360
Everything is fine.

725
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,120
I didn’t tell her this.

726
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,360
Has your arm been washed?

727
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,920
No need.

728
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,920
What’re you saying?

729
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,200
Don’t be too polite to me.

730
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,880
We’re both men.

731
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,520
No need for it. Brother.

732
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,320
Why did you call me brother?

733
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,560
No need.

734
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:42,780
What’s up?

735
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:43,320
My head...

736
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,520
You have a headache?

737
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,680
Dr. Mi. Dr. Mi.

738
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,280
I feel pressure in my head.

739
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,120
His head hurts.

740
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,400
I’ll find Director Shao

741
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,600
and give him a CT scan.

742
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,880
You go borrow a wheelchair.
Be quick.

743
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:55,600
Okay.

744
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,080
Excuse me.
Please make room for us.

745
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:05,840
Sorry.

746
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,720
Excuse me.

747
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,900
Excuse me. Sorry.

748
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:08,910
-What’s the matter with you?
-This patient,

749
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,480
he has an emergency,

750
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,880
so he will go
to the emergency entrance.

751
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,080
(Examination Room 3-CT)
Emergency entrance?

752
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,360
You’re wearing a white coat.

753
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,440
I’m afraid you’re making
an exception for him.

754
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,200
We’re following

755
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:19,840
the rules in the hospital.

756
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,960
Please understand.

757
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,040
Understand?

758
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,320
Then who will understand me?

759
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,520
My wife has her arm broken

760
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,560
and we’ve been waiting here

761
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,040
for over two hours.

762
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,120
Forget it.

763
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,080
Since we’ve been waiting this long,

764
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,200
it won’t matter
if we let them in first.

765
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,240
No.

766
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,520
You’ve been waiting so long,

767
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,720
and what if they can’t reset your bone

768
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,600
because it’s been too late?

769
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,400
Sir,

770
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,240
this patient

771
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,240
just had a craniotomy.

772
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,160
Please let them in

773
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,600
and I’ll stay here

774
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,480
to explain it

775
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,720
to you, right?

776
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,600
I said no.

777
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,440
Don’t pick a fight.

778
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,480
What the hell’s wrong with it?

779
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,400
You offended us
and you dare to complain about it?

780
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,280
Do you think you were right
to jump the queue?

781
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,280
Do you want a fight?

782
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,300
I will push him in

783
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,190
for an examination.

784
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,920
-Come and have a look.
-The doctor hit me.

785
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,360
He jumped the queue

786
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,800
and hit me.

787
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,750
The doctor hit me.

788
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:07,720
(Doctor jumped the queue and hit others)
Come and have a look.

789
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,970
(We must investigate into it.)
No shooting, stop.

790
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,020
(Police)

791
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,160
No worries.

792
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,200
I’m not

793
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,400
that weak.

794
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,200
You dislike me?

795
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,040
No.

796
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,680
I didn’t know I would

797
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,240
come to the police station one day.

798
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,560
Just state what happened

799
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,560
to the policemen.

800
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,440
It’s not that serious.

801
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,960
Just tell me

802
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:36,800
if anyone makes trouble with you.

803
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,000
Okay.

804
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,320
Why not let me see you off?

805
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,760
No need. A taxi just comes.

806
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,520
I’ll go. See you.

807
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,200
Can’t it be a coincidence?

808
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,640
Sir, can you take me?

809
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,400
Sure.

810
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,160
This is the patient’s
complaint against you.

811
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,440
This is the hospital’s

812
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,920
response to it.

813
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,220
(Letter of Notification
to Dr. Mi Ka of the Neurosurgery)

814
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,840
(Transferred to the ER
from Neurosurgery.)

815
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,080
Do you have any questions?

816
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,840
A complaint won’t be that serious,

817
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,480
but this has gone viral

818
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,400
on the Internet,

819
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,680
which may affect

820
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,920
our hospital in the year-end’s

821
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:42,840
spiritual civilization evaluation.

822
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,560
We may not be able to

823
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,280
secure the top-three place.

824
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,720
I will bear the consequence.

825
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,360
But I want to know

826
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,760
is it a decision made

827
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,600
by Director Shao

828
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,520
to have me transferred to the ER?

829
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,000
This is the hospital’s decision.

830
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,000
Director Shao agrees.

831
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,800
I see. Director He.

832
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,120
Thank you.

833
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,280
How is it?

834
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,000
Let me see.

835
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,600
Transferred to the ER?

836
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,640
Is it that serious?

837
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,480
No worries.

838
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,720
They just want to

839
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,960
train me more.

840
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:38,880
So I can take shifts

841
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,040
with you. Isn’t it good?

842
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,240
I’ll pick up my things.

843
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,640
No worries.

844
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,760
You’re good.

845
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,200
You’re famous now.

846
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,440
I never thought that

847
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,440
you would earn us merits

848
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,760
in such a manner.

849
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,480
They’re talking nonsense.

850
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,080
You must not believe in them.

851
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,360
You dare defend yourself?

852
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,040
A special policeman picked up

853
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:09,880
a fight in Renxin Hospital.

854
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,000
They have the right

855
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,160
to gossip about it

856
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,360
and make it sound true.

857
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,200
It wasn’t started by me.

858
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,560
How can they say I hit him?

859
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,480
Don’t forget that

860
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,640
you’re a special policeman.

861
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,040
I know

862
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,400
that’s because of Xiaochao.

863
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,960
But you are not

864
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,800
a hotheaded man, are you?

865
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,360
I have nothing to say.

866
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,560
As it’s so said on the Internet,

867
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,200
though our seniors will

868
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,120
understand you,

869
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,880
what about the common people?

870
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,560
Can you explain it to them

871
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,800
one by one?

872
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,480
As a policeman,

873
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,640
you should be strict

874
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,480
with yourself.

875
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,840
You are not alone.

876
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,240
What you did is

877
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,160
on behalf of the whole unit.

878
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,640
I was wrong.

879
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,560
Well.

880
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,000
Don’t go to the hospital

881
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:57,880
for the following days,

882
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,440
unless someone

883
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,680
may have found out your identity.

884
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,720
What about Xiaochao?

885
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,640
Do you think

886
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,680
we don’t have men who can

887
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,920
take care of him

888
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,680
except you?

889
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,230
Tomorrow,

890
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,040
a special police unit

891
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:11,920
from our neighboring city

892
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,400
will come to visit

893
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,400
our Tiger Assault Team.

894
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,190
It’s a contactless training.

895
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,920
I’ll leave the job to you.

896
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,630
Yes, I won’t fail you.

897
00:34:46,020 --> 00:35:03,420
(Neurosurgery, Mi Ka)

898
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:08,840
For this patient,

899
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,720
you need to pay attention that

900
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,840
-his cranial pressure can’t be high.
-Hello, Director Shao.

901
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,200
Director Shao.

902
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,240
There are two pieces
of A4 paper 50m ahead of you.

903
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,840
One with circles on it.

904
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,040
One doesn’t.

905
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,280
Imagine the paper with circles
is the hostage-taker

906
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,160
and the other is the hostage.

907
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,280
Each of you

908
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,480
will only have one chance.

909
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,000
So,

910
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,040
you must hit the hostage-taker.

911
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,120
This is our country’s self-made

912
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,280
accurate sniper rifle.

913
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,920
It won’t be worse than

914
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,440
the Russian T5000.

915
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,900
(Target)

916
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,960
A good sniper

917
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,960
should be highly skilled

918
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,280
but also has a stable mind.

919
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,680
You must

920
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,960
feel the rifle

921
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,920
as a part of your body.

922
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,120
Do you understand?

923
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,160
Yes.

924
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,000
Okay, let’s begin.

925
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:42,380
(Xiaoman)

926
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,240
Xiaoman.

927
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,800
Mi Ka, have you gone to bed?

928
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,920
No, I just arrived home,

929
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,320
did some cleanup,

930
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,360
and took a shower.

931
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,320
What’s up?

932
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,280
You sound upset.

933
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,240
No.

934
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,760
Perhaps I just

935
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,080
haven’t had enough food.

936
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,400
Are you exhausted?

937
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,920
It must be stressful
to work in the ND.

938
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,320
Yes.

939
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,520
I have a lot to learn.

940
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,960
It’s a stressful job.

941
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,520
How do you do?

942
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,960
Everything is fine here.

943
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,000
You don’t need to worry about me.

944
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,280
Take care of yourself.

945
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,520
Fine.

946
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,840
Take care of yourself

947
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,360
and follow the doctor’s instructions.

948
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,200
I’ll hang up then.

949
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,200
I need to rest.

950
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,600
Goodnight.

951
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,280
Come in.

952
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,400
Captain Xing.

953
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,680
How is Xiaochao?

954
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:56,880
He is good.

955
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,400
The draw is removed.

956
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,480
And the doctor said

957
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,640
the test result was good, too.

958
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,400
Fine.

959
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,640
What is this?

960
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,280
A training plan for them.

961
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,640
(Training Plan)
Several robberies have happened

962
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,160
around the gold processing plant
in the south.

963
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,600
I’ll make a scheme to deal with them.

964
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,280
Go ahead.

965
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,440
I’ll leave you alone.

966
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,680
Have you seen anyone else
in the hospital?

967
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,680
No.

968
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,360
In our unit, just me

969
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,160
has gone to the hospital.

970
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,200
I didn’t mean our unit.

971
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:27,960
I mean the...

972
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,840
Who?

973
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:30,880
It was only me.

974
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,720
Only I have gone

975
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,880
-to the hospital.
-You can leave now.

976
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,880
Is he being silly on purpose?

977
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,900
(Emergency)

978
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,570
Brother.

979
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,950
-What happened?
-Brother, please wake up.

980
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:15,540
What happened?

981
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,120
Brother.

982
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:16,830
What happened?

983
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,480
Brother.

984
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,720
-Brother.
-What’s up?

985
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,400
Doctor, please check on him.
He just fainted.

986
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,120
Let me see.

987
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,920
-How is he?
-What disease he has?

988
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:27,960
He has a heart disease.

989
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,600
He said he felt pain
in the chest this morning.

990
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,840
Anything else?

991
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,840
No.

992
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,040
Excuse me.

993
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,080
What’s up?

994
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,280
This patient has dilated pupils,

995
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,080
a weak pulse
and decreased breathing.

996
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,200
Which department do you work for?

997
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,560
I’ve just been transferred
to the ER today.

998
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,440
My name is Mi Ka.

999
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,440
Send him to the first aid room.

1000
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,160
Okay.

1001
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,400
What’s going on?

1002
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,220
Dr. Zhou,

1003
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,880
this is our new doctor Mi Ka.

1004
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,320
The patient fainted outside.

1005
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,080
He has a heart disease.

1006
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,040
Now he’s short of breath
and has a weak pulse.

1007
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,280
Why a heart patient

1008
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,240
was sent to the ER?

1009
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,400
He has a cut on his hand.

1010
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,520
He fainted when

1011
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,120
he was waiting in the ER.

1012
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,640
It looks like a heart attack.

1013
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,440
Run an ECG test
and monitor his condition.

1014
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,680
Mi Ka, give him some oxygen.

1015
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,040
Manman, administer into his veins.

1016
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:09,580
-Okay.
-Well.

1017
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,260
Move him onto the bed.

1018
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:10,950
Here you are.

1019
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,400
Sir.

1020
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,880
What’s your name? Sir.

1021
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,440
Sir.

1022
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,960
He is unconscious.

1023
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,680
Damn it!

1024
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,960
He has ventricular fibrillation.

1025
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:25,920
Ventricular fibrillation?

1026
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:26,760
Go fetch an AED.

1027
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,430
Yes.

1028
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,420
(Manual Defibrillation)

1029
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,520
200 J. Make room for me.

1030
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,560
The heart starts again.

1031
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,880
That’s great.

1032
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,640
Again, ventricular fibrillation.

1033
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,160
Continue.

1034
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,240
300 J.

1035
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,000
Has it come back?

1036
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,560
Yes, the heart starts.

1037
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:28,880
What’s up?

1038
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,640
Don’t move!

1039
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,240
-Sir!

1040
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:31,880
-Sir.
-Relax yourself.

1041
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,160
-We’re saving your life.
-Relax.

1042
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:33,920
Hold him.

1043
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,640
-Quick.
-Tie him up.

1044
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,760
Quick.

1045
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,380
Sir, no worries.

1046
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,040
You try to hold him.

1047
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,160
I’ll find Director Wei.

1048
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,160
Okay.

1049
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,280
Director Wei.

1050
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,720
How is he?

1051
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,680
The heart starts.

1052
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,360
How many?

1053
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,360
178 per minute.

1054
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,080
And the blood pressure is 71 over 42.

1055
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,160
What medicines have you given him?

1056
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,880
We’ve injected two doses of Cordarone.
