Yan, are you okay?

97
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,000
-Be quiet!
-Yan!

98
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,760
Yan!

99
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,840
What’s wrong with him?

100
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,520
Please,

101
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,920
he has a heart attack.

102
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,270
Stop.

103
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,720
A hostage has a seizure.

104
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,760
Stop and wait.

105
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,070
Roger.

106
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,960
-He has a heart attack.
-Speak.

107
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,280
Please help him.

108
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,040
Who can help him?

109
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,520
Yan!

110
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,760
I...

111
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,760
I’m a doctor.

112
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,480
Yan!

113
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,400
What’s wrong with him?

114
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,560
How is he?

115
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,200
Faint breathing.

116
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,960
Can’t feel carotid artery pulse.

117
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,720
Maybe an acute myocardial infarction.

118
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,600
Please.

119
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,320
Shut up.

120
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,520
He should be sent
to the hospital immediately.

121
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,000
-Or he will die.
-Shut up.

122
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,640
Yan.

123
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,280
Please help him.

124
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,200
Shut up!

125
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,240
It’s true.

126
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,680
He may die some minutes later.

127
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,160
Believe I’ll kill you right now?

128
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,380
Keep down.

129
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:35,720
Shut up.

130
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,200
Judging by the situation inside,

131
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,760
everyone follows the command

132
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,040
of the NO.1.

133
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,840
Everyone,

134
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,240
the robbers are in a rage.

135
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,080
-Ready to attack.
-Don’t move.

136
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,080
-Keep down!
-Ten, nine,

137
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,920
eight, seven,

138
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,920
six, five,

139
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,040
four, three,

140
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,120
two, one.

141
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,080
Go!

142
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,800
They have grenades.

143
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,000
Get out of the way.

144
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,280
Rescue the wounded.

145
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,760
Remain in your place!

146
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,200
Come here.

147
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,280
All of you step back,

148
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,440
or else I’ll kill her right now.

149
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,720
I mean it.

150
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,880
Step back.

151
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,400
Everyone steps back.

152
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,880
I’ll shoot.

153
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,040
Step back.

154
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,560
Ambush Unit 2, go.

155
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,600
Go!

156
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,160
Quick.

157
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,120
Run.

158
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,600
You’re safe. Run.

159
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,800
Run.

160
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,760
Quick.

161
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,440
Go.

162
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,520
Remain in your place,

163
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,640
or else I’ll blow it up
and die with you.

164
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,960
Drop your gun.

165
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,120
Drop it!

166
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,440
Drop your gun.

167
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,480
Drop it!

168
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,720
Grip it.

169
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,880
Grip it and it won’t blow up.

170
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,360
You are lying.

171
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,680
He pulled out the pin.

172
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,680
I saw it. It’ll blow up.

173
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,640
It won’t blow up even without the pin

174
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,400
as long as you grip it tightly.

175
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,000
It doesn’t blow up now, right?

176
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:34,600
You’re not lying?

177
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,600
No.

178
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,000
What should I do?

179
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,280
Grip it and I’ll get you out of here.

180
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,920
And then?

181
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,320
Blow me up in another place?

182
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,200
You won’t die.

183
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,400
I’ll take you to
an anti-explosion place.

184
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,760
You’re brave.

185
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,760
What do you do?

186
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,000
A surgeon. I graduated not long ago.

187
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,760
A surgeon should have a steady hand.

188
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,720
I lose control of my hands.

189
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,520
Because the neuroendocrine

190
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,320
responds to
the sympathetic nervous system.

191
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,320
You’re good at your lesson.

192
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,920
But if you keep producing it,

193
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,160
we’ll both die here.

194
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,760
I will stop it.

195
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,600
What’s your name?

196
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,640
Mi Ka.

197
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,240
I don’t know such a surname.

198
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,760
My father is surnamed Mi.

199
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,080
What can I do with it?

200
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,840
Doctor Mi,

201
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,280
listen.

202
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,480
I need you to stand up

203
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,560
and follow me to the outside.

204
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,880
I can’t. I can’t walk.

205
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,440
I fear that it will blow up

206
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,160
once I move.

207
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,560
If I get too nervous...

208
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,360
I was here to buy gifts

209
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,200
for my parents’ wedding anniversary.

210
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,560
I haven’t gotten married.

211
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,400
I haven’t gone out with anyone.

212
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,840
I can’t die here and now.

213
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,440
No, I can’t.

214
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,880
Doctor Mi,

215
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,880
look at me.

216
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,680
-Look at me.
-I don’t want to...

217
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,080
Doctor Mi,

218
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,640
this is not that complex.

219
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,960
If you walk out with me,

220
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,480
perhaps we can have the hot-pot

221
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,760
together tonight,

222
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,360
but if you don’t,

223
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,800
we’ll just die.

224
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,880
Do you understand?

225
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,080
Believe me.

226
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,600
I’m here

227
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,400
and you’ll be fine.

228
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,440
Slowly.

229
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,720
Stand up slowly.

230
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:49,840
Good.

231
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,000
I’m scared.

232
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,320
Hold me.

233
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,080
Anti-explosion Unit, get ready.

234
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,720
Are you ready?

235
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,960
When I count to three,

236
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,640
you release it and I hold it.

237
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,520
From your thumb.

238
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,480
One.

239
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,600
Two.

240
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,880
Three.

241
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,560
Good.

242
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,160
The same to the rest.

243
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,160
Your index finger.

244
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,240
One.

245
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,120
Two.

246
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,640
Three.

247
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,600
Good.

248
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,200
Your middle finger.

249
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,840
One.

250
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,720
Two.

251
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:29,960
Three.

252
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,040
The last two fingers.

253
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,520
Your ring finger.

254
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,280
One.

255
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,480
Two.

256
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,480
Three.

257
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,280
The last one. Hold on.

258
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,560
One.

259
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,320
Two.

260
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,440
Three.

261
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,960
Then what about you?

262
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,560
I’m the police.

263
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:44,220
(Two years later)

264
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:49,780
(Anthropotomy, Neurosurgery)

265
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:30,580
(Brain Map)

266
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,720
Did you see

267
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,160
my training notice?

268
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,640
I know you will forget it.

269
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,520
So I have had put it in your bag.

270
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,040
What will become of me

271
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,720
if without you?

272
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,440
The emergency training

273
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,080
will last for days.

274
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,440
Take care of yourself.

275
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,920
I know, Doctor Mi.

276
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,600
You’d better have the meal now,
or you’ll be late.

277
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,800
Vitamin, protein, and carbohydrate.

278
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,120
A perfect diet.

279
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,120
My God.

280
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,760
Whoever marries you

281
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,000
will surely be happy.

282
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:20,840
Xiaoman,

283
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,200
I’ll cure your disease

284
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,200
someday.

285
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,120
I live up to my words.

286
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,400
It’s the third time that
it’s come back to me.

287
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,080
I’ve tried everything,

288
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,520
surgery, chemotherapy,
and radiotherapy.

289
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,720
I won’t like any surgery

290
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,000
before the death.

291
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,400
I know.

292
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,000
If you want to make something happen,

293
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,160
you’ll fight to the last moment.

294
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,680
But sometimes I think,

295
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,400
just let me go

296
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,840
if the treatment would only

297
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,760
leave me in pain.

298
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,760
No.

299
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,800
When I was bitten by a dog,

300
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,440
you saved me

301
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,240
and got injured with a big scar.

302
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,040
Now it’s my turn to save you.

303
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,880
I won’t let you go.

304
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:32,840
What’s up?

305
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,480
What happened?

306
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,720
Be quiet!

307
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,440
Drop your head.

308
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,840
Be quiet!

309
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,640
Turn around.

310
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,400
Keep down. I mean you.

311
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,280
Keep down.

312
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,800
Don’t let me hear any fuss from you.

313
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:04,960
Not a sound.

314
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,120
Keep down.

315
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,240
I’ll shoot him if anyone moves.

316
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,560
Do you like to play the hero?

317
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,840
Your behavior

318
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,120
has killed all of you

319
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,360
in this flight.

320
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,080
If this was

321
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,920
a real situation,

322
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,760
the crew

323
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,480
had made

324
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,640
four terrible mistakes

325
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,840
during the drill.

326
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,220
(Emergency Rescue Training)

327
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,320
The training is no more than

328
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,880
a perfunctory effort.

329
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,520
Is it necessary

330
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,520
to issue a certificate of completion

331
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,640
and send us

332
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,520
to the police training base?

333
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,960
It’s a collaboration with the police.
Do you understand?

334
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,240
Doctors need to

335
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,040
learn emergency rescue

336
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,880
and must obtain

337
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,000
the certificate of completion.

338
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,760
All new doctors need to learn.

339
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,880
Do you want to be the first?

340
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,760
The first what?

341
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,440
First,

342
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,160
when the plane was hijacked,

343
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,560
no one pressed the alarm

344
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,600
to inform the cockpit.

345
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,560
The first one
who fails to get the certificate.

346
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,680
How can I fail to get it?

347
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:29,680
Yanshan,

348
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,880
the training is just like

349
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,240
the military training

350
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,720
we had in the university.

351
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,600
Second,

352
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,000
no one stood up

353
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,640
to communicate with the robbers

354
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,760
and find out their objective,

355
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,000
or stabilize their emotions.

356
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,640
Such as running,

357
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,120
goose-stepping,

358
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,760
having the meal and singing
before getting together.

359
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,040
♪Union is strength♪

360
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:47,700
That’s true.

361
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,600
Look at this place.

362
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,440
Like an old house
with nothing special.

363
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,280
I dare say

364
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,320
they don’t have any high-tech here.

365
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,800
Third,

366
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,400
you forgot to protect the passengers.

367
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,680
A crying child might

368
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,440
easily infuriate the robbers,

369
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,840
so, you need to move

370
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,080
children to a place

371
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,160
far away from the robbers.

372
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,600
Thank you.

373
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,840
Damn it!

374
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:20,880
What’s up?

375
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,080
This is

376
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,880
Director He of our hospital.

377
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,320
I heard that her husband

378
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,560
is the chief of the Special Police,

379
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,120
and that’s why

380
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,520
we’ve come here

381
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,320
to have the emergency rescue training.

382
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,080
How dare you keep grumbling?

383
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,280
Fourth,

384
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,120
one member

385
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,520
tried to attack the robber

386
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,240
when he was not sure of winning,

387
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,280
putting people and the place in danger.

388
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,600
The most important thing

389
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,480
when a plane is hijacked

390
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,600
is not to irritate the robbers.

391
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,320
The biennial training

392
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,760
is a tradition

393
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,280
of our hospital.

394
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,800
Through the training,

395
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,120
you’ll learn the necessary skills,

396
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,160
so that you can

397
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,440
provide effective

398
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,720
on-site rescue

399
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,600
and the timely medical care

400
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,600
in a natural disaster

401
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,200
or mass traumatic event.

402
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,760
I’ll first introduce you

403
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,160
the instructor of the training,

404
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,400
the deputy captain
of the Tiger Assault Team,

405
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,880
Mr. Shu Wenbo.

406
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:17,840
Let’s welcome him.

407
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,080
Hello, everyone.

408
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,640
I’m the assistant instructor

409
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,360
of this training.

410
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,120
I’m Shu Wenbo.

411
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,640
Your chief instructor

412
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,280
is our captain Xing Kelei.

413
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,200
Thank you, everyone.
Thank you for the cooperation.

414
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,040
That man is handsome.

415
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,760
I heard his name is Xing Kelei.

416
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,920
He is the captain.

417
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,880
If I was held hostage

418
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,080
by such a handsome man...

419
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:44,760
First of all,

420
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,440
on behalf of the Tiger Assault Team,

421
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,440
I welcome you on board.

422
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,200
Then,

423
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,840
I’ll let you know

424
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,080
the content of the training…

425
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,560
Confiscate his cigarettes.

426
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,400
Yes.

427
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,160
It’s clearly stated
in the training manual

428
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,200
that smoking is forbidden
during the training.

429
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,760
I’ll keep them for you.

430
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,720
Take them back after the training.

431
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,600
No need, brother.

432
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,600
You can keep them.

433
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,160
I’m your instructor,

434
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,320
not your brother.

435
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,840
During this emergency rescue training,

436
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,480
you’ll be cut off from the outside

437
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,680
for two weeks.

438
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,560
Theories account
for thirty percent in your score,

439
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,440
and practices seventy percent.

440
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,040
The course includes

441
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,480
physical training, basic rescue,

442
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,640
trauma care,

443
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,960
and emergency drills.

444
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,640
We are doctors.

445
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,040
Do we need them

446
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,440
to teach us trauma care?

447
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,680
Exactly. It’s a waste of time.

448
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,640
Is everything clear to you?

449
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,400
Speak.

450
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,520
Can we ask for leave?

451
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,440
It’s a contactless training course

452
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,640
and sometimes we may have

453
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,840
urgent action at night,

454
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,040
so, no one can leave

455
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,560
without a reasonable cause.

456
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,840
You must ask the chief instructor

457
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,520
to sign your leave note if you have to.

458
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,040
So, I can ask you to sign.

459
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,480
Let me say it again.

460
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,600
The chief instructor

461
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,280
is our captain Xing Kelei.

462
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,040
Now, everyone,

463
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,800
go back and change your clothes.

464
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,240
I’ll see you in the playground
ten minutes later.

465
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,520
Everyone.

466
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,280
Stand at attention.

467
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,400
Dress right, dress.

468
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,920
Front.

469
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,360
At ease.

470
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:05,680
Stop.

471
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,560
Come here.

472
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,500
I… I…

473
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,280
Hurry.

474
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,240
Use the strength
of your waist and abdomen.

475
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,240
One more.

476
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,000
Cheating is shameful.

477
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:41,880
You two,

478
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,320
do another thirty sit-ups.

479
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,400
Have some water, girls.

480
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,440
-Take it.
-Thank you.

481
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,440
No.

482
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:54,960
Chen Tao,

483
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,080
why don’t you bring us

484
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:56,620
a bottle of water?

485
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,240
Exactly.

486
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,440
No way.

487
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,840
My legs can’t even

488
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,440
support myself.

489
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,240
I can’t fetch water for you.

490
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,880
Yanshan, I just asked the instructor.

491
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,160
He said we can have lunch soon.

492
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,200
I’ve brought some beef paste.

493
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,240
I’ll share it with you later.

494
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,280
No. I’m on a vegetarian diet.

495
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,840
Since when?

496
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,360
It’s none of your business.

497
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,480
Won’t you

498
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,560
ask for leave this afternoon?

499
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,960
Think about it.

500
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:20,920
This is

501
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,240
a contactless training.

502
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,600
Shu Sir

503
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,120
won’t let you go that easily.

504
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,280
I didn’t expect it would be so strict.

505
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,280
But Dr. Shao Yuhan

506
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,520
is a neurosurgery specialist

507
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,120
of the globally renowned

508
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,080
Allen Medical Center.

509
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,400
This time he will come to our hospital

510
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,000
and make exchanges with us.

511
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,080
I must see him.

512
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,360
Only he can help Xiaoman.

513
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,520
Then you can only hope

514
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,240
that “poker face” could
make an exception for you.

515
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,160
Don’t you hear that

516
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,200
the “poker face” is nothing.

517
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,720
Xing Kelei is more horrible than him.

518
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,360
Who is that?

519
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,480
Our chief instructor,

520
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,360
Xing Kelei.

521
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,960
Nicknamed the Destroyer.

522
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,160
He takes it as his duty

523
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,440
to destroy every trainee.

524
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,280
Two of our seniors nearly

525
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,840
failed to get their certificates
of completion.

526
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,720
It’s said that

527
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,760
he is the youngest captain

528
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,440
since the founding
of the Tiger Assault Team.

529
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,200
Seems he’s won the First Merit,

530
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,520
so, he got promoted.

531
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,840
Is he really that amazing?

532
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:07,960
I tell you

533
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,640
the most amazing special police

534
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,320
I’ve ever seen
can fight against heavy odds

535
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,520
and keep a steady hand

536
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,440
even when faced with a grenade.

537
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,480
Xing Kelei will

538
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,560
be dwarfed

539
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,040
if compared to him.

540
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,760
Anyway, the world has justice

541
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,680
while he might be merciless.

542
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,040
Dear Mi Ka,

543
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:24,720
I wish you good luck.

544
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,240
You must not be...

545
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,440
Damn it! My name is Mi Ka.

546
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,360
He’ll likely bar my way.

547
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,240
Likely.

548
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,440
Gather round

549
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,320
and get ready for lunch.

550
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,680
Shu Sir,

551
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,600
uh...

552
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,920
we don’t feel well today.

553
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:39,840
Can we ask for leave

554
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,680
this afternoon?

555
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,960
We not only train

556
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,640
your physical strength,

557
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,880
but your willpower,

558
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,440
so, you can’t...

559
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,440
Sir,

560
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,760
we both are

561
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,240
on the period.

562
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,800
We’ve gotten our clothes dirty.

563
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,040
Fine.

564
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,360
You can go.

565
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,120
-Thank you, sir.

566
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,760
A good job.

567
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,960
Of course.

568
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,120
I’m not a capable woman

569
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,800
except when it comes to men,

570
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,000
especially one

571
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,800
who easily feel embarrassed

572
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,000
when talking to women.

573
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,200
They’re the easiest to deal with.

574
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,980
(Simulated training cabin)

575
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,720
Captain Xing,

576
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,480
thank you very much.

577
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,160
Both the two countries

578
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,640
on this international flight’s route

579
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,120
are the most violent regions,

580
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,240
and their airport management

581
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,280
is a mess.

582
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,800
There were two accidents that

583
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,120
someone brought the prohibited goods

584
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,240
and weapons onto the plane.

585
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,480
It matters significantly to us

586
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,800
that you’ve come and given us

587
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,080
the anti-hijacking training,

588
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,400
which further ensures

589
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,040
the safety of our flights.

590
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,080
It’s our duty

591
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,080
to collaborate with you.

592
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,280
Luo Ting and Li Nian

593
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,000
will be here this afternoon

594
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,720
to teach them some tactics.

595
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,840
I have work to do.

596
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,460
I’ll take my leave.

597
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,080
Fine. Goodbye.

598
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:48,600
Hello.

599
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,200
Hello, Luo Sir.

600
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:49,920
Xing Sir.

601
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,460
Hello, Li Sir.

602
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,120
Xing Sir.

603
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:51,720
Thank you for your job.

604
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,480
May I

605
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,560
have your WeChat?

606
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,920
Yes. So, we can ask you for advice

607
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,240
when necessary.

608
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,400
Yes, I also want to befriend you.

609
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,480
-Me, too.

610
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,400
Okay.

611
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,760
Thank you, Xing Sir.

612
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,800
Thank you.

613
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,080
I’ll leave it to you.

614
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:05,760
That’s what we should do.

615
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,340
Hello.

616
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:18,800
How is the training?

617
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,240
I’ll be back right away.

618
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:23,960
The rear ones.

619
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:24,920
Please catch up.

620
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,600
Everyone,

621
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,440
keep running.

622
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,240
Hold on and you’ll make it.

623
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,560
Hold on.

624
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,560
Come on!

625
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,400
Catch up.

626
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,880
I give up.

627
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,600
Come on!

628
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,760
No worries.

629
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,520
Failure is the mother of success.

630
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,600
I tell you...

631
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,600
I...

632
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,400
Hold on.

633
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,880
I can’t run anymore.

634
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,760
I must run.

635
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,120
I need to ask for leave to Shu Sir

636
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,800
after I finish it.

637
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,240
Is she a marathon runner?

638
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,600
Don’t you know?

639
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,760
Shu Sir,

640
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,520
I have an urgent matter
this afternoon.

641
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,520
Could you please let me go?

642
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,640
It’s clearly stated
in the training manual

643
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,480
that you need to submit
the letter to the chief instructor.

644
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,640
Where is he?

645
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,680
He hasn’t arrived.

646
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,000
He is not responsible then.

647
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,480
You can’t hold me back
for that reason.

648
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,280
Please help me.

649
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:58,700
(Shu Wenbo)

650
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,900
(A Missed Call from Shu Wenbo)

651
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:05,760
He doesn’t answer me.

652
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,000
Can you send him a WeChat text?

653
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,160
This is not in our rules.

654
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:10,960
Rules are dead

655
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,200
but humans are alive.

656
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,360
Yet disciplines are dead, too.

657
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,520
We must obey disciplines.

658
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,320
Have some water.

659
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,400
I’m not thirsty.

660
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,180
Do have some.

661
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,400
I don’t like it.

662
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,960
Did he agree to let you go?

663
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,240
He didn’t give you

664
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,120
any chance, did he?

665
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,080
No.

666
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,760
I must see Director Shao today.

667
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,560
What can you do?

668
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,280
Run away!

669
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,920
Keep it down.

670
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,560
He just called the roll.

671
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,680
I think he won’t call it again

672
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,920
within a short period.

673
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,280
I’ll find an opportunity to run away

674
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,840
when all of us

675
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,160
are running down the mountain.

676
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,760
Sounds wrong.

677
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,600
I have to try even if it’s wrong.

678
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,360
Gamble on it.

679
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:12,820
(Intercity Bus Terminal)

680
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,040
Quick.

681
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,640
Be careful.

682
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:11,840
Sir.

683
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,080
Why are staring at me?

684
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,440
What’s the hell of it?
A bandit girl?

685
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,080
What do you want?

686
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,760
I must go to the Renxin Hospital.

687
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,280
Could you give me a ride?

688
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,120
I really can’t hail a taxi.

689
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:57,640
Get in.

690
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,680
Thank you.

691
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,040
Why are you there?

692
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,280
I’m a doctor

693
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,680
of the Renxin Hospital.

694
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,560
I’m attending a training

695
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,880
in the Special Police Base.

696
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,240
What job are you doing?

697
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,080
Police.

698
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,840
What a coincidence!

699
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,280
What’s your name?

700
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,200
My name is Mi Ka.

701
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,440
What’s your name?

702
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,000
Mi Ka.

703
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,520
I don’t know such a surname.

704
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,880
My father is surnamed Mi.

705
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,880
What can I do with it?

706
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,480
Mi Ka.

707
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,600
How is your training?

708
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,560
Just some basic

709
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,840
physical training.

710
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,480
Just like some formalities.

711
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,220
Many of us

712
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,760
just want a certificate,

713
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,560
so, we can be given some titles.

714
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,720
Do you feel the same way?

715
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,960
No.

716
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,080
I hope I can learn some skills

717
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,080
that can be used in emergencies.

718
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,520
To meet practical needs
and not bother others.

719
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,800
You’re practical.

720
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,520
Who is your instructor?

721
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,600
Shu Sir.

722
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,040
Is he doing good?

723
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,680
Good. A responsible man.

724
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,200
He may be a little staid.

725
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,400
But I heard that

726
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,360
he is better than that Xing Kelei.

727
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,920
Why?

728
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,200
Xing Kelei is the chief instructor,

729
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,000
but we haven’t seen him all day.

730
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,760
I think he must have been negligent.

731
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:42,880
And we need his signature

732
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,080
if we want to ask for leave.

733
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,800
I narrowly failed to get out of there.

734
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,080
So, you...

735
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,840
I called him later

736
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,800
and asked for leave.

737
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,440
I tell you,

738
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,840
I don’t like….

739
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,800
I don’t like that Xing Kelei, either.

740
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,120
Really?

741
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,800
What do you say of him

742
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,680
in private?

743
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,190
It’s said that he is terrible,

744
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,360
and he took it as his duty

745
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,520
to destroy every one of us.

746
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,800
It’s better to meet a ghost

747
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,760
than him.

748
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,560
Is he your leader?

749
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,880
Why do you suppose

750
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,840
I am his underling?

751
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,190
You look young.

752
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,080
You can’t be a leader.

753
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,800
Why is there a traffic jam?

754
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,400
Are you in a hurry?

755
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,190
I’m afraid I will be late.

756
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,190
Be ready.

757
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,440
Here we are.

758
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,720
By the way,

759
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,840
please don’t tell Xing Kelei

760
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,760
what I told you about him,

761
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,920
or else I’ll be in trouble.

762
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,240
Don’t worry.

763
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,000
I won’t tell anyone.

764
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:19,700
Okay.

765
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,500
And

766
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,840
how should I pay you?

767
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,320
By WeChat?

768
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,000
No need.

769
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,440
I’m not a taxi driver.

770
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,120
Well. Get off.

771
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,800
Thank you very much.

772
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,440
See you again.

773
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,480
Open.

774
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:56,840
Xiaoxiao.

775
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,840
They just began?

776
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,520
Yes.

777
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,640
Doctor Shao

778
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,640
is in the operating room

779
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,920
and the live streaming is ready.

780
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,840
Other doctors are

781
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,520
just discussing it.

782
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,400
Okay.

783
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,000
Hold this.

784
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,480
Mi Ka,

785
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,840
only the department’s

786
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,160
attending doctors and above

787
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,120
can join the meeting.

788
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,000
Is it all right for you to sneak in?

789
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,240
They will focus on

790
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,640
the live-streaming surgery.

791
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,880
No one will notice me.

792
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,200
Let’s begin.

793
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,240
The patient is too young.

794
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,200
I still think it’s too risky.

795
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,120
Around the world,

796
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,560
there are less than one hundred

797
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,640
such cases using awake craniotomy.

798
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,000
It’s hard to
apply numbing medications,

799
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,360
so, the surgery will be difficult.

800
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,680
Mo Xiaohui,

801
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,840
we’ve found

802
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,120
a tumor on the left side,

803
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:01,920
which is very close

804
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,000
to the language area

805
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,160
of your brain,

806
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,160
so, we’ve decided to

807
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,200
wake you up

808
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,480
during the surgery.

809
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,600
Do you understand?

810
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:09,600
Yes.

811
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,100
Okay.

812
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,040
The anesthesia specialist

813
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:11,840
will give you the medications,

814
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,840
and after that,
we’ll access your brain

815
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,240
before we wake you up,

816
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,560
and then we’ll continue the surgery.

817
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,320
Is it okay?

818
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,200
Good.

819
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,840
Relax. It’s not a big surgery.

820
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:21,680
Start the anesthesia.

821
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,400
All right.

822
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:24,540
Yes.

823
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,640
The patient

824
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,760
is too young.

825
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,240
We can’t know

826
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,200
whether he can bear with it,

827
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,640
and makes sure that

828
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,080
such a complex craniotomy surgery

829
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,760
can go smoothly

830
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,800
with him being awake.

831
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,520
The tumor grows

832
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,040
near his sport

833
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,040
and language areas.

834
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,480
If using the conventional method,

835
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,240
the risk will be high

836
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,960
and they may destroy
some of his brain functions.

837
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,160
It’s understandable why

838
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,240
Doctor Shao has chosen
the awake craniotomy.

839
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,600
Now the patient
has fallen into a light sleep.

840
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,840
Low dose anesthesia in surgery

841
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,440
may easily cause epilepsy.

842
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,840
It will be a problem
if he gets a seizure.

843
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,280
Doctor Shao,

844
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,480
the patient’s bone flap
has been removed.

845
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,960
Decrease the depth of anesthesia.

846
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:15,680
All right.

847
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,640
Wash his brain with cold water.

848
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,400
Yes.

849
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,760
If he gets a seizure,

850
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,160
we can apply
the cold saline to parts

851
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,240
to relieve his symptoms.

852
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,560
Jia Li.

853
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,840
Test his left hand.

854
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:48,720
Okay.

855
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,000
Mo Xiaohui,

856
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,720
please try to move your left hand.

857
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:02,880
No problem.

858
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,600
Doctor Shao, he gets a seizure.

859
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:10,880
President,

860
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,280
if it’s the conventional

861
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,800
craniotomy,

862
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,680
he won’t have a seizure.

863
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:16,920
Yes.

864
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,960
If the patient keeps convulsing,

865
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,320
it may hurt

866
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,960
his brain functions.

867
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,720
This is somehow complicated.

868
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,240
Use the cold saline to

869
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,800
reduce the cortical excitability.

870
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,520
The cold saline

871
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,560
is the key.

872
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:40,800
Doctor Shao,

873
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,960
his brain is stable.

874
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,640
Go on.

875
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:46,720
Jia Li.

876
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,680
Test the functions

877
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,600
of his right hand.

878
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,440
Yes.

879
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,240
Mo Xiaohui,

880
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,760
keep a count of
how many times you press it.

881
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,080
Yes.

882
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,240
One.

883
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,120
Two.

884
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,560
Three.

885
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,560
Four.

886
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,720
Five.

887
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,800
Six.

888
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,920
Seven.

889
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:19,960
Eight.

890
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,720
Doctor Shao,

891
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,240
his right hand

892
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,000
has been slightly numb.

893
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,040
Should we stop the operation?

894
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,320
No.

895
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,800
That means

896
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,160
the tumor is very close

897
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,400
to the neurons

898
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,160
controlling his hand.

899
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,400
It’s too risky to continue.

900
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,320
President,

901
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,800
this plan

902
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,720
may be too bold.

903
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,640
Doctor Shao,

904
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,120
we have removed

905
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,320
eighty percent of the tumor.

906
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,880
Should we continue?

907
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,600
Continue.

908
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,640
Yes.

909
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:12,840
Go on.

910
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,600
The surgery is completed.

911
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,920
Increase the depth of anesthesia.

912
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,640
Amazing!

913
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,280
Doctor Shao is not being bold.

914
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,080
He’s taken all precautions

915
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,440
to reduce the percentage

916
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,680
of malignant tumor cells

917
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,360
to less than five percent,

918
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,400
which may

919
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,240
significantly prolong

920
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,800
the patient’s life.

921
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,920
Doctor Shao has come out.

922
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,080
President Zhang.

923
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,440
Doctor Shao,

924
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,600
thank you for your work.

925
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,920
You’ve largely removed

926
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,680
the patient’s

927
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,920
malignant tumor

928
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,320
while securing

929
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,160
his brain functions.

930
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,480
You give him

931
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,880
more days to live on.

932
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,600
Considering the development

933
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,640
of the medical technologies,

934
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,360
I think doctors should

935
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,640
not only try to save patients,

936
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,400
but give them a more decent life.

937
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,360
This is my duty.

938
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:35,880
Doctor Shao,

939
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,160
your hands are so steady

940
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,760
that I hope I can

941
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,400
be as half good as you.

942
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,200
That’s true.

943
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,760
It was breathtaking.

944
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,640
Thankfully that you had a quick mind.

945
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,600
You’re our idol.

946
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,360
Applauding.

947
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,480
Are you Zhang Yang?

948
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,080
Yes.

949
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,400
The patient

950
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,520
is an epileptic.

951
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,600
It’s very likely that

952
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,840
he will have an epileptic fit
during the surgery.

953
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,320
It’s predictable.

954
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,360
So, it was not the quick mind.

955
00:42:58,920 --> 00:42:59,960
We need to

956
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:00,960
take precautions

957
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,080
against every emergency

958
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,800
that could happen.

959
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,440
As for the steady hands,

960
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,600
you can also have them
by practicing,

961
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,240
rather than talking around.

962
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:12,680
Okay, President Zhang,

963
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,200
we should go and see

964
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:13,760
patients in the ICU.

965
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,400
Please.
