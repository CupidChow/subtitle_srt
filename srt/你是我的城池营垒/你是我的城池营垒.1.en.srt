the panel of experts

14

has agree unanimously that

15
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,660
Proposal SK-1 is both innovative

16
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,140
and refreshing.

17
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,860
However, aerospace belongs to
systems engineering.

18
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:21,460
The prerequisite

19
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,580
of your proposal is

20
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,140

00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,370
so quiet today?

26
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,140
Feeling down?

27
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,260
Is it that bad?

28
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:45,780
I’m not someone chatty to begin with.

29
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,860
But during the defense just now,

30
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,100
you were so eloquent.

31
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,140
And now, you look moody.

32
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,140
Why? Discouraged?

33
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,330
Didn’t we

34
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:56,650
anticipate this already?

You’re right.

40
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,540

41

(In the end,)

112
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:48,420
(the smart guy went to)

113
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,450

This is crossing the line!

117
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,260
He can’t slander her like that.

118

to your defense.

121
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,890
(please also tell everyone that)

122
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,170
(Jingjing was in the elite class)

123
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,420
(and she graduated
from a university of Project 211.)

124
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,170
(She did poorly in school?)

125
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,020
(Impossible!)

126
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,420
And now I’d like to ask

127
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,860
the victim in question:

128
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,980
are they real or fake?

129
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,770
Some are real, some are fake.

130
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,100
That one about me being ugly was fake.

131
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,540
I’ve always looked this good, okay?

132
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,210
Also,

133
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,210
he rejected me, yes,

134
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,330
but it wasn’t ugly.

135
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,420
He was really polite.

136
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:34,450
So you admit that

137
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,770
you confessed to him

138
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,610
but got rejected?

139
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:41,260
Yes.

140
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,820
That guy...

141
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,170
(Yu Tu)

142
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:53,860
was really handsome

143
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,580
and really smart.

144
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,650
So did he really

145
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,980
think that you were dumb

146
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,050
and so he chose the other girl over you?

147
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,860
I’m not dumb. You are.

148
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,420
I graduated
from a university of Project 211.

149

(Which jerk said that?)

152
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,610
(You have always been pretty.)

153
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:31,740
(You were just a bit unpolished.)

154
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:39,740
(By the way,)

155
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,370
(I heard from Li Ming that)

156
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,180
(Yu Tu and Xia Qing broke up)

157
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,450
(when they were in
the fourth year of university.)

158
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,810
(They were together for around a year.)

159
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,540
(You still remember Li Ming,)

160
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,100
(our high school friend?)

161
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,980
(He lived in the same area as Yu Tu.)

162
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,300
(Their parents know each other.)

163
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,250
(I heard Yu Tu is now in Shanghai.)

164
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,180
(Yu Tu)

165
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,770
(Speaking of which, Jingjing,)

166
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,620
(do you think Yu Tu
regrets rejecting you?)

167
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,210
(Don’t be this childish.)

168
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:36,860
Yu Tu.

169
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,450
Do you have a moment?

170
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:39,570
I have a question.

171
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,300
Sure, go ahead.

172
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,570
Do you want a girlfriend now?

173
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:46,770
If so,

174
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:47,860
what do you think of me?

175
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,690
(Sorry.)

176
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,300
(I want someone)

177
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,570
(who can work together with me.)

178
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,010
(But who you found)

179
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,980
(didn’t stick with you till the end.)

180
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,620
It’s already 10 PM.

181
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:07,380
Should we

182
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,940
return to Shanghai?

183
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,060
We’ll leave tomorrow morning

184
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,060
and arrive at Hengdian in the afternoon.

185
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:11,860
I’ll ask them

186
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,130
to postpone your scenes.

187
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:14,620
No.

188
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,770
I have ten scenes tomorrow.

189
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,100
Let’s go to Hengdian now.

190
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,420
Ask the driver to drive slowly.

191
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,130
Look how tired you are.

192
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,250
Mr. Wang

193
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,500
Hengdian it is.

194
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,130
No problem.

195
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:24,860
Thank you.

196
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,840
(Class 5 Senior 3)

197
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,810
(An exam?)

198
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,130
(How many calories
does a strawberry have?)

199
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,130
That’s tough.

200
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,540
Even a brainiac won’t know the answer.

201
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,920
(Math)

202
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,920
(Math Exam)

203
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:47,570
Jingjing.

204
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,010
Jingjing.

205
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,180
Wake up!

206
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:54,810
Did you play Honor of Kings?

207
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:58,620
(Xiao Qiao,)

208
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,250
(you can become stronger.)

209
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,180
(Enemy Legendary)

210
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,180
(Enemy Unstopable)

211
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,460
(You’ve been slain)

212
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,240
(This level? Pro gamer?
Honor of Kings Endorser?)

213
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,570
This Xiao Qiao was you?

214
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,180
Congratulations.

215
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,980
You’re famous on Weibo now.

216
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:18,940
Look.

217
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,650
First in trending:

218
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,540
Qiao Jingjing, a fake gamer,

219
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,100
sending ripples through
the entertainment

220
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,100
and the esports industry.

221
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,650
When did you start playing this game?

222
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,890
When I was filming earlier this year.

223
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,060
I played it on and off.

224
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,570
I didn’t play it for long.

225
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,540
In Honor of Kings,

226
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,130
you can be a spectator

227
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,860
and watch people fight,

228
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,810
even record it.

229
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:38,810
Didn’t you know?

230
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,420
Such a function exists?

231
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,740
You didn’t know?

232
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,860
Why did you even play the game?

233
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,450
I have endorsed the game.

234
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:47,010
You guys said I was a pro gamer.

235
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,060
Fake it

236
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,380
till you make it, right?

237
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,210
I knew you’re like this.

238
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,100
Just one or two compliments

239
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,540
are enough to make you think
you’re good at something.

240
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:58,300
It’s serious, you know.

241
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,570
Do you have any idea
how popular this game is?

242
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,060
How many people are lining up

243
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,570
to endorse it?

244
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:05,810
Some will even do it for free!

245
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:07,940
Honor of Kings

246
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,450
was supposed to renew
the contract with us.

247
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,180
But with the current drama,

248
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,330
I guess it’s gone.

249
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,210
Of course, this is not the worst.

250
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,250
You’re an actress.

251
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:19,380
Endorsement is just a side job.

252
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,810
What’s more important

253
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,770
is the leading actress role
for Mr. Li’s latest movie.

254
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:23,860
Do you know

255
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:24,770
what this new movie

256
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:25,740
will be called?

257
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,450
Authenticity.

258
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,570
You’re saying that

259
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,100
someone stirred this up

260
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,540
to get the role in Mr. Li’s movie.

261
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:36,460
(Alex-Honor of Kings)

262
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,890
Call from Honor of Kings.

263
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,450
Hi,

264
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,180
Ms. Qiu, I’m Alex.

265
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:48,450
Hi.

266
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:49,740
What’s with the trending topic today?

267
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,450
Does that alt belong to Jingjing?

268
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,210
Was she practicing some heroes?

269
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,100
Yes.

270
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,940
She was using her alt

271
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,130
to practice heroes
she was not familiar with.

272
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,330
That’s why it was like this.

273
00:13:58,770 --> 00:13:59,690
In this case,

274
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:00,250
you should clarify

275
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,690
(Honor of Kings World Champion Cup)
on Weibo.

276
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:02,620
Or else,

277
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,940
you’ll put us in a weird position.

278
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,100
You’re right.

279
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,650
We’ll do it right away.

280
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:07,890
By the way, Ms. Qiu.

281
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,450
We have discussed internally
and we believe that

282
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,100
a clarification on Weibo

283
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,890
might not be able to cut it.

284
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,690
We will have an event soon

285
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,450
and we might be able to turn this crisis

286
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,500
into opportunity.

287
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,420
What event?

288
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,650
So,

289
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,180
the World Champion Cup

290
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,690
will end in a month.

291
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:25,380
And then,

292
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,010
we’ll hold

293
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,740
an award ceremony.

294
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,620
In this ceremony,

295
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,690
we would love to invite Jingjing

296
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:31,940
to play a casual match.

297
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:32,940
We will select randomly

298
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,690
five lucky players from Weibo.

299
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,210
Together with Jingjing, the six of them

300
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:37,380
will be divided into two teams.

301
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,250
Each team can select

302
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,130
two professional players
as their teammates.

303
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:43,650
But this is not stipulated

304
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:44,980
on our contract.

305
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,060
The contract also doesn’t say that

306
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:47,690
a video like this

307
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:48,770
would be leaked.

308
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,130
It’s just a casual match.

309
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,500
Don’t worry.

310
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:53,980
Unless Jingjing is...

311
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,100
It’s not about her player skill.

312
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:56,570
It’s that in our...

313
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,890
It’s okay. I’ll do it.

314
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,380
Ms. Qiu.

315
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:01,740
Hello.

316
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,380
That voice just now was...

317
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,650
It was Jingjing.

318
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:06,980
As you know,

319
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:07,740
she’s an avid fan

320
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,980
of your game.

321
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,940
Since

322
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,060
Jingjing already said yes,

323
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,180
I see no point in refusing you.

324
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,860
Let’s discuss more in detail.

325
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,380
Qiao Jingjing updated her Weibo.

326
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,650
(That was the best I could do.)

327
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,130
(We both have Qiao in our name)

328
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,890
(so why can’t I use you well?)

329
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:32,380
The comments and the reactions

330
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,250
from the netizens seem good.

331
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,250
Many have bought

332
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:34,980
her explanation.

333
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,890
However, some still remain skeptical.

334
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,740
Post the message we said just now.

335
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,810
(In this year’s award ceremony,)

336
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,130
(the endorser of Honor of Kings,)

337
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,100
(Qiao Jingjing will have a casual match)

338
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,250
(with some lucky winners.)

339
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:46,940
(Are you excited about)

340
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,330
(Qiao Jingjing’s Xiao Qiao?)

341
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,500
(Apply now.)

342
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:54,180
(Jingjing’s so cute! Go!)
(Jingjing, you’re the best! Go!)

343
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:54,810
After announcing that

344
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:56,100
Qiao Jingjing will play
in a casual match,

345
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,380
the tide has turned.

346
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,570
Everyone is looking forward to it now.

347
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,620
(Qiao Jingjing:
I’m done with Xiao Qiao!)

348
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:01,690
In fact, everyone thinks that

349
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,380
it’s normal

350
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,010
to be unable to perform well
on certain heroes.

351
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:05,100
Look.

352
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,250
Some players came to her defense too.

353
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:08,770
However,

354
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:09,860
how good is she?

355
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,100
If she’s as bad as she was

356
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,180
in the video,

357
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,180
then that would be disastrous.

358
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,300
We will look bad.

359
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:19,300
When that happens,

360
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,060
we’ll remove her as our endorser.

361
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,500
The dissenting voice

362
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,620
has gone down temporarily,

363
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:35,890
but the casual match

364
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,100
will begin in around a month.

365
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,420
Your level

366
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,620
is not good enough for a match.

367
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:41,740
I have already found

368
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,130
an excuse for you.

369
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:43,890
You really don’t have to

370
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,380
take part in this match.

371
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:46,300
Jingjing,

372
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,330
you’re too reckless this time.

373
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:54,690
Jingjing.

374
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,650
Ms. Ling,

375
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,300
I don’t usually accept a stranger’s

376
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,300
friend request on WeChat.

377
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,860
Don’t worry.

378
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,380
I’ll find out

379
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,570
who’s behind

380
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:08,570
all this.

381
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:09,890
No need for that.

382
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,180
It’s my fault.

383
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:14,690
Don’t be mad.

384
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,570
I’m not mad.

385
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,810
The culprit will suffer my wrath soon.

386
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,380
Try to get me the role

387
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,530
from Mr. Li.

388
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:24,020
Okay.

389
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,780
As for the game,

390
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,810
find someone reliable

391
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:26,780
to coach me.

392
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:27,570
This show

393
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:29,050
will finish shooting in a few days.

394
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,500
Keep the current schedule.

395
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,690
Don’t add other things.

396
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,260
I was planning

397
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,690
to give you a 2-week break.

398
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:36,780
But now that the casual match

399
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,290
is in a month,

400
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:38,860
you plan to

401
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,290
spend this period to practice hard?

402
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,620
Look.

403
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:44,860
In the comments,

404
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,500
(Jingjing, go!)
my fans voiced their support.

405
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:48,020
(Looking forward to Jingjing’s performance)
If I lose in the match which will take place

406
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,140
in a month,

407
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,170
not only will I be mocked,

408
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,020
my fans too.

409
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,690
I see.

410
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:54,660
I’ll arrange for it then.

411
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:58,570
It’s my fault this time.

412
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,740
Thank you.

413
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,100
Oh, please.

414
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,290
No need to

415
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,170
to thank me.

416
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:08,570
I still have one month.

417
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:09,660
I can do this.

418
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,380
In no way is this

419
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:11,450
harder than abs training.

420
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,330
Of course.

421
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:13,260
You can do this.

422
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,290
All right. It’s 2 AM now.

423
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,450
You still have shooting tomorrow.

424
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:17,140
Sleep early.

425
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:17,660
All right.

426
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,330
Jingjing.

427
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,690
Even though I agree that

428
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,620
abs training is harder than gaming,

429
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,690
but your abs are nowhere to be seen

430
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,690
despite the weight loss.

431
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:37,500
Good night.

432
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:49,980
Really? You can’t see them?

433
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,900
Congratulations, Ms. Qiao

434
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,330
(End of shooting celebration)
for completing the shooting.

435
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,450
Yay!

436
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,480
(Fushan Production Team,
End of shooting celebration)

437
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,500
Come, let’s take a group photo.

438
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,740
Look at this camera.

439
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,780
Three, two, one. Good.

440
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:08,930
Thank you.

441
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,260
Thanks, everyone. Goodbye.

442
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,210
Take care.

443
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,740
Good job.

444
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,260
Goodbye.

445
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,050
Since you’ve decided

446
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,290
to play in this casual match,

447
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:29,980
then we have to prepare thoroughly.

448
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:30,980
Only one goal in mind:

449
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,260
don’t let anyone know that

450
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,210
you’re a novice.

451
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:34,740
Once you’re back in Shanghai,

452
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,290
you’ll need to start training.

453
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:36,980
Got it.

454
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:38,050
Take this.

455
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,020
You’ll use this phone
for the casual match.

456
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,210
Use it

457
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,050
for your practice

458
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,290
so that you can get used to it.

459
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:44,620
Your account has been created.

460
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:46,100
No one will know it’s you.

461
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,500
I’ve also found you

462
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,780
a professional coach for you.

463
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,020
Who?

464
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,020
A professional player?

465
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,020
I can’t wait.

466
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:09,810
Here.

467
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:12,980
My husband.

468
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,210
Are you sure he’s good at it?

469
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:45,900
Guo

470
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,410
is a King player, okay?

471
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,600
(Guo, King Player x0
Best Heroes: Cheng Yaojin, Xiahou Dun...)

472
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:53,980
I decided to ask you to

473
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,380
endorse Honor of Kings

474
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:55,980
because

475
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,740
I was inspired by

476
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,900
how engrossed he was in the game.

477
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,020
He’s a veteran,

478
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,260
more than qualified to be your coach.

479
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,530
Also,

480
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,690
with our current situation,

481
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,500
I don’t dare to find
an outsider to coach you.

482
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,100
What if he or she
shares this with everyone?

483
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:10,690
Fine then.

484
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:11,980
Train hard.

485
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,260
If you have half of

486
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,660
what Guo has,

487
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,900
then your performance
should be satisfactory.

488
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:17,620
I still have work.

489
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,140
This meeting room

490
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:20,020
will be your classroom

491
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:20,980
from now onwards.

492
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:21,860
Start whenever.

493
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,450
Train hard too, Xiao Zhu

494
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:24,500
so that you can be her partner.

495
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,140
All right.

496
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,210
I’ll leave her to you, darling.

497
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,450
Go finish your things.

498
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:30,500
Go.

499
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,690
I’ll be in your care then.

500
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,020
No need to be so formal.

501
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,020
We’re almost like a family now.

502
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,900
Ling has told me

503
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,290
about the general situation.

504
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:48,450
Don’t worry.

505
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:50,330
This game is simple.

506
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,380
You can be good at

507
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:52,620
several heroes

508
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,450
in a month.

509
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,660
Calm yourself down.

510
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,260
Okay.

511
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:57,380
So let’s start

512
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,530
from the basics.

513
00:21:58,530 --> 00:21:58,930
Okay.

514
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,140
Let’s go to the tutorial.

515
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:33,020
(Welcome to the Honor of Kings.)

516
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:38,140
From the blue side’s perspective,

517
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:40,100
this is mid,

518
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,570
this is top,

519
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:42,500
and this is bottom.

520
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,210
Since

521
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,330
you’re new,

522
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:46,620
let’s start with Support.

523
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,290
Just follow the Marksman.

524
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,290
Okay.

525
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:51,450
By the way,

526
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,330
Ling told me

527
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,450
about the match rules.

528
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:56,860
You’ll have

529
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,980
two random players

530
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,290
and two pro players

531
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,330
as your teammates.

532
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,410
Honestly,

533
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,780
you can never outperform

534
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,570
a professional player anyway.

535
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,450
Professional players

536
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,050
will want to be the carries.

537
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,210
There are carries in this game?

538
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:15,380
Yes.

539
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:17,530
There are five positions

540
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,450
in total.

541
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,620
Mid, Jungler, Marksman,
Tank, and Support.

542
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:21,690
The first three

543
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,860
are the carries.

544
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,620
Can I be a carry then?

545
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,330
Do you want to win?

546
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:33,980
Yes.

547
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,050
Then play Support.

548
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,380
Do you know why?

549
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:37,810
First,

550
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:39,780
Support is easier to pick up.

551
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:42,620
Secondly,
it’s not the most pivotal role.

552
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,450
You can definitely be Support.

553
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,290
Let me teach you

554
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:48,980
some common supportive

555
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,020
skills.

556
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,740
Look.

557
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,860
Let’s start with Zhang Fei.

558
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:55,450
His abilities

559
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,620
are quite simple.

560
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,210
Five Tiger Generals,

561
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,410
at your service.

562
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,840
(Victory)

563
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,410
Just like that.

564
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,260
Now, let’s matchmake and practice.

565
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,100
(Welcome to the Honor of Kings.)

566
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:40,100
Just follow me, Hou Yi.

567
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,140
Use your Skill 1 once you’re out.

568
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,440
(Get Ready. Prepare to engage)

569
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:44,620
Okay.

570
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:45,930
Your Skill 2 is a shield.

571
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,570
Use it on me.

572
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:50,450
Good.

573
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,450
If you can use it at the right time,
it will be even better.

574
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:55,660
Okay.

575
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,570
You’re level 4 now.

576
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:57,620
You can use your ultimate skill.

577
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,620
Use it to blow him away.

578
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,410
Follow my march!

579
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,480
(Yikes!)

580
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,570
(Thank you.)

581
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,780
He was about to die.

582
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,100
Why did you blow him away?

583
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,620
I just wanted to see how it looks like.

584
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,410
It’s okay.

585
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:12,170
Let’s continue.

586
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,780
Gao Jianli is after me now.

587
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,500
Hurry

588
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,690
and blow him away
with your ultimate skill.

589
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,400
(First Blood)

590
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:21,260
Jesus!

591
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,100
I don’t have much HP left.

592
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:23,860
Why did you

593
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,930
blow him towards me?

594
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:27,530
It’s okay.

595
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:28,170
Let’s continue.

596
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:28,860
Don’t sweat it.

597
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,140
You can do this.

598
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,140
Come.

599
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,320
(You’ve been slain.)

600
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,320
(You’ve been slain.)

601
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,320
(Enemy unstoppable)

602
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,080
(Defeat)

603
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:46,290
Don’t worry. It’s not your fault.

604
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,100
This hero is not meant for you.

605
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:50,900
So,

606
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:52,500
let’s use another hero.

607
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,500
Let’s use Sun Bin.

608
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,500
He’s quite good.

609
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,320
(Defeat)

610
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:02,860
Try Niumo.

611
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,800
(Defeat)

612
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,410
Zhuang Zhou.

613
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,720
(Defeat)

614
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:14,930
Today

615
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,660
is still a fruitful day.

616
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:18,930
We have found several heroes

617
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:20,170
that don’t suit your play style.

618
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,210
Let’s not give up

619
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,570
and do this again tomorrow.

620
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,100
We’ll definitely find

621
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,100
your true calling.

622
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:25,780
Okay.

623
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,260
Yes.

624
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,170
How’s the training?

625
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:57,620
Well,

626
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,100
full of surprises.

627
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:06,140
Oh, my.

628
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:12,050
You worked hard.

629
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,290
Your arms must be tired.

630
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,140
How’s the practice?

631
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:20,930
Not bad.

632
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,620
We’ve tried out

633
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,500
all Supports.

634
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,530
Really?

635
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,380
Did she find a hero

636
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:27,410
that she’s good at then?

637
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,530
Cai Wenji.

638
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:36,980
Zhuang Zhou and Yao
are not bad too, right?

639
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:40,140
Wait,

640
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,740
even though

641
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,050
you’re not at your best form yet,

642
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,570
but the random players

643
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:45,810
selected

644
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:46,860
won’t necessarily be King players either,

645
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:47,740
right?

646
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,260
So let’s call off tomorrow.

647
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,260
Have a break.

648
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,450
I will revise

649
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,170
a new coaching plan

650
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,570
based on

651
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:57,980
Jingjing’s capability.

652
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,170
Okay.

653
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,930
She has to shoot
an ad tomorrow anyway.

654
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:01,810
She won’t be able to practice.

655
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:02,620
Jingjing,

656
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,810
go back now

657
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:04,660
and sleep early.

658
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,450
I’ll practice

659
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:07,620
on my phone tomorrow.

660
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,530
I’m not used to this phone.

661
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:09,900
Don’t. Don’t.

662
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:11,260

663
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,380
we’ll be in deep trouble.

665
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,330

667
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:17,780
I can use my alt.

668
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:20,050

669
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:21,140

00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:37,970
(Are you ready?)

758
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,330
(I lost...)

759
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,530
(None shall resist)

760
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:53,570
(my bullet and my good looks.)

761
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,640
(Tripple Kill)

762
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:56,770
Is

763
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,220
Yu Tu good at this game?

764
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,520
(Double Kill)

765
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:16,380
Another victory?

766
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,140
It’s barely ten minutes!

767
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:25,360
(Carry me please!)

768
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,700
(Will it be too)

769
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,180
(shameless of me)

770
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,380
(to join their lobby back?)

771
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,140
(They invited me by mistake.)

772
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,100
(School’s About to Start So Panicky
invites you to a game of 5v5 Valley of Kings.)

773
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:40,180
School’s About to Start So Panicky.

774
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,570
He’s a nice guy.

775
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:45,460
(Marksman is good in this patch.)

776
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,700
(I will play Marksman this round.)

777
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,720
(Welcome come to Honor of Kings)

778
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,880
(Prepare to engage)

779
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,160
(First Blood)

780
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,050
(Cai Wenji?)

781
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,490
(Sorry, I’m still new.)

782
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:03,250
(I’m a noob.)

783
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,900
(Use voice chat. Let me guide you.)

784
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,330
Voice chat?

785
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,280
(Whole Team)

786
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:12,100
(I finally knew why)

787
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,490
(Yu Tu, Marksman main,)

788
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:14,330
(was willing)

789
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:15,700
(to give up the position of Marksman.)

790
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,420
(This Cai Wenji is a troll!)

791
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:18,420
(You’re overthinking.)

792
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:19,940
(I just want to show you)

793
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,010
(how to play Zhuge Liang properly.)

794
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,080
(You’ve been slain.)

795
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,380
(Oh no.)

796
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:32,490
(They won’t invite me)

797
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,940
(for the next round.)

798
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,400
(Double Kill)

799
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:45,330
Eat this.

800
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,730
You’ve walked into my trap.

801
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,080
(Tripple Kill)

802
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,920
(Quadra Kill)

803
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,460
(Unbelievable.)

804
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,460
(Yu Tu, you kill stealer!)

805
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,250
(Your Zhuge Liang is not bad, Yu Tu.)

806
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,530
(I have never seen you pick him.)

807
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,660
(Zhai Liang always picked Mage)

808
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,100
(so he couldn’t pick it.)

809
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,620
