20
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,780
(Xia)

21
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,360
Hello.

22
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,920
What are you doing?

23
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,680
Are you

24
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,280
having a perfect weekend

25
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,720
with your captain?

26
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,040
No.

27
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,040
Do you know Captain Shen?

28
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,920
Shu Wenbo respects him a lot.

29
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,720
He has also been
an incredible mentor to Xing Kelei.

30
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,400
His two daughters came here.

31
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,680
The older sister

32
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,200
had a car accident
and injured her spine.

33
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,640
The local hospital couldn’t treat her.

34
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,000
So, she came here
with her younger sister.

35
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,960
Xing Kelei is helping them settle down

36
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,440
near the hospital.

37
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,920
She will see the doctor tomorrow.

38
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,840
That’s quite troublesome.

39
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,240
I feel sad for her.

40
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,360
They are both

41
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,160
pretty young girls.

42
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,000
Two beautiful young girls...

43
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,280
So, Xing Kelei has known them

44
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,160
since they were kids?

45
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,600
I guess so.

46
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,640
The older sister called him Lei.

47
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,200
The younger sister called him Kelei.

48
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,120
They must have known each other
since they were young.

49
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,560
Are you stupid?

50
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,720
What?

51
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,720
Well...

52
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,600
There must be a problem

53
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,120
with the sister who called him Lei.

54
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,960
I think you two

55
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,960
are getting along too well.

56
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,120
You are soul mates

57
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,080
who are joined at the hip.

58
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,760
No one can separate you, right?

59
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,720
Yeah.

60
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,680
What are you talking about?
It sounds gross.

61
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,800
Listen.

62
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,680
Be careful

63
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,920
and keep an eye on them.

64
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,120
Xing Kelei

65
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,120
is not young.

66
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,240
I don’t believe

67
00:02:59,320 --> 00:02:59,960
he didn’t have any

68
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,400
special feelings for girls.

69
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,800
Isn’t it normal

70
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,880
that he had some special feelings?

71
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,520
It’s not normal if he didn’t.

72
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,640
Not bad.

73
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,240
You’ve grown up.

74
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,000
You are quite mature
and mentally strong now.

75
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,280
You don’t understand.

76
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,000
I just read the analysis of

77
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,200
craniofacial deformity surgery tonight.

78
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,360
I’m swimming

79
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,880
in the ocean of knowledge.

80
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,320
You don’t know the feeling of

81
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,600
being filled with knowledge.

82
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,200
Fine, I don’t understand it.

83
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,360
I forgot that I was calling you

84
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,080
to complain to you.

85
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,640
What do you want to complain about?

86
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,160
Nothing.

87
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,280
I feel much better now

88
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,520
after having a chat with you.

89
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,040
None of those things matter now.

90
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,080
Just ignore the bad things.

91
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,160
By the way,

92
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,360
I want to know

93
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,440
where you bought

94
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,600
the mystery box,

95
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,720
the limited-edition toy.

96
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,760
You want it?

97
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,200
I can buy it for you if you want.

98
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,560
No. No.

99
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,120
I’m asking for a friend.

100
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,440
A friend?

101
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,720
Why don’t I know that you have a friend

102
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,360
who likes these things?

103
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,120
Just find a reliable purchasing agent.

104
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,440
I can forward you
his contact card on WeChat.

105
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,720
I just can’t get

106
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,720
the one I want.

107
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,160
It’s driving me crazy.

108
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,040
Is it out of stock?

109
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,920
Not really.

110
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,480
It is still available.

111
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,840
But it will take me

112
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,240
some time to find

113
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,270
a reliable purchasing agent

114
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,720
and ask him to line up to buy it.

115
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,680
I’ve been really busy lately.

116
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,160
I’ll figure it out when I have time.

117
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,080
Okay.

118
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,960
Keep an eye on Xing Kelei.

119
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,960
You worry a lot, Director Xia.

120
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,600
I’ll hang up, bye.

121
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,960
Wait!

122
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,200
I’m not finished yet.

123
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,800
(Mi Ka)
Hello, Shu Wenbo.

124
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,360
I just asked her.

125
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,640
That toy is still available.

126
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,080
Just find a reliable purchasing agent.

127
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,480
Good luck.

128
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,120
How is it going now?

129
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,720
No problem, Mi Ka.

130
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,720
I have found

131
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,560
a reliable purchasing agent.

132
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,640
Okay, come on.

133
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,720
Miss Ruan Qingxia
has been busy recently.

134
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,040
I think she will be very happy

135
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,000
to receive your gift.

136
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,680
Bye.

137
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,800
Okay, thanks.

138
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,080
Lei.

139
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,720
I’ll call him that tomorrow.

140
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,480
Xing Kelei!

141
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,600
Don’t you see me standing here?

142
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,120
Open the door for me.

143
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,440
Help me in.

144
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,160
Are you drunk again?

145
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,760
What’s wrong?

146
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,520
Open the door.

147
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,840
It’s just two paces away

148
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,320
and you still ask me
to open the door for you.

149
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,840
Help me in.

150
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,800
It’s ten o’clock.

151
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,640
My girlfriend should be worried.

152
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,560
Well, do you have no time

153
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,440
to talk to your own sister

154
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,920
after you have a girlfriend?

155
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,160
You had such a good attitude

156
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,520
when you lived in my house.

157
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,880
Why is your attitude

158
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,240
so bad now?

159
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,520
Open the door.

160
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,840
All right.

161
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,480
Please.

162
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,680
Help me well.

163
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,640
I think your girlfriend

164
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,840
is really good.

165
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,960
Yeah. Yeah.

166
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,480
Mi Ka is really good.

167
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,320
Yeah.

168
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,040
Be serious about it.

169
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,840
No problem.

170
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,680
Be serious about it.

171
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,200
Treat her well.

172
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,080
Okay. Okay.

173
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:46,840
Okay.

174
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,960
Go ahead.

175
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,160
Mi Ka?

176
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,840
Dr. Mi?

177
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,120
Is she sleeping

178
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,840
or is she ignoring me
because she is angry?

179
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,160
No.

180
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,160
I can’t just sit still and wait.

181
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,000
Lei, good morning.

182
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,480
What’s wrong?

183
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,560
Why are you talking like that?

184
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,680
Don’t you think

185
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,560
it sounds feminine?

186
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,040
Please, this way.

187
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,000
Sit down.

188
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,680
Enjoy the healthy breakfast.

189
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,480
Thank you.

190
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,000
What’s going on here?

191
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,520
Nothing.

192
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,960
Tell me if anything happened.

193
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,120
I need to finish this quickly

194
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,320
and then go to work.

195
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,920
It’s okay. Go ahead and eat.

196
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,820
(Shen Jianing (Looks like her father))

197
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,180
(Younger sister Older sister)

198
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,920
Let me simply sort out

199
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,640
the relationships for you.

200
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,800
The key figures are the two sisters
of the Shen family.

201
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,560
The older sister Shen Jianing

202
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,880
looks like her father.

203
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,520
(Shen Jianan (Looks like her mother))
The younger sister Shen Jianan

204
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,640
looks like her mother.

205
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,920
But none of these matters.

206
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,760
You have already known Captain Shen.

207
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,680
He is my former captain.

208
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,880
He has been really good to me.

209
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,600
He and my father are childhood friends.

210
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,720
So, we have

211
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,240
a good relationship.

212
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,200
These are

213
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,160
all the photos about us

214
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,000
that I can find.

215
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,480
Do you have any questions?

216
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,480
I think this photo

217
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,720
was taken by accident.

218
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,000
Does Captain Shen

219
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,120
want to fix you up

220
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,200
because you’ve been hanging out a lot

221
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,840
and you kind of like each other?

222
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,280
You are over thinking it.

223
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,120
What did two little kids know?

224
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,200
Look,

225
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,400
obliviously I was helping her with

226
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,840
her homework in the photo.

227
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,200
I was a good student

228
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,400
when I was a child.

229
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,120
It’s normal for me to coach her.

230
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,800
We are just friends.

231
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,040
Coach her?

232
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,320
Why was she

233
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,800
looking at you so attentively?

234
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,320
She wasn’t reading her homework.

235
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,640
Speaking of that,

236
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,720
come on, look here.

237
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,580
(Handsome me (Very handsome))
I’ve been handsome

238
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,520
since I was a child.

239
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,040
It’s not my fault.

240
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,600
People like to enjoy

241
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,600
wonderful things.

242
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,920
However,

243
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,080
I remember that she did

244
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,000
hold my hand once

245
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,840
when I sent her home.

246
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,400
I guess

247
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,160
she liked me a little bit.

248
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,920
She was a kid at that time. It’s normal.

249
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,400
Xing Kelei!

250
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,680
I am angry!

251
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,280
Dr. Mi.

252
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,240
I was wrong.

253
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,600
I was just joking.

254
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,240
It’s not true, you...

255
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,360
You...

256
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,920
Beauty.

257
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,760
Dr. Mi.

258
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,160
Angel Mi.

259
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,040
Open the door.

260
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,360
You...

261
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,760
I was wrong.

262
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,920
I’m kneeling down for you.

263
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,240
Just come out and see...

264
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,600
Are you a fool?

265
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,120
Can’t you tell

266
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,160
I’m really angry or I’m faking it?

267
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,040
I really can’t tell.

268
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,200
We should be fine now.

269
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,240
I’m leaving.

270
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,640
Send me her ID number.

271
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,280
I’ll register now.

272
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,800
There is no specialist available.

273
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,280
There are only general doctors.

274
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,280
Well,

275
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,760
let her take the examination first.

276
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,880
Mr. Shao is also here these days.

277
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,080
Then we can

278
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,920
let Mr. Shao check the results.

279
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:47,800
Let’s just

280
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,520
follow the normal procedure.

281
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,760
Why is my girlfriend so kind?

282
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,480
Of course.

283
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,040
The two of them are quite pitiful.

284
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,240
Their mother died when they were kids.

285
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,080
Captain Shen is not around.

286
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,720
Let’s take them as our younger sisters

287
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,480
and take good care of them.

288
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,920
Don’t worry.

289
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:12,960
All right.

290
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,400
Get in the car, big sister.

291
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,360
Do you remember

292
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,480
what I told you to say?

293
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,920
Yeah, Jianing.

294
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,680
Mi Ka will

295
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,520
at least offer some help

296
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,200
for the sake of Kelei.

297
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,800
What should we say then?

298
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,080
I know what to say
whether she will help us or not.

299
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:01,880
Go to the car

300
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,360
and grab two bottles of water for them.

301
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,720
Okay.

302
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,480
Mi Ka, you are here.

303
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,720
How did you sleep last night?

304
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,040
You have a lot of examinations
to do today.

305
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,920
It’s going to be tough.

306
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,120
Thank you for your concern.

307
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,800
I’m fine.

308
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,920
He went to get you some water.

309
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,480
Mi Ka.

310
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,800
Can you make an appointment

311
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,520
with a specialist for us?

312
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,880
I’ve registered.

313
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,880
You are quite thoughtful.

314
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,160
But it’s not a specialist.

315
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,240
Just a general doctor.

316
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,560
There is no specialist available now.

317
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,240
Take the examination first.

318
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,480
We can also get an appointment

319
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,360
with a general doctor on our own.

320
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,680
We can go there and register now.

321
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,880
Thank you for registering for us.

322
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,640
Kelei.

323
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,120
Find a specialist for Jianing.

324
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,520
It’s just an examination today.

325
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,200
We can only find you a specialist

326
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,440
after you get the result.

327
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,600
Mi Ka.

328
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,000
Jianing has difficulty in sleeping.

329
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,590
Get us a single room

330
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,880
facing south with a good environment.

331
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,960
Mi Ka is a doctor.

332
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,280
She can’t violate

333
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,590
the rules of the hospital.

334
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,200
We will try our best.

335
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,110
Jianan.

336
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,200
Let’s do

337
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,520
as Lei says.

338
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,000
It would be the best

339
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,680
if we won’t trouble Mi Ka.

340
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,830
This is how it works in the big city.

341
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,520
There aren’t so many people

342
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:28,600
in the hospital in our hometown.

343
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,680
Unlike here, we don’t need to
make an appointment in advance.

344
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,680
We don’t understand the rules here.

345
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,800
Right, Jianing?

346
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,440
Mi Ka, sorry.

347
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,880
My sister is still young.

348
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,760
Sorry that she troubled you again.

349
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,000
It’s okay. Don’t worry.

350
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,480
Mi Ka is my girlfriend.

351
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,400
She will do her best

352
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,480
to help you.

353
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,080
Let me do it.

354
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:07,060
(Neurosurgery)

355
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,400
Jianing.

356
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,240
Look at Kelei.

357
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:44,700
(Examination Room 3-CT)

358
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,180
(Shen Jianing Ongoing)

359
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,240
Here we are.

360
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,680
Look, the spine.

361
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,960
Here and there.

362
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:07,880
I think these are

363
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,480
problems from

364
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,280
the last car accident.

365
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,920
Given the circumstances,

366
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,840
I think she needs to
have another operation.

367
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,520
There is one point.

368
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,920
She has a good chance of standing up

369
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,600
if she recovers well after surgery.

370
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,480
That’s good.

371
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,680
She is lucky.

372
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,720
Several people will be discharged today.

373
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,880
I’ll go to the Inpatient Department
and check it out.

374
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,640
Okay.

375
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,480
Thank you, Mr. Shao.

376
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,360
It’s okay.

377
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,400
Xiaoxiao.

378
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,960
Is there any single room

379
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,800
in the vacant wards?

380
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:37,520
No.

381
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,400
It’s not sure when the patient

382
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,600
in the single room will be discharged.

383
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,640
A patient named Shen Jianing

384
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,880
will move in later.

385
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,480
She suffers from insomnia

386
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,080
and a severe headache.

387
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,080
Her family member wants a single room.

388
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,600
Tell me if there is any

389
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,280
single room available.

390
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,360
Okay, got it.

391
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,200
Hello.

392
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,880
Go through the formalities first.

393
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:00,840
And

394
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,000
there is no single room available yet.

395
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,360
But I told them

396
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,200
to notify the family member

397
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:04,960
if there is any

398
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,360
vacant single room.

399
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,360
Okay, I’ll do it later.

400
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,440
No pressure on you
about the single room.

401
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,840
Don’t violate any rule for that.

402
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,560
Don’t worry.

403
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,200
So many people here.

404
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,040
Jianing.

405
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,640
You have two examinations to do later.

406
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,320
Your attending doctor

407
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,440
has written out a slip for you.

408
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:32,960
Lei.

409
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,000
Come with me

410
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,840
for the examinations later.

411
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,560
Just leave the rest to Jianan.

412
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,000
Okay.

413
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,160
I’ll go to work.

414
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:40,960
Remember to change your clothes

415
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
before taking the examinations.

416
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,760
Thank you, Mi Ka.

417
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,600
You’re welcome.

418
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,560
I’ll leave you to it.

419
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,720
Mi Ka!

420
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,440
I have something to ask you.

421
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,200
What’s the matter?

422
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,880
Who is our nurse?

423
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,640
This one, Xiaoxiao.

424
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,640
And also,

425
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,640
where should I get

426
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,480
the blood test result

427
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,360
tomorrow morning?

428
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,560
Just go to Xiaoxiao.

429
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,240
Where is the hot water room?

430
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:15,920
I’ll take you there.

431
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:16,760
Okay.

432
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,280
Mi Ka, thank you.

433
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,440
I’m outspoken

434
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,320
and straight forward.

435
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,880
Please don’t mind.

436
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,240
It’s okay. No worry.

437
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,480
The hot water room is here.

438
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,240
Okay.

439
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:31,720
Dr. Mi.

440
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,880
You can get the water here.

441
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,840
Mi Ka.

442
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,920
Kelei and us

443
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,480
know each other too well.

444
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,600
We grew up together.

445
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,800
When we met him this time,

446
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,240
I feel that he hasn’t changed at all.

447
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,640
He still feels like a family member

448
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,440
to us.

449
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,960
Although

450
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,840
Jianing and I are sisters,

451
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,640
we are

452
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,760
not the same at all.

453
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,480
I’m like a boy.

454
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,800
She is different.

455
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,600
She has been liked by many boys

456
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,840
since she was a young girl.

457
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,480
But she didn’t

458
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,600
talk to other boys.

459
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,320
She only talked to Kelei.

460
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,840
Back then,

461
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,960
Kelei always came to our house

462
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,840
for a meal

463
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,680
and coached Jianing.

464
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,920
You know what, he is a quick learner.

465
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,800
I don’t know that.

466
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,640
What did he teach your sister?

467
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,160
He taught her

468
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,160
math and English.

469
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,600
They used to

470
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,840
listen to English tape

471
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,120
in that room.

472
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,520
They were really happy.

473
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,600
I was thinking

474
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,680
that I should find someone to coach me

475
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,960
if I had known it could be so happy.

476
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,240
How was your sister’s English
after the coaching?

477
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,040
She didn’t work on that at all.

478
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,720
She did poorly on exams.

479
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,840
That’s why the teacher kept saying

480
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,680
that puppy love can be
a waste of learning time.

481
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,920
Indeed it is.

482
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,080
That’s how Jianing wasted her time.

483
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,880
I’m not blaming Kelei.

484
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,080
It’s not like that.

485
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,920
Let’s not talk about this.

486
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,160
First love is

487
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,360
always fruitless.

488
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,480
And you shouldn’t have puppy love.

489
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,840
I don’t have puppy love.

490
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,840
So, I got admitted to medical school.

491
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,360
Your water is almost full.

492
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,480
I’ll go to work.

493
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,800
Be careful.

494
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,320
Jianing.

495
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,680
Mi Ka told me

496
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,800
to stretch your arms and relax
after drawing blood.

497
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,960
Try it.

498
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,600
Is that so?

499
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,360
Yes.

500
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,160
Does it make you feel better?

501
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,360
Lei.

502
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,360
How long have you been together

503
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,360
with Mi Ka?

504
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,800
I feel that you two are
in a good relationship.

505
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,440
It’s enviable.

506
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,040
Not really long.

507
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,480
It’s because we met the right person.

508
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,120
Have Keyao met her?

509
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,360
Yeah.

510
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,920
My sister likes Mi Ka a lot.

511
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,320
By the way,

512
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,880
I’ll tell my sister
to see you next time.

513
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,800
Don’t bother.

514
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,360
Keyao is really busy.

515
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,920
And we have troubled

516
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,600
you guys a lot this time.

517
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,520
Don’t say that.

518
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,360
Lei, stop pushing my wheelchair.

519
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,080
What’s wrong?

520
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,840
My head hurts.

521
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,080
Your head hurts?

522
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,320
Let’s go to a doctor.

523
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,640
I don’t want to.

524
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:32,920
But we can’t just

525
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,440
stay here.

526
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,960
I don’t want to move at all.

527
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,160
How does it hurt?

528
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,240
It’s just...

529
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,480
Very painful.

530
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,440
Shen Jianing.

531
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,320
What’s happening?

532
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,240
Shen Jianing!

533
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,560
What’s happening?

534
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,560
My head hurts.

535
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:51,880
Your head hurts?

536
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,760
Come on, let me see.

537
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,480
Let’s go back to the ward first,

538
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,200
then I’ll tell your attending doctor
to see you.

539
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,000
Alright?

540
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,160
Okay.

541
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,440
Lei!

542
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,000
I’m here.

543
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:16,680
I’ve checked

544
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,800
her test results.

545
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,880
I think it should be a stress headache

546
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,760
or a long-term migraine.

547
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,360
I’ve prescribed the painkillers.

548
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,680
Have some rest first.

549
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,160
If there is nothing else,

550
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,960
I should leave for training.

551
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,920
Kelei, are you leaving now?

552
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,800
Jianan.

553
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:35,760
Let’s not disturb

554
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,360
Lei’s work.

555
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,760
Got it, Jianing.

556
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,800
Sorry, Kelei.

557
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,520
It’s okay.

558
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,000
Call me if anything happens.

559
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:57,960
Is Dr. Mi here?

560
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,680
Dr. Mi

561
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,360
doesn’t seem to be here.

562
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,520
Thank you.

563
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,480
Take me out for a walk.

564
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,560
Okay.

565
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,640
Jianing.

566
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,680
Why is Xing Kelei

567
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,440
always helping his girlfriend?

568
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,120
We were going to

569
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,200
make a lot of requests

570
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,720
to build tension between them.

571
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,320
As a result, Xing Kelei

572
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,480
warded off all of it for her.

573
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,400
It made me

574
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,840
look like

575
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,480
that I’m thoughtless.

576
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,960
Jianan.

577
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,280
Bear with it for my sake.

578
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,000
Otherwise, no one can help us.

579
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,560
I’m counting on Xing Kelei

580
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,320
to treat my legs.

581
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,880
Otherwise, I’m going to live
the rest of my life

582
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,040
in a wheelchair.

583
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,720
Can you understand it?

584
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,280
It’s just

585
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,160
I didn’t expect

586
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,560
that Xing Kelei is so upright.

587
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,360
Right.

588
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,080
I forgot that he is

589
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,800
the same kind of person as our father.

590
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,640
What should we do next?

591
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,440
I was telling Mi Ka

592
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,120
that you and Kelei

593
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,680
were childhood sweethearts

594
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,200
and I also added

595
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,320
highly colored details to it.

596
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,920
She acted like nothing happened.

597
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,760
No response at all.

598
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,400
Why do these two people

599
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,960
always act in unexpected ways?

600
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,600
We can’t make

601
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,800
excessive demands now.

602
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,280
We have to

603
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,600
cooperate with the doctor.

604
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,040
What’s more,

605
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,440
I can’t keep pretending

606
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,280
that my head hurts.

607
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,280
I need to think about it.

608
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,040
All right.

609
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,000
Let’s do it with this training schedule

610
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,280
for the combat.

611
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,600
Ask Xing Kelei

612
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,120
how his hands are working now.

613
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,600
Can he return this week?

614
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,440
Yes.

615
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,000
You guys

616
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,000
achieved some results in the past,

617
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,160
but this time the task is hard

618
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,760
and we are pressed for time.

619
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,760
We are looking forward to
the performance of Tiger.

620
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,840
Yes!

621
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,040
All right, the working time is over.

622
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,880
Xing Kelei is in love now.

623
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,160
What about you?

624
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,400
Report!

625
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,520
After I leave this room,

626
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,440
I’ll go to prepare for my love life!

627
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,800
Good.

628
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,400
Fight hard

629
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,800
and love hard.

630
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,040
Yes!

631
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,600
Shu Wenbo, this is yours.

632
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,200
Thank you.

633
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,200

of the patient Shen on 15?

678
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,720
Her spine needs a second operation.

679
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,200
The directors have seen her X-ray.

680
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,200
No.

681
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,240
I’m asking

682
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,240
that if she is Xing Kelei’s
ex-girlfriend.

683
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,160
What?

684
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,240
Xing Kelei’s ex-girlfriend?

685
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,440
Xing Kelei has no ex-girlfriend.

686
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,880
She is the daughter
of Xing Kelei’s mentor.

687
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,280
That’s weird.

688
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,360
The rumor that Xing Kelei’s
ex-girlfriend

689
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,640
moved in has been spreading

690
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,040
throughout the wards

691
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:03,920
this afternoon.

692
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,480
And you took her in.

693
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,960
They said that they were
childhood sweethearts.

694
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,360
They had been together
since they were young.

695
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,480
After all these years,

696
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,280
Xing Kelei is still willing to help her.

697
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,480
Not only him,

698
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,680
his current girlfriend,

699
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,840
which is you,

700
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,600
is also helping her in person.

701
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,120
Who said that? Tell me the name.

702
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,080
I’ll go to see them.

703
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,200
Even the cleaning ladies

704
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,440
and the nursing workers
are talking about it.

705
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,760
Who can you look for?

706
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,000
They do have a lot of time.

707
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,160
I’m upset.

708
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,200
I want to complain about Xing Kelei.

709
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,200
Go ahead.

710
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,600
I was already angry

711
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,840
when you called me.

712
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,280
We must talk it through today.

713
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,240
Come on.

714
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,240
Go ahead.

715
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,480
It’s just

716
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,880
that he said he would

717
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,600
stand in the way of
his older sister’s love life

718
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,840
if he lives in her house.

719
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,720
He pretended to be weak

720
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,920
and made me feel bad about him.

721
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,240
Then he moved back.

722
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,880
It’s not a big deal, right?

723
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,160
But what happened later

724
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,680
is even more strange.

725
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,760
I can

726
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,880
understand he is in Captain Shen’s debt

727
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:08,920
for his kindness.

728
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,560
I can also understand

729
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,080
that he wants to help those two sisters.

730
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,080
But the problem is those two sisters...

731
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,600
The younger sister

732
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,040
talked to me alone a few times.

733
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,160
Every time

734
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,600
she talked to me,

735
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,680
it feels like...

736
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,880
You know what I’m saying?

737
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,600
It’s just...

738
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:26,960
I just feel

739
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,440
aggrieved, you know.

740
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,280
She would sting me, or...

741
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,000
Just...

742
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:32,920
I’m aggrieved.

743
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,040
I know. I know.

744
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,440
It sounded like
she didn’t say anything bad,

745
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,920
but every sentence
she said was aiming at you.

746
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,720
Exactly.

747
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,360
Think about what she said carefully.

748
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,080
She said those things

749
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,720
to upset you.

750
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,000
She wanted to make you angry.

751
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:44,720
Right?

752
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,000
You are right, miss.

753
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,320
What about the older sister?

754
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,400
The older sister...

755
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,400
She is all right.

756
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,240
The older sister is quiet.

757
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,800
She didn’t talk to me much.

758
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,800
But every time

759
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,560
Xing Kelei showed up,

760
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,440
it’s easy for her to have problems.

761
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,360
But it’s not her fault.

762
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,320
She is a patient.

763
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,600
She can’t control her condition.

764
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,160
Who said that she can’t control it?

765
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,160
How do you know she didn’t fake it?

766
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,800
In my opinion, she definitely faked it.

767
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,280
We are off the track.

768
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,360
We are not complaining about
those two sisters.

769
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,200
Yeah.

770
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,000
It’s Xing Kelei.

771
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,760
-Xing Kelei.

772
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,440
You know what, there are

773
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,280
all kinds of rumors about me

774
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,360
in the hospital.

775
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,840
They said that I’m
Xing Kelei’s current girlfriend.

776
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,440
Shen Jianing is his ex-girlfriend.

777
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,360
They were childhood sweethearts.

778
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,960
They grew up together and have been

779
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,360
in a good relationship
since they were born.

780
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,360
Now his current girlfriend

781
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,200
is helping his ex-friend

782
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,760
and taking care of her.

783
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:49,680
It’s...

784
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,800
That’s

785
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,720
an old-fashioned story.

786
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,640
What’s that?

787
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,920
That’s nonsense.

788
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,480
Which bastard said that?

789
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,240
What else is there? Go on.

790
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,280
I’m not saying it.

791
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,600
I’ll go to the toilet.

792
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:09,630
Don’t...

793
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,920
I can’t help you.

794
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,630
You are on your own.

795
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,280
What’s happening here?

796
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,000
I don’t know how much

797
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,560
you just heard.

798
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,120
But from Mi Ka’s perspective,

799
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,670
I’m definitely not objective.

800
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I just want to

801
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,000
remind you, Captain.

802
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:39,840
No matter how solid

803
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,000
a relationship is,

804
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,150
it can’t stand hardship
and misunderstanding.

805
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,400
Of course, the misunderstanding
can be cleared easily.

806
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,760
But

807
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,120
it’s like

808
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,400
a stone in shoes.

809
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,230
You can dump it,

810
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,760
but it would still make
people uncomfortable

811
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,840
when it hurt the feet.

812
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,360
What should I do?

813
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,120
Figure it out by yourself.

814
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,160
I’m leaving.

815
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,400
Are you here

816
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,560
just to gossip?

817
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,520
Not really.

818
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,000
I was going to complain about

819
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,840
my own things.

820
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,480
But I think her story

821
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,840
is more interesting,

822
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,520
which makes mine ordinary.

823
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,080
Forget it.

824
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,520
Our bonding time is over.

825
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,160
I won’t bother you!

826
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:28,760
I’m leaving.

827
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,680
Bye.

828
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,920
Has Xia left?

829
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:45,960
Dr. Mi.

830
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,480
Tomorrow,

831
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,680
I’ll go to the hospital

832
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,160
and fix it for you.

833
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,200
Considering your

834
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,840
understanding of women,

835
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,200
it’s hard for you to fix it.

836
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,160
It’s okay.

837
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,640
Forget it, I was just

838
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,840
complaining about it with Xia.

839
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:01,800
No way.

840
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,840
It’s my fault. I’ll take care of it.

841
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,200
All right.

842
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,720
Change your shoes!

843
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:25,300
(Outpatient)

844
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,360
I’m in the hospital.

845
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,920
Captain Shen’s daughter

846
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,760
injured her legs in a car accident

847
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,040
and came to me for help.

848
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,280
You know that Captain Shen has been
a great mentor for me.

849
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,240
I must help her.

850
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,680
Mi Ka also works in the hospital.

851
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,760
So, she helped with the surgery.

852
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,160
But you know what,

853
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,120
some mouthy people

854
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,640
said that Shen Jianing

855
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,840
is my ex-girlfriend.

856
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,080
They made it so complicated

857
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,400
about the three of us.

858
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,480
Yeah, it’s really

859
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,280
awkward for

860
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,680
Mi Ka and me now.

861
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,920
But it’s not important.

862
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,160
I just hope her operation

863
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:15,960
can be finished

864
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,320
quickly and smoothly.

865
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,240
Okay, got it.

866
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,400
Bye.

867
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,040
That’s how it is.

868
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,120
I’m saying

869
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,120
that Captain Xing
is not that kind of person.

870
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,280
-Which means...
-Yeah.

871
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,360
Dr. Mi

872
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,400
is a nice person.

873
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,040
She is really nice.

874
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,800
Really nice.

875
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,280
Come in.

876
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,040
You are here.

877
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,160
Dr. Shao.

878
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,280
I want to ask about

879
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,360
the schedule of Shen Jianing’s surgery.

880
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,440
I just want to see you.

881
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,280
If you are in a hurry,

882
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,680
we can work overtime.

883
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,560
We are kind of in a hurry.

884
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,960
Because I need to go back

885
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,120
for the closed training soon.

886
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:06,880
I want to

887
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,120
take care of this

888
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,520
before I go back to the team.

889
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,840
Then Mi Ka will

890
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,680
feel less stressed.

891
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,080
Yeah, you are right about this.

892
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,680
To be honest,

893
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,440
some not really good words

894
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,320
have been spreading

895
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,360
in the hospital these days.

896
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,600
But based on my observation,

897
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,680
Mi Ka handled her emotion well.

898
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,640
She has improved.

899
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,680
Yes.

900
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,400
Tuesday...

901
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,200
Well,

902
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,120
how about

903
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,240
we do the surgery
on Wednesday afternoon?

904
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,400
Okay.

905
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,280
Thank you.

906
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,000
You are welcome.

907
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:31,960
I’m leaving.

908
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:47,640
Xiaoxiao.

909
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,760
Where is the patient on 15?

910
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,200
The doctor asked her
to do an examination

911
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,400
and her family member took her there.

912
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,880
Where is Dr. Mi?

913
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,200
Mi Ka went to the office
to send the materials.

914
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,400
Please tell her for me

915
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,480
that I’ve fixed it,

916
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,640
Dr. Mi can work at ease

917
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,680
and Dr. Mi’s hard work is appreciated.

918
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,120
Why are you laughing?

919
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,120
Don’t miss one word.

920
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,440
Okay.

921
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,600
Hello.

922
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,520
Captain Xing.

923
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,760
Captain Hao let me ask you

924
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,720
how your hands are doing now.

925
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,680
Can you end your vacation this weekend?

926
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,080
I’m fine now.

927
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,600
Shen Jianing will have
an operation this Wednesday.

928
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,080
I’ll go back after the operation.

929
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,720
Okay, I’ll hang up.

930
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,800
Okay, bye.

931
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,560
You know what,

932
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,200
the patient on 15
with the surname of Shen

933
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,360
is not Captain Xing’s

934
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,920
ex-girlfriend at all.

935
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,160
She’s just a relative turning to him.

936
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,480
She acts like

937
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,160
her family runs the hospital.

938
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,360
Who did you hear that from?

939
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,640
Captain Xing said it himself.

940
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,520
He said she is the daughter
of his mentor.

941
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,920
He must help her.

942
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,880
Dr. Mi also supports him to help her.

943
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,120
Dr. Mi

944
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,400
is a kind person indeed.

945
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,440
Captain Xing

946
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,880
is only her boyfriend.

947
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,760
But she is even willing to take care of
such a troublesome thing.

948
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,720
Who said first

949
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,880
that the patient on 15

950
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,520
is Captain Xing’s girlfriend?

951
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,160
I don’t know.

952
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,160
I think it came from the ward.

953
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,080
I think

954
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,000
maybe

955
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,120
these two sisters said it themselves.

956
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,280
I don’t know about that.

957
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,240
Aunt.

958
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,360
I think he came to
the hospital this morning

959
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,240
and explained our relationship
to the nursing workers

960
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,280
and the cleaning ladies.

961
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,520
He drew a clean line from us.

962
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,000
Now everyone is saying

963
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,760
that his girlfriend is kind.

964
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,280
It seems that Xing Kelei wants us

965
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,080
to have the operation
as soon as possible.

966
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,640
Jianing.

967
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,760
I...

968
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,240
Sorry.

969
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,200
Why are you running?

970
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,760
The meeting took so long.

971
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,000
I haven’t finished my cases yet.

972
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,960
Captain Xing came here.

973
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,320
Did he come to see the patient on 15?

974
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,680
No, he didn’t see her.

975
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,560
The patient on 15

976
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,640
went down for an examination.

977
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,960
He left a few words.

978
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,040
Listen carefully.

979
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,800
I’ve fixed it.

980
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,480
Dr. Mi can work at ease.

981
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,800
Dr. Mi’s hard work is appreciated.

982
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,680
That’s it?

983
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,360
That’s not enough?

984
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,920
It took me a long time to remember it.

985
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,160
All right, thank you.

986
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,080
