=Episode 7=

20
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,120
Director Wei.

21
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,560
How’s the patient?

22
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,400
His heart beats.

23
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,120
How many times?

24
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,200
One hundred and seventy eight.

25
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,960
Blood pressure is 71 and 42.

26
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,000
What medicine did you use?

27
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,640
Two tubes of Cordarone.

28
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,800
The patient had a sudden heart attack

29
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,460
at the waiting area,

30
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,360
and lost consciousness soon.

31
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,640
He also had

32
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,520
malignant arrhythmia.

33
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,360
I think

34
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,400
he has coronary embolism.

35
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,000
Continue, what to do?

36
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,320
It’s very dangerous
without thrombolysis.

37
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,360
The most effective way

38
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,800
is interventional coronary surgery.

39
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,880
What did the patient come for?

40
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,960
He cut his arm by accident.

41
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,470
Heart attack broke suddenly.

42
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,000
Who inquired his family

43
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,770
just now?

44
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:12,400
Me.

45
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,640
Call his family in.

46
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,720
Yes.

47
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,520
Director, here’s his family.

48
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,720
Brother.

49
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,640
How did he get the wound

50
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,320
on his belly?

51
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,360
He had an appendix\hoperation.

52
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,640
When did he do it?

53
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,040
Last week.

54
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,680
No, no, no. The week before last.

55
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,320
Did he have hypertension or diabetes?

56
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,480
He has hypertension,

57
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,560
no diabetes.

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,920
Take her out

59
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,680
and sign critical condition notice.

60
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,520
OK.

61
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,680
Critical condition notice?

62
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,200
Take it easy.

63
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:43,960
Is it serious? Doctor!

64
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,760
She’s just frightening you.

65
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:45,960
Zhou Zhe,

66
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,720
notify Cardiology Department
for consultation.

67
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,280
Transfer the patient

68
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,280
to the Emergency Medicine Department.

69
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,720
OK.

70
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,720
What did you say?

71
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,360
Thrombolysis?

72
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,680
I didn’t know

73
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,960
he had an operation recently.

74
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,280
You’re the new girl

75
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,000
of the Neurosurgery Department, right?

76
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,800
You followed Shao Yuhan

77
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,800
for some days.

78
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,800
Didn’t he

79
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,560
teach you how to

80
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,920
inquire symptoms?

81
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,200
Thrombolysis in this case?

82
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,600
What if it causes hemorrhoea?

83
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,240
Sorry, Director Wei.

84
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,640
Get out.

85
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,040
Don’t interfere with me here.

86
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,680
Hello, KFC breakfast.

87
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,320
Who ordered these?

88
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,840
-You ordered?
-Is it you?

89
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,910
No, no, no.

90
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,640
-It’s not me.
-Not you?

91
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,240
Come. I’ll tell you the condition

92
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:42,880
of this patient.

93
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,800
It’s yours now.

94
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,480
OK.

95
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,080
OK. I’ll keep some for you.

96
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,010
No problem.

97
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,320
Yanshan,

98
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,400
Have some coffee.

99
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,520
Thank you, Dr. Jia.

100
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,920
Why treat me breakfast?

101
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,920
It’s from Mi Ka.

102
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:56,960
Everyone has it.

103
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,320
Here are Panini and porringer.

104
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,080
Which one do you like?

105
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,200
I like Panini.

106
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,680
OK. Here.

107
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,600
Panini.

108
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,360
Thank you.

109
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,800
Mi Ka is so considerate.

110
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,640
All of us don’t want her to leave.

111
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,760
We’ll make a way

112
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,720
to get her back.

113
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,360
Don’t work so hard.

114
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,280
Have some rest.

115
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,440
OK.

116
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,060
(Ms. Mi Ka, Neurosurgery)

117
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,320
Mi Ka.

118
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,120
How’s the patient?

119
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,160
He’s fine. His arm was treated,

120
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:37,840
and he’s sent to Cardiology Department.

121
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,520
Good.

122
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,440
Zhou Zhe.

123
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,240
Let me introduce.

124
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,960
This is a new comer, Mi Ka.

125
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,320
This is our senior, Zhou Zhe.

126
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,840
Don’t say so.

127
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,320
I just come here

128
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,200
a few years earlier than you.

129
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,520
Please give me more advice, Dr. Zhou.

130
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,280
It’s my pleasure.

131
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,880
Make yourself easy. We’re the same.

132
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,750
-Thank you.
-I’ll go work now.

133
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,560
OK.

134
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,320
Don’t worry. He’s very nice.

135
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,640
He treats us very well.

136
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,080
Chen Xiaoyan.

137
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,040
Mi Ka.

138
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,680
You didn’t see her before,

139
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,160
the master of emergency care,
Feng Manman.

140
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:10,800
Hello.

141
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,620
You know her.

142
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,600
Of course.

143
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,680
Unexpectedly,

144
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,760
you come to our department.

145
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,120
Dr. Mi,

146
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,440
we heard of your name

147
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,110
long ago.

148
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,200
Am I so notorious?

149
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,350
We’ll get to work now.

150
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,460
-Bye-bye.

151
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:25,220
Bye-bye.

152
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,200
Do you think

153
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,720
Director Wei is

154
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,600
too indifferent and relentless?

155
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,120
It’s nothing.

156
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:32,870
When we came here before,

157
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:33,990
few of us weren’t criticized.

158
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,080
It’s shifting time.

159
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,840
I have to have lunch. Will you?

160
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,800
No, I won’t. Take your time.

161
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,560
OK. Don’t be upset.

162
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,760
-Bye-bye.

163
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:57,700
(To Xing Kelei
I’m transferred to Emergency Department)

164
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:02,700
(Is Xiaochao recovering well?)

165
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,100
(For Xiaochao,
attention needs to be paid)

166
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,100
(to the functions of his limbs.)

167
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,320
This is a simulation

168
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,360
of a gold processing plant.

169
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,600
Next,

170
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,800
each of you will draw a card.

171
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,120
There are four robbers in this plant.

172
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,160
The one who takes the red card

173
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,440
will kill the robbers in red.

174
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,560
The one who takes the green card

175
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,880
will kill the robbers in green.

176
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,280
This is to test

177
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,360
your contingency ability

178
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,400
in low light conditions.

179
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,120
Got it?

180
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes!

181
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,000
Come, take a card.

182
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,400
Thank you.

183
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,200
You’re welcome.

184
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,840
Thank you.

185
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,440
It’s not as good as Boston’s coffee.

186
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,680
Just take it.

187
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,280
You treat me coffee.

188
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,440
I should follow you.

189
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,840
I’m not so picky.

190
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,200
You’re home.

191
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:18,960
By the way,

192
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,920
what do you think of Mi Ka,

193
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,800
the new comer

194
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,120
of your Department?

195
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,800
You come straight to the point.

196
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,880
It seems the girl

197
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,280
is your favorite student.

198
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,240
From your tone and expression,

199
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,520
you’re not satisfied with her.

200
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,840
To be frank,

201
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,880
she nearly made a trouble

202
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,400
at her “debut” today.

203
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,680
Is the young

204
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,720
so blundering now?

205
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,160
She’s young.

206
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,440
You should teach her more.

207
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,640
I heard something about her.

208
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,360
It’s not difficult for you

209
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,600
to keep her at your department.

210
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,400
This girl

211
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,960
has good basis,

212
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,560
but she needs

213
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,610
some frustrations

214
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,580
to grow up quickly.

215
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,720
You know

216
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,800
the Emergency Department

217
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,080
is the busiest and toughest

218
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,320
area in the whole hospital.

219
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,640
You have to face various

220
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,720
patients and families,

221
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,360
as well as various emergencies.

222
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,800
If she can be

223
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,080
a good doctor

224
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,840
in such a condition,

225
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,640
she can face whatever situation

226
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,680
in the future easily,

227
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,800
am I right?

228
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,440
Moreover,

229
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,360
you’re such a

230
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,160
good instructor.

231
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,720
She’s lucky, right?

232
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,480
You’ve expended much care

233
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,040
and thought on it.

234
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,080
Right,

235
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,360
here you are.

236
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,180
(International Remote
Surgery Conference)

237
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,600
You’re still wearing this watch?

238
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,280
I’m used to it.

239
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,640
This is the invitation of the

240
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,960
International Remote Surgery Conference.

241
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,550
One of my classmates

242
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,640
started a business

243
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,480
and engaged in this field.

244
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,880
He asked me to invite

245
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,320
some important guests for him.

246
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,760
Please accept it.

247
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,280
It’s called propaganda

248
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,000
in the entertainment circle.

249
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,560
Propaganda?

250
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,480
What nonsense!

251
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,960
Are you still single?

252
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,800
Actually, you and Yao...

253
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,160
I have an operation soon.

254
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,780
I’ll go get prepared.

255
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:11,920
The coffee here

256
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,040
is better than Boston’s.

257
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,040
I’ll treat you next time.

258
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,720
Oh, here.

259
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,560
Thank you.

260
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,840
Take it.

261
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,080
I really don’t want it.

262
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,560
See you.

263
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,200
(Emergency Manual)
Intravenous injection,

264
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,240
penicillin-sensitive.

265
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,360
(Moments Mi Ka)

266
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,240
Go to bed early.

267
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,120
Hug?

268
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,120
Is it too intimate?

269
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,360
Rose?

270
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,160
It’s not good either.

271
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,120
Neither a silly smile.

272
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,120
Is it too intimate

273
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,880
to ask her to go to bed early?

274
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,320
Several doctors in her hospital

275
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,080
are my WeChat frineds.

276
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,880
It’s not good for them to see it.

277
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,000
Sleep early to keep healthy.

278
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,040
Report your work

279
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,770
at hands, respectively.

280
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,020
You’ve worked very hard recently.

281
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,000
Keep it.

282
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,200
Morning.

283
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,280
Do you know the time?

284
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,040
We should arrive at 7:00 am.

285
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,160
It’s 6:55 am now.

286
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,520
My rule is ten minutes in advance.

287
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,240
A doctor can’t just come and go

288
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,240
at exact time point.

289
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,360
Working for me,

290
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,440
you should know
each second is critical..

291
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,960
I’ll remember it.

292
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,080
Let’s start the morning meeting.

293
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,240
Report your work

294
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,040
at hands, respectively.

295
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,360
The patients in Observation Ward
are stable.

296
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,200
The old man we saved yesterday

297
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:50,920
is a little troublesome.

298
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,200
He’s over 70 years old.

299
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,800
He had fracture due to car accident

300
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,280
and other complications.

301
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,040
He’ll be transferred to
Orthopedics Department soon.

302
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,960
But he has bad

303
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,630
cardiac ejection fraction.

304
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,120
Although his situation is under control,

305
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,400
he still needs close observation.

306
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,720
Notify the Orthopedics Department
for consultation.

307
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,680
Yes!

308
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,760
I have a kid patient.

309
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,840
He came here yesterday

310
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,880
after a quarrel with his parents.

311
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,920
The broken glass of the phone

312
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,960
cut his hand seriously.

313
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,800
With the risk of infection,

314
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,760
he’s having injection now.

315
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,360
How fractious the children are!

316
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,440
They quarreled for his parents

317
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,000
didn’t allow him to play with the phone.

318
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,080
You’re the new comer Mi Ka, right?

319
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,240
Yes.

320
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,840
Are you unhappy

321
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,040
to be transferred here?

322
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,040
No.

323
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,280
Upset?

324
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,280
Frustrated?

325
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,320
Right?

326
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,880
I can understand.

327
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,680
Young doctors don’t want to

328
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,320
work at Emergency Department,

329
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,000
especially Emergency Surgery Department,

330
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,840
because of fast pace and tough tasks.

331
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,520
You’re from Neurosurgery.

332
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,440
You may feel big difference.

333
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,960
Our work doesn’t need

334
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,640
as much skills as Neurosurgery,

335
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,080
But we don’t need idler, either.

336
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,920
If you don’t want to stay here,
just tell me.

337
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,040
Director Wei.

338
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,280
I’m not an idler.

339
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,680
I’ll work hard.

340
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,880
That’s good.

341
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,800
You follow Zhou Zhe.

342
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,920
Watch and ask more.

343
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,720
Don’t act on your own

344
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,680
like what you did yesterday.

345
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:15,960
Yes.

346
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,560
Adjust your mindset

347
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,080
and treat it as your internship.

348
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,280
Director Wei,

349
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,680
actually, Mi Ka is really outstanding.

350
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,000
Yesterday, she’s...

351
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,760
Dismiss!

352
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,720
See?

353
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,000
This is her!

354
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,520
She even doesn’t let me finish.

355
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,880
If you speak ill of Director Wei again,

356
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,440
I’ll record it

357
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,400
without any word missing.

358
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,240
Who said anything?

359
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,560
I didn’t hear.

360
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,240
I didn’t say anything.

361
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,320
Actually,
Director Wei asked you to follow me,

362
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,480
because you’re new here,

363
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,520
and you need adjustment.

364
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,320
I see. Dr. Zhou.

365
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,640
Have your breakfast now.

366
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,880
We’ll have to stand all day long.

367
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,040
OK.

368
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,400
Still coffee,

369
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,080
fried bread stick , soybean milk,

370
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,360
and the pancake.

371
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:04,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

372
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,800
You’re leaving, Captain Xing?

373
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,200
Captain Xing.

374
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,400
OK. That’s it.

375
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,480
Captain Xing.

376
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,800
You’re leaving, Captain Xing?

377
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,440
Yes.

378
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,120
Kelei.

379
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,200
Captain Hao.

380
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,760
You’ve done well
in the special training.

381
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,760
The counterpart police
sent a letter of thanks.

382
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,040
I’ll treat you to dinner tonight.

383
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,040
Come to my home.

384
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,760
I’ll ask my wife to make more dishes.

385
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,320
Perhaps some other day.

386
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,960
Anything important?

387
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,480
I... I have to go to the hospital

388
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,800
and see Xiaochao.

389
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,880
Really? Why don’t you change a day?

390
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:37,840
Moreover,

391
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,160
do you need a whole day?

392
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,080
Well, I’ll treat you the other day.

393
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:41,920
I’ll treat you.

394
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,840
Bye-bye.

395
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,400
Silly boy.

396
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,920
Mi Ka, let’s sit there.

397
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,560
Yanshan is there.

398
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,400
You finished?

399
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,760
Yanshan, you’ve finished?

400
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,640
Why are you so late?

401
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,520
What’s wrong?

402
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,960
We received four patients

403
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:04,960
from a car accident

404
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,440
this morning.

405
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,440
She’s too tired to have lunch.

406
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,320
Hurry to eat.

407
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,640
Director Shao has

408
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,720
an outpatient service this afternoon.

409
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,920
I have to go now.

410
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,000
Bye-bye.

411
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,560
-I finished too.
-Bye-bye.

412
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,160
Right, Mi Ka,

413
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,240
thank you.

414
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,240
You’re so kind

415
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,640
to offer us breakfasts,

416
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,320
coffees and others.

417
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,720
We appreciate it very much.

418
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,920
I’ll treat you some other day.

419
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,720
Take your time.

420
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,040
What does he mean?

421
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,320
You don’t know?

422
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,320
No.

423
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,680
Me, either.

424
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,320
Bro!

425
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,520
Can’t you see me?

426
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,680
Bro!

427
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,560
What’s wrong?

428
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,480
Is there anything wrong in the squad?

429
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,040
How could it be?

430
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,560
Well, hum…

431
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,880
What is Dr. Mi busy with recently?

432
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,320
I asked her about your conditions,

433
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,520
but she didn’t answer me.

434
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,160
It’s my fault.

435
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,680
Dr. Mi was transferred to
the Emergency Department.

436
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,520
Emergency Department?

437
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:30,920
When?

438
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,040
It’s exactly that day

439
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,600
after what happened.

440
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,160
The patient on bed 16

441
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:40,840
wants to remove nasal feeding.

442
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,560
He pulled out the stomach tube
for many times.

443
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,560
The nurses are annoyed.

444
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,760
I checked his conditions.

445
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,560
Encephaledema
is basically under control.

446
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,160
It should be no problem

447
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,040
for him to have liquid diet.

448
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,520
What about Geng Xiaochao?

449
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,800
He recovered well

450
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,640
after pulling out the diversion tube,

451
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,560
without fever or other complications.

452
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,360
If it keeps like this,

453
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,600
he can be discharged next week.

454
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:00,630
Good.

455
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,000
Arrange a precision motion test

456
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,970
for him before he’s discharged.

457
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,840
OK.

458
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,110
Director Shao,

459
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,280
these patients were

460
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,640
looked after by Mi Ka before.

461
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,920
They always ask

462
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,400
-when Mi Ka will return...
-Don’t ask mercy for her.

463
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,520
It’s normal personnel transfer.

464
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,400
It’s settled.

465
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,040
Then, I’m leaving now.

466
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,400
Xing Sir.

467
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,240
Dr. Shao.

468
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,520
What’s up?

469
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,760
I heard Mi Ka was transferred to

470
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,720
the Emergency Department.

471
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,200
I think there must be

472
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:41,940
some misunderstanding here.

473
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,640
I want to explain it.

474
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,200
If you want to ask about

475
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,360
Geng Xiaochao’s situation,

476
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,720
I’ll answer you honestly.

477
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,560
But if it’s about our

478
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,220
personnel transfer.

479
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:51,850
I’m sorry.

480
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,080
I have nothing to say.

481
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,440
Is it personnel transfer or punishment?

482
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,840
I don’t think these two things

483
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,320
have any relation in nature.

484
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,520
This arrangement at such time

485
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,920
is telling everyone that

486
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,160
Mi Ka was wrong.

487
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,920
Mi Ka.

488
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,160
I saw Instructor Xing

489
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,360
going to Director Shao’s office

490
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,480
angrily.

491
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,880
Why did he come to Director Shao?

492
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,600
It’s likely related to you.

493
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,880
(Director’s Office)
Is it proper

494
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,440
to judge a thing

495
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,760
from your own standing point?

496
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,280
I’m not here to

497
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,360
argue with you.

498
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,720
I just want to express

499
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,420
my opinions

500
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:23,520
as a party involved.

501
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,480
At that time,

502
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,640
it’s the family who pushed Mi Ka first.

503
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,520
So Dr. Mi was not wrong.

504
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,160
Instead, I think

505
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,360
she’s very responsible

506
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:32,960
to her patient.

507
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,320
It’s worth praising.

508
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,640
I admit,

509
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,320
I was a little excited

510
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,080
back then,

511
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,320
but Xiaochao is my subordinate.

512
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,680
No matter what happens,

513
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,400
I have to protect him.

514
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,400
Mi Ka is your subordinate.

515
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,520
You shouldn’t punish her

516
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,320
because of the public opinions

517
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,720
on the Internet

518
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,600
or the complaints from the family.

519
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,240
Alright.

520
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,560
Listen to me,

521
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,560
I think carefully for

522
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,760
my personnel appointment.

523
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,920
Emergency Department needs hands.

524
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,080
Mi Ka is a

525
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:58,960
doctor with great responsibility

526
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,960
and good skills.

527
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,480
I approved her transfer
according to the rule.

528
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,960
You do know

529
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,160
she’s very proud.

530
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,360
-Neurosurgery is very important to her.
-I know!

531
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,040
Is it Mi Ka who asked you

532
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,680
to speak for her?

533
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,160
It’s enough. Don’t say anymore.

534
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,160
Director Shao,

535
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,920
it’s none of his business.

536
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,320
His opinions

537
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,440
are not mine.

538
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,680
I’ll do my best
in the Emergency Department.

539
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,800
You’re right.

540
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,560
Mi Ka is a

541
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,040
very proud girl.

542
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,720
But what you’re doing now

543
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,320
will make her suffer a lot.

544
00:19:59,280 --> 00:19:59,960
Why did you make bold to

545
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,240
go to my superior

546
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,240
and interfere with my job?

547
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,120
I just want to tell him that

548
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,360
what happened is actually not

549
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,040
your problem.

550
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,240
You’re not my instructor anymore.

551
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,920
I’ve graduated.

552
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,440
So don’t interfere with

553
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,240
my business anymore.

554
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,000
I just want to clarify for you.

555
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,640
What do I need to clarify?

556
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,160
I’ve been in the
Emergency Department now.

557
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,200
It should have been over.

558
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,280
What you are doing now

559
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,280
gets it out again.

560
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,440
I had tasks these days.

561
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,680
I didn’t know what happened.

562
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,720
Sorry

563
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,440
for bringing you trouble.

564
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,680
I won’t work here anymore.

565
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,120
Xiaochao is not my duty.

566
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,240
Let’s...

567
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,760
Let’s not contact anymore.

568
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,880
Bad luck will come
when we’re together.

569
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,980
(Outpatient)

570
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,400
Mi Ka.

571
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,480
Are you tired?

572
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,160
It’s just a beginning.

573
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,160
I didn’t sleep well last night.

574
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,200
It’s really stressful to

575
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,520
work in the Emergency Department

576
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,320
at the beginning.

577
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,760
You’ll get used to it soon.

578
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,040
Take it easy.

579
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,480
Adhesive plaster.

580
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,160
Adhesive plaster!

581
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,640
Adhesive plaster.

582
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,080
Come on.

583
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,480
Give it to me.

584
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,280
It’s OK now.
Come to change dressings in two days.

585
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,160
Don’t touch water.

586
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,360
Thank you, doctor.

587
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,520
Mi Ka.

588
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,680
What’s wrong with you?

589
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,280
Nothing.

590
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,640
(Outpatient Room)
Dr. Zhou.

591
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,600
Come have a look.

592
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,280
This boy hurts his eyes

593
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,120
and keeps tearing.

594
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:20,690
We wonder if there is

595
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:21,490
any sharp object

596
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:22,150
in his eyes.

597
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,540
The Ophthalmology Department is closed.

598
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,520
We have no idea

599
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,360
but come to you.

600
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,800
Let me check it.

601
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,400
We’ve tried that just now.

602
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,240
But he didn’t allow anyone

603
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,040
to see his eyes.

604
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,160
Doctor, please make a way.

605
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,640
Eyes are important for him,

606
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,640
or he’ll suffer a lot.

607
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,560
Don’t worry.

608
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,160
Hello, kid.

609
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,320
Let me check it for you. Come on.

610
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,280
Excuse me,

611
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,280
did he touch anything?

612
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,400
How long did he suffer?

613
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,960
His grandma looked after him.

614
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,080
She said that

615
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,800
he always blinks and rubs his eyes.

616
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,280
Now, he’s shedding tears.

617
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,680
It’s swollen.

618
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,880
I don’t think there is

619
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,840
any sharp object.

620
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,560
Dr. Zhou,

621
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,840
could I have a look?

622
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,440
Of course. Go ahead.

623
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,280
Have a look.

624
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,520
Baby, listen to the doctor, OK?

625
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,040
Kid,

626
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,040
I have a way

627
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,960
to make you not suffer.

628
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,520
Can you show me your eyes?

629
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,400
Do you like Minions

630
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,680
or Peppa Pig?

631
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,840
Minions.

632
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,080
It is trichiasis.

633
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,200
Maybe his grandma

634
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,000
didn’t pay attention to it.

635
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,720
I see.

636
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,400
I thought he’s naughty

637
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,160
and touched his eyes

638
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:33,960
with dirty hands.

639
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,680
But it seems

640
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,920
he has conjunctivitis now,

641
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,280
so he suffers a lot.

642
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,840
Let’s pull out

643
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,840
his abnormal eyelashes first.

644
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,160
You go to
the Ophthalmology Department tomorrow

645
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,680
and take some guttae sulface.

646
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,160
OK. Thank you, doctor.

647
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,960
Pretty, want a Taxi?

648
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,640
Dr. Mi, what a coincidence!

649
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,440
I happened to pass by.

650
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,400
May I give you a ride?

651
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,240
It’s so late.

652
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,280
It’s not safe for you to ride a bike.

653
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,960
But I think

654
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,120
I’m not safe either

655
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,360
while meeting you.

656
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,680
Well, what about

657
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,760
you drive my car?

658
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,560
OK.

659
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:31,960
Address.

660
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,520
Dequan Road No. 335.

661
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,720
OK.

662
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,520
Don’t you use navigator?

663
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,560
I am a navigator.

664
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:48,960
Well,

665
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,920
I bought some sparkling water,

666
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:50,840
without sugar.

667
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,480
It tastes nice. Want it?

668
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,760
Do you usually

669
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,720
drink two bottles a time?

670
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,960
I planned to take one home

671
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,480
and drink at night.

672
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,480
Are you used to
the Emergency Department?

673
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,720
Yes.

674
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,680
There is no instructor like you

675
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,400
who’ll criticize me.

676
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,160
I’m quite used to it.

677
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,440
Well.

678
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,320
Why do you ride so far to go home?

679
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,320
Didn’t you say

680
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,960
a doctor needs strong body?

681
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,720
Could I

682
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,000
have a nap for a while?

683
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,400
I’m sleepy.

684
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,320
We arrived?

685
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,840
Have you waited for some time?

686
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,160
Yes.

687
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,440
I’m so sorry. I fell asleep.

688
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,960
How could I sleep so well?

689
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,280
Like a dead pig!

690
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,120
You have quite a poor

691
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:41,840
sense of security.

692
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,200
A single girl mustn’t sleep

693
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,200
when taking Taxi

694
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,520
or on-line car-hailing service.

695
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,160
How could you know I’m single?

696
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,080
It’s so late.

697
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,920
Your boyfriend doesn’t come
to pick you up.

698
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,440
Break up if you do have.

699
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,880
What if my boyfriend

700
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,360
is a special police

701
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,600
and as busy as you are?

702
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,320
I have to leave now.

703
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,520
Remember to give me praise.

704
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,800
And a silk banner, OK?

705
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,040
Thank you.

706
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,120
Don’t you take

707
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:17,800
your sparkling water?

Mi Ka.

728

Shouldn’t you work on the day shift?

729
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,760
It’s just 6:20 am,

730
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,040
not the time to change shift.

731
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,280
I come early and check the records

732
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,160
to avoid criticism.

733
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,200
If I had your awareness,

734
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,920
I wouldn’t have been criticized so much.

735
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,400
Not long ago,

736
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:44,960
a patient with head injuries came,

737
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,080
and was transferred to the Neurosurgery.

738
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,480
I have to wait for his report.

739
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,680
Go change the shift.

740
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,160
I’ll get the report for you.

741
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,160
Thank you.

742
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:56,720
Morning.

743
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:57,630
-Dr. Mi.
-Morning.

744
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:03,540
(Neurosurgery)

745
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:13,960
Yanshan.

746
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,240
Mi Ka.

747
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,520
Why are you here?

748
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,440
I come to sign

749
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,600
a report for a patient

750
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,560
who’s transferred here.

751
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,000
Are you used to
the Emergency Department?

752
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,560
Why didn’t you come to Director Shao

753
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,400
for his mercy?

754
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:32,560
-No need.
-Mi Ka.

755
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,480
We understand

756
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,120
what you think.

757
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,080
Moreover, you treated us

758
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,690
so many

759
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,800
breakfasts and coffees,

760
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,760
we won’t just

761
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,440
sit watching.

762
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,440
Once possible,

763
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,680
we will speak good for you

764
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,320
in front of the director.

765
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:43,920
Yes.

766
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,240
When it’s not so hot,

767
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,680
and Director Shao agrees,

768
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,840
you can come back again.

769
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,720
Yes.

770
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,040
What breakfasts and coffees?

771
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,560
Didn’t you order it?

772
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,520
It’s sent here on time,

773
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,280
with your name on it.

774
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,520
Mi Ka.

775
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,800
It’s OK for you to treat us

776
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,400
once or twice.

777
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,120
But you don’t have to go

778
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:02,880
to this expense every day.

779
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:03,720
Hello, everyone.

780
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,960
Ms. Mi’s breakfast.

781
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,720
Here it comes.

782
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,440
This?

783
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,320
She’s still pretending.

784
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,300
(Ms. Mi Ka, Neurosurgery)

785
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,080
I’ll check it.

786
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,800
Sir, sir.

787
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,240
Wait, wait a second please.

788
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,410
Who...

789
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,720
Who ordered

790
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,520
these breakfasts?

791
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,920
I’m so sorry.

792
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,760
We can’t see

793
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,760
the specific information of the client.

794
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,440
Is it from the same person?

795
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:33,840
Yes.

796
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,280
It’s ordered by Ms. Mi in advance.

797
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,400
Can you help me

798
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,440
call the customer service number?

799
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,440
I... I want to check it.

800
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,880
I think they made a mistake.

801
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,560
I see.

802
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,080
Wenbo,

803
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,160
there is a big sweep

804
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,760
of transport violations these days.

805
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,160
We’ll be responsible for

806
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,400
the toll stations
at highways around the city.

807
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,880
Make a name list for it.

808
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,400
OK.

809
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,960
Hello?

810
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,280
Dr. Mi.

811
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,640
Xing Sir.

812
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,200
What’s wrong?

813
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,720
Well.

814
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,000
You ordered the breakfasts

815
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,880
every day?

816
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,840
Yes. It’s our team

817
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,600
who ordered that for you.

818
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,200
To thank you for

819
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,000
looking after Xiaochao,

820
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,880
we ordered some breakfasts

821
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,760
and coffees.

822
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,080
It’s not against your rule, is it?

823
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,760
Well.

824
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,640
Thank you. Thank you so much.

825
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,360
I’ll explain to others

826
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,880
so that they won’t misunderstand it.

827
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,680
Misunderstand?

828
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,360
About what?

829
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,400
Nothing. It’s our duty and work

830
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,280
to look after Xiaochao,

831
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,000
right?

832
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,120
I...

833
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,080
I bought different kinds of food.

834
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,480
No, we

835
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,600
bought different kinds of food.

836
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,800
Do you like it?

837
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,720
I didn’t have it.

838
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,560
I’m in the Emergency Department now.

839
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,440
I come to send a report today

840
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,640
and know this benefit.

841
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,920
You didn’t have

842
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,800
any of it?

843
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,960
But I still want to thank you.

844
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,920
I... I have to work now. Bye-bye.

845
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,480
What’s up? Why so upset?

846
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,120
Nothing.

847
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,120
Director Wei,

848
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,480
Mi Ka is just used to doing it.

849
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,120
She doesn’t intend to go back.

850
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,920
Even if she does,

851
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,520
it doesn’t matter.

852
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,920
Basic skills

853
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,680
are the foundations of a doctor.

854
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,360
What about you?

855
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,480
What do you do in your spare time?

856
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,240
This is Shao Yuhan.

857
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,560
Postpone Liu Ting’s operation time

858
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,440
to 2:00 pm. Yeah.

859
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:57,920
Good.

860
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,360
Come in.

861
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:10,920
What’s this?

862
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:11,880
Director Shao,

863
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,360
I saw you just drink milk

864
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:13,920
every morning.

865
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,120
I think you don’t like

866
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,190
the breakfast in the canteen.

867
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,600
So I made some

868
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,630
organic light food for you.

869
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,280
Thank you.

870
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,230
I had breakfast at home.

871
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,760
Anything else?

872
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:27,800
I wrote a thesis

873
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,440
and want you to review it for me.

874
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,960
I want to publish it on core journal.

875
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,760
Did you encounter the cases

876
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,880
you mentioned in it?

877
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:45,360
No.

878
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:46,360
No?

879
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,360
Why did you write about it?

880
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,520
Because there is no

881
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,840
thesis or works

882
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,840
related to this disease in China.

883
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,600
I think it’s of great

884
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,440
academic significance.

885
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,680
I referred to some English...

886
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,960
Any research

887
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,640
should be based on

888
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,960
practice.

889
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,440
Medicine is not a fancied discipline,
right?

890
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,280
Xu Yanshan.

891
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,920
I know,

892
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,320
a thesis published

893
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:09,960
on core journal

894
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,720
will help you get a title.

895
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,280
But I want to say,

896
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,360
if you don’t know

897
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,880
how to become a good doctor,

898
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,160
even you get

899
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,080
a title you want,

900
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,440
does it make any sense?

901
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,440
Got it. Director Shao.

902
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,160
And your organic light food.

903
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,560
Dad.

904
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,800
How could he vomit here?

905
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,320
Take him to the toilet.

906
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,080
Sorry. Sorry.

907
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:52,920
How dirty!

908
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,200
Sorry. Sorry.

909
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:54,800
I’m so sorry.

910
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,000
Excuse me. Make way.

911
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,520
A cleaner will come soon.

912
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,440
What’s wrong with him?

913
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,240
Doctor, he always vomits.

914
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,720
So I take him here.

915
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,480
There is no number for outpatient.

916
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,000
So we come here.

917
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,000
Doctor,

918
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,160
should we register for
Gastroenterology Department?

919
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,360
Gramp,

920
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,480
what’s wrong with you?

921
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,520
How do you feel?

922
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,320
My dad has senile dementia.

923
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,400
He can’t speak.

924
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,360
He must eat something wrong.

925
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,200
He vomited for several times,

926
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,280
like a spray.

927
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,280
Like a spray?

928
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,440
Yes.

929
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,880
What has he been doing lately?

930
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,680
Or did he get hurt?

931
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,600
No.

932
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:26,690
It’s...

933
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,200
just some time ago,

934
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,080
we didn’t notice him,

935
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,480
and he went downstairs.

936
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,480
But today, we

937
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,520
watched him all the time.

938
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,560
All the time.

939
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:40,960
Ouch.

940
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,040
I think he got hurt

941
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,240
for quite a while.

942
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,040
He needs a

943
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,320
brain CT.

944
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,360
Go have the prescription.

945
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,120
Doctor.

946
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,760
Didn’t he vomit?

947
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,200
It’s just enterogastritis.

948
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,160
Why should he have brain CT?

949
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,400
Vomit doesn’t necessarily mean

950
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,240
he eats something wrong.

951
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,480
I think your father

952
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,800
fell down some time ago

953
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,200
and bumped his head.

954
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,440
But he couldn’t

955
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,200
tell you by himself.

956
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,040
He couldn’t say it.

957
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:01,860
Thank you.

958
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,800
Please help me do that.

959
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:03,450
OK.

960
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:04,050
Let’s go.

961
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:04,960
-Come.
-I’ll do it.

962
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,360
Electrocardiograph monitoring.

963
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,960
Gramp.

964
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,120
Keep awake. Don’t sleep.

965
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:15,840
I think

966
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,840
he got hurt for a long time.

967
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,520
The hematoma grows

968
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,280
and develops like this today.

969
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,560
Director Wei,

970
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,920
come to check this patient.

971
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,400
He vomited

972
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,040
like a spray

973
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:26,840
at the waiting area.

974
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,240
He has anisocoria

975
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,640
and begins to lose consciousness.

976
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,560
It’s exactly

977
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,640
the symptoms of subdural hematoma.

978
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,920
Didn’t his family

979
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:34,800
tell you the situation?

980
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,160
He can’t speak.

981
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,920
His family said

982
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,440
he went out alone and got hurt,

983
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,360
but no one discovered it.

984
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,400
Take brain CT first.

985
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,800
Notify the Neurosurgery
for consultation.

986
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,480
Yes.

987
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,480
Let me do it.

988
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,200
Get off.

989
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:49,700
Certificate.

990
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:50,400
Thank you.

991
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,400
Captain Xing. Captain Xing.

992
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,600
There’s a thing under the truck.

993
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,880
Thank you.

994
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,080
What’s on the truck?

995
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,360
I don’t know.

996
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,880
This is not my truck.

997
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,160
I just drive it.

998
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,160
Stop!

999
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:34,910
Freeze!

1000
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,040
Go!

1001
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,240
Take him away!

1002
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,110
Yes!

1003
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,200
Morning, Dr. Mi.

1004
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,480
Morning, Xing Sir.

1005
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,560
Do you just finish the night shift?

1006
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,240
Yes.

1007
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,320
What about you?

1008
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,520
Me, too.

1009
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:36,840
I want a mango.

1010
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,000
I’ll have a mango.

1011
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,080
Take an orange.

1012
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:41,640
Thank you.

1013
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,360
Thank Mi Ka.

1014
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:45,920
Director Wei.

1015
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,240
What are you doing?

1016
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,000
The office is not a supermarket.

1017
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,800
Director Wei, you are here just in time.

1018
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:51,880
The fruits are particularly sweet.

1019
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,280
They’re full of love,

1020
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:53,930
it’s quite different.

1021
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,820
Yes. Director.

1022
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:55,430
These are sent

1023
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:56,310
by the family of the old man,

1024
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,220
to thank Mi Ka.

1025
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,120
If Mi Ka wasn’t so careful to discover

1026
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,200
his father bumped his head,

1027
00:40:59,440 --> 00:40:59,960
they might

1028
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,520
treat it as enterogastritis.

1029
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:02,680
No.

1030
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,880
It’s Director Wei’s contribution.

1031
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,160
Being careful is the basic quality

1032
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:07,720
for working in the Emergency Department.

1033
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,200
Work harder.

1034
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,400
Yes.

1035
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,080
What are you waiting for?

1036
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,000
Go to work.

1037
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,280
OK.

1038
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,520
Do you hear it?

1039
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,320
She’s praising you.

1040
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,560
I didn’t hear that.

1041
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,560
In the Emergency Department,

1042
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,560
no criticism is praising.

1043
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,880
That’s pretty good for you

1044
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,640
to have this comment.

1045
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,280
You got this praise

1046
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:34,840
in such a short time.

1047
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,040
Wonderful!

1048
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,280
Dr. Mi,

1049
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,400
you break the record

1050
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,720
of our Emergency Department

1051
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,960
under the supervision of Director Wei.

1052
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,680
It’s enough. Let’s work.

1053
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,480
Don’t flatter me,

1054
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,560
or I’ll be proud.

1055
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,560
I’ll have this

1056
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,720
instead of lunch.

1057
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,600
Director Wei.

1058
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,600
You’re leaving?

1059
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,600
Wait a second. Let’s have a chat.

1060
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:10,760
Why?

1061
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,840
Am I so

1062
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,520
frightening?

1063
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,560
No.

1064
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,800
All of us respect you.

1065
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,720
It’s fear, I think.

1066
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,520
Director Wei.

1067
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,840
What do you want to say?

1068
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,600
Did... I make

1069
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,880
any mistake again?

1070
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,080
Are you still upset for

1071
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,440
coming to the Emergency Department?

1072
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:28,800
No.

1073
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,160
At the first day,

1074
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,800
I was really upset,

1075
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,720
but that’s because

1076
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,360
I felt sorry for Director Shao,

1077
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,680
not because of the difference

1078
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,040
between the two departments.

1079
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,730
Do you think Shao Yuhan

1080
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,940
asked you to the Emergency Department

1081
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,380
because you did something wrong?

1082
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,670
Yes.

1083
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,640
I did make a mistake.

1084
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,120
Why should you come to

1085
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:52,720
our department?

1086
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,000
Have you ever thought about it?

1087
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,920
Obviously you haven’t.

1088
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,640
Renxin Hospital

1089
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,640
receives about 1,000 patients

1090
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,920
every day at the Emergency Department.

1091
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,120
Those who
can’t get a number at Outpatient,

1092
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,640
can’t get medicine at Pharmacy,

1093
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,360
can’t get hospitalized,

1094
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,080
and can’t come at day time,

1095
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,880
come to the Emergency Department.

1096
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,000
It’s like a war in our department.

1097
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,040
We have emergencies,

1098
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,520
touch-and-go,

1099
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,120
and willful trouble makers.

1100
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,360
Those who can’t think quickly

1101
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,880
and respond flexibly

1102
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,840
can’t stay long in our department.

1103
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,320
How long do you think

1104
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,120
you can stay in our department?
