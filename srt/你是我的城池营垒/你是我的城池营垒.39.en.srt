Hello.

27
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,000
How is it?

28
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,400
Are you busy on the last day?

29
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,160
Very busy.

30
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,080
Your ticket.

31
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,000
You’ll take the bus

32
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,320
to Changgang tomorrow.

33
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,360
Let me pick you up.

34
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,960
You don’t need to pick me up.

35
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,080
Why not?

36
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,520
-Where are you going?
-What’s your secret

00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,920
-Changgang, 1:40 PM.
-that I can’t know?

38
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,760
I... I have a lot of secrets.

39
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,040
I won’t talk to you.

40
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,000
I’m busy now.

41
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,000
Bye-bye.

42
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,600
1:40 PM to Changgang.

43
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,600
It’s 82 kilometers from Chaozhou.

44
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,720
Number Zero.

45
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,920
Number Two

46
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,880

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,320
1:40 PM to Changgang.

51
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,760
The bus is full of people.

52
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,320
Hold it back well.

53
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,240
Don’t let the boss slip away.

54
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,200
Roger that.

55
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,120
Sir!

56
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,160
Are you crazy?

57
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,320
Sorry.

58
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,760
I have to go to Changgang today!

59
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,600
We have left.

60
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,840
Take the next bus.

61
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,120
Please, please.

62
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,000
I have to go to Changgang today!

63
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,280
Thank you.

64
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,520
That was dangerous.

65
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,080
Do you know it?

66
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,920
I know.

67
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,040
Sorry.

68
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,480
Leave your luggage here.

69
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,640
Sorry.

70
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,520
Can you put the luggage

71
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,720
on the luggage rack?

72
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,200
No.

73
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,360
There are fragile valuables in it.

74
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,080
Sorry.

75
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,920
Some people are selfish.

76
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,640
Maybe there are truly valuables

77
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,640
in his bag.

78
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,520
Follow up.

79
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,200
Sorry.

80
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,960
You are not a local, right?

81
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,600
No.

82
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,320
Are you here to travel?

83
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,440
No.

84
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,440
I’m here to work.

85
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,760
Work?

86
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,240
What kind of work can you do here?

87
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,440
I’m a doctor. It’s a business trip.

88
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,400
An angel in white.

89
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,920
No wonder you look so beautiful.

90
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,200
Not at all.

91
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,520
A doctor.

92
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,440
I will prescribe regimen

93
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,760
for the good of my patients

94
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,840
according to my ability

95
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,240
and my judgment

96
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,080
and never do harm

97
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,040
to anyone.

98
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,600
To please no one will I

99
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,600
prescribe a deadly drug.

100
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,760
Are you also a doctor?

101
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,400
No.

102
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,120
Then how can you recite

103
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,760
the Hippocratic Oath?

104
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,880
I wanted to be a doctor
when I was a child.

105
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,280
Why did you give up?

106
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,600
Because I realized

107
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,840
I can’t be that noble.

108
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,520
The bus is arriving at Jiangshui Town.

109
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,360
Please get ready for your arrival.

110
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,960
There is a thief.

111
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,000
A thief? Where?

112
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,790
The man in the green coat

113
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,480
took his bag.

114
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,960
Maybe that’s his bag.

115
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:42,790
That’s impossible.

116
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:43,880
I wanted to take that seat

117
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,120
when I got in the bus.

118
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,120
That person said

119
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,160
there are valuables in his bag.

120
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,600
Obviously it’s his bag.

121
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,200
Maybe

122
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,680
these two people know each other.

123
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,680
Does it seem like

124
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,640
that they know each other?

125
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,280
Don’t worry about it.

126
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,040
No.

127
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,960
Miss.

128
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,320
What?

129
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,600
Why did you take his bag?

130
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,400
That’s nonsense.

131
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,360
It’s my bag.

132
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,320
Sir.

133
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,120
Isn’t this bag yours?

134
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,440
No.

135
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,840
I asked you

136
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,360
when I got in the bus

137
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,520
and you said the bag is yours

138
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,680
and there are valuables inside.

139
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,960
Who is she?

140
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,880
Young girl.

141
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,280
You must be mistaken.

142
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,680
This bag is really not mine.

143
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,560
Number Two. Number Two.

144
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,560
Get this girl away right now.

145
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,600
Are you scared

146
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,480
of being retaliated by him?

147
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,680
We are there for you.

148
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,400
We can help you.

149
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,160
Miss.

150
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,280
He said

151
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,160
that it’s not his bag.

152
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,000
Stop making a scene.

153
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,000
Let him get off the bus.

154
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,680
We are all in a hurry.

155
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,240
-Yeah.

156
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,080
Come on.

157
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,960
Excuse me.

158
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,000
Mom, a gun!

159
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,480
Don’t move!

160
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,440
Don’t move! Don’t move!

161
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,560
Ready for action.

162
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,680
Get down!

163
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,200
Stay still!

164
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,720
Keep driving!

165
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,800
Don’t move.

166
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,120
Keep driving.

167
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,060
(Call 110)

168
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,760
You want to be a hero?

169
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,960
Bro.

170
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,720
I’ll make it happen for you now.

171
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,720
Action!

172
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,760
Number Two.

173
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:45,360
Don’t move!

174
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,800
Step aside!

175
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,520
Don’t move! Don’t move!

176
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,760
Don’t move! We are the police!

177
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,880
Close the door and close the curtain.

178
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,560
Collect all the phones!

179
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,560
Take out your phone!

180
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,440
Hurry up!

181
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,280
Quickly!

182
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,880
Take out your phone! Take it out!

183
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,000
Surround them.

184
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,640
Go!

185
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,560
Bro.

186
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,520
Please

187
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,360
let my kid go.

188
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,160
My kid is sick.

189
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:21,840
We finally made

190
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,400
an appointment with a specialist...

191
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,920
Shut up!

192
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,360
Please, bro.

193
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,160
Boss, there are cops out there.

194
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,360
How should we get out of here?

195
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,560
Rest assured.

196
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,520
There are so many people on the bus.

197
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,040
You can even leave by plane.

198
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,400
Don’t look at me in this way.

199
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,080
I told you

200
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,560
I’m not a noble person.

201
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,120
And I want to warn you

202
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,120
to mind your own business.

203
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,320
How many people are on the bus?

204
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,360
Almost every seat has been taken
before the bus left.

205
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,680
There are 50 people on the bus.

206
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,480
What about the criminals?

207
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,640
There are two or three criminals.

208
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,680
One is injured.

209
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,360
There is another one.

210
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,160
What about our guy?

211
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,360
It’s too chaotic. I don’t know.

212
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,360
Notify the bureau immediately

213
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,720
that a group of drug dealers with guns

214
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,840
hijacked a bus

215
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,120
with at least 50 passengers

216
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,080
and a criminal policeman on it.

217
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,400
Ask them to send a SWAT team

218
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:13,880
and medical staff immediately

219
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,120
to support us.

220
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,160
Hurry up!

221
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,460
(Emergency)

222
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,920
Hello, who is that?

223
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,200
I’m Captain Cao.

224
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,760
Captain Cao.

225
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:42,840
Kelei.

226
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,640
We have

227
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,680
an emergency here.

228
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,200
I need you to support us now.

229
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,160
Roger that.

230
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,960
Lower your head! Hold your head!

231
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,640
Jun.

232
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:53,960
Are you all right?

233
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,200
Jun.

234
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,880
Don’t worry, I’m here.

235
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,360
It’s alright.

236
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,720
Doctor!

237
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,720
Please come over.

238
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,480
Please take a look at him.

239
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,240
He must go to the hospital now

240
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,240
to get the bullet out of him.

241
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,560
How are you doing?

242
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,240
Who allowed you to save him first?

243
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,560
Is it because he is a good guy

244
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,280
and my young brother is a bad guy?

245
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,120
I am a doctor.

246
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,160
I don’t save people

247
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,080
in order of being good and evil.

248
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,400
His injury is easy to deal with.

249
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,240
It will only take me two minutes.

250
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,400
It’s useless even you can save him.

251
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,400
He will die anyway.

252
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,880
That’s your business.

253
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,560
But I have to

254
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,720
treat him now.

255
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,120
You are quite bold.

256
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,280
But I don’t know if you can
live a long life.

257
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,640
Jun.

258
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,520
Don’t worry.

259
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,040
I’m here.

260
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,040
If you die,

261
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,360
I’ll kill everyone on the bus for you.

262
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,880
All right.

263
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,160
All your vitals are fine.

264
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,760
Bear with it.

265
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,840
Doctor! How are you going to save him?

266
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,800
No pneumothorax.

267
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,320
The bullet didn’t penetrate him.

268
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,480
It should be blocked by the ribs.

269
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,440
He must go to the hospital right now

270
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,640
to get the bullet out.

271
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,640
Take it out here.

272
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,080
Right here?

273
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,160
I don’t know

274
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,760
the exact position of the bullet

275
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,160
without a CT result.

276
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,440
It would be more dangerous

277
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,240
if his chest gets hurt.

278
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,400
Sorry about that.

279
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,200
I need to keep my words.

280
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,440
I’m a doctor.

281
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,480
It’s my duty to save people.

282
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,560
I won’t do

283
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,000
the surgery here

284
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,320
is not because he is a bad guy.

285
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,600
The sanitary conditions here
are too poor.

286
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,440
I don’t have any surgical equipment.

287
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,960
How can I do the surgery for him?

288
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,360
You just told me

289
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,600
your childhood dream

290
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,480
is to be a doctor.

291
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,520
Don’t you understand

292
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,320
such a simple fact?

293
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,360
Okay.

294
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,360
You need equipment.

295
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,680
I have it.

296
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,480
When will the support arrive?

297
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,920
They are already on the way.

298
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,360
Li?

299
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,200
Hello.

300
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,800
Is that Captain Chen?

301
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,240
Yes.

302
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,200
My name is Mi Ka. I’m a doctor.

303
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,960
There is a person in the car

304
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,640
who needs surgery right now.

305
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,840
Who is it?

306
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,880
It’s their guy.

307
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,200
Are the passengers all right?

308
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,400
They are fine right now.

309
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,400
What about our guy?

310
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,480
How is he?

311
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:07,960
He injured his left shoulder.

312
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,590
I stopped the bleeding

313
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,590
and dressed his wound.

314
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:12,070
He is fine for now.

315
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,110
Cut to the point.

316
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,200
I need to do surgery on the bus now.

317
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,480
We need medical staff

318
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:22,760
and surgical equipment.

319
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,920
I will send a list

320
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,110
to your phone number.

321
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,830
Ask the hospital to
prepare it immediately.

322
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:28,760
Okay.

323
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,160
Give it to me.

324
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,040
You can save your guy.

325
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,400
Whatever you want,

326
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,360
we can talk about it.

327
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,480
But you must guarantee

328
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,640
the safety of passengers on the bus.

329
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,800
If my guy dies,

330
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,720
everyone on the bus will die with him.

331
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,880
The lives of all passengers

332
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,080
are in your hands now.

333
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,240
Dr. Mi.

334
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,800
By the way, my brother is with
blood type B.

335
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,080
Tell them not to make a mistake.

336
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,880
It’s a life-and-death matter.

337
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:17,800
Hello.

338
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,920
We just got the news

339
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,280
that a policeman and a drug dealer

340
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,720
got injured on the bus.

341
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,320
There happened to be a doctor on the bus

342
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,760
who stopped the bleeding for our guy.

343
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,480
Now the drug dealer needs surgery

344
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,440
to take out the bullet.

345
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,360
I’ll be there about ten minutes later.

346
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,680
Okay.

347
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,520
Hello.

348
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,680
(The phone you are calling is
powered off.)

349
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,640
(The phone you are calling is
powered off.)

350
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,120
Move your hand away.

351
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,200
Move it away, Jun.

352
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,920
Bear with it, Jun.

353
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,240
After the operation is finished,

354
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,280
we can leave then.

355
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,680
You can’t escape.

356
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,640
It’s not my first time

357
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,920
to end up in this situation.

358
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,400
There is always a last time.

359
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,120
If today

360
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,560
is my last day,

361
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,800
then today

362
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,440
will also be your last day.

363
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,800
So guys, please

364
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,320
pray for us.

365
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,640
Thank you.

366
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,280
I’m Xing Kelei from
Jiangning Special Police.

367
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,840
I’m Chen Hui.

368
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,000
Captain Cao told me about the situation.

369
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,160
Have the doctors arrived?

370
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,120
Soon.

371
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,280
Who is Captain Chen?

372
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,160
It’s me.

373
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,520
Is everything prepared

374
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,110
according to

375
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:58,880
Dr. Mi’s list?

376
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,480
Yes.

377
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,560
Everyone, hurry up to help

378
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,560
unpack the ambulance.

379
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,760
Dr. Mi? What’s the full name?

380
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,560
It’s... Mi Ka.

381
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,240
Yeah, Mi Ka.

382
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,480
Captain Cao.

383
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,040
The situation in the bus

384
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:31,880
is completely obscured.

385
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,720
I can’t carry out a shooting.

386
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,280
My suggestion is to stall them
until the night comes

387
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,360
and get close to them

388
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,560
in the darkness.

389
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,080
Has the negotiator arrived?

390
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,400
Ask the negotiator to talk to them.

391
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,160
Not yet.

392
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,600
I want to pretend to be a doctor

393
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,880
and get on the bus
to check the situation.

394
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,320
No, it’s too dangerous.

395
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,400
You know nothing about
the medical stuff.

396
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,800
It’s easy to be found out.

397
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,320
Captain Cao.

398
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,960
The doctor inside is my girlfriend.

399
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,400
We will cooperate well.

400
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,160
Besides, I know

401
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:56,800
the basic medical knowledge.

402
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,880
Don’t worry.

403
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,720
The drug dealer is calling.

404
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,680
Stop hesitating.
We don’t have much time left.

405
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,160
Okay.

406
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,440
Act as your plan.

407
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,400
Be careful.

408
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,440
Okay.

409
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,400
Captain Chen, is the doctor here?

410
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,320
Just a minute.

411
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,200
But I hope you can

412
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,040
release some of the hostages first.

413
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,360
Sit down. Sit down!

414
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,480
Sit down. Don’t move!

415
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,240
Don’t move!

416
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,360
Sit down!

417
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,080
I’ll get ready.

418
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,120
Okay.

419
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,160
You must release

420
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:36,680
some hostages first.

421
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,720
Why?

422
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,160
Your brother is going to have surgery.

423
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,720
There are so many people here.

424
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,000
The doctor will come up later

425
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,800
with all the equipment.

426
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,840
With so many people here,

427
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,880
the surgery cannot be performed.

428
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,320
And also,

429
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,920
your brother doesn’t take the CT.

430
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,280
If his pleura gets hurt,

431
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,440
or his blood vessel gets punctured,

432
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,800
leading to hemopneumothorax,

433
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,440
I promise

434
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,520
he won’t be able to live
for more than twenty minutes.

435
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,600
What’s more,

436
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,280
is there a difference between

437
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,200
twenty hostages

438
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,240
and fifty hostages?

439
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,960
What?

440
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,440
Okay.

441
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,960
I see.

442
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,280
What did he say?

443
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,200
The suspect said

444
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,280
only one doctor can get on the bus.

445
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,440
After you get on the bus,

446
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,560
they will release

447
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,320
some hostages first.

448
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,120
They also said

449
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,120
that Dr. Mi suggested

450
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,400
them releasing some hostages.

451
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,760
Only when his brother stays alive

452
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,360
can other people have
the chance to live.

453
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,480
Your girlfriend

454
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,480
is impressive.

455
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,520
Should you take
the communication equipment?

456
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,880
No.

457
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,520
They will certainly search my body.

458
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,560
I was going to

459
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,480
let you and the doctors go

460
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,640
after the operation is finished.

461
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,200
Now it seems like

462
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,000
all of you are going to stay.

463
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,200
I didn’t mean to leave.

464
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,920
Apply it yourself.

465
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,000
What’s wrong?

466
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,040
He has been having a high fever

467
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,360
for three days.

468
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,160
It’s over 39 degrees.

469
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,560
I want to take him to the hospital today

470
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,360
to see a doctor.

471
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,640
Except for the fever,

472
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,160
are there any other symptoms?

473
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,000
No.

474
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:34,920
He has been given

475
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,600
IV fluids for about three days

476
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,600
in the health center near our home.

477
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,120
But the fever won’t subside.

478
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,280
Take a look.

479
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,080
He has a rash.

480
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,040
It should be the parascarlatina.

481
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,720
After his fever subsides,

482
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,760
the rash will vanish

483
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,520
and he should be fine then.

484
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,360
Don’t worry.

485
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,520
Okay, thanks.

486
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,880
Do you have water?
Let him drink more water.

487
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,880
No.

488
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,000
Who has some water?

489
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,120
Thank you.

490
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,000
Come on.

491
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,880
Baby, have some water.

492
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,640
He is coming.

493
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,040
Peel. Big Teeth.

494
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,120
Go to pick him up.

495
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,440
Yes.

496
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,760
Take off your mask.

497
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,200
What’s wrong?

498
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,720
I... I didn’t have lunch.

499
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,760
I might have a... a low blood sugar.

500
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,320
Laoliu.

501
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,040
Get something to eat for Dr. Mi.

502
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,040
How can a doctor perform an operation

503
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,040
with an empty stomach?

504
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,240
Doctor.

505
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,360
Excuse me.

506
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,360
We got what we want. You can go back.

507
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,720
It’s not an easy operation.

508
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,920
She can’t do it alone.

509
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,080
You are quite bold.

510
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,160
Are you a policeman?

511
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,760
I am not a policeman.

512
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,400
I’m a doctor.

513
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,720
I volunteered to come here.

514
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,800
Another noble person.

515
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,160
Dr. Mi, you two can make a great couple.

516
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,800
Why don’t you two get acquainted first?

517
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,240
It’s a rare opportunity.

518
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,080
Come on.

519
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,480
Zhang Jianlin from Yimin Hospital.

520
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,760
Mi Ka from Renxin Hospital.

521
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,240
Why haven’t they
released the passengers?

522
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,560
Did they change their minds?

523
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,720
How is the situation?

524
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,120
Open the box.

525
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,000
Turn it.

526
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,000
What’s this?

527
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,080
Tissue scissors.

528
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,440
What’s this?

529
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,000
Tissue forceps.

530
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,640
Hold on.

531
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,800
Open this.

532
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,120
This one.

533
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,440
Spreader.

534
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,560
This one?

535
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,960
Hemostatic forceps.

536
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,480
This is the needle holder.

537
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,360
You are not a doctor.
You are a policeman.

538
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,000
Have you remembered all these tools?

539
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,200
Yes.

540
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,480
The head of the needle holder
is shorter than this.

541
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,400
This is the hemostatic forceps.

542
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,000
If you keep

543
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,200
asking him like that,

544
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,880
your brother will die.

545
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,280
Fine.

546
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,240
Can you release the hostages now?

547
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,880
I’m a man of my words.

548
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,400
Sit down.

549
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,800
But I didn’t say all of them.

550
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,000
Listen to me.

551
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,720
Women and children get off first.

552
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,720
I didn’t say that either.

553
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,040
What do you mean?

554
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,600
Nothing.

555
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,920
Women and kids,

556
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:04,920
and this

557
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,240
wounded cop will stay.

558
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,160
The rest can leave.

559
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,520
Our child is sick.

560
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,400
Are you still a human being?

561
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,440
Dr. Mi.

562
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,280
Do you know how to do the math?

563
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,840
Eleven more people will be released

564
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,080
in my way.

565
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,400
It’s my loss.

566
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,640
You want to keep

567
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,160
women and kids.

568
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,320
You must release this kid.

569
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,640
He keeps crying.

570
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,480
He will affect me doing surgery.

571
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,960
Yeah.

572
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,560
I’ll shoot him now.

573
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,000
Then he won’t affect you.

574
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,120
He is just a kid.

575
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,200
Do you still have a conscience?

576
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,880
Conscience?

577
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,080
Do you know what this is?

578
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,560
Drug.

579
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,240
You are talking about conscience

580
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,320
with a drug seller.

581
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,480
Peel. Big teeth!

582
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,480
Release them!

583
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,680
Let them do surgery for Jun.

584
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,040
If you don’t

585
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,760
release this kid,

586
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,160
I’m not responsible for any problems

587
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,480
during the operation.

588
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,240
You are threatening me.

589
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,120
Let him go.

590
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,160
Let this little boy go.

591
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,320
Keep his mother.

592
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,560
Keep that little girl.

593
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,000
Be quick!

594
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,280
Get up! Get up!

595
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,960
Hurry up! Hurry up!

596
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,560
Go! Come on!

597
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,480
I’m not leaving!

598
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,160
I’ll stay with my daughter!

599
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,640
I’m asking you to leave!

600
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,880
I won’t leave even you kill me!

601
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,880
Okay, I’ll kill you now!

602
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:50,840
There are people getting off the bus.

603
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,400
We saw them.

604
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,800
Pay attention to their identities.

605
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,720
Help!

606
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,760
They are all men coming out.

607
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,880
There is only one child.

608
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:22,320
Help!

609
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,560
The suspect is not simple.

610
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,240
I hope Xing Kelei can handle him.

611
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,200
The SWAT team has arrived.

612
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,760
What to do then?

613
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,480
It’s okay.

614
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,920
There are still many people on the bus.

615
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,000
They can’t see us.

616
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,440
They dare not make a move.

617
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,880
Captain Chen.

618
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,120
Our surgery

619
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,280
is about to start.

620
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,040
I need a big SUV.

621
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,920
Any brand is okay.

622
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,670
Please

623
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,000
send it here within half an hour.

624
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:12,520
Thank you.

625
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,080
I’ll give you the car.

626
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,670
You need to release ten more hostages.

627
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,560
I’m not negotiating

628
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,040
with you.

629
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,960
After the surgery begins,

630
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,000
just lay out the tools

631
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,920
and hold the hemostatic forceps for me.

632
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,230
Captain.

633
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,080
Captain. Captain.

634
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,230
I’ve asked them.

635
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,190
There are

636
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:35,800
five suspects on the bus.

637
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,880
They are all males.

638
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,800
They have guns.

639
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,080
One of them was injured.

640
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,360
The one calling us

641
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,360
is his older brother.

642
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,600
I have asked the painter
to make a portrait.

643
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,670
Okay, I see.

644
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,760
Okay.

645
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,080
That’s a lot of people.

646
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,440
It’s not easy to take them down

647
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,440
all at once.

648
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,560
Officer Xing suggested

649
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,760
we act in darkness.

650
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,800
The sun goes down

651
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
at 6:13 PM here.

652
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,520
It’s about two hours later.

653
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,280
I’ll go to deploy my men.

654
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,120
Okay.

655
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,280
How far is it from

656
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,120
the nearest border?

657
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,600
About twenty kilometers.

658
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,680
They asked for an SUV.

659
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,520
They will certainly head for the border.

660
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,040
There are many paths in this area.

661
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,040
Normally they have

662
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:07,920
hidden strongholds here.

663
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,280
It’s better to take them down here.

664
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,640
It would be troublesome

665
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,520
if they get to the border.

666
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,320
Install a locator on the car.

667
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,040
It has been done.

668
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,160
I’m going to make a move

669
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:16,840
when they change the car.

670
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:17,720
I’ll go to get ready and simulate it.

671
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,520
Okay.

672
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,040
The operation should have started.

673
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,480
How to perform the operation

674
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,800
with the curtains closed like that?

675
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,120
Hello.

676
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,600
Okay, got it.

677
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,720
The suspect asked for
a generator and lights.

678
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,640
The blood pressure.

679
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,000
130, 70.

680
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,680
Pay attention to the changes.

681
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,680
I see the bullet.

682
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,120
Give me the tweezers.

683
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,680
Be ready to close it up.

684
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,720
Scissors.

685
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,960
Not this one.

686
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,080
Gauze.

687
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,880
Scissors.

688
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,760
The operation is finished.

689
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,440
All right.

690
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,600
Dr. Mi.

691
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,240
Unlock it.

692
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,680
-Unlock it.
-Don’t you hear it?

693
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,320
Our boss asked you to unlock it.

694
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:34,920
Hello.

695
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,200
Captain Chen, the operation went well.

696
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,760
Have you prepared the SUV

697
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,640
I want?

698
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,560
You can take a look by yourself.

699
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,920
When do you want it?

700
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,280
I’ll call you.

701
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:52,800
By the way,

702
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,360
I forgot to tell you

703
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,320
that we found

704
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,880
a fake doctor here.

705
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,600
You two keep an eye on the outside.

706
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,280
Don’t let them play any trick.

707
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,400
What happened?

708
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,400
Excuse me.

709
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,640
The clip is off.

710
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,720
I asked you to
keep an eye on the outside.

711
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:26,840
Go back!

712
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,000
Okay.

713
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,520
Hello.

714
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:39,840
The car you want

715
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,400
is in front of you.

716
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,440
Okay.

717
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:42,840
Captain Chen.

718
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,280
Please ask your driver to leave.

719
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,520
Keep the car running.

720
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,080
Leave the key on it.

721
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,400
I will send my guy to check it.

722
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,160
Don’t play any trick.

723
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,560
Big Teeth, you go.

724
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,200
Yes, boss.

725
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,400
Boss, the car is fine.

726
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,680
Okay.

727
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,520
Get ready to leave.

728
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,480
Laoliu, carry Jun.

729
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:09,960
Okay.

730
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:10,680
Peel.

731
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,240
Grab the injured policeman

732
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,080
and make the hostages

733
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,720
walk around us.

734
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,240
You guys get off the bus

735
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,640
back to back.

736
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,920
Then the snipers

737
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,840
won’t dare to shoot.

738
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,680
Grab one hostage,

739
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,720
so they won’t dare to
make a surprise attack.

740
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,960
Boss, what about you?

741
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,760
I’ll guard these two lovebirds.

742
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,400
I’ll get her.

743
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:46,960
You,

744
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,200
