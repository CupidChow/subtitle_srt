Xing... Xing Sir.

58
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,320
Dr. Mi.

59
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,280
Yesterday I’ve said everything

60
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,840
I need to say.

61
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,040
You are in no position
to get training now.

62
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,200
You can leave now.

63
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:43,210
Sir.

64
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,880
Do you have to pick on me?

65
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,280
Why are you so ruthless?

66
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,760
If I pick on you,

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,520
you would have left first time

68
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,880
you violated the discipline.

69
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,400
Dr. Mi.

70
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,520
I respect your choice.

71
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,040
But you should also respect

72
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,360
our discipline.

73
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,320
How about this?

74
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,360
I have a solution for you.

75
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,480
Go ahead.

76
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,720
Go to solve

77
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,720
your own business first

78
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,680
and come back next year.

79
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:28,850
Do you have to stay here

80
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,040
and wait for Xing Kelei?

81
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,000
I have to admit my mistake.

82
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,680
I need to beg him

83
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,520
for one more chance

84
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,320
that I can stay and continue training.

85
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,840
You’re really stubborn.

86
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,520
But I realized

87
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,880
that the brains
of these special policemen

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,880
seem to be different from
ordinary people.

89
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,760
Do you know Shu Wenbo?

90
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,800
What’s wrong with Shu Sir?

91
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,280
When he was introducing

92
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,800
the professional equipment
to me that day,

93
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,400
guess what happened?

94
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,880
He used that gloves for arresting
to electrocute me!

95
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,400
The electricity numbed me.

96
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,120
And I was like...

97
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,360
Look,

98
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,920
if Xing Kelei

99
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,920
can let me stay and continue training,

100
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,960
I’m willing to let him electrocute me
a hundred times.

101
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,120
You are great.

102
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,600
-Uncle Li.
-You can’t.

103
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,560
Just let me put them here.

104
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,600
Help me, please.

105
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,720
It’s not that I don’t want to help you,

106
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,760
we have rules here.

107
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,640
What’s the big deal if I put them here?

108
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,830
I’m begging you.

109
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,510
It won’t be a big deal!

110
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,000
I’ll just put them here for a while.

111
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:21,880
What’s happening?

112
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,280
Nothing.

113
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,960
I have something

114
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,400
for Captain Xing.

115
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,600
But he is not here.

116
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,120
I want to put things here

117
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,360
and I’ll go back.

118
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,960
He just doesn’t let me.

119
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,840
Why can’t he put it here?

120
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,720
Why?

121
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,480
Miss.

122
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,840
It’s not that I don’t bend the rules.

123
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,520
You don’t know the situation.

124
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,960
Uncle Lee

125
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,760
lives alone in the Stream Village
on the mountain.

126
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,600
There was a rainstorm

127
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,720
and mudslides a few days ago.

128
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,360
Captain Xing

129
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,640
led people up to the mountain
to do rescue operations

130
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,520
and saved him.

131
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,000
He feels grateful.

132
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:49,720
So he brings stuff here

133
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,080
once for a while.

134
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,520
How can Captain Xing accept it?

135
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,040
Once, when Captain Xing
was not here,

136
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,120
he left some stuff here.

137
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,080
I allowed him

138
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,120
out of good intentions.

139
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,640
After Captain Xing saw it,

140
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,600
guess what,

141
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,500
no kidding,

142
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,320
he lashed me

143
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,120
really hard.

144
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,400
Think about it.

145
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,520
How can I let him do that again?

146
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,000
It’s nothing valuable.

147
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,040
There are just

148
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,080
some chestnuts I picked myself.

149
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,000
Uncle.

150
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,120
Are your legs not working well?

151
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,600
It’s okay.

152
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,120
I sprained my ankle.

153
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,040
I think

154
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,080
if you sprained your ankle,

155
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,000
you’d better not take the mountain road.

156
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,800
How about I send you back?

157
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,600
Well,

158
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,480
you can give your stuff

159
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,560
to us.

160
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,720
We will keep it for you.

161
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,360
And if we

162
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,080
meet Captain Xing,

163
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,600
we will talk about it later, okay?

164
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,130
All right.

165
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,720
I’ll send you back to
the Stream Village first.

166
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,600
Okay?

167
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,440
Is the Stream Village
far away from here?

168
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,500
No.

169
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,280
There is

170
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:41,920
a minibus

171
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,120
directly to their village.

172
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,000
Right over there.

173
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,740
Okay.

174
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,640
It’s going to rain soon.

175
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,840
Can you do it?

176
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,080
Rain?

177
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,280
Can you lend me an umbrella?

178
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,000
There is no umbrella.

179
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,080
Can you make do with a raincoat?

180
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,120
Yeah, thanks.

181
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,720
Don’t bother.

182
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,590
-I’ll go back by myself.
-It’s okay.

183
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,240
It’s okay. It’s okay.

184
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,000
Let me take you back.

185
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,960
Here, take it.

186
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,040
All right.

187
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,040
Let’s go.

188
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,680
Well, thank you.

189
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,280
Be careful.

190
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,000
Miss, thank you.

191
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,560
Be careful.

192
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,080
Take care.

193
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,120
Sun, I’m going back.

194
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,760
Take care.

195
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,760
I’m a doctor.

196
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,960
You have to send him
to the hospital now!

197
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,040
Otherwise he will die!

198
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,240
I’m not lying!

199
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,880
He will be dead a few minutes later!

200
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,800
Stop talking!

201
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,680
I have joined the emergency rescue team

202
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,800
since I was in college.

203
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,240
I hope I can

204
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,440
save the people within my reach

205
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,920
who need me.

206
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,560
I really hope

207
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,400
I can use what I learned

208
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,680
to help others.

209
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,080
You’re not cut out for it.

210
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:54,880
I didn’t come here

211
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,120
for the certificate!

212
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,920
Why can’t I get through?

213
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,240
Reporter Xia.

214
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,360
What are you doing

215
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,520
in the heavy rain?

216
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,520
I’m

217
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,120
waiting for someone.

218
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,040
Waiting for Mi Ka?

219
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,720
Where’s she?

220
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,460
(Mi Ka Dialing)
Sorry.

221
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,600
The subscriber you dialed

222
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,280
cannot be connected for the moment.

223
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,640
Please dial again later.

224
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,280
Sorry.

225
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,720
The subscriber you dialed

226
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,520
cannot be connected for the moment.

227
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,160
Is anyone here?

228
00:08:21,880 --> 00:09:00,640
Mi Ka!

229
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,360
Mi Ka! Mi Ka!

230
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,080
I’m here!

231
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,960
Is it Xing Sir?

232
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:21,880
Mi Ka!

233
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,720
Sir, I’m here!

234
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:29,800
What happened?

235
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,240
I tripped and fell.

236
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,880
Can you stand up?

237
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,360
I need your help.

238
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,720
Slow down.

239
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,040
Sit down.

240
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,120
Be careful.

241
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,840
Come on, lean against it.

242
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,720
Get on my back.

243
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,000
What are you waiting for?

244
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,400
You need to train tomorrow.

245
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,600
Come on.

246
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,320
You got hurt that badly?

247
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,920
I... I...

248
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,920
I don’t know how to treat it.

249
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:37,920
Let me get someone for you.

250
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,200
No need. No need.

251
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,520
I can do it myself.

252
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,760
Can you get that

253
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,400
for me?

254
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,480
You are tough indeed.

255
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,720
What else can I do?

256
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,440
Inflammation is more troublesome.

257
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,160
Do you need

258
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,960
some anti-inflammatory drug

259
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,160
or antibiotics?

260
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,760
Not necessary.

261
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,560
I’m not that vulnerable.

262
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,840
Uncle Li came again
to send you something.

263
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,280
I noticed that he was limping.

264
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,120
I worried about his health.

265
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,080
So I sent him back.

266
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,880
I’ve checked,

267
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,360
he is all right.

268
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,920
There is no bone injury.

269
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,920
Uncle Li told me.

270
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,920
I know you mean well.

271
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,880
But you have to get it straight first.

272
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,720
There is no bus on the mountain
after five o’clock.

273
00:12:59,160 --> 00:12:59,880
If I didn’t go to find you,

274
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,680
what should you do then?

275
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,480
I know

276
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,160
I got caught by you again.

277
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,880
Are you thinking

278
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,480
how to punish me now?

279
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,880
Don’t bother.

280
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,040
You are going to fire me anyway.

281
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,480
I don’t think you are afraid of
being punished by me.

282
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,080
I am afraid.

283
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,560
What are you afraid of?

284
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,960
What happened last time is not over yet.

285
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,200
plus what happened this time,

286
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,640
I’m so dead.

287
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,680
How is your

288
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,200
friend doing?

289
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,600
Which friend?

290
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,000
Xiaoman?

291
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,480
There is some hope now.

292
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,560
How do you know it?

293
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,480
Another friend of yours, Xia,

294
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,760
reported to my leader

295
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,280
about your situation.

296
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,920
You got hurt badly.

297
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,080
You don’t need to

298
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,080
train tomorrow.

299
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,400
I don’t need to train...

300
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,280
What do you mean?

301
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,760
You are not going to drive me away?

302
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,960
I only said that you can train.

303
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,920
I didn’t say I would
let you have the certificate.

304
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,520
Why are you avoiding me?

305
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,680
It’s just a sneeze.

306
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,200
Don’t you know

307
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,480
women should be treated with tenderness?

308
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,240
My strong fighting power

309
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,000
is not for being tender.

310
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,480
Hurry up and leave.

311
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,360
Don’t spread your cold.

312
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,960
It’s just a cold.

313
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,320
Not a viral influenza.

314
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,800
You won’t have it.

315
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,080
Go back and get some hot water.

316
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,160
Drink this.

317
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,320
It works for me anyway.

318
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,160
Thank you.

319
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,840
Thank you, Captain Hao.

320
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,160
The police force you lead

321
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:33,800
is really

322
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,520
warm and disciplined.

323
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,120
All right.

324
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,200
We will talk later.

325
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,240
Xia!

326
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,720
You...

327
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,080
Why are you here?

328
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,240
Didn’t I ask you to wait for me

329
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,160
at the shooting range?

330
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,800
We should meet at nine o’clock.

331
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,080
It’s half past nine now.

332
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,200
You haven’t set out yet.

333
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,200
Didn’t I send you a message on WeChat

334
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,120
that something came up
and I will be late?

335
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,440
The training time of SWAT

336
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,400
is fixed.

337
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,880
It can’t be changed at will.

338
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,160
Then we can meet tomorrow.

339
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,160
Tomorrow...

340
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,280
What do you want to say?

341
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,680
Nothing.

342
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,360
Just cut to the chase.

343
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,400
You ask me to say it.

344
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:13,880
I think

345
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,000
as a media worker,

346
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,760
you shouldn’t take the advantage of

347
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,560
your position

348
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,400
to play favors

349
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,960
and intervene in the work
of other departments.

350
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,480
It’s very unprofessional.

351
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,560
Ah...?

352
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,120
You ask Captain Hao to make Captain Xing

353
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,280
keep Mi Ka.

354
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,560
This is unreasonable.

355
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,960
You are only looking at the visible.

356
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,200
It’s even more unprofessional.

357
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,200
Besides, I should interview

358
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,560
Xing Kelei.

359
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,960
He was changed to you
without telling me.

360
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,040
This is even more unreasonable.

361
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,480
I don’t want to do it at all.

362
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,680
Since you don’t want to do it,

363
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,600
why are you following me?

364
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,080
It’s my task to receive you.

365
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,240
Didn’t you say that the shooting time

366
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,440
can’t be changed?

367
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,120
I’ll see you at work this afternoon.

368
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,160
You are nice today

369
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,200
to volunteer to box.

370
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,240
I know Captain Hao gave you a hard time

371
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,070
and you feel aggrieved.

372
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,110
Right?

373
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,000
What are you talking about?

374
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,960
You leaved Mi Ka return
to the team for training

375
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,880
because Xia talked to
Captain Hao, right?

376
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,320
No.

377
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,760
No?

378
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,800
What are you thinking about?

379
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,400
Concentrate!

380
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,920
Captain Shu, come on!

381
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,280
So...

382
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,480
Captain Hao explained

383
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,960
why Mi Ka left the base to you.

384
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,480
Then this is not playing favors.

385
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,200
Do you think Captain Hao is someone

386
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,320
who plays favors at will?

387
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,920
Seriously.

388
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,320
Oh no.

389
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,280
Not good!

390
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,560
Well...

391
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,080
One! Two!

392
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,360
Right turn!

393
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,200
One! Two!

394
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,800
Okay, just put it here.

395
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,520
Thank you.

396
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,800
-Captain Shu.

397
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,400
-Okay.
-Captain Shu.

398
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,520
The special policeman

399
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,760
can also be late.

400
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,440
I...

401
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,480
All right.

402
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,880
I don’t want to

403
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:37,800
waste your time.

404
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,120
Let’s get started now.

405
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,280
We don’t want to see each other anyway.

406
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,440
The shooting of rappelling down
from a high place.

407
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,520
Go ahead.

408
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,320
What’s wrong?

409
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,480
Can’t you do it, Captain Shu?

410
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,360
I can.

411
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,160
Action!

412
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,100
(Climbing Building)

413
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:31,920
How is it?

414
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,800
You didn’t look at the camera

415
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,280
when you landed.

416
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,320
Do I need to look at the camera?

417
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,720
Don’t you know it?

418
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,680
I didn’t.

419
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,880
I thought you knew everything.

420
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,280
I’ll do it again.

421
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,360
Action!

422
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,520
Why is your

423
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,480
ending so ugly?

424
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,760
I don’t know how to make expressions.

425
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:08,920
Look.

426
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,120
We are shooting a promotional video.

427
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,600
A promotional video is to promote

428
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,120
the charm of the special police.

429
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,880
The charm.

430
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,120
Your expression is too scary.

431
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,480
Well...

432
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,840
I’ll do it again.

433
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,680
All right.

434
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:41,480
Action!

435
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,920
Action.

436
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,560
Okay, this one is not bad.

437
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,520
You’ve worked hard.

438
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,440
That’s what I should do.

439
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,200
What’s wrong?

440
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,170
Nothing.

441
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,320
When I came down,

442
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,600
my muscles were not moved in a right way

443
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,680
and got pulled.

444
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,520
Captain Shu.

445
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,640
Did you pull the part

446
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,000
where you got injured before?

447
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,200
Why didn’t you tell me
that you are injured?

448
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,160
It’s okay.

449
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,240
It’s just that the old injury

450
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,520
is sort of affected.

451
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,760
I will cooperate
no matter what you want.

452
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,240
Xia.

453
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,640
I want to apologize to you

454
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,960
about what happened this morning.

455
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,880
Captain Xing told me

456
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,800
that you only explained to Captain Hao

457
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,040
why Mi Ka left the base.

458
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,360
I was too arbitrary.

459
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,680
I am sorry.

460
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,280
It’s okay.

461
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,160
Do I look like

462
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,520
a stingy person?

463
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,160
Well...

464
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,280
Then let’s have a

465
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,640
better sense of time from now on.

466
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,000
No one should be late again.

467
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,800
I think

468
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,720
you’re a little too much this time.

469
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,480
I didn’t know he was injured.

470
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,120
It’s all because of you.

471
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,480
All right.

472
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,560
It’s my fault.

473
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,280
I mean it is this dork

474
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,720
who wronged me first.

475
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,600
How do I end up

476
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,040
feeling guilty?

477
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,080
Didn’t he

478
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,800
apologize to you first?

479
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,280
What else should I do?

480
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,800
Get back at myself
to make him feel better?

481
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,680
All right, let’s not talk about this.

482
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,440
You’ve been here only for a few days.

483
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,960
What did you buy?

484
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,240
Nothing.

485
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,000
I don’t know what it is.

486
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,920
I got a call from the mail room

487
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,480
that I have a parcel.

488
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,360
Could it be that someone

489
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,760
sent me a bomb?

490
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:42,880
You have made

491
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,680
so many enemies.

492
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,280
Plus Shu Wenbo.

493
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,560
Good luck with that.

494
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,480
I...

495
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:52,840
Hello.

496
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:53,920
Is there

497
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,000
a parcel of Ruan Qingxia?

498
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,320
Wait a minute, I’ll check it.

499
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,280
Okay, thank you.

500
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,520
Is it this one?

501
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,200
I guess.

502
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,800
Can I borrow this?

503
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,320
Okay.

504
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,000
Thank you.

505
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,520
What’s this?

506
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,600
Oh my god.

507
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,560
My Desert Rose.

508
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,240
It’s broken like this before it’s used.

509
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:29,920
I’m sorry!

510
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,360
I will buy a new one for you.

511
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,880
Shu Wenbo broke

512
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,200
my Desert Rose.

513
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,600
And he bought me a fake one.

514
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,600
Let me see it.

515
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,480
The purple. The green.

516
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,760
Your face will look like
a rainbow if you wear them.

517
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,400
It’s Shu Wenbo’s taste indeed.

518
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,200
Pretty.

519
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:51,640
So pretty.

520
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,320
Pretty.

521
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,600
Emergency muster!

522
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,720
Emergency muster! Hurry up!

523
00:23:59,080 --> 00:23:59,920
Emergency muster!

524
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,720
Emergency muster! Hurry up!

525
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,800
Emergency muster!

526
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,960
Everyone,

527
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,200
dress right!

528
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,960
Front!

529
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,480
As ease.

530
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,680
Attention!

531
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,520
Well, guys.

532
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,120
Do you want to take ten laps first
to refresh yourselves?

533
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,360
Stand still if you don’t want to run.

534
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,560
The simulated assessment

535
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,240
of combined training starts now.

536
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,360
A climber

537
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,640
slipped into the valley
while climbing the mountain

538
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,760
and needs rescue now.

539
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,640
It’s the same as

540
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,360
the field training.

541
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,320
Five people form a group.

542
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,280
There will be a special policeman

543
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,520
protecting you

544
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,320
without providing

545
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,800
any technical guidance.

546
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,200
You need to search for

547
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,160
the injured person

548
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,680
according to the information you have.

549
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,720
I’ll name the group.

550
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,410
Group One.

551
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,960
Xu Yanshan. Chen Tao.

552
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,920
Nie Xiaohui. Liu Rong.

553
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,120
Mi Ha. You are on my team.

554
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,120
Out of rank.

555
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,760
Get your equipment.

556
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,240
Group Two.

557
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,800
Zhang Tong. Li Hong.

558
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,320
Zhang Qingqing. Chen Xiaoyan.

559
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,680
Lin Xuanyang.

560
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,680
Out of rank.

561
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,520
You are with Instructor Li Nian.

562
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,280
Check the equipment.

563
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,040
Okay.

564
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,240
There is no climbing rope.

565
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,760
I don’t have

566
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
a snap-on tourniquet

567
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,320
and a triangle bandage.

568
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,000
I don’t have a compass

569
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,360
and an intercom.

570
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:47,960
Sir,

571
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,720
there is a lack of equipment.

572
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,080
We made a request to fill in the items.

573
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,000
According to the positioning,

574
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,720
it should be here.

575
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,840
We are the first to arrive.

576
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,320
It’s over there!

577
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:24,920
Is it?

578
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,000
Yes.

579
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,800
Take out the equipment.

580
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,160
The climbing rope.

581
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:30,800
Okay.

582
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,000
I’ll get it.

583
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:43,880
Liu Rong.

584
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,640
Come down with me.

585
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,200
Okay.

586
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,840
Check the rope again.

587
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:47,760
Be careful.

588
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,080
Move. Be careful.

589
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,880
Slow down. Chen Tao.

590
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,600
Wear your protection well.

591
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,600
Be careful.

592
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,120
Thank you.

593
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,000
Can you pull the rope for me?

594
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,540
(Injury to ankle. Unable to walk)
How is it?

595
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,880
Injury to ankle!

596
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,520
No fracture. Unable to walk!

597
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,620
(Open wounds)

598
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,400
Open wounds on forehead and arm

599
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,360
which need to be bandaged
and disinfected!

600
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,440
It doesn’t sound serious.

601
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,120
Pull him up with the rope.

602
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:42,880
Mi Ka!

603
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:43,880
Throw down the rope!

604
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,920
We’ll pull him up!

605
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:45,760
Okay!

606
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,760
To all the groups.

607
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,200
This is Group Two.

608
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,000
We found someone

609
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,960
who has lost a lot of blood.

610
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:51,840
We need to carry him down
the mountain now.

611
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,320
But we don’t have enough climbing ropes.

612
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,440
We request support.

613
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:56,920
Didn’t they check it

614
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:57,960
before they set off?

615
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,400
Now they found
that they don’t have enough ropes.

616
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,400
Chen Tao!

617
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,600
Is he seriously injured?

618
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,560
No.

619
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,120
Their injured person
urgently needs treatment!

620
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:06,960
We should give them

621
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,000
the rope first!

622
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,960
No, this is a simulated test.

623
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,240
The injured person won’t really die.

624
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,400
If we give them the rope,

625
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,080
our task will be delayed.

626
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,160
Since it’s set

627
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,440
that their person is
the most seriously injured,

628
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,120
we should

629
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,120
help them carry the injured person

630
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,480
down the mountain first.

631
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:21,800
Chen Tao!

632
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,160
Do you guys agree?

633
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:23,980
Agree.

634
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,640
Agree!

635
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,080
You and Liu Rong stay here

636
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,360
and take care of our injured person!

637
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,000
We’ll go to

638
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,440
help them and come back later!

639
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,480
-Okay!

640
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,600
Group Two. Group Two.

641
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,840
This is Group Five.

642
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,240
We’ll go to support you.

643
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,880
Send us your location.

644
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:37,960
Let’s go.

645
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,880
Get him up.

646
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,600
Hurry up.

647
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,840
Group Two!

648
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,240
We are here to support you!

649
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,520
Okay. Thank you!

650
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:57,440
-Thank you.
-Throw it down!

651
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,040
Hurry up. Take it.

652
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,580
Slow down.

653
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,960
Slow down. Keep it steady.

654
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,240
Be careful.

655
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,680
Slow down.

656
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,360
Dress right!

657
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,880
Front!

658
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:52,920
At ease,

659
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,120
attention!

660
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,920
I’ll announce the result.

661
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,200
All the groups

662
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,880
completed the task successfully.

663
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,720
The fastest one is Group Two.

664
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,160
The second fastest

665
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,280
is Group One.

666
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,400
The third is Group Four.

667
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,440
The fourth is Group Third.

668
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,040
The slowest

669
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,480
is Group Five.

670
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,120
But in today’s assessment,

671
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,520
Group Five has

672
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,760
the highest score.

673
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,120
First of all, they carefully
checked the equipment

674
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,960
before they set off

675
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,040
and filled in the missing items

676
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,600
to ensure that the rescue
can be carried out smoothly.

677
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,480
Second,

678
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,840
after they received

679
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,840
another group’s request for support,

680
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,440
they assessed
the condition of the injured

681
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,840
to decide whom to rescue first.

682
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,080
They went to support
the other group first

683
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,760
to ensure that
the critically injured person

684
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,560
can receive effective treatment in time.

685
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,800
So the best group today is

686
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,640
Group Five.

687
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,600
But the assessment today

688
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,880
also exposed some students’ problems

689
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,480
in the use of ropes.

690
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,960
I hope she can practice more

691
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,160
on her own.

692
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,280
The assessment will be on tomorrow.

693
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,080
Okay. Dismiss.

694
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,760
The survival training
in the wilderness yesterday

695
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,360
is really exciting.

696
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,360
I didn’t feel that way yesterday.

697
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,200
But when I woke up this morning,

698
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,080
I felt like I was punched by someone.

699
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,840
Don’t complain.

700
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,240
We don’t have to do
morning exercises today.

701
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,200
We even have half a day

702
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,840
to review the theoretical knowledge.

703
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,560
We should feel happy about it.

704
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,720
Why do I

705
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,720
not feel happy at all?

706
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,160
Do you become depressed because of him?

707
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,480
I want to take Xing Kelei

708
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,840
to our hospital

709
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:40,760
to see the psychologist.

710
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,760
I suspect that he has

711
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,280
severe personality split.

712
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,000
He is good for a while,
and mean for a while.

713
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,800
I can’t figure out

714
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,040
what kind of person he is.

715
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,480
Do you still want to figure him out?

716
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:53,880
Do you have

717
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,360
Stockholm syndrome?

718
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,480
-It’s cold.
-Don’t talk nonsense.

719
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,360
What’s the test for tomorrow?

720
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,600
The basic use of rope

721
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,760
and rappelling.

722
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,160
I wasn’t there that day.

723
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,320
I didn’t have that class.

724
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,720
I need to make up
the missed lesson today.

725
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,440
Or I’m going to suffer again.

726
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,280
I think you should

727
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,600
find him

728
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,000
and beg him for mercy.

729
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:14,760
Beg him for mercy?

730
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,200
Do you think it would work?

731
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,200
Then what should you do?

732
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,600
I’m leaving.

733
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,200
Hurry up. There will be no place later.

734
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,160
Hurry up.

735
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,560
I will ask someone else for help.

736
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,200
Li Sir!

737
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,000
Rappelling is

738
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,000
a technique for fast landing

739
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,120
with the help of
professional rope equipment

740
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,360
and carry-on equipment,

741
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,800
including rappelling down
from helicopters,

742
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,360
mountains and high building.

743
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,760
In drills,

744
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,920
you might use professional equipment

745
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:02,920
like descending controller

746
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,240
and ATC.

747
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,520
Sure enough.

748
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,520
The training in the base

749
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,760
is just for letting you experience it.

750
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,040
The simulated scenario

751
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,480
is relatively simple.

752
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,520
You only need to

753
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,160
use some simple tools

754
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,120
like ropes and figure 8.

755
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,040
The test is mainly about

756
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,840
the students’ mastery of the technique.

757
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,120
Well said, sir.

758
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,240
It would be great

759
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,280
if you are our chief instructor.

760
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,120
Actually, Captain Xing

761
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,680
pretends to be cold on the appearance.

762
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,680
He is merciful enough

763
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,960
to you guys.

764
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,680
Really?

765
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,120
I guess he is a good person.

766
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,960
But you are competent,

767
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,640
humorous,

768
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,840
and handsome.

769
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:46,880
You know what,

770
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,280
in our dormitory,

771
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,080
you are regarded as
the prince charming.

772
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,780
(Female Dormitory)

773
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,800
Sir.

774
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,720
Where’s Mi Ka?

775
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,120
She went out.

776
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,800
She went out again?

777
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,080
She didn’t leave the base.

778
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,280
She went to practice

779
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,360
at the training ground.

780
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,000
Actually, rappelling

781
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,040
and the basic use of ropes

782
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:21,760
are really simple

783
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,800
and easy to learn.

784
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,440
Is it dangerous or not?

785
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,560
As long as you master

786
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,670
the key points of the motion,

787
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,800
there will be no danger.

788
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,670
What’s more,

789
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,630
there are protective measures

790
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,710
in this test site.

791
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,840
It’s not dangerous.

792
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,190
How high is it?

793
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,630
About 17 to 18 meters.

794
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,120
You need to climb up first

795
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,600
with this rope

796
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,670
and then rappel down.

797
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,710
When you go up,

798
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,630
it requires your physical strength.

799
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,440
When you rappel down,

800
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,560
it requires your body coordination.

801
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,000
This is the safety rope
used for rappelling.

802
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,890
I will teach you
from the most basic part.

803
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,410
Okay.

804
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,320
You will use it tomorrow.

805
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,150
Okay, thank you.

806
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,240
Take this rope first.

807
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,560
Go around it in this way.

808
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,960
Get it through.

809
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,720
Get it through...

810
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,560
Make a figure 8 shape.

811
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,160
Figure 8...

812
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,080
This is called figure 8 knot.

813
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,240
Also the most used knot.

814
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,040
Then go around from here.
Get it through.

815
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,240
Then get it through in this way.

816
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,200
And this.

817
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,760
Look, isn’t it tight?

818
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,600
I didn’t quite follow you.

819
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,160
Isn’t it simple?

820
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:25,760
Okay.

821
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,240
Let’s do it again.

822
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:28,760
Pull this.

823
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,300
Go around.

824
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,120
Go around from behind.

825
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,720
Get it through.

826
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,000
-This is not figure 8.
-From the behind.

827
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,360
Go from the behind, you...

828
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:39,880
No.

829
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:41,200
Explain it to me...

830
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,400
Sir.

831
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,000
This is the special meal for you

832
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,440
to express my gratitude.

833
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,520
Lamb chops and hairtail.

834
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,440
Thank you for teaching me.

835
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,040
Did you use all of the money

836
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,280
in your meal card?

837
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:56,920
No. No.

838
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:58,480
Well...

839
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,840
Have a seat. Let’s eat together.

840
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,360
Okay.

841
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:06,800
Have more

842
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,040
of this lamb chop. It’s very nutritious.

843
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,540
Here.

844
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,520
Thank you.

845
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,280
I’m good.

846
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,680
Luo Sir, have some too.

847
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,960
You are really considerate.

848
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,720
The man who can be your boyfriend

849
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,800
must be really lucky.

850
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,280
That’s true.

851
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,440
I mean it.

852
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,480
Here, have some hairtail.

853
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,920
It’s too delicious.

854
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,320
Why do I have a weird feeling?

855
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,520
You ate a lot.

856
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,360
But you practiced too little.

857
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,200
Come on, Captain Xing.

858
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,000
Is your arm better?

859
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,720
It sounds insincere.

860
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,640
I didn’t mean it.

861
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,480
Can you forgive me?

862
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,600
No, it’s too contrived.

863
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,320
Too contrived.

864
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,080
This ointment works well.

865
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,000
Have a try.

866
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,440
Xia.

867
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,520
You are here.

868
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,240
Are you looking for me?

869
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:21,800
No.

870
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,040
Yes.

871
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,960
This is for you.

872
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,360
Sorry.

873
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,400
We have rules

874
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,280
that we can’t just accept

875
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,240
stuff from others.

876
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,080
It’s not like that.

877
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,760
Didn’t you pull your muscles?

878
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,440
This ointment works really well.

879
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,440
It’s anti-inflammatory and analgesic.

880
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,240
You will recover very fast

881
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,320
after you use it.

882
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,120
Here.

883
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:38,920
Thank you.

884
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:39,920
I don’t need it.

885
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:40,920
Why?

886
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,720
I’m almost

887
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,640
fully recovered.

888
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,480
“Almost” means not fully recovered.

889
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:46,000
Look.

890
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,240
This ointment works really well.

891
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:47,960
Try it.

892
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,200
No, I really don’t need it.

893
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,520
Are you afraid of trouble?

894
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,040
Come on.

895
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,360
-Let me apply it for you.
-No, no, no!

896
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,360
Xia.

897
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,560
Thank you for your kindness.

898
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,480
It’s my honor to serve people.

899
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,840
It’s my responsibility
to cooperate with you.

900
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,360
Such a good ointment,

901
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,800
you should keep it.

902
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:07,040
Are you still angry with me?

903
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,040
I’m not.

904
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,240
You are a man.

905
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,560
Why are you so stingy?

906
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,720
I’m not angry.

907
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,440
That expression means angry.

908
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,160
I’m really not angry! You...

909
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:18,760
Well,

910
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,480
I still have work to do.

911
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,560
Our appointment is at ten thirty.

912
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,200
It’s half past nine now.

913
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,280
I’ll see you

914
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,600
at the training ground one hour later.

915
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:27,720
Wait.

916
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,320
I’m here now.

917
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,600
And you ask me to wait for one hour.

918
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,080
You... you...

919
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,360
Is your head broken?

920
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,160
About turn!

921
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:50,960
You are here.

922
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,480
Ruined my selfie.

923
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,480
Good. You are not late this time.

924
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,000
I’m early.

925
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,760
You kept me waiting for an hour.

926
00:38:59,200 --> 00:38:59,900
I’m a

927
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,720
straightforward person.

928
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,760
Please don’t mind.

929
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,760
I just want to improve

930
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:03,960
our work efficiency.

931
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,480
I don’t mind.

932
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,240
I am generous.

933
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,440
Do you think everyone

934
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,800
is as stingy as someone?

935
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,440
I saw that you were

936
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,240
taking pictures, right?

937
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,000
I want to take a picture
of this building.

938
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,920
You ruined it.

939
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,480
I just can’t get the whole building

940
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,680
in this picture.

941
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,400
Of course the high angle

942
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,520
can’t get the whole building in it.

943
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,080
What do you know?

944
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,520
The 45-degree overhead shot
will make my face look small.

945
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,160
But also make your legs look short.

946
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,120
My legs are short?

947
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:32,720
Give me your phone.

948
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,760
Let me take a picture for you.

949
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,760
You?

950
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,400
Can you do it?

951
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,000
You take the phone upside down.

952
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,080
Don’t move.

953
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,320
Let me see.

954
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,560
Look. How is it?

955
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,240
Well...

956
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,520
You are good at it.

957
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,600
It’s the first time
that my legs look like

958
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,680
two meters long in a picture.

959
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,480
My figure is really good.

960
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,520
I like

961
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,640
playing with the camera

962
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,600
and photography.

963
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,880
In fact, the principle is very simple.

964
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,320
Turn the phone upside down

965
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,640
and there will be optical illusion

966
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,160
in the photos taken.

967
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,600
It will make people look slim.

968
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,680
What’s more,

969
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,480
place the phone below the waist,

970
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,480
and it will lengthen

971
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,020
the lower half

972
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,440
of the body in visual.

973
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,160
I didn’t know

974
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,120
that you are such a Shu Wenbo.

975
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,160
And you are not fat.

976
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:28,960
Really?

977
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,160
You’re too skinny.

978
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,320
You should eat more.

979
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,240
My mom said

980
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,520
chubby girls are blessed.

981
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,800
The time is up.

982
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,080
Let’s go to work.

983
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,520
Aren’t you going to interview?

984
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,100
Where’s the photographer?

985
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,600
The photographer is
waiting at the reception.

986
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,560
We have

987
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,960
field technical
and tactical training today.

988
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,120
I’m not good at talking.

989
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,560
Let me take you to
shot some interesting stuff.

990
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,200
Fully armed?

991
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,160
It sounds cool.

992
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,000
Let’s go.

993
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,680
Next group.

994
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,520
What’s their problem?

995
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,280
They are not decisive enough.

996
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,600
Hurry up!

997
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,320
Yes!

998
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,360
Keep practicing.

999
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,240
Yes.

1000
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:31,720
What’s wrong?

1001
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,560
Where is the toilet?

1002
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,640
Toilet?

1003
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,640
There is no toilet!

1004
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,120
Keep it down.

1005
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,680
No toilet? You guys

1006
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,160
don’t go to the toilet?

1007
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,000
We are not allowed

1008
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:43,960
to go to the toilet during training.

1009
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,360
Training is the same as actual combat.

1010
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,200
No matter what happens,

1011
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,400
we can’t leave without permission.

1012
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,720
All right.

1013
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,360
But I want to go to the toilet now.

1014
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,560
What should I do?

1015
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,520
Are you in a hurry?

1016
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,680
Yes.

1017
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,320
You can go over there

1018
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,200
to finish it.

1019
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,200
The grass is denser over there.

1020
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,040
No one will see you.

1021
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:02,880
No!

1022
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,160
This place

1023
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,680
is rarely visited by people.

1024
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:13,760
I guess we need to

1025
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,880
keep driving about ten kilometers.

1026
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,480
Can you still hold it?

1027
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,240
I have to.

1028
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,400
Slow down!

1029
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,720
I’ll slow down.

1030
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,320
I mean,

1031
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,960
faster. Faster.

1032
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,800
What do you want...

1033
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,920
Are you okay, Xia?

1034
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,200
Are you okay?

1035
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,280
I’m not in the mood to talk to you now.

1036
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,080
What?

1037
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,680
I’m not in the mood to talk to you.

1038
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,960
Why?

1039
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,760
Tell me if you have anything.

1040
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,520
You...

1041
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,840
I’ll drive more slowly if you want.

1042
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,480
Xia!

1043
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,200
Shut up and drive!

1044
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,680
