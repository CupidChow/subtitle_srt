1
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:52,000
=You Are My Glory=

2
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:55,120
=Episode 3=

3
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,040
(Can you be my coach?)

4
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,560
(I think)

5
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,400
(you should find someone else.)

6
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:05,920
(I might quit this game)

7
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,760
(at any time.)

8
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,719
(Well, could you at least)

9
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:12,079
(give me some advice when we play?)

10
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:13,560
(Like telling me where I do wrong,)

11
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,439
(or how it should be done.)

12
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:15,280
(Is that all right?)

13
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,400
(If you feel like quitting,)

14
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,439
(I'll find someone else.)

15
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,560
(Please, Jade Rabbit God.)

16
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,039
(Okay.)

17
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,080
Okay?

18
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,159
One step at a time.

19
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,759
Since you agreed to the first step,

20
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:47,360
the second one is not far now.

21
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,800
Wait.

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,039
What's the second one?

23
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,520
(Let's get started then.)

24
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,840
Hey, my support character.

25
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,919
(Use Wang Zhaojun.)

26
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:11,560
(Use Wang Zhaojun?)

27
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,439
(I don't know how to.)

28
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,599
(I haven't tried it before.)

29
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:15,840
If you guys have a unit competition,

30
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:17,919
there's a good chance
it's in Draft Mode.

31
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:20,120
You might not necessarily get Cai Wenji.

32
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:22,039
It's all right for a newbie
to get Wang Zhaojun.

33
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,400
The summoners' abilities.

34
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,000
Change it to Flash.

35
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,560
Hold on.

36
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,840
Is there something

37
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,120
that I'm not aware of?

38
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,560
What unit competition?

39
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,560
It's the Honor of Kings competition

40
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,759
organized by our unit.

41
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:36,840
I would like Jade Rabbit God

42
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,560
to teach me.

43
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,520
Look.

44
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,039
Yu Tu is quite a good coach.

45
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,719
Zhai Liang is a good example.

46
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,000
Look how screwed up it was

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,039
when he used Xi Shi.

48
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,599
I watched him for a bit

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,159
to learn the techniques.

50
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:49,599
But I learned the rest

51
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,000
all by myself.

52
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,400
Come off it.

53
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,199
Finally,

54
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,439
the kill counts are more
than the number of times slain.

55
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,919
(Why are the opponents
using Wang Zhaojun as well?)

56
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:16,400
(It feels worse than an outfit clash.)

57
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,240
I won't lead you guys to defeat.

58
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:41,240
Get to higher ground!

59
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:07,800
When I was learning acting,

60
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,839
I had to watch the videos

61
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,720
of my seniors repeatedly.

62
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,680
Now, I have to do the same and watch

63
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,040
how I got slain when playing games.

64
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,160
I bet

65
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,879
it's because I have been gifted

66
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:20,160
with such great beauty.

67
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,399
So all other talents
need to be cut back.

68
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,560
That was so devious.

69
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:36,399
Yu Tu is way more devious.

70
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,120
That's why we won.

71
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,639
Is this game

72
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,639
all about being devious?

73
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,879
That explains why I lost.

74
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,480
It's all because I'm an upright person.

75
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,040
Chill.

76
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,600
Chill.

77
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,759
Sure enough.

78
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:05,839
It's more satisfying
than using Cai Wenji.

79
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,240
Cotton, not bad, huh?

80
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:16,560
How is it?

81
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,079
I'm doing better now
than I did yesterday, right?

82
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:19,800
That's really good.

83
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,120
I've been practising

84
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,040
all day today.

85
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,639
Hard work pays off!

86
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,240
I'll prove it with my singing!

87
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,959
I have to save this game.

88
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:56,519
Cool!

89
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,959
Nice one, girl.

90
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:00,319
Yu Tu, I never thought
a kill stealer like you

91
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,759
would let her get the kill.

92
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,120
(He let me get the kill?)

93
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,839
(True enough. He let me win.)

94
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:40,800
He still won't reply to me.

95
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,839
I know you let me win

96
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:54,959
when I got the Triple Kill.

97
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,360
I've earned enough.

98
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,160
You should get the kill.

99
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:26,920
Thank you.

100
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:41,959
Dandan.

101
00:08:42,199 --> 00:08:43,319
Get me

102
00:08:43,319 --> 00:08:43,959
the cosmetics contract.

103
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:44,439
I'll go over

104
00:08:44,439 --> 00:08:45,639
and discuss the details with them later.

105
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,800
Tell Mr. Wang to get the car ready.

106
00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:47,519
Okay.

107
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,879
Give Mr. Wang a call.

108
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,360
Where's Jingjing?

109
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,679
It's only one o'clock,

110
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:56,399
and she's gone already?

111
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,919
Jingjing hasn't been here
for a few days now.

112
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:00,559
Xiao Zhu said she did apply for leave.

113
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,799
She merely asked

114
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,039
for a day off.

115
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,120
Wait, she didn't come here at all

116
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,120
while I was away on the business trip?

117
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:10,840
Why didn't you tell me?

118
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,720
I'll check her place.

119
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,320
Jingjing.

120
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,279
Jingjing.

121
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,440
Why didn't you come
in the past two days?

122
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,399
You've been practising at home?

123
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,480
Let me see.

124
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,440
Not bad.

125
00:09:58,919 --> 00:09:59,879
Are you battling AI players?

126
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,759
Are you kidding me?

127
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:03,480
I'm doing solo queue, all right?

128
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,600
Solo queue?

129
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,440
Not bad, huh?

130
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,960
You have the guts to solo queue now.

131
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,559
I was nervous at first.

132
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:10,279
But it's better now.

133
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:11,679
I've reached Gold IV now.

134
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:12,840
I solo queued and ranked up myself.

135
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:15,120
What has gotten into you?

136
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,120
You're so good now.

137
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:17,799
I'm gifted.

138
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:23,440
That's so awesome.

139
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:27,600
Let me see.

140
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,600
Wait.

141
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,039
Guo never taught you
how to use this hero.

142
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,320
Did you practise it yourself?

143
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:35,919
Actually, I asked a game expert

144
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:36,879
to teach me.

145
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,519
I think he's better than Guo.

146
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:41,320
That's hard to say.

147
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,120
Is he reliable?

148
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:44,840
Will he expose your identity?

149
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,960
Don't worry.

150
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,080
I bet he doesn't even know

151
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,759
who I am.

152
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,360
Is he an online friend?

153
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:50,879
How did he teach you then?

154
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,159
Through the voice chat.

155
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,919
He teaches me how to use the abilities,

156
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:54,840
how to move,

157
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,519
and what I should do.

158
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,159
I'm going to take a sip.

159
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,399
Let's see.

160
00:10:58,919 --> 00:10:59,879
Which is it?

161
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:01,519
Open up my friend lists

162
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,480
in the game.

163
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,679
His name is Jade Rabbit Pounding Elixir.

164
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,440
Click on the avatar,
and you can see his performance record.

165
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:10,200
He has a 93-percent win rate.

166
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,600
For real?

167
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:16,519
Indeed.

168
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:18,120
He seems to be better than Guo.

169
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,799
It's a shame.
He's just an online friend.

170
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:22,919
If there's such a good player

171
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:23,759
in real life who's that reliable

172
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:24,799
to teach you in person,

173
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,159
you'll progress

174
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:27,679
a lot faster.

175
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,039
(Yu Tu)

176
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:31,840
(exists in real life.)

177
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,919
(If he teaches me in person...)

178
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:35,159
But it's okay.

179
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,440
Just keep up the training.

180
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:37,879
There's still a month to go.

181
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:38,799
You need to step up the game.

182
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,720
Basically,

183
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,080
I've declined all the job offers.

184
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,200
But for those that we accepted
a few months ago,

185
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,360
we still have to fulfil them.

186
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,799
Why are you in a daze?

187
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,360
I know.

188
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,320
You do?

189
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,279
Really?

190
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:53,559
I'll get going then.

191
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:54,679
I still have a contract to discuss.

192
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,440
Okay.

193
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,960
Keep it up.

194
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,200
Okay.

195
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:59,720
Drink more water.

196
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,559
Protect your skin.

197
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:01,279
Bye.

198
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:11,799
Why is Yu Tu

199
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:13,320
online every day?

200
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,200
He plays games every day.

201
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:19,200
Is this how he spends his holidays?

202
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,559
(Rabbit God.)

203
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:29,720
(Do you spend your holidays)

204
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,879
(playing games at home?)

205
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,240
(What does he work as now?)

206
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:38,279
(It doesn't feel like
he's in the financial industry.)

207
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,000
(Peipei.)

208
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,000
(Do we have any classmates)

209
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,600
(who have a really cool job now?)

210
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,519
(It's you, isn't it?)

211
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:54,360
(I mean)

212
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,600
(what are those with good grades)

213
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,559
(doing right now?)

214
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,000
(I see. Those guys?)

215
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,039
(Qi Qi is working as an editor-in-chief)

216
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:02,039
(in a book company.)

217
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,120
(Wang Jiang is now a vice president)

218
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,200
(in one of the top 500 corporations.)

219
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:07,600
(Who else?)

220
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,039
(Sun Xiu is working in the Office
of the Secretary to the Mayor.)

221
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,279
(How about Yu Tu?)

222
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:41,720
(I think Yu Tu is working)

223
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,360
(in Aerospace Research Institute
in Shanghai.)

224
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:45,120
(Aerospace?)

225
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:46,759
(He's in the aerospace industry?)

226
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:47,960
(But didn't he study finance)

227
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,200
(back in college?)

228
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:51,480
(How do you remember so clearly?)

229
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,480
(How would I know)

230
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,759
(why did he join aerospace?)

231
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,279
(Why do you ask?)

232
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,440
(Check this out.)

233
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:08,639
(Yu Tu)

234
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:10,240
(bought the air purifier)

235
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,639
(that your friend posted on Moments.)

236
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:12,519
(It broke down all of a sudden.)

237
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:13,720
(He called to request a repair,
but he couldn't get through.)

238
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,080
(Could you help him with it?)

239
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:16,879
(I just managed to reach him.)

240
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,840
(He said)

241
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,720
(he could only go over tomorrow night
to fix it.)

242
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,320
(This is for the kid's room.)

243
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,360
(Could you inform him)

244
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,080
(to come as soon as possible?)

245
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,679
(This kid coughs a lot
when he has a cold.)

246
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,120
(Yu Tu sells purifiers?)

247
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,200
(I think they developed it)

248
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,039
(for civilian use or something.)

249
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,720
(I thought aerospace tech
must be really cool.)

250
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:29,679
(But still, totally unexpected.)

251
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:30,440
(Which part is broken?)

252
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,480
(I couldn't turn it on.)

253
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:32,919
(Are you staying in Minhang?)

254
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,679
(I'll go over and take a look.)

255
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,120
(Why did you send this to me?)

256
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:40,840
(It was in the group chat.)

257
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,759
(I just recalled.)

258
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:42,759
(So I sent it to you.)

259
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,559
(He's indeed in the aerospace industry.)

260
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:55,279
Yu Tu.

261
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,480
Chang'e 1 has been launched.

262
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,159
Someone else

263
00:14:58,159 --> 00:14:59,080
is a step ahead of you.

264
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:00,159
That's perfect, isn't it?

265
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:01,879
Perhaps, by the time I graduate,

266
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:03,679
the moonbase has been built.

267
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,200
I'll use the moon as a starting point

268
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,200
to conquer Mars

269
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,120
and fly through the solar system.

270
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:09,279
Come off it.

271
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:10,840
It doesn't cost me anything

272
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,679
to brag, isn't it?

273
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,120
Fine.

274
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,480
You're the top student.
So you must be right.

275
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,720
Wait up!

276
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,120
It turns out that
he didn't give up on his dream.

277
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:43,919
Yu Tu is in this city too.

278
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:07,799
(Peipei.)

279
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:08,999
(Show me the purifier advertisement)

280
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,639
(that Yu Tu sent you.)

281
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:24,960
(It's time to unleash my acting skills.)

282
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:35,919
The smog in Shanghai

283
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:37,200
is too serious.

284
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,440
How about your place?

285
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,879
What a coincidence.

286
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,440
Yu Tu and I are in Shanghai too.

287
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:44,080
The smog in Hangzhou

288
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,200
is pretty serious too.

289
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:46,799
The situation in Wuhan

290
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:48,879
is all right.

291
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:50,080
What brand of purifier

292
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,840
do you use?

293
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,159
I bought

294
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:54,840
a Jade Rabbit Air Purifier.

295
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,960
But it broke down after a few days.

296
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:58,519
Yu Tu?

297
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:00,480
Isn't that your company's product?

298
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:02,919
Is that a product

299
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:04,279
of Jade Rabbit God's company?

300
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,679
That explains it.

301
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,399
I bought it because it's the same
as your name.

302
00:17:07,399 --> 00:17:08,679
What a coincidence.

303
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,879
It's a product developed by our lab

304
00:17:09,879 --> 00:17:10,919
and another company.

305
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,759
Try using another adapter.

306
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,200
A classmate of mine bought it

307
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,279
and said it wasn't working either.

308
00:17:15,639 --> 00:17:16,519
I took a look

309
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:18,440
and found out it was the adapter.

310
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:20,159
(Why did this classmate)

311
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:21,159
(steal my idea?)

312
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,879
I tried using another adapter,

313
00:17:22,879 --> 00:17:23,960
but still, it didn't work.

314
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,880
I called for repair,

315
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,279
but they said it was scheduled

316
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,279
for the day after tomorrow.

317
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,400
But my parents

318
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,400
are having really bad coughs.

319
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:34,920
The after-sales service isn't that good.

320
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,799
Yu Tu.

321
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:37,680
Take a look for Cotton.

322
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,680
(What a good line.)

323
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,799
(I have to send So Panicky)

324
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:41,880
(a set of skin.)

325
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:42,759
Jade Rabbit God.

326
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:43,920
You even know how to do that?

327
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,680
Of course.

328
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,039
He is a part-time
troubleshooting expert.

329
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,000
Well, Jade Rabbit God,

330
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,599
could you

331
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:53,319
take a look at the purifier at my place?

332
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,559
Send me

333
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:58,400
your contact details.

334
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,920
(That was easy.)

335
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,000
I'll get the guys at the lab

336
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,839
to go to your place

337
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:04,400
and take a look.

338
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,680
(I knew it wouldn't be that easy.)

339
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,799
(It was so hard to get him
to add me on QQ back then.)

340
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,960
(Good thing
I have a trick up my sleeve.)

341
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,519
Thank you.

342
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:14,319
But

343
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:15,920
this is actually

344
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,960
the second repair.

345
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:18,920
I think there's no point for them
to come anyway.

346
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,000
That's so unreliable.

347
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:22,680
What actually went wrong?

348
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,319
I wanted to buy it.

349
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:25,440
But I changed my mind now.

350
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,440
That's right, Yu Tu.

351
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,039
Are your products reliable?

352
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:28,720
Jeez.

353
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,519
That's right.

354
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:30,759
I bought it

355
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,200
because it says on the ads

356
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,079
that it's the aerospace tech.

357
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,759
But I never expected this.

358
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,680
(Sorry.)

359
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,519
(The great aerospace industry
of the motherland.)

360
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:40,039
(I'll make it up to you next time.)

361
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:41,319
Didn't the repair guy say

362
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:42,519
what went wrong?

363
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,920
He seemed to be in a bad spot,

364
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,480
and he didn't say what was the problem.

365
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,000
Yu Tu.

366
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,960
Why don't you go and take a look?

367
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:55,279
Do you stay with your parents?

368
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,319
That's right.

369
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,440
Are they in now?

370
00:18:58,839 --> 00:18:59,599
Yes.

371
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:01,720
If it's convenient,

372
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,960
I'll go over and take a look.

373
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,079
My house is in Pudong.

374
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:09,400
Is it too far?

375
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:10,839
So sorry to bother you.

376
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:12,240
It's fine.

377
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:13,759
Send me the address.

378
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:23,240
You're so lame.

379
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:23,960
Why do you have to go

380
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,000
when her parents are around?

381
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,279
You're the lame one.

382
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:30,079
Xiao Zhu.

383
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:31,000
Xiao Zhu.

384
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,640
Quickly unpack

385
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,519
this newly bought purifier.

386
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,279
Hurry.

387
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:00,599
How's my makeup?

388
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:06,640
It's too thick, isn't it?

389
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,119
I knew it.

390
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,240
It's too thick.

391
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:26,440
Do I look girlie?

392
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,759
Yes.

393
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:28,599
Well.

394
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,400
Jingjing, it's late at night.

395
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,440
What are you doing?

396
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,119
Is this a dress-up game?

397
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:35,319
Destroy the air purifier.

398
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,160
Cotton.

399
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,400
No, it's not me.

400
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,960
I'm her assistant.

401
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,640
She sent me down to get you.

402
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:24,119
Assistant?

403
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,400
It's right in front.

404
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:43,920
I'm Xiao Zhu.

405
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
We're almost there.

406
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,519
Jingjing, why did you come downstairs?

407
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,400
I'm worried someone might think

408
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,480
that I'm being a snob.

409
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,039
That's why I came down to welcome him.

410
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:46,759
Long time no see.

411
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,160
Long time no see.

412
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:50,240
Has it been ten years?

413
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,480
About that.

414
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,319
Let's take a look at the purifier.

415
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:09,799
I've stayed in the house for days

416
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:10,720
and haven't stepped out of it since.

417
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,200
I'm feeling a little lightheaded.

418
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,559
Why don't we go for a walk first?

419
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:18,480
Here's the thing.

420
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,079
I wanted to use the excuse

421
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:20,279
that the power's off.

422
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:21,920
But I didn't expect Ding Chaoqun
to have used it.

423
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,720
I couldn't bear the thought

424
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,480
of destroying such a cute purifier.

425
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,160
So it's doing its work right now.

426
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:30,599
It's quite cold out there.

427
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:36,000
I'm going back up to get changed.

428
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,920
Wait for me.

429
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:28,960
I don't feel so safe

430
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,400
walking with you.

431
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,319
Are you kidding me?

432
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,319
I should be the one to say that.

433
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,079
Look.

434
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,880
When I came out with Xiao Zhu,

435
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,799
which is the girl you saw earlier.

436
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:41,160
There weren't as many people

437
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,079
who turned around to look at us

438
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:43,319
when I came out with her.

439
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,960
Don't make me get photographed,

440
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
or I'll hit the headlines.

441
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,000
Why would you play games with me?

442
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:17,240
Didn't you invite me?

443
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,680
You added the wrong person.
Have you forgotten?

444
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,720
But...

445
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:24,559
why would you

446
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,000
be in my QQ friend list?

447
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,000
Do I have to explain about me

448
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,400
using an alt

449
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,440
to secretly add your QQ account?

450
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,799
Do you have amnesia or something?

451
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:36,720
Are you also

452
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,359
going to ask me

453
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:38,039
why I asked you here?

454
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,279
Do you have a Weibo account?

455
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:47,960
Yes.

456
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,279
Well, log in to your account

457
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,480
and check out mine.

458
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,680
(Yes, my muse is so adorable!)

459
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,000
(An air purifier
recommended by the muse.)

460
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,720
(I'm buying it!)

461
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,559
(I'm posting the review.)

462
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:14,680
(I think it's the last unit.)

463
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,559
(When I checked again,)

464
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:16,880
(the product is sold out.)

465
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,559
(I'll post one.)

466
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:18,359
(I almost didn't get it.)

467
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:19,559
(You snatched the same product
as my muse.)

468
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:20,920
(How much did she get paid
for posting this?)

469
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:22,440
(Xieyue Yilun.)

470
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,480
(Isn't your husband)

471
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,839
(working with that company?)

472
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:25,480
(Ask him.)

473
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:26,680
(I did.)

474
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,640
(He said he didn't pay her.)

475
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,240
(The less popular celebrity)

476
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,519
(charges 300,000 yuan for one post.)

477
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:30,799
(Let alone Qiao Jingjing.)

478
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:31,599
(My husband said)

479
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:32,440
(it's all sold out.)

480
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,559
(There are many more orders)

481
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:34,359
(with limited stocks.)

482
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:35,759
(We didn't see this coming.)

483
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:36,799
(Speaking of,)

484
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:37,400
(the only publicity)

485
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,039
(is for all employees)

486
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:39,279
(to post on their Moments.)

487
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,720
(This is so cool!)

488
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:41,799
Why?

489
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,200
It's not like I'm endorsing
any other similar products.

490
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,000
There's no conflict.

491
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,279
Support the motherland's

492
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:47,680
aerospace industry.

493
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:49,960
Thank you.

494
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,599
That's so not cool of you.

495
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,440
I thought what was uncool

496
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:01,480
was lying to me

497
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,119
about taking part

498
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:03,400
in the Honor of Kings tournament.

499
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,039
I didn't lie to you.

500
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,519
I'm taking part in the tournament.

501
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,440
Don't you know I'm the spokesperson

502
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,799
of the Honor of Glory?

503
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,240
I did see the event of you
giving away inscriptions

504
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,920
when I logged into the game.

505
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,720
A few months ago,

506
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,759
a WeChat friend of mine

507
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:19,079
recorded a video of me

508
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:20,000
playing games

509
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,799
and sent it to the marketing account.

510
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,279
You should know

511
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,480
my gaming skills.

512
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,960
So one month later,

513
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,720
I'll be going on the same stage

514
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,559
with professional players

515
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:29,880
to prove myself.

516
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,480
Thus, everything that has happened.

517
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,400
Are you playing
with professional players?

518
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:39,440
Not all.

519
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,680
There are five lucky players.

520
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,039
So there are six of us including me.

521
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,039
Four professional players.

522
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:43,880
Two on each side.

523
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:48,799
What do you think

524
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,400
of my gaming skills

525
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,039
if I were to join the tournament?

526
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,039
There's no telling if we will win

527
00:28:58,519 --> 00:28:59,640
even with you on the team.

528
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,880
So you want me to teach you?

529
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:07,119
Can you?

530
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:08,759
Not the kind

531
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:10,079
through the Internet.

532
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,000
That's too inefficient.

533
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,039
It's best if you could teach me
in person.

534
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,039
You happened to be on a break

535
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,720
right now anyway.

536
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,240
It wouldn't get in the way

537
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,240
of your work, right?

538
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:23,960
Here's the thing.

539
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,799
I've never watched a professional game.

540
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,720
I don't know much

541
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,920
about their gaming skills.

542
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:29,400
I don't know if I can teach you.

543
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,960
It's okay.

544
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:32,039
I won't get anyone else

545
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,039
to teach me anyway.

546
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,359
You should know that.

547
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,440
You trust me?

548
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,160
You're my classmate.

549
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:53,319
Yu Tu.

550
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,799
Teach me Math.

551
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,039
I'll treat you to crispy chicken.

552
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:06,240
Okay.

553
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,400
Really?

554
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,519
Are you doing it willingly?

555
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,640
Enough walking then.

556
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,640
Let's go back and play games.

557
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:14,440
Hold on.

558
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:16,440
Your parents are at home.

559
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:17,799
It's not so appropriate.

560
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,480
Says who that my parents are around?

561
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,039
My parents are in their hometown.

562
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,880
The only thing at home
is the Jade Rabbit Purifier.

563
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,680
What day is the game next month?

564
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:38,039
Sunday, the second week
of next month.

565
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:38,920
It's on the 10th.

566
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:41,799
There's not much time left.

567
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,400
Let's get started now.

568
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:45,000
And do what?

569
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:47,680
I've just started playing this game
recently

570
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,240
and haven't studied it.

571
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:51,480
So I'm not so sure

572
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,480
how I should teach you.

573
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,079
But

574
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,799
you can start by telling me the mistakes
you made

575
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,680
when you had a match with us

576
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,799
in the last few days.

577
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:00,000
(That was quick of him)

578
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,400
(to enter the coaching mode.)

579
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:03,119
Let's start with the errors collection.

580
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:06,640
Are there a lot?

581
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:10,160
Not really.

582
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:11,480
More than ten.
