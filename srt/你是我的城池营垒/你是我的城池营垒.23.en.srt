I don’t want to share the moment
with others.

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,920
Make a wish.

63
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,360
Is it

64
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,440
a wish

65
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,640
of world peace?

00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,760
Half right.

67
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,120
How about the other half?

68
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,560
Getting rich.

69
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,320
Fine.

70
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,000
I don’t have a gift?

71
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,160
No.

72
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,160
But there is a gift

73
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,200
which I want you to give to another one.

74
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,440
It’s my birthday,

75
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,520
but you give another person a gift.

76
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,960
Please help me give this gift

77
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,560
to the little girl

78
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,920
who wanted to

79
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,680
treat the sick all over the world.

80
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,080
Please tell her

81
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,960
it’s great to be protected by her.

82
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,840
Thank you.

83
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,800
The little girl

84
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,240
actually has the biggest wish,

85
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
which is

86
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,600
hoping the police

87
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,240
she’s always been in love with

88
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,400
can be safe and sound,

89
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,520
and no bad person will

90
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,040
hurt him.

91
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:11,060
(Outpatient)

92
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,080
Morning.

93
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,320
Morning, Mi Ka.

94
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,960
What’s wrong? Why are you in low spirits

95
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,200
after resting for several days?

96
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,920
I don’t know what happened.

97
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,040
It’s like I was possessed.

98
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,920
My laptop was splashed with water.

99
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,040
Half of my paper

100
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,160
is in it.

101
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,320
Then what should you do?

102
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,080
It’s time for excellence selection.

103
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,280
Can you finish it before that?

104
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,200
I don’t look forward to it.

105
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,520
But I’ve finished half of the paper.

106
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,680
It’s really pitiful.

107
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,640
Luckily,

108
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,640
I’ve synchronized it to cloud storage.

109
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,080
Also I copied the experimental data

110
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,080
to the computer

111
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:48,880
in the office.

112
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,880
I’m here mainly to bring you this.

113
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,880
Local specialties, from the mountains.

114
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,480
Dried bamboo shoots.

115
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,600
-Thank you, Mi Ka.
-Thank you. We all have.

116
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,920
You hung out, didn’t you?

117
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,120
With Captain Xing?

118
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,480
You are gossiping.

119
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,200
See you.

120
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,630
Thank you.

121
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,560
Not at all.

122
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,920
Morning, Dr. Xu.

123
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,400
Morning, Xiaoxiao.

124
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,400
I’d like to tell you a straight tip.

125
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,120
I heard that

126
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,000
they held a meeting today.

127
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,080
President Zhang

128
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,800
particularly told Mr. Shao to

129
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,600
consider choosing you
as an outstanding doctor.

130
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,960
You just listened to people around you.

131
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,080
It doesn’t count.

132
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:22,840
It depends on

133
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,360
Mr. Shao’s decision in the end.

134
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,160
What’s wrong with Chen Tao recently?

135
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,200
Why has he stayed away once he saw you?

136
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,480
Is that so?

137
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,320
It’s not like that.

138
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,790
You are gossiping.

139
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,000
Great. All documents are here.

140
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,560
Yanshan.

141
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,520
Come here.

142
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,360
I got some local specialties for you.

143
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,160
Thank you.

144
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,200
You still haven’t finished your paper?

145
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,520
It’s almost done.

146
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,040
But it still needs

147
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,480
a lot of experimental data.

148
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,920
It’s a great deal of work.

149
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,320
Time is limited
but the task is heavy.

150
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,080
It’s great if I’m

151
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,360
a quick learner like you.

152
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,960
I’m not that great

153
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,680
as you said.

154
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,280
You should trust yourself.

155
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,800
OK. I’d trust myself.

156
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,560
Dr. Xu has been working

157
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,640
in Neurosurgery longer.

158
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,120
She is careful in work

159
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,320
and good in skill.

160
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,320
It’s more probable

161
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,960
that she’ll be selected.

162
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,320
It makes sense.

163
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,400
But I believe Mr. Shao

164
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,560
thinks highly of Mi Ka.

165
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,160
During their vacation this time,

166
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,720
they had a trip in a mountain together.

167
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,840
How do you know that?

168
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,600
They brought the same

169
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,880
local specialties.

170
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,640
Isn’t it obvious?

171
00:09:48,540 --> 00:10:03,780
(Toilet)

172
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,880
Dura forceps.

173
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,800
But I believe Mr. Shao

174
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,080
thinks highly of Mi Ka.

175
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,720
During their vacation this time,

176
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,160
they had a trip in a mountain together.

177
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,920
Yanshan.

178
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,600
Sorry, Mr. Shao.

179
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,280
Xu Yanshan.

180
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,880
If your thoughts were

181
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,920
far away from the operating room,

182
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,600
you’d better get out first.

183
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,040
I will be careful next time.

184
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,000
Get out.

185
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,880
Bipolar.

186
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:02,960
The operation went very successfully.

187
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,440
All the indexes are fine.

188
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,720
Just have more rest.

189
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,800
Thank you.

190
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,960
It’s a pleasure. Don’t worry.

191
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,760
OK. Go ahead.

192
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,800
Mr. Shao.

193
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,520
I won’t make

194
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,720
such a stupid mistake again.

195
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,640
It is stupid.

196
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,880
I can forgive you.

197
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,240
But you should be clear about

198
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,760
how dangerous it was for the patient

199
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,240
if it went lower.

200
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,160
If anything happened,

201
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,600
can you forgive yourself

202
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,760
as a doctor?

203
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,080
Xu Yanshan.

204
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,240
It’s an operating room.

205
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,720
It’s only for operation.

206
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,280
If you can’t work without distractions,

207
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,560
don’t get in.

208
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,880
I see.

209
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,320
Mr. Shao.

210
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,560
Mr. Shao. You’ve had a long day.

211
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,400
Three minutes and eight seconds. Great!

212
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,680
What’s wrong? Aren’t you feeling well?

213
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:08,460
No.

214
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,800
Maybe I’ve been stressful
and didn’t rest well

215
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,080
for too many things happened lately.

216
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,040
Being too nervous
will make it at cross purpose.

217
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,360
Relax.

218
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,240
Captain Hao is concerned about you.

219
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,240
He treats you like

220
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,080
treating his natural son.

221
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,920
Brat!

222
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,640
I care about

223
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,360
all of you.

224
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,560
Captain Xing.

225
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,040
We’ve finished

226
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,160
shooting the training.

227
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,200
I’d ask you about time

228
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,360
for an exclusive interview.

229
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,480
Maybe next week.

230
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,200
I don’t think I have time this week.

231
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,920
Kelei.

232
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:39,760
You are

233
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,200
the spokesperson of Tiger Assault Team.

234
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,320
Make sure you’ll do a good job.

235
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,520
I see.

236
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,720
OK.

237
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,240
Take a rest.

238
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,880
Shu Wenbo.

239
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,800
Why don’t you

240
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,320
say hello to me on seeing me?

241
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,040
I… I saw

242
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,720
you were working.

243
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,560
It’s been over.

244
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,560
I can leave work early today.

245
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,760
After you finish your training,

246
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,480
let’s go have dinner together.

247
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,400
It’ll be a long training.

248
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,800
Don’t wait for me.

249
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,280
It doesn’t matter. I have time.

250
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,520
I have something else to do tonight.

251
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,240
What is it?

252
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,200
Tonight,

253
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,040
I will go to…

254
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,320
The…

255
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,720
Report!

256
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,080
Urgent!

257
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,000
Someone is turning on the gas tanks,

258
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,360
threatening to blow up the building
in Jinxiu Community.

259
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,280
A request for setting out.

260
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,080
Start off at once.

261
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,800
Yes.

262
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,480
Attention to safety.

263
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,640
Quickly.

264
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,280
Come on. Leave here.

265
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,280
Quickly.

266
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,000
Come on. Follow me.

267
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,800
Be careful.

268
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,720
Captain Xing.

269
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,200
What’s going on?

270
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,560
It’s an emotional entanglement.

271
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,360
The hostage taker is Zhang Dayong.

272
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,000
They are lovers.

273
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,920
Both of them live in

274
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,120
Room No. 301 of the building.

275
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,080
This is the plan of the corridor.

276
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,480
This is the plan of the rooms.

277
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,520
This is the satellite imagery.

278
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,800
They are here.

279
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,760
There are six

280
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,160
gas tanks in the room now.

281
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,560
All windows and doors

282
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,560
are deadly locked.

283
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,480
He wants to light the gas

284
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,080
and die together with his girlfriend.

285
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,760
Wenjing. Go to this place.

286
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,760
Find somewhere to watch.

287
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,880
OK.

288
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,600
How many years does the building have?

289
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,120
About 30 years.

290
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,840
Have someone to make an assessment.

291
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,040
Check out

292
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,560
the building’s damage degree

293
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,200
if an explosion occurred.

294
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,160
Yes.

295
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,560
No matter if Zhang Dayong

296
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,720
has turned on the gas tanks,

297
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,500
in the action,

298
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,280
nobody is allowed to fire.

299
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,280
Nobody is allowed to fire.

300
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,040
Now only two of us are here.

301
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,040
Tell me

302
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,720
why you did this.

303
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,400
No. No.

304
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,080
I gave you everything.

305
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,720
My love. My money.

306
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,760
I gave all to you.

307
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,640
Why did you still betray me?

308
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,320
No. No. No.

309
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,480
I didn’t.

310
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,760
Last week, you told me

311
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,080
you’d go to work overtime.

312
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,880
But I saw you by myself

313
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,230
-that you were with a man.
-Captain Xing. Captain Xing.

314
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,560
I’m now at the designated spot.

315
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,360
The suspect Zhang Dayong

316
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,520
is now in a rage.

317
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,560
There is a blind area for watching

318
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,840
from my angle.

319
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,520
It’s a long way

320
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,840
to reach Zhang Dayong from the window.

321
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,110
We can’t enter through the window.

322
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,310
The only way is going through the door.

323
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,640
It’ll have spark if we dash the door in.

324
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,640
It actually can’t work, either.

325
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,070
If he wants to light it,

326
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,090
flicking the lighter

327
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,200
only needs one moment.

328
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:16,440
Captain Xing.

329
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,310
We have the house assessment results.

330
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,680
If all the six gas tanks

331
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,160
explode together,

332
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,880
the whole building

333
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,960
will probably collapse.

334
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,350
Breaking in doesn’t work.

335
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,400
Contact the nearby unlocking

336
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,520
company to solve it.

337
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,720
Yes.

338
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,040
Why?

339
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,200
Why did you betray me?

340
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,200
Zhang Dayong.

341
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,800
No. I didn’t.

342
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,200
Calm down.

343
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,120
I know

344
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,400
you love your girlfriend very much.

345
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,640
I believe

346
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,800
you are the last one

347
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,800
who would hurt her.

348
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,720
Talk to me if there is anything.

349
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,500
Your life

350
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,090
will be very great in the future.

351
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:53,840
Never do

352
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,280
things making you regret.

353
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,410
Get away.

354
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,720
All of you. Get away.

355
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,640
I will blow it up if any of you come.

356
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,600
Break the window first.

357
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,320
Let the gas out

358
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,120
to decrease the explosive force.

359
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,640
It can also catch his attention.

360
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,800
Li Nian, contact the firemen

361
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,680
to prepare a water torch

362
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,360
to cooperate with us.

363
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,200
Yes.

364
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,480
Zhang Dayong.

365
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,200
Calm down.

366
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,720
I know

367
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,360
you love your girlfriend very much.

368
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,480
I believe

369
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,360
you are the last one

370
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,080
who would hurt her.

371
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,720
Give me the lock picks.

372
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,520
I will be fired

373
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,680
if it’s known by the company.

374
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,480
It’s too dangerous for you to do it.

375
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,920
I’ll complete the procedures afterward.

376
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,560
He was downstairs of your company.

377
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,280
You got in his car.

378
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,440
I saw you getting on.

379
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,320
Then I followed you.

380
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,280
You went to the hotel.

381
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,480
Tell me.

382
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,800
What were you doing there?

383
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,520
No.

384
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,040
What were you doing there?

385
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,000
No.

386
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,160
You must be wrong.

387
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,880
I didn’t do it.

388
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,120
No, it’s not like that.

389
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,560
There are so many policemen here.

390
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,320
I can’t live any longer.

391
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,120
Anyway,

392
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,880
you can’t live, either.

393
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,160
I’m begging you.

394
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,720
You are begging me now?

395
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,800
You are begging me.

396
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,040
You are begging me now?

397
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,160
What were you doing by then?

398
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,440
When you two

399
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,360
were enjoying yourselves,

400
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,920
did you think of me?

401
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,120
Open your eyes.

402
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,720
Once I move my fingers,

403
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,400
the policemen at the door

404
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,320
and all the others in this building…

405
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,920
Why didn’t you think of it

406
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,780
when you were

407
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,440
with that man?

408
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,720
I gave you everything.

409
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:36,600
-I gave all the…
-Action.

410
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,600
Without me…

411
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,520
Hurry.

412
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,760
Don’t catch me!

413
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,290
Turn around.

414
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,150
Don’t catch me!

415
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,420
Go away!

416
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,560
Let go of me.

417
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:06,760
Don’t move.

418
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,480
Bitch!

419
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,840
What’s wrong with your hand?

420
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,520
It’s bleeding.

421
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,320
It’s fine. Flesh wound.

422
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,600
The wound is deep.

423
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,840
Let me take you to the hospital.

424
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:25,840
No.

425
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,520
Let’s go.

426
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,520
Are you sure you are OK?

427
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,880
I’m OK.

428
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,600
You are back.

429
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,280
Are you still feeling ill

430
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,480
for Mr. Shao’s criticism?

431
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,960
You are not like a person who

432
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,240
would divert attention in an operation.

433
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,200
Do you have something on your mind

434
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:58,800
recently?

435
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,160
No. I’m just a bit tired.

436
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,840
It’s important to be selected
as an outstanding doctor.

437
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,960
But being healthy is more important.

438
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:07,750
What’s more,

439
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,040
Mr. Shao thinks highly of you.

440
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,400
You think so?

441
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,000
But I don’t think so.

442
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,720
I can’t flatter him.

443
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,960
I have to work harder.

444
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,760
If not, what else can I do?

445
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,720
Your words sound

446
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,760
harsh.

447
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,640
What do you mean?

448
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,400
Mi Ka.

449
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,240
You were transferred to ER
after making a mistake.

450
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,200
He transferred you back
once there is a chance.

451
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,160
If it’s not for you,

452
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:33,920
Ye Xiaoman wouldn’t have the chance

453
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:34,840
to go abroad.

454
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,520
You can go to his house

455
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,600
and learn with his friends.

456
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,120
You can go out for a trip together.

457
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,720
Don’t you think he’s

458
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,640
different to you?

459
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,720
Yanshan, you are my friend.

460
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,360
You don’t know me well?

461
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,040
A man treats a woman

462
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,120
like this unconditionally.

463
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,440
How could you not know?

464
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,600
Do you feel better?

465
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,240
Xing Kelei.

466
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,680
Why are you here?

467
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,240
Show me your hand.

468
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,080
What’s going on?

469
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,720
A slight wound

470
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,560
in the task.

471
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,720
How many stitches?

472
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,240
Seven.

473
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,800
Hey. Is it a slight wound?

474
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,320
It doesn’t matter.

475
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,080
I’ll be fine soon.

476
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,720
How could it be?

477
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,040
I’m really fine. Look at my leg.

478
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,040
It was broken last year.

479
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,000
But it’s still useful after being sewed.

480
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,200
You may continue.

481
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,840
I will get back now.

482
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,160
Except this,

483
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,760
is there any other injury?

484
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,720
No.

485
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,120
Just the hand.

486
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,440
Why

487
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,560
didn’t you tell me?

488
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,600
Next time when you get injured,

489
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,560
don’t let me worry that much.

490
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,760
Seven stitches. It really hurts.

491
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,640
You…

492
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,600
Where is your wound?

493
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,600
Is it serious?

494
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,560
Still painful?

495
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,320
I’m not injured.

496
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,880
It’s Xing Kelei.

497
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,160
Mi Ka is with him.

498
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,080
Nothing serious.

499
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,680
That’s fine.

500
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,280
They told me that.

501
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,440
So I thought you are injured.

502
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,480
Thank you for your concern.

503
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,640
But I have to leave

504
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,960
for something else.

505
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:31,800
Hold on.

506
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,080
I want to talk to you.

507
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,440
Wait…

508
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,400
Hey…

509
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,800
I came to see you

510
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,360
in the middle of the meeting.

511
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,040
But you just leave without a word.

512
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,520
I didn’t ask you to come.

513
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,960
Is it my fault to see you?

514
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:46,680
I didn’t mean that.

515
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,240
-Then what do you mean?
-I…

516
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:57,880
Hello.

517
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,600
I’m still in the hospital.

518
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:01,920
Boss is back.

519
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,000
He’s looking for you everywhere.

520
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,080
Come back soon.

521
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,440
Why is it so quick?

522
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,760
I’ve told you I’m serious this time.

523
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,760
I like her

524
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,160
and I will get her.

525
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,440
Besides,

526
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,360
Wenbo has no problem

527
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,760
with me suiting Xia.

528
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,760
He said they are just friends.

529
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,200
I don’t know why you get mad.

530
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,720
I don’t know what is wrong.

531
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,160
But I have to say

532
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,440
sorry to you.

533
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,040
Go for your meeting.

534
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,960
It’s hard to take a taxi.

535
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,600
How about you drive me back?

536
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,360
Driving will be slower.

537
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,360
By subway. That will be quick.

538
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,520
Your hand is injured

539
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,520
so you need to take more bone soup

540
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,320
for supplement.

541
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,760
It’s just flesh wound.

542
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,440
Not the bone.

543
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,000
Right.

544
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,440
Then what should you eat?

545
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,640
Waiter.

546
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,840
Paws for two.

547
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,270
Look.

548
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,370
You’re an authentic
western-style doctor.

549
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,120
How can you trust this kind

550
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,080
of method of eating the paws
while the hand gets injured?

551
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,840
I get refined internally and externally

552
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,640
and I have a thorough knowledge of both
western and traditional Chinese medicine.

553
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,240
Get refined internally and externally.

554
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,000
As my girl,

555
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,840
you are really different.

556
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,240
You are as excellent as I am.

557
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,920
Sure.

558
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,240
By the way,

559
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,480
did Keyao say anything to you

560
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,720
after getting back home?

561
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,360
She said nothing.

562
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,360
But it’s weird.

563
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:55,620
I think

564
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,720
both of them are weird.

565
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,000
So we can’t do

566
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,920
match-making things again.

567
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,800
If it’s not like that, it’s awkward.

568
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,200
Yes.

569
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,760
What are you thinking?

570
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,160
The paper.

571
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,560
I am not good at

572
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,200
writing this kind of academic paper.

573
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,680
But it’s time to submit it.

574
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,000
My girl

575
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,560
never admits defeat.

576
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:23,920
I trust you.

577
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,320
You should trust yourself too.

578
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,240
You just said

579
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,960
get refined internally and externally,

580
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,080
western and eastern…

581
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,120
Both western
and traditional Chinese medicine.

582
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,440
Both western
and traditional Chinese medicine.

583
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,960
What are you doing?

584
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,080
Let me aid you

585
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,440
and share my excellence to you.

586
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,000
Then my paper will pass.

587
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,160
Sure.

588
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,800
Can you eat it? Let me help.

589
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,560
How about the paws?

590
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,600
You are back, Captain Xing.

591
00:26:59,120 --> 00:26:59,720
Did you eat?

592
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,440
Yes.

593
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,120
Why are you sure Shu Wenbo

594
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,720
has feelings for you?

595
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,480
If a man likes you or not,

596
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,680
you can see it via his eyes.

597
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,800
When he looks at you,

598
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:24,760
it’s different from

599
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,840
his looking at others.

600
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,160
I really don’t want

601
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,480
to guess like this anymore.

602
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,840
It’s too hard.

603
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,200
He thought I was kidding before.

604
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,520
He took it as a trick.

605
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,320
Now I will make it clear with him

606
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,240
that I am serious.

607
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,280
I’d see what he wants.

608
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:43,700
Mi Ka.

609
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,840
You were transferred to ER
after making a mistake.

610
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,760
He transferred you back
once there is a chance.

611
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,320
If it’s not for you,

612
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,000
Ye Xiaoman wouldn’t have the chance

613
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,360
to go abroad.

614
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,840
You can go to his house

615
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,800
and learn with his friends.

616
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,520
You can go out for a trip together.

617
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,040
Don’t you think he’s

618
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,960
different to you?

619
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,560
A man treats a woman

620
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,640
like this unconditionally.

621
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,920
How could you not know?

622
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,280
Hello.

623
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,880
Did you hear me?

624
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,640
Yes. Yes.

625
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,960
I think it’s great.

626
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,000
So you agree me

627
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:18,920
to explain it clearly to him,

628
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,800
right?

629
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,400
Do you have to make it clear?

630
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,040
I think I’d better make it clear.

631
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,640
If I keep it all inside

632
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,480
and ponder it over,

633
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,690
it’s really hard.

634
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:30,880
OK.

635
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,800
That’s it.

636
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,760
OK.

637
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,960
That’s it.

638
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,240
I’m hanging up.

639
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,440
Bye-bye.

640
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,120
Should I make it clear

641
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,840
to Mr. Shao, too?

642
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:58,260
(Outpatient)

643
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,320
Doctor.

644
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,080
My county’s doctor told me

645
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,280
the tumor may be malignant.

646
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,560
What should I do?

647
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,680
Mi Ka.

648
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:09,960
This CT

649
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,600
shows

650
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,760
low density place-holding plot area
in the brain.

651
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,320
It’s thought to be glioma.

652
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,170
But I think it needs

653
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:16,870
further confirmation

654
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:17,970
by MRI.

655
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,920
Have you had a tooth extraction lately?

656
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,480
Yes.

657
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,240
I also had a fever.

658
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,560
Fever?

659
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,720
Maybe it’s brain abscess.

660
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,040
You don’t need to have too much
psychological burden.

661
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,800
We will see after

662
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,560
the MRI.

663
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,840
OK.

664
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,320
Please pay the fees on the ground floor.

665
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,360
I will help you make an appointment
on tomorrow afternoon

666
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,360
for MRI at five o’clock.

667
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,880
After you come tomorrow,

668
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:41,880
go to building number seven

669
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,840
beside the Outpatient directly.

670
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,040
Give them the appointment sheet

671
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,120
and wait.

672
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,000
OK.

673
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,400
Thank you, doctor.

674
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:48,720
OK.

675
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,000
Don’t think too much. It’s OK.

676
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,320
OK.

677
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,800
The last one, right?

678
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,960
It’s the last one.

679
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,440
You are so patient.

680
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,320
You even told him

681
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,000
everything about paying and appointment.

682
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,720
It’s just a lift of the finger.

683
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,400
Then the patient

684
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,480
doesn’t need to turn from side to side.

685
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,400
OK. I will be there right now.

686
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,120
Finish it.

687
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,800
Hello, Mr. Shao.

688
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:41,700
Mr. Shao.

689
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,000
I’d like to talk to you.

690
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,160
Go ahead.

691
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,800
I heard some gossips

692
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,080
recently.

693
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,000
It’s mainly because

694
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:49,960
I know the relationship

695
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,120
between you and Keyao.

696
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,520
I don’t care about it.

697
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,480
But I’m afraid it will affect

698
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,760
your relationship.

699
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,320
I know what you want to say.

700
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,800
I also want to say something to you.

701
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:01,880
OK.

702
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,600
On the way

703
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,480
to one’s growth,

704
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,200
there must be someone

705
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,080
who is unwilling to see you

706
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,280
making achievements

707
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,200
through your efforts.

708
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,480
What is the reason?

709
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,720
Because they don’t work harder than you.

710
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,960
They are unable to stand your success.

711
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,200
They surmise something bad of you

712
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,840
to make them feel balance

713
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,760
about something grey

714
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,560
in their mind.

715
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,600
For everything like this,

716
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,880
do you know what the best way is?

717
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,280
Don’t regard yourself as an outsider.

718
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,480
OK.

719
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,080
I see.

720
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,400
Since you see,

721
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,640
focus your time and energy

722
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,400
on the right things.

723
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,320
For example…

724
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,440
The paper.

725
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,800
No, I just want to

726
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,800
help you and Keyao.

727
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,800
No, thanks.

728
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,720
Look.

729
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,080
You are at different age from me.

730
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,360
You are at different age from Keyao.

731
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,920
But we are almost at the same age.

732
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,640
So we have our own way

733
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,600
to solve the matters

734
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,400
between us.

735
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,320
We don’t need others to help.

736
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,600
OK.

737
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,080
We’ve checked your eyes.

738
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,520
All functions are normal.

739
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,800
Your view narrows down.

740
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,560
It has nothing to do

741
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,720
with your eyes.

742
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,760
Not with my eyes?

743
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,120
Then what?

744
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,640
I doubt it’s with the brain.

745
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,520
I advise you to make an appointment
of Neurosurgery

746
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,840
for a head CT.

747
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,320
It won’t be a big problem, right?

748
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,760
I can’t answer you that question.

749
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,120
Brain of mankind

750
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,160
is very complicated.

751
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,720
There might be big or small problems.

752
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,720
You’d better make a definite diagnosis.

753
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,280
Hello.

754
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,520
Mi Ka, Mr. Zhang wants you.

755
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:35,880
OK.

756
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,320
How is your training today?

757
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,920
As usual.

758
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,800
What’s wrong with you?

759
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,000
Nothing.

760
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,040
It’s almost 22 o’clock.

761
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,840
I can’t speak too much.

762
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,440
I have to hurry to finish the paper.

763
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,840
Maybe I can’t have video calls

764
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,240
with you in the coming days.

765
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,520
It’s in a hurry.

766
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,040
OK.

767
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,320
Don’t have too hard training.

768
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,600
Take care of yourself.

769
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,120
I see. Don’t worry.

770
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,760
One more thing,

771
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,630
I feel like

772
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,190
I saw a person in the hospital

773
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,190
like you very much.

774
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,710
Maybe you missed me too much,

775
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,280
so you felt others are like me.

776
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,480
Don’t make yourself up.

777
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,880
I will continue my paper.

778
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,230
You’d better go to bed early.

779
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,760
Good night.

780
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:48,750
Zhang Yang.

781
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:49,600
I checked the skull base of the patient.

782
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,480
Later, we…

783
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:54,620
Mr. Shao.

784
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,710
You had two operations yesterday.

785
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,000
And today you’ll have another one.

786
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,000
So I particularly bought you

787
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,240
Coffee and breakfast.

788
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,600
No sugar for the coffee.

789
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,520
Thank you. I already had breakfast.

790
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,800
Then I won’t disturb you.

791
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,560
Actually you are very talented.

792
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,080
But as a doctor,

793
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,040
if you want to gain acceptance,

794
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,120
you need to make enhancement

795
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,520
in your professional skill.

796
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,520
First it’s professional skill

797
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,120
and then it’s benevolent mind.

798
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,520
But in my opinion,

799
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,640
the latter is more important.

800
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,600
Mr. Shao, I…

801
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,240
Did I do something wrong?

802
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:24,880
You are too easy

803
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,160
to be affected by meaningless things.

804
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:26,960
And then you bring affect

805
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,400
on others around you.

806
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,200
Do you understand?

807
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,560
Mr. Shao, you want me?

808
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,080
Thank you for reminding, Mr. Shao.

809
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,240
It’s about the operation.

810
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:44,020
(In Operation)

811
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,880
A patient of moyamoya disease

812
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,480
has the symptom of cerebral infarction

813
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,960
by large vessel occlusion at skull base.

814
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,000
First,

815
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,960
separate superficial temporal artery.

816
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,680
Then it’s vascular bypass

817
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:55,840
of superficial temporal artery and

818
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,080
section M4 of middle cerebral artery.

819
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,680
Meanwhile,

820
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,920
stick temporal muscle
onto the brain surface.

821
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,000
Zhang Yang.

822
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:04,760
Yes.

823
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,560
Change the place with Yanshan.

824
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,280
Yes.

825
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,360
Xu Yanshan.

826
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,000
You can observe it clearly

827
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,560
with the help of the microscope.

828
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,960
When you watch it clearly,

829
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,760
you should also remember it clearly.

830
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,760
You will operate it by yourself

831
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,360
sooner or later.

832
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,320
Yes.

833
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,440
Come here.

834
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,200
Sew it.

835
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,320
Now you are seeing

836
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,320
the first stitch of

837
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:33,860
vascular bypass sewing.

838
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,040
The first stitch

839
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,200
is very

840
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,880
important.

841
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,360
Because it’s easy to cause avulsion.

842
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,760
Don’t move.

843
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,840
I just wanted to see it clearly.

844
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:56,720
Mi Ka.

845
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,280
You go to watch it.

846
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,480
OK.

847
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,600
Don’t touch the microscope.

848
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,280
Yes.

849
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,600
Are you alright?

850
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,200
I’ll continue my paper now.

851
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,920
You are working so hard.

852
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:39,950
Mr. Zhang.

853
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,360
Would you mind giving some advice?

854
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,200
Sure.

855
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,680
-Come on. Please sit.
-OK.

856
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,560
Great, Mi Ka.

857
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,040
Your perspective to study

858
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,280
is very instructive.

859
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,320
You’ve made a progress.

860
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,440
Really?

861
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,280
Yes.

862
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,360
I’ve always had no confidence

863
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,240
in my own

864
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,960
academic level.

865
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,000
Anyway, the experimental data

866
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:04,960
is very important.

867
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,560
Or it’s hard to support your argument.

868
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,000
And it’ll be easily questioned.

869
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,120
I recorded

870
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,160
all the data

871
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,120
during my experiment.

872
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:11,920
I also referred to

873
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,240
many foreign articles.

874
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,840
It’s been sorted for months.

875
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,240
Then that won’t be a problem.

876
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,840
I think highly of you.

877
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,200
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

878
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,960
Yan… Yanshan.

879
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,400
The best way to comfort

880
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,880
is letting her stay quietly.

881
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,160
Xu Yanshan.

882
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,000
Trust yourself.

883
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,240
You’ve made great efforts.

884
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,480
By no means will you lose out to Mi Ka.

885
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,320
Mr. Zhang.

886
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,040
A patient’s relative

887
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:51,760
fell down and convulsed suddenly,

888
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,760
foaming at the mouth.

889
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,360
I will take a look.

890
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,840
I will go with you.

891
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,240
Great, Mi Ka.

892
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,240
Your perspective to study

893
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,440
is very instructive.

894
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,640
Really?

895
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,720
Anyway, the experimental data

896
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,580
is very important.

898
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,440
Or it’s hard to support your argument.

899
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,680
And it’ll be easily questioned.

900
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,600
I recorded

901
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,600
all the data

902
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,720

903
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,600

00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,120
Isn’t Mi Ka here?

911
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,920
No.

912
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,000
Mr. Shao wants her.

913
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:05,790
Ask her to go to the office

914
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:06,840
after she gets back.

915
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,480
OK.

916
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,600
Are you OK, Dr. Xu?

917
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:13,880
I…

918
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,120
I’m fine.

919
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,520
You don’t look well.

920
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,520
It’s probably because
I didn’t sleep well last night.

921
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,600
Please remember to tell her.

922
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,800
OK.

Uh.

932
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:31,120
The experimental data is lost.

933
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,520
You must store it in the wrong place.

934
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,200
Check carefully.

935
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,090
It’s impossible.

936
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:35,760
I opened it this morning.

937
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,170

No.

941

00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,160
I only copied the paper.

943

Yanshan.

944
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,560
After Mi Ka went out,

945
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,640
did you come back to the office?

946
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,520
No, I didn’t.

947
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,720
I went to submit the paper just now.

948
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:56,880
What’s wrong?

949
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,360
Anything lost?

950
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,280
The experimental data was lost.

951
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:01,970
How could it happen?

952
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,680
Didn’t you copy it?

953
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,080
Yanshan.

954
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,840
The patient of bed eight
has increased intracranial pressure.

00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,440
OK.

958

965
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:43,840

place-holding pathology.

967
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,000
According to your symptom,

968
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,480
and the result of hormone check,

969
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,560
we think it’s pituitary tumor.
