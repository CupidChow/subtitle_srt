00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,960
What are you looking at?

21
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,040
A video of intracranial abscess surgery.

22
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,600
Xu Yanshan’s mother

23
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,600
is having surgery tomorrow.

24
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,560
I will be Dr. Wang’s assistant.

25
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,640
Is she okay with that?

26
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,280
It’s the basic quality

27
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,640
of every doctor

28
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,800
to treat patients equally.

29
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,720
She should at least

30
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,320
have some faith in me.

31
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,240
Your hand...

32
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,910
How did you injure your hand again?

33
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,120
I cut myself during training.

34
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,080
It’s just a minor injury.

35
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,440
A minor injury again?

36
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,920
You call every injury a minor injury.

37
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,160
But it has never been a minor one.

38
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,640
Worry about me?

39
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,400
I worry about you.

40
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,560
You are the captain
of the Tiger Assault Team.

41
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,880
Your health

42
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,440
concerns everyone’s safety.

43
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,000
It’s not that serious.

44
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,440
It is that serious.

45
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,120
Think about it.

46
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,320
When I was holding a grenade in my hand,

47
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,880
you were the only person

48
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,520
I can trust.

49
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,560
I basically

50
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,280
entrusted my life to you.

51
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,160
Captain Xing.

52
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,440
You have a great responsibility.

53
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,080
For those who might

54
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,720
entrust their lives to you

55
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,520
just like I did,

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,560
you have to protect yourself.

57
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,120
Don’t get hurt again.

58
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,280
What’s more,

59
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,760
when you told me

60
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,000
you are a cop,

61
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,120
I didn’t

62
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,640
feel that scared anymore.

63
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,600
And I thought

64
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,720
you are really handsome.

65
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,000
It’s a compliment.

66
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,280
I am handsome.

67
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,560
All right.

68
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,480
It’s cold outside. Just stay inside.

69
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,440
Well,

70
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,160
let me know when you
get back to the dorm.

71
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,200
Good luck with

72
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,320
your surgery tomorrow.

73
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,600
I’m leaving.

74
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,680
Good night.

75
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,520
Captain Hao, it’s me.

76
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,480
Something goes wrong with my body.

77
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,400
I don’t think

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,320
I can join the combat.

79
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,960
Do you have time tomorrow afternoon?

80
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,200
I want to talk to you.

81
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,560
Okay.

82
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,000
Mom, don’t be afraid.

83
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,120
Just get a sleep
and you will be all right.

84
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,080
I think you are more nervous than I’m.

85
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,960
-I’m not.
-Dr. Xu.

86
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,280
We are going to take the patient inside

87
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,480
for anesthesia.

88
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,400
Okay.

89
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,000
I’ll leave my mother to you.

90
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,320
Rest assured.

91
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,840
Auntie will be all right.

92
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,040
I...

93
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,880
How about

94
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,280
we go to the popular cafe

95
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,600
when you have time?

96
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,960
Okay.

97
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,460
(Neurosurgery)

99
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,120
Xiaoxiao. Xiaoxiao.

100
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,440
Dr. Wang asked you to go there.

101
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,280
Okay.

102
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,260
(Xing Kelei: Do you have time
this noon?)

103
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:21,260
(I have something to tell you.)

104
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,260
(I’ll wait for you in the lobby
of the hospital.)

105
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,260
(Mi Ka: I have an operation
this morning.)

106
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,940
(It might take some time.
Is 2:00 PM okay?)

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Mi Ka.

108
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,720
I just met Captain Xing.

109
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,760
He is at Neurosurgery Outpatient.

110
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,000
Does any of his

111
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,040
team members feel uncomfortable again

112
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,680
and he accompanies him to see a doctor?

113
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,880
He didn’t mention it.

114
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,640
Okay.

115
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,120
I’ll go to send this first.

116
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:14,700
(Visitor Waiting Area)

117
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,040
The patient has been anesthetized.

118
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,160
Vital signs are normal.

119
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,360
Okay, let’s start.

120
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,560
Mi Ka, you’ll perform the operation.

121
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,400
I’ll supervise you.

122
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:44,870
Okay.

123
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,440
The patient has two abscess cavities

124
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,840
that are at some distance
from each other.

125
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,720
So let’s try to

126
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,560
remove these two lesions

127
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,920
with a bone window.

128
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,880
Use the milling cutter

129
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,040
to mill her bone flap first.

130
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:02,880
Milling cutter.

131
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:07,920
Attention.

132
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,320
Seal the border of the skull base

133
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
and endocranium with bone wax.

134
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,520
Open it after hanging the endocranium.

135
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,640
Be careful to protect the brain tissue.

136
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:50,800
Move! Move!

137
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,680
What’s the situation?

138
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,920
A three-vehicle collision.

139
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,280
What are the body temperature
and the blood pressure?

140
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,240
The body temperature is 36.

141
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,280
The blood pressure is 90 and 60.

142
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,960
It’s kind of serious.

143
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,920
Take the patient to the Emergency Room.

144
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,880
Okay, hurry up.

145
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,720
Move!

146
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:13,980
(Neurosurgery Operating Room)

147
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,360
Dr. Wang.

148
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,800
There is a victim of a car accident

149
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,600
in the Emergency Room who suffers
severe cerebral hemorrhage.

150
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,840
They need you to take a look there.

151
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,520
I’ll go to check it.

152
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,600
Mi Ka, go on.

153
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,360
Okay.

154
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,560
Jia Li, supervise her.

155
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,120
Notify me immediately
if there is any problem.

156
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,240
Yes.

157
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,240
The bleeding is increasing.

158
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,800
There is too much bleeding.

159
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,040
I can’t find the bleeding point.

160
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,680
Stay calm.

161
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,920
Watch carefully and suck the blood.

162
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,200
Use one more suction apparatus.

163
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,920
The patient’s blood pressure
begins to drop.

164
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,640
Her cerebellum is a little swollen.

165
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,200
It might affect the brain stem.

166
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,040
It’s dangerous.

167
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,240
Try to enlarge the bone window
to reduce pressure

168
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,440
and reveal the bleeding point
at the same time.

169
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,480
I found the bleeding point.

170
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,560
The gap is too big.

171
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,080
Electrocoagulation can’t stop it.

172
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,640
The blood pressure dropped to 70.

173
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,840
Give me a temporary aneurysm clip.

174
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,640
What’s the patient’s blood pressure now?

175
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,200
The blood pressure is 90.

176
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,160
Mi Ka.

177
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,640
You did a good job just now.

178
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,240
The most important thing is not to panic

179
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,520
when you encountered danger
during the operation.

180
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,440
The patient can be saved

181
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,520
only when the doctor doesn’t panic.

182
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,280
Yes.

183
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,880
But it’s mainly

184
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,680
because of Mr. Jia’s guidance.

185
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,760
Not at all.

186
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,840
I have said no more than

187
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,720
three sentences in total.

188
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,760
Well,

189
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,200
I have something else to do.
I should leave.

190
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:16,920
Okay.

191
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,160
Goodbye.

192
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,640
Don’t worry,
the operation was successful.

193
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,400
Thank you, Dr. Wang.

194
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,600
You should thank

195
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,320
Mi Ka and Dr. Jia.

196
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,520
They handled

197
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,400
the crisis with calm.

198
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,600
Where’s Mi Ka?

199
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,440
She got something to do and she left.

200
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,640
I just finished the operation.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

201
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,680
It’s okay.

202
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,080
Whose medical history is that?

203
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,680
Didn’t I tell you

204
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,640
that my friend gets

205
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,440
an adenoma of the pituitary gland?

206
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,680
Actually,

207
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,360
it’s me.

208
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,440
What’s your plan now?

209
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,840
I just made an appointment
with an expert this afternoon.

210
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,600
I want to see the doctor first.

211
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,400
Why haven’t you told me till now?

212
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,920
I also need some time

213
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,800
to accept it.

214
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,720
If you tell me,

215
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,280
we can take it together

216
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,640
and figure it out together.

217
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,800
You are already stressed.

218
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,440
I don’t want to cause you any trouble.

219
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,760
I am your girlfriend.

220
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,160
We’ve been through

221
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,720
so many things together.

222
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,640
Why didn’t you tell me

223
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,040
such an important thing?

224
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,400
No matter how strong

225
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,760
and how powerful you are out there,

226
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,400
I don’t care that much.

227
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,560
I want you to be totally real

228
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,920
in front of me.

229
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,480
Even it’s your most vulnerable side,

230
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,600
I can accept it.

231
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,880
I’m willing to be there for you.

232
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,640
Alright?

233
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,400
You also said

234
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,800
it’s not a big problem.

235
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,680
Whether it’s a big problem or not,

236
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,680
you are the one who gets it.

237
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,360
Did you tell Keyao?

238
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,360
Not yet.

239
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,880
I haven’t figured out

240
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,200
how to tell her about it.

241
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:34,960
I also think

242
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:35,840
you need a craniotomy

243
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,080
as soon as possible.

244
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,800
How long will it take
for him to recover?

245
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,080
It depends on the individual situation.

246
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,160
This kind of surgery

247
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,160
is not difficult for us.

248
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,080
But a craniotomy is always risky,

249
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,720
especially considering

250
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,320
the job of Captain Xing.

251
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,640
What about the minimally
invasive surgery?

252
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,360
Didn’t many patients

253
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,960
have minimally invasive surgery
in such cases?

254
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,840
The location of his tumor is not good.

255
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,240
The tumor is relatively large.

256
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,440
The difficulty of a minimally
invasive surgery

257
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,520
is much bigger than a craniotomy.

258
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,280
And it’s hard to cut the tumor clean.

259
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,800
Yes,

260
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,480
it takes less time to recover from
a minimally invasive surgery.

261
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,040
But if anything goes wrong
during the operation,

262
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,400
it would be the opposite to
what you want.

263
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,880
Well,

264
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,440
I’ll do the craniotomy.

265
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,360
How soon can we do it?

266
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,080
Let me see.

267
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,520
Next week.

268
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,760
Okay, next week is fine.

269
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,400
Have you really decided?

270
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,280
My physical condition

271
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,640
has totally affected my work.

272
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,400
Besides,

273
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,480
what’s more important than my health

274
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,280
is my responsibility.

275
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,720
I should be responsible to my teammates

276
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,120
and to the people.

277
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,520
I can’t work

278
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,000
no matter what.

279
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,160
I’d better face it.

280
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,840
No matter what happens,

281
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,200
I’m here with you.

282
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,480
If you are not here with me,

283
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,960
where else do you want to do?

284
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,360
Here.

285
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,880
It’s delicious.

286
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,200
Sorry.

287
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,360
It’s okay, put it down.

288
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,760
I’ll go to the restroom

289
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,440
and clean it.

290
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,560
Sit down.

291
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:59,680
Have a seat.

292
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,160
I mean,

293
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,600
if someone else stains his clothes,

294
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,240
would he still be that calm?

295
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:06,760
It must be a torment

296
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,830
for a neat person like him.

297
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,310
Why don’t you try it next time?

298
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,200
No need.

299
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,920
I have an unquenchable thirst for life.

300
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,240
Your breakfast.

301
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,280
Here is your breakfast.

302
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:18,640
Thank you.

303
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,480
You know what,

304
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,400
I’ve always had a question.

305
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,440
But I don’t know if I should ask it.

306
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,560
If I say you shouldn’t,

307
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,120
will you not ask it?

308
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,560
No.

309
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,400
That’s it.

310
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,360
I mean,

311
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,840
how did you get Shao Yuhan?

312
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,440
Who told you that I was
the one who chased him?

313
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,160
That’s what everyone said in school.

314
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:48,920
They said

315
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,600
that you chased him

316
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,160
to the elevator.

317
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,480
Wait!

318
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,840
Shao!

319
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,200
I...

320
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,280
I want to tell you

321
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,600
about changing

322
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,560
the surgical records.

323
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,200
Are you talking to me?

324
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,440
Change what?

325
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,760
Rena.

326
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:00,800
How are you doing?

327
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,880
A lot of work. Exhausted.

328
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,240
What are you doing today?

329
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:04,800
I’m not sure.

330
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,400
These stuffs.

331
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,720
Maybe grab a cup of coffee later.

332
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,000
Okay then, call me.

333
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,040
-Okay.
-Okay. Rena.

334
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,000
Okay.

335
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,200
-Bye.

336
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,480
What did you just say
about changing something?

337
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,240
The hematoma range
and the description of

338
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,520
the bleeding point I recorded

339
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,520
are not very clear.

340
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,920
I want to change it.

341
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,200
That’s why you got yourself
panting like this?

342
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,640
Just to tell me about that?

343
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,680
Although it is a

344
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,720
simulated surgical drape,

345
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,600
I still want to be precise.

346
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,840
And also,

347
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,280
it was my fault

348
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,400
that I accidentally

349
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,760
spilled coffee on you.

350
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:38,720
But you can’t

351
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,760
stop me from changing it

352
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,280
for that reason.

353
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,840
What’s your name?

354
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:43,960
Tracy.

355
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,440
Xing Keyao.

356
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,840
Put it on my desk on time

357
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,720
tomorrow morning.

358
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,520
And also,

359
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,600
you spilled coffee on me.

360
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,200
Remember to buy another one for me.

361
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,760
What’s wrong?

362
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,680
It seems that this question
is difficult to answer.

363
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,400
What question is difficult to answer?

364
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,080
A question that doesn’t
need to be answered.

365
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,480
Got it.

366
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,440
Refusing to answer means
a guilty conscience.

367
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,440
A guilty conscience means a tacit yes.

368
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,040
What were you two talking about?

369
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,640
-Nothing.

370
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,880
By the way,

371
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,320
there is an activity

372
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,520
of visiting the organic farm
this afternoon.

373
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,360
Do you want to go together?

374
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,240
This afternoon...

375
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,320
Come on, what’s the silence about?

376
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,040
Are you going or not?

377
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,080
Anything is okay.

378
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,920
I’m up for anything.

379
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,120
Anything is okay for you.

380
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,320
And you are up for anything.

381
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,000
So you are going.

382
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,960
Just keep it simple

383
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,720
and tell me you can go.

384
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,440
You two can really drag your feet.

385
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,640
Let’s meet this afternoon

386
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,760
in front of the hotel.

387
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,960
Okay.

388
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,200
Have the porridge.

389
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,720
How are you doing now?

390
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,720
It’s okay.

391
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,280
You asked for a leave

392
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,200
last time because of

393
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,000
the tumor in your brain?

394
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:16,960
Yes.

395
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,360
I’m here today

396
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,200
to tell you about it.

397
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,400
I want to quit the combat

398
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,000
and do logistics.

399
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,720
Have you figured it out?

400
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,520
The disease I have

401
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,920
will affect my vision.

402
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,640
I can’t affect the whole team

403
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,040
just because of me.

404
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,720
Who do you think

405
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,680
is suitable

406
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,720
to take your place?

407
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,880
Wenbo and Wenjing

408
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,520
work well together.

409
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,880
I think they are perfectly qualified

410
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,320
for the sniper project.

411
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,760
As for the new off-road motorcycle,

412
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,360
Wenbo has been practicing it
for a long time.

413
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,160
If it’s a manhunt in complex terrain,

414
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,040
Luo Ting is the best for it.

415
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,560
Okay.

416
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,880
I’ll do it as you said.

417
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,160
Wenjing will start to get trained

418
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,400
for the shooting project
you joined before

419
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,360
as your substitute.

420
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,720
Substitute?

421
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,640
Captain Hao, I...

422
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,400
Kelei.

423
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,920
You are the best

424
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,000
trainee I’ve ever coached.

425
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:20,880
I know

426
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,600
you would never give up

427
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,360
until the last moment.

428
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,640
Me too.

429
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,800
As for whether to replace you or not,

430
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,800
we will make a decision

431
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,400
based on your physical condition

432
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,840
after the operation.

433
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,640
Okay.

434
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:17,840
Captain Xing.

435
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,040
You are off today.

436
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,560
Why are you here to get trained?

437
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,360
Captain Xing.

438
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,360
We will stay with you today.

439
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,760
We will practice as long as you do.

440
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,640
We all know

441
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,200
your condition.

442
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,400
We all want to be with you.

443
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,280
We don’t know what to do

444
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,800
except to stay with you.

445
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,240
Captain Xing.

446
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,240
What are we going to practice next?

447
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,000
You are finally off.

448
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,080
Have some rest.

449
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,400
We...

450
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,440
We can stay...

451
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,680
This is an order.

452
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,120
Everyone, stand up.

453
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,920
Never mind, let’s leave him alone
for a while.

454
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,760
Left turn!

455
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,120
Lockstep marching!

456
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,280
Hello, Mi Ka.

457
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,760
What’s the matter?

458
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,040
Xing Kelei has a pituitary adenoma

459
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,440
in his brain

460
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,760
which is pressing against
his optic nerve.

461
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,600
The doctor recommended
surgery as soon as possible.

462
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,720
I see.

463
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,840
Dr. Shao.

464
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,840
How are you going to thank me?

465
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,080
Why should I thank you?

466
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,000
You know why.

467
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,000
If I didn’t bring up with the activity,

468
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,440
how could you ask her out?

469
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,280
Mind your own business first

470
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,720
and find a girlfriend.

471
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,040
You are...

472
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,120
Really...

473
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,520
She is here.

474
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,200
Well...

475
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,640
What’s wrong?

476
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,640
Mi Ka called me

477
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,920
and said that they found

478
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,240
a pituitary adenoma in Kelei’s brain.

479
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,280
We can’t make it clear over the phone.

480
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,800
I’m not going with you this afternoon.

481
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,800
I’ve booked

482
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,000
the latest flight to go back.

483
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,280
I have an important meeting

484
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,240
tomorrow.

485
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,960
I can’t go back with you.

486
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,400
Well, don’t worry.

487
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,240
Send me all his

488
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,120
examination results and reports

489
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,040
when you get back.

490
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:53,960
I’ll take a look.

491
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,440
Thank you.

492
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,400
Go up and pack your stuff.

493
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,160
I’ll wait for you in the lobby

494
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,480
and take you to the airport.

495
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,720
Okay.

496
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,040
Well...

497
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,560
Forget about me.

498
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,920
Go ahead and do what you need to do.

499
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:04,960
I’ll take care of myself.

500
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,320
No one is worried about you.

501
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,520
Bye.

502
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,080
Goodbye.

503
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,960
This is the menu.

504
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,880
Well, are you stalking me?

505
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,680
I’ve known you for years.

506
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,840
Do I need to stalk you?

507
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,800
You would come here

508
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,680
when you feel down.

509
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,040
-Two bowls of beef noodles!

510
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,160
Okay.

511
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,600
I remember it was Lu Feng

512
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,960
who found this restaurant.

513
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,880
We used to come here to have noodles

514
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,720
every time we got punished
during training

515
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,320
when we were young.

516
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,320
We were naughty at that time

517
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,400
and we did need some lessons.

518
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,680
I remember it was

519
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,600
Captain Shen who coached us.

520
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,840
Yeah.

521
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,200
What’s that look?

522
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,880
Why do I think you need a lesson?

523
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,560
What’s wrong with my...

524
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,520
Don’t implicate me if you feel itchy.

525
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:16,790
I...

526
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,600
-I...
-Don’t mess with Captain Hao.

527
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,720
Do I have a problem?

528
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,520
We will be brothers

529
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,240
for a lifetime.

530
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,680
Here are your noodles.

531
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,400
Thank you.

532
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,880
Madam, another bowl of
beef noodles here.

533
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,960
Okay.

534
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,280
I’m starved.

535
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,360
Speak of the devil.

536
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,520
Aren’t you supposed to be in Thailand?

537
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,760
Don’t you know there is

538
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,880
a means of transportation called plane?

539
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,640
It takes only a few hours to come back.

540
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:46,920
I bought a ticket tonight

541
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,480
to fly back.

542
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,160
Just for a bowl of noodles?

543
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,320
How expensive the noodles are?

544
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,680
It’s because of you.

545
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I was wondering why you were
weird that day.

546
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,200
Why didn’t you tell us?

547
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,440
You can’t carry it on your own,

548
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,080
can’t the three of us

549
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:02,960
carry it together?

550
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,840
Your noodles.

551
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,240
Do you remember

552
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,000
that whoever lost during the training

553
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,200
would pay the meal?

554
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,040
I never paid for it anyway.

555
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,720
I remember it was you all the time.

556
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,880
He also paid before.

557
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,520
I was having a fever.

558
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,640
Otherwise how could I lose to you
with short legs?

559
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,400
Whose legs are short?

560
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,560
Don’t you insult me.

561
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:27,780
When I first

562
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,440
entered the police academy,

563
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,280
the leader said

564
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,120
that my image is suitable for
undercover work.

565
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,840
Like Chen Yongren in Infernal Affairs.

566
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,720
Who is calling me?

567
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,800
It’s obviously calling me.

568
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,000
You are Liu Jianming.

569
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,840
Here is your song.

570
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,640

like a ghost?

584
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,360
You should tell me
that you would come back.

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,000
Are you going to tell me

586
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,760
when you are

587
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,440
in the ICU?

588
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:40,920
I see.

589
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,120
It’s not a serious illness.

590
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,080
It’s not a big deal.

591
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,320
So I didn’t tell you.

592
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,160
What’s serious?

593
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,720
Is it serious when they ask me
to collect your body?

594
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,240
Can’t you wish me well?

Let me ask you,

596
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,640
if our parents know it,

597
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,880
what should I tell them?

598
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,720
I’m your sister,

599
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,880
but I don’t know anything.

600
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,080
I know you are a tough guy.

601
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,120
You want to handle

602
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,280
everything on your own.

603
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,280
But you are my younger brother.

604
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,000
You will only

605
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,680
make me worry more in this way.

606
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,560
Do you know it?

607
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,160
I know.

608
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,760
Well, it’s just

609
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,840
I have a pituitary adenoma

610
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,160
in my brain.

611
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,080
I do think you have a tumor
in your brain!

612
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,840
You studied medicine.

613
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,560
You know

614
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,520
it’s not a big deal.

615
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,400
So,

616
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,560
don’t worry.

617
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,480
It’s okay.

618
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,560
It’s not a big deal.

619
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,080
I’m not worried.

620
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,840
I’m just angry.

621
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,680
I studied neurosurgery.

622
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,640
Don’t I know it?

623
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,880
Isn’t it just a tumor

624
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,440
in your brain?

625
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,120
It’s a simple surgical procedure.

626
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,840
A really simple one.

627
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,640
Well, are you hungry?

628
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,600
Do you want egg noodles?

629
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,080
Less oil for the luncheon meat.

630
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:07,840
All right.

631
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,240
Are you all right?

632
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,760
I’m fine.

633
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,680
I’ve heard about

634
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,720
Xing Kelei.

635
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:50,920
A pituitary adenoma

636
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:51,760
is not a major operation.

637
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,160
Don’t worry too much about it.

638
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,080
I know it as a doctor.

639
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,640
But as his girlfriend,

640
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,440
it seems impossible not to worry.

641
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,200
But I believe

642
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,280
you can adjust yourself

643
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,400
and accompany him through
this difficult time.

644
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,320
Thank you.

645
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,920
I should thank you

646
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,400
for what you did for my mom

647
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,080
in the operating room.

648
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,960
It’s my duty.

649
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,040
Do you remember

650
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:26,880
the patient with thoracic trauma

651
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,520
when we got stuck in the elevator?

652
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,000
I couldn’t be as brave

653
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,280
as you.

654
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,400
But if you were like me,

655
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,040
maybe my mother

656
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:37,640
would still be

657
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,760
in the ICU.

658
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,320
Thank you for your understanding.

659
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,200
Mi Ka.

660
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,720
I used to take you as my friend

661
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,880
because I think you were inferior to me.

662
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,680
Later I found out

663
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,920
that Dr. Shao thinks highly of you

664
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,320
and it made me really jealous.

665
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,480
Perhaps

666
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,760
that was when

667
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,040
I got on the wrong road.

668
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,000
Yanshan.

669
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,320
You have always been

670
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,880
a quick learner

671
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,880
and also

672
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,320
a professional doctor in my mind.

673
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,560
Mi Ka.

674
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,880
I’m sorry.

675
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,280
I accept your apology.

676
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,040
We are still friends

677
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,080
just like before.

678
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:14,080
I told you that you don’t
need to pick me up.

679
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,560
Well,

680
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,190
you start to dislike me now?

681
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,150
No.

682
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,760
It’s my duty

683
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,080
to serve you well.

684
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,400
But the driver

685
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,520
can’t drive today.

686
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,920
How about we take a taxi?

687
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,440
Let’s take a bus.

688
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,190
There should be empty seats
right now. Okay?

689
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,060
Okay.

690
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:36,660
Let’s go.

691
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,440
Let me do it.

692
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,600
Don’t move.

693
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,640
Stay there

694
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,200
and wait for the food.

695
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,320
It’s rare to

696
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,040
have my sister’s cooking.

697
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,760
Well,

698
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,600
have I ever treated you badly?

699
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,160
When you were young

700
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,280
and no higher than the cooking bench,

701
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,520
wasn’t I cooking for you?

702
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,320
Really?

703
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:28,820
Thank you.

704
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,560
Let’s eat.

705
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,080
You are really my sister.

706
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,640
No meat at all.

707
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,560
You should have more vitamins.

708
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,800
Okay.

709
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,800
Have a taste of my sister’s

710
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,040
excellent scrambled egg with tomatoes.

711
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,120
She is never stingy with eggs.

712
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,120
There are a lot of eggs.

713
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,040
That’s it.

714
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,720
Are you off these days?

715
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,440
I need to go back

716
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,560
and finish the handover.

717
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,200
Hurry up and finish it.

718
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,240
Then take a rest for a few days.

719
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,240
It’s not like that the earth won’t turn

720
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:56,840
without you.

721
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,480
I haven’t had surgery yet.

722
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,640
Why should I rest?

723
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:00,880
I think Keyao

724
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:01,920
is totally right.

725
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,280
You can’t be too tired before surgery.

726
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,080
I happen to have two days off.

727
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,080
Why don’t you

728
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,280
begin your

729
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,560
days off earlier?

730
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:11,560
It has been a long time since we

731
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,280
went out together last time.

732
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,240
We can go shopping

733
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,840
and watch movies together.

734
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:17,960
Aren’t you going to

735
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,640
take the year-end assessment?

736
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,600
How do you have any day off?

737
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,880
I’m all ready.

738
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,480
Well,

739
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,160
I’m going to ski in Canada this winter.

740
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,920
Take Mi Ka to the mall

741
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,680
and buy me the latest

742
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,200
ski suit.

743
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,040
Okay.

744
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,960
You have a room of ski suits

745
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,040
and you haven’t worn them many times.

746
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:41,920
Are you going to buy more?

747
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,400
I want the latest one.

748
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,240
Come on, can you two act normally?

749
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,520
You are making me more nervous.

750
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,000
It’s like something serious
is going to happen.

751
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,440
Don’t talk nonsense.

752
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,680
If you really want to
make me feel better,

753
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,560
you

754
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,240
prepare for the exam.

755
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,680
You

756
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,520
wash your ski suit

757
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,720
and keep wearing it.

758
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,560
Come on, let’s eat.

759
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,400
Have more.

760
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,160
I mean,

761
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,120
I’m being treated too well

762
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,480
-for my illness.
-Have vitamins.

763
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,080
Eat.

764
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,080
Shrimps.

765
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,400
It is too much.

766
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,760
I’m like a lord now.

767
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,720
Come on, massage my legs.

768
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:22,280
Are your legs uncomfortable?

769
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,080
Come on.

770
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,160
Where else?

771
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,440
Here, and here...

772
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,500
-Your shoulders are uncomfortable?
-Yes.

773
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:28,340
-Come on.
-All right.

774
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,400
-Come on.
-Let me give you a massage.

775
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,080
Are you feeling better now?

776
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,280
Are you showing me how tender you are?

777
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,720
Harder. Come on.

778
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,160
I did.

779
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,600
Let me wash the dishes.

780
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,320
No need, go to watch TV.

781
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,360
Let me do it.

782
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:51,920
Where’s Keyao?

783
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,040
She is out.

784
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,440
She wants to give you a chance to show

785
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,960

799
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,240
In fact,

800
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,400
I think he

801
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,360
cares about it a lot.

802
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,240
He just won’t tell me

803
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,240
and won’t express his feelings.

804
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,440
He feels upset inside.

805
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,480
Sometimes

806
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,360
the person who gets sick

807
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,320
is not the one who suffers the most.

808
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,960
The one who suffers the most

809
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,960
is the person who cares about him.

810
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,520
I really hope

811
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,200
I can help him with it

812
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,160
and do something for him.

813
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,160
But later I found out

814
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,680
there is nothing I can do.

815
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,040
Nothing will work.

816
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,640
You can do it.

817
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,160
Didn’t I lose all my hope

818
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,400
at first?

819
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,000
You are the one

820
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,440
who made me stick to it.

821
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,440
You made me believe

822
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,680
that there are miracles.

823
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,360
Whatever you want to do,

824
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,040
you will make it.

825
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:36,820
(Intradural operation)

826
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,240
Thank you.

827
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,880
Dr. Shao?

828
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,160
Aren’t you attending

829
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,400
the academic conference?

830
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,440
Yeah.

831
00:40:59,080 --> 00:40:59,840
But

832
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,480
I can also choose to come back early.

833
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,360
I heard about Xing Kelei.

834
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,040
It’s not

835
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,520
a big operation.

836
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,960
It’s just...

837
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,200
You worry that he can’t

838
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:17,880
go back to the front line

839
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,040
after the surgery, right?

840
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,840
Because

841
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,720
if he has the craniotomy,

842
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,000
it’s very likely that he can’t

843
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,080
do a lot of actions during training.

844
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,840
So you want to

845
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,040
look for more information

846
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,640
and see if he can have

847
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,720
transsphenoidal microsurgery?

848
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,920
Dr. Wang said

849
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,360
that his tumor is big

850
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,840
and its location is not good.

851
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,160
It’s very difficult to do
the transsphenoidal microsurgery

852
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,560
and totally remove the tumor.

853
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,320
But I think I can do it.

854
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,520
Although this operation

855
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,000
is risky and difficult,

856
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,560
I’ve read all his reports.

857
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,120
I can try it.

858
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,480
Thank you, Dr. Shao.

859
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,840
I am a doctor.

860
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,000
What’s wrong?

861
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,400
We have talked about it

862
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,960
and figured out a plan.

863
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,040
Dr. Shao said he can do

864
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,720
the transsphenoidal microsurgery
for you.

865
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,400
It would take less time
to recover from it

866
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,880
and the incision would be smaller.

867
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,160
Maybe you can still join

868
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,400
the combat.

869
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,240
That’s why you want to see me so late?

870
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,760
Yes.

871
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,840
I know you care about it.

872
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,160
You just pretend not to care.

873
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,160
Your tumor is big
and its location is not good.

874
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,480
Actually, there is

875
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,160
a certain risk

876
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,680
of having the
transsphenoidal microsurgery.

877
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,400
But Dr. Shao said

878
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,640
he has confidence in

879
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,400
minimizing the risk.

880
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,680
A craniotomy is safer.

881
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,320
But it takes less time

882
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,320
to recover from microsurgery.

883
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,480
I’ll let you

884
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,320
decide

885
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,600
on your own.

886
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,200
I’ll support you

887
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,840
