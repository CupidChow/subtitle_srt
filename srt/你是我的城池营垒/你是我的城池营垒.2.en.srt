1
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:52,120
=You Are My Glory=

2
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,159
=Episode 2=

3
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:12,120
Yu Tu, you're such a kill stealer.

4
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,760
Yu Tu, you handle Zhuge Liang
quite well.

5
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,879
Why have I not seen
you playing this character before?

6
00:02:16,839 --> 00:02:18,639
Zhai Liang fights
to be the Mage every time.

7
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,879
He's good enough for that.

8
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:21,720
This is normal.

9
00:02:22,839 --> 00:02:24,440
Do you really have to do this?

10
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:28,440
I think,

11
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:29,800
from now on,

12
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,240
the Mage belongs to Yu Tu.

13
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,399
Zhai Liang, don't fight for it anymore.

14
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:36,080
I disagree.

15
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,080
Zhai Liang is a bad Marksmen.

16
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,720
At least, he's a mediocre Mage.

17
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:44,160
Go away.

18
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,279
I'm still farming.

19
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,039
Cai Wenji,

20
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:47,279
when you enter the bush later,

21
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:48,320
give me a good View.

22
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,720
I'm going to take my time farming.

23
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,880
Which bush?

24
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,800
A girl?

25
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,800
She's a girl?

26
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,240
Could Yu Tu

27
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,000
have recognized my voice?

28
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,440
Miss.

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,520
Yes.

30
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,240
40% of the players of this game

31
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,440
are female.

32
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,399
I've memorized...

33
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,720
I've seen the data before.

34
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:11,559
But, Yu Tu.

35
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:12,800
the ladies repellent,

36
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,639
invited you here.

37
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:15,960
Yu Tu,

38
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:18,440
do you really not know this lady?

39
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,759
I hope he has forgotten about me.

40
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,279
Isn't she the one on QQ?

41
00:03:23,279 --> 00:03:24,679
You add a stranger on your QQ?

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,520
That...

43
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,559
The bush you were talking about.

44
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:29,720
Is it the bush up there?

45
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:30,880
Yes, it's the one.

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Why should I hide there?

47
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,839
You can see
if our enemy is surrounding us.

48
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:35,520
If you see them, give us a heads up.

49
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,199
Okay.

50
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,080
As expected,
he didn't recognize my voice.

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,559
Cai Wenji, what are you doing?

52
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,039
Cai Wenji.

53
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:11,199
You'd better follow the Mage.

54
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,600
I'll farm on my own for now.

55
00:04:13,839 --> 00:04:14,520
Yu Tu,

56
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,759
the one who invited her
should be responsible for her too.

57
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:17,759
Sure.

58
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,559
A terrible Marksmen like you

59
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,199
isn't worth being protected.

60
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,200
Only when you have the situation
well in hand,

61
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,480
can you gain a decisive victory
a thousand miles away.

62
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:49,399
This is the God's will.

63
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,399
Go, go, go.

64
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,920
We won another round.

65
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:21,760
Zhuge Liang got 18 kills.

66
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,559
I played quite well too.

67
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,600
Look at how I used Cai Wenji

68
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,079
and got two kills.

69
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,679
Qiao Jingjing,

70
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:42,160
why are you still awake?

71
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,519
How can you be so brazen?

72
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,679
I'm going to sleep now.

73
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,200
Jingjing.

74
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,160
Jingjing.

75
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:20,480
Jingjing.

76
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,239
Purchase all the heroes

77
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:26,959
and skins for me.

78
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:27,720
Okay.

79
00:06:28,359 --> 00:06:28,760
Wait a minute.

80
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,519
Forget it. Buy only the nice ones.

81
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,480
Sure.

82
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:34,920
Okay. Nice.

83
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,640
Nice.

84
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:37,040
That's great.

85
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:37,760
Nice.

86
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,160
Okay.

87
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,040
Jingjing, let's take a break

88
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,799
and get ready for the next scene.

89
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:43,839
Okay.

90
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:48,480
Have you bought it already?

91
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,119
Yes, I have.

92
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,959
I've bought all the nice skins.

93
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,279
I can guarantee that,
from now on,

94
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,559
you'll be the most handsome one
in the valley.

95
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,160
Even if you die in the Valley of Kings,

96
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,279
you'll die
in your most beautiful costumes.

97
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:00,959
That's right.

98
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,040
By the way, Jingjing.

99
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,279
Three persons

100
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:05,920
have become your friends.

101
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:07,920
It's only been one night,

102
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:08,839
and so many people

103
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:09,640
have requested to be your friends.

104
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,320
Each one of them will get two skins.

105
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,000
Then, they'll feel embarrassed

106
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,839
if they don't invite me.

107
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:22,119
Not you.

108
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:27,519
Do you not want me to stay?

109
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,839
It's okay.

110
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,000
Go spend time with your mom.

111
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:30,640
Okay.

112
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:32,119
I'm leaving.

113
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,959
Take a good rest.

114
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,000
Sleep early.

115
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,519
The skin tactic is a success.

116
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:50,559
Miss,

117
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:52,480
you gave me two skins.

118
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,480
Don't get too excited.

119
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,160
I received it too!

120
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,200
Yo, yo!

121
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,480
I got it too.

122
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:02,880
Heroes, please invite me.

123
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:05,799
Of course.

124
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:06,480
I have never received skins

125
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,079
from anyone before,

126
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,720
let alone from a girl.

127
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,799
Miss, don't worry.

128
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,239
Dragon King will lead you.

129
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:14,279
Let's start.

130
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:16,920
Yu Tu.

131
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,359
Why didn't you put on

132
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:19,760
the skin she gave you?

133
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:21,040
I didn't get any.

134
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:24,720
Oops.

135
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,959
Yu Tu.

136
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,679
I didn't expect you

137
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:29,359
to get to the bottom of a girl's list.

138
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,640
Yu Tu, are you betraying me?

139
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,640
Be smart and retreat.

140
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,320
Don't worry.

141
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,480
I've gotten the blue buff.

142
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,559
We won't lose anything

143
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:42,760
this round.

144
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,920
You're still as annoying as always.

145
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,519
Yu Tu,

146
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,480
I invited a friend to join us.

147
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,480
Together with the four of us,

148
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,359
we'll do five-rows tactics.
Are you joining us?

149
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:53,679
Sure.

150
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,280
Miss, after this round,

151
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,400
we'll play the ranking match.

152
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,719
We'll see you tomorrow.

153
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,679
Can't I join you?

154
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:02,919
You won't get any ranking.

155
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,799
You don't have a rank yet, right?

156
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:06,840
Yes.

157
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,599
I have not played
a ranking match before.

158
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:14,599
I got left behind again.

159
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,559
I bought six skins

160
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:18,359
for nothing.

161
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,640
Does she know that

162
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,919
if she doesn't exit the room

163
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:25,799
after the game,

164
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,200
we can hear her speak?

165
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:35,000
Why don't you lead her?

166
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:36,719
I'll invite another person.

167
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,239
After all, you never like playing
the ranking match.

168
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,239
I'm not the one who received her skin.

169
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:42,960
What about this?

170
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,359
If you win a match, then I'll...

171
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:48,559
No.

172
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,960
If you win two matches,

173
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:52,559
I'll handle all the chores today.

174
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:12,880
Yu Tu actually leads me on his own.

175
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,640
He's too handsome.

176
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:01,000
Look at this.

177
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:09,280
You're such a brute.

178
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:10,960
I just got my four stars,

179
00:11:11,479 --> 00:11:12,960
and you have won a dozen of matches.

180
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,640
You'll handle the household chores
for a week.

181
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Qiao Jingjing,

182
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,280
what's wrong with you?

183
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,080
You're turning 30 years old soon,

184
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:35,799
yet

185
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:37,159
you adore a person

186
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:37,840
just because

187
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:39,080
he's good at playing games.

188
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,440
He might be bald,

189
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,640
or obese.

190
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,000
What is there to get excited about?

191
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,239
But, he's really handsome when he plays.

192
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:21,039
How's it going?

193
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,000
Has she made a lot of progress
in the past two days?

194
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:24,039
Of course.

195
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:24,719
Really?

196
00:12:27,119 --> 00:12:28,359
But, frankly,

197
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,520
Jingjing doesn't have much talent

198
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:32,000
in playing games.

199
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,559
But, she has extraordinary willpower.

200
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,239
It's true.

201
00:12:35,239 --> 00:12:36,599
No matter how badly she's defeated,

202
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,000
she only needs
to have a good night sleep,

203
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,760
and she'll regain all her enthusiasm
on the next day.

204
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:43,880
To be fair,

205
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:45,719
not everyone

206
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,760
can be a celebrity.

207
00:12:47,239 --> 00:12:48,080
You need to have

208
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,479
the tenacity.

209
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:50,599
That's enough.

210
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:53,159
Cut straight to the chase.
How's the performance?

211
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,119
It's improved a lot.

212
00:13:00,359 --> 00:13:01,200
When she's at home...

213
00:13:01,359 --> 00:13:02,000
Oh, my God.

214
00:13:04,239 --> 00:13:04,840
What's wrong?

215
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:05,559
I've got to go.

216
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,599
What time is it?

217
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,640
Why are you leaving

218
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,559
earlier and earlier?

219
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:11,640
Practice a little more, please.

220
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,039
I'm going back to train my abs.

221
00:13:19,359 --> 00:13:20,000
Jingjing.

222
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,000
Are you going back

223
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
to play

224
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
with the friends you made the other day?

225
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,119
Then,

226
00:13:24,119 --> 00:13:25,280
why didn't you tell Miss Ling?

227
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:28,520
It's more impressive

228
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,880
if I can turn into a peerless master

229
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,119
overnight.

230
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:41,119
Why did he go offline so soon?

231
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:03,400
Yu Tu.

232
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:04,640
Yu Tu.

233
00:14:06,119 --> 00:14:07,760
Sorry, sorry.

234
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,719
It took me a long time

235
00:14:08,719 --> 00:14:10,000
to deal with the customer

236
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,400
before I finally sent him away.

237
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:12,239
I'm sorry.

238
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:12,760
Here.

239
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,000
Let me take a good look at you.

240
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:16,479
Nice.

241
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,640
You're still so handsome.

242
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:19,599
You're not bald yet.

243
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,520
It seems like you people
who do scientific researches

244
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,719
only work as hard as us

245
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,000
who are in the financial industry.

246
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:25,599
Am I right?

247
00:14:26,719 --> 00:14:27,400
Come. Have a seat.

248
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,400
Don't just stand there.

249
00:14:29,359 --> 00:14:30,239
Why are you drinking plain water?

250
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:31,799
I have some nice tea.

251
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,880
I'll make tea for you.

252
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,400
Wait a minute.

253
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,280
Guess who I met at Wuhan

254
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:39,239
two days ago.

255
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,239
Sandbag

256
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,919
told me that

257
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,719
you are going to resign

258
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:45,359
from the institute.

259
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:46,159
Is it true?

260
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,000
That's my plan.

261
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,280
But, nothing's final yet.

262
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,479
I'm quite surprised.

263
00:14:53,119 --> 00:14:54,200
Back then,

264
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,039
you were determined to join
the Aerospace Research Institute.

265
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:57,760
You have been working there
for so many years.

266
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,440
Why are you resigning now?

267
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:02,760
Due to personal issues.

268
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,479
Sure.

269
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:08,080
Then, I won't press on.

270
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,159
But, often,

271
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,960
you need to experience it yourself

272
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:13,640
before you know if it really suits you.

273
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,840
After

274
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:16,760
you truly understand it,

275
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,520
you'll realize that

276
00:15:17,719 --> 00:15:18,359
a lot of things

277
00:15:18,359 --> 00:15:19,520
are different

278
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,440
from what you expect.

279
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:26,000
I guess

280
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,119
you already know

281
00:15:27,599 --> 00:15:28,960
why I want to meet you today.

282
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,840
I want to let you know that

283
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,400
if you eventually decide

284
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,640
to resign from the institute,

285
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,960
you're welcome to join us.

286
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,119
Hey.

287
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:04,760
Hey.

288
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,599
Yu Tu,

289
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,239
have you met Ren Wang?

290
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,080
I just met him.

291
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,119
When Ren Wang visited Wuhan
a few days ago,

292
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:11,280
I bought him a meal.

293
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,760
I accidentally let it slip.

294
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:14,679
Will you blame me for being nosy?

295
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:15,960
Of course, not.

296
00:16:16,599 --> 00:16:17,840
I've been sending out resumes anyway.

297
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,479
Zhai Liang told me that

298
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,080
you received

299
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,640
a letter of offer from DF Capital.

300
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,239
Yes.

301
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,520
But, they want me to

302
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,440
work at the headquarters in Beijing.

303
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,320
That's great.

304
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,599
Because you haven't set foot

305
00:16:27,599 --> 00:16:28,679
in this industry

306
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:29,520
ever since you graduated
from university,

307
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,000
I thought it'd be difficult for you

308
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,200
to land a good job.

309
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,719
Apparently, I underestimated you.

310
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:34,599
Let me tell you.

311
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:36,880
Both investment banking and
venture capital financing

312
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,760
have their pros and cons.

313
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,280
Think twice about it.

314
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,280
Don't worry. I know what to do.

315
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,960
Okay. I'm going home then.

316
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,320
See you in the valley tonight.

317
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,039
You have been a bit invested recently.

318
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:47,719
Why?

319
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:49,520
Is a humble white-collar worker like me

320
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,960
not allowed

321
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,119
to have my own hobby?

322
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,520
Besides,

323
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,919
ever since Zhai Liang

324
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:56,239
brought you in,

325
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,359
I'm getting more and more pumped up.

326
00:16:57,719 --> 00:16:59,000
I didn't expect you

327
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,880
to play so well.

328
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,599
You are

329
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:02,479
quite a good teammate.

330
00:17:02,599 --> 00:17:04,640
I was tricked by Zhai Liang.

331
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,559
You and Zhai Liang
work really well together.

332
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,320
You share the same opinion
on your teammates too.

333
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,559
He's just trash.

334
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,679
I'm hanging up.

335
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:12,440
See you tonight.

336
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:19,400
Yu Tu,

337
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:20,840
look at our high school chatroom.

338
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:21,640
Someone uploaded a post

339
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,919
about you and Qiao Jingjing.

340
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:33,479
He's not online yet.

341
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:58,439
Hey, Peipei.

342
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:00,479
You know what.

343
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,920
They have started

344
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:02,680
spreading rumors

345
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,560
in our high school chatroom.

346
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,280
Everyone

347
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,400
is scolding the bastard
who spread the rumors.

348
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,400
Guess what happened next.

349
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,280
What happened?

350
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,839
Yu Tu spoke.

351
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:11,760
You definitely haven't expected this.

352
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,800
Let me tell you.

353
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,959
Besides

354
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:16,479
scolding the guy who spread rumors,

355
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,280
there were also a few others

356
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,119
who left insensitive remarks.

357
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,199
Eventually, Yu Tu spoke.

358
00:18:21,439 --> 00:18:22,599
He said that he had never said
anything like that,

359
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,959
giving all of them
a slap in their faces.

360
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:26,359
Immediately, those guys went quiet.

361
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:27,400
Isn't he great?

362
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,439
Yu Tu.

363
00:18:30,719 --> 00:18:31,520
Are you free now?

364
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,680
I'd like to ask you something.

365
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,959
Sure. Go ahead.

366
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:37,920
Do you need a girlfriend?

367
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,400
If you need one,

368
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,319
what do you think about me?

369
00:18:48,199 --> 00:18:48,800
Sorry.

370
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,599
I don't need a girlfriend
for the time being.

371
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:53,959
Why?

372
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,239
Are you worried that
it will affect your studies?

373
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,760
You do sports

374
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,400
and read novels every day,

375
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,680
but your studies
have never been affected.

376
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,079
That's not the reason.

377
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:01,040
Then, why?

378
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:02,400
There's nothing wrong with me.

379
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:06,400
Sorry.

380
00:19:08,479 --> 00:19:09,160
Give me a minute.

381
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,199
You have to tell me why, right?

382
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:19,479
Sorry.

383
00:19:20,479 --> 00:19:21,959
I want someone

384
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:23,359
who will work hard together with me.

385
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:38,479
Take a screenshot of the conversation

386
00:19:38,479 --> 00:19:39,479
and send it to me.

387
00:19:40,199 --> 00:19:41,479
I'll do it now.

388
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,119
Wait.

389
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:47,800
I haven't said anything
like that before.

390
00:19:48,719 --> 00:19:49,119
If any of you

391
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,239
is still in touch with Qiao Jingjing,

392
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:51,719
send my apologies to her.

393
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,040
If there's anything
that requires further explanation,

394
00:19:54,479 --> 00:19:55,239
I'll cooperate.

395
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,920
Apologize to me?

396
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,359
How will you apologize to me?

397
00:19:59,439 --> 00:20:00,920
Will you provide an explanation too?

398
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:04,319
How?

399
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,239
Are you going to post it on Weibo?

400
00:20:05,959 --> 00:20:07,280
You know nothing about
the entertainment industry.

401
00:20:08,719 --> 00:20:09,719
If you have time to spare,

402
00:20:09,719 --> 00:20:10,959
why don't you play with me?

403
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,239
Why waste your time in the chatroom?

404
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:12,719
I've moved

405
00:21:12,719 --> 00:21:13,920
all the remaining items here.

406
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:16,760
I have also terminated the rental.

407
00:21:17,719 --> 00:21:18,280
I'll stay here

408
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,599
for a while.

409
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:22,079
Your house is quite far

410
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:23,040
from the town.

411
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:25,239
The traffic was smooth
the last time I came here.

412
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:26,839
This time,
I was stuck in a traffic jam,

413
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,959
and it took me one and a half hours.

414
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,280
It's near to my workplace.

415
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,760
I visit the town

416
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,520
not more than a few times in a year.

417
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,520
If you're going to work at Lujiazui,

418
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,920
are you going to sell this house?

419
00:21:47,479 --> 00:21:48,040
We'll see how it goes.

420
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:51,719
When are you

421
00:21:51,719 --> 00:21:52,560
going to Shenzhen?

422
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:55,560
I will officially start working
after the New Year.

423
00:21:56,239 --> 00:21:57,119
Don't you want to go home?

424
00:21:58,319 --> 00:21:59,040
Later.

425
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,239
For now,

426
00:22:01,239 --> 00:22:02,439
I'll enjoy my free time here.

427
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,800
If I go home,

428
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,560
they will definitely
pressure me to get married.

429
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,079
They will arrange blind dates for me.

430
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:08,599
Also, I haven't told them

431
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:09,640
about my resignation.

432
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,839
They would be furious
if they find out.

433
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:14,040
Didn't you go home a few days ago?

434
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,719
How did you

435
00:22:15,719 --> 00:22:16,439
break the news to your parents?

436
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:18,319
I haven't told them anything.

437
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:21,040
I told you
to only stay for a couple of days.

438
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:27,920
Why?

439
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,839
Why are you hesitating?

440
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:33,079
A job that pays you
a million yuan a year

441
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,560
and a taxing job
that pays you only a quarter of that.

442
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,439
Yet, you can't make up your mind?

443
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,520
Is it that difficult?

444
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,560
No one pays me a million yuan a year.

445
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,359
That's not true.

446
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:46,439
When you got your degree,

447
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,959
you received so many letters of offer.

448
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,640
If you had accepted
either one of those offers,

449
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:51,920
you'd now be earning
millions of yuan annually.

450
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:54,599
You're silly to have chosen
to work in an aerospace company.

451
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,760
Even if you've earned yourself a Ph.D.,

452
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,599
and been burning yourself out,

453
00:22:58,599 --> 00:22:59,880
you're still earning so little.

454
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,560
If you haven't done the research,

455
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,800
and earned yourself some prize money,

456
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,599
how could you afford

457
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:05,520
paying your mortgage loan?

458
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,920
Living your life like this.

459
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,000
You've put your intelligence to waste.

460
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,520
At least...

461
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:16,680
At the very least,

462
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,839
you wouldn't have broken up
with Xia Qing.

463
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,880
Let the bygones be bygones.

464
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,359
You will regret it sooner or later.

465
00:23:22,959 --> 00:23:23,280
Where can you find

466
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,760
such a beautiful and smart wife

467
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,640
in the future?

468
00:23:28,439 --> 00:23:29,640
Worry about yourself.

469
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,560
Pfft!

470
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:32,560
You are lucky you look good.

471
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:39,920
You can't live on

472
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,239
your dreams and sentiment.

473
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:44,839
I have different goals.

474
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:48,319
I worked hard to earn my degrees.

475
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,560
Now, I want to make
as much money as I can,

476
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,000
and live the best life I can afford.

477
00:23:53,439 --> 00:23:54,560
In today's society,

478
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:57,800
a celebrity and a live-stream seller

479
00:23:58,199 --> 00:24:00,000
can earn up to millions of yuan
every minute.

480
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,280
Look at yourself.

481
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:03,760
You've launched satellites into orbit.

482
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,520
You can ask around.

483
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,680
No one knows who you are.

484
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,479
You sold your soul for your company,

485
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,000
but is only making so little.

486
00:24:20,439 --> 00:24:21,280
These days

487
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,239
are probably

488
00:24:23,239 --> 00:24:25,000
the idlest days in my life.

489
00:24:26,199 --> 00:24:27,479
I only play games at home.

490
00:24:30,239 --> 00:24:30,800
How about this?

491
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,359
You should visit Beijing

492
00:24:34,719 --> 00:24:35,719
and meet up with your old friends.

493
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:37,680
I heard that

494
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,160
Xia Qing is still single now.

495
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:42,239
Perhaps,

496
00:24:42,239 --> 00:24:43,520
both of you

497
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:45,599
will rekindle your romance.

498
00:24:47,439 --> 00:24:49,000
You've been single for so long.

499
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,239
Is it because...

500
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:52,000
No.

501
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,800
I'll never understand you.

502
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:25,839
For the past two years,

503
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,920
you've never taken a day off.

504
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,239
Let's talk

505
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:35,640
only after you clear your annual leave.

506
00:25:37,959 --> 00:25:39,839
After that,

507
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,719
only shall you make a decision.

508
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,800
I agree.

509
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,319
It's so difficult to handle Zhuge Liang.

510
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,000
How did Yu Tu do it?

511
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,319
He comes and goes as he pleases.

512
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:23,959
Why is he still not inviting me?

513
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,520
Did my hefty investment

514
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,280
go down the drain?

515
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,400
Have you not seen

516
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,479
the skin I sent to you?

517
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,599
You don't need to send me skin.

518
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,599
Hey.

519
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,280
Hello, Jingjing.

520
00:27:49,479 --> 00:27:50,760
You left in such a hurry.

521
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,800
I forgot to tell you that

522
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:52,920
we will have

523
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,800
a family activity tomorrow.

524
00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:54,479
You don't have to practice at the studio

525
00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:55,920
tomorrow.

526
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:57,319
Oh.

527
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,319
Okay.

528
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,280
Then, I'll practice on my own.

529
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:00,479
Do a good job.

530
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:01,880
Guo said that
you have made significant progress.

531
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:02,760
That's all.

532
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:03,479
Yes.

533
00:28:25,199 --> 00:28:27,560
Can you be my coach?

534
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,040
Yu Tu is so good at playing games.

535
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,839
If he can coach me,

536
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:44,119
I can definitely
make greater progress.

537
00:28:46,199 --> 00:28:47,800
But, how can I persuade him

538
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,400
to be my coach,

539
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,640
when I'm basically a stranger to him?

540
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,439
Back then,

541
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:53,719
he even rejected

542
00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:54,680
a beautiful girl like me.

543
00:29:06,239 --> 00:29:07,040
Xiao Zhu,

544
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,400
tell Dandan to draw me a plan.

545
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,400
My company is organizing

546
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,839
an Honor of Kings' tournament.

547
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,319
I want a nice victory

548
00:29:29,439 --> 00:29:30,719
so that it'll help me
in my career later.

549
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,520
Don't your company organize any event?

550
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,760
Does a recital contest count?

551
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,000
Where does he

552
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,599
actually work at?

553
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:47,520
Doesn't he have a degree in finance?

554
00:29:47,959 --> 00:29:49,119
Do investment banks these days

555
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:50,280
organize recital contests?

556
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,800
That's so unique.

557
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,599
I've signed up for the contest.

558
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,359
But, I don't know how to play,

559
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:58,959
and I can't let my colleagues
find out that

560
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:00,119
I actually know nothing.

561
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:03,640
I think it's better

562
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,640
if you can approach someone else.

563
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:06,040
I might quit this game

564
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,920
at any time.

565
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:12,560
Why?

566
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,280
I'm on leave.

567
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,839
But, my vacation will end
at any time.

568
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,439
Besides,

569
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:24,839
I only started playing not long ago.

570
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,280
And you're playing so well already.

571
00:30:29,239 --> 00:30:30,239
It seems hopeful.

572
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,839
Can you guide me

573
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:35,079
when we play?

574
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,719
You can point out my mistakes,

575
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,560
and how I should fix them.

576
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:38,160
Can you do that?

577
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,439
If you quit,

578
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,400
I'll find someone else.

579
00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:44,680
Jade Rabbit,

580
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,839
please.
