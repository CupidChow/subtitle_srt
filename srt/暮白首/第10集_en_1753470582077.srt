1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We are in love

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
A moment of flowers, a moment of spring

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I never care about you

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You don't understand

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
How much love I have

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I look at the flowers with my eyes

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I look at the flowers with my eyes

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I never care about you

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You don't understand

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
How much love I have

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I look at the flowers with my eyes

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,480
Flowing Good to Me

13
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,000
Episode 1

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,920
It's so whoever bats me needs it.

15
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,360
한다

16
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:05,800
Everyone

17
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,680
Keep up

18
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,300
At last

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Kill them!

20
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,200
Don't move!

21
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,000
Don't move!

22
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,400
Don't move!

23
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,600
We are just passers-by.

24
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,600
If you want to disturb us,

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,600
please forgive us.

26
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,000
Please give us some face.

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Let us pass.

28
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,400
Since you left Longying City,

29
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,600
I followed you all the way.

30
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,000
You are a escort.

31
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,600
I don't believe it.

32
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,200
You young masters

33
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,400
can't think it through.

34
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,800
It's fine to dream about others.

35
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,400
If you want to lie to me,

36
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,000
it's not that easy.

37
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,800
Give me the antidote.

38
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,400
I'll keep you safe.

39
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,200
Don't think about it!

40
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,800
Miss Liuli, please have a look.

41
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,200
I can't do

42
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,200
what you told me to do.

43
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Bury them.

44
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,800
Don't let others see you.

45
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,000
Yes.

46
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:44,800
It's too late.

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,600
Retreat!

48
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,400
Check it carefully.

49
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,600
See if the antidote is still there.

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,600
Yes.

51
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,400
I came late.

52
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,000
The chief told me to come to pick you up.

53
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,000
I think

54
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,000
I should turn off the light.

55
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,800
There's an antidote.

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,200
You stay here and check it carefully.

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,200
Don't let anyone know.

58
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:16,800
Yes.

59
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,400
Stop!

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,800
Without the chief's order,

61
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,800
no one can enter.

62
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,200
I came to Lingxu Pavilion today

63
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,000
to ask for the chief's permission.

64
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,600
I hope he can save my brother from Longyin City.

65
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,200
The chief promised

66
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,800
to be my family's friend.

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,600
He won't refuse to save my brother.

68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,400
Please do me a favor.

69
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,400
Let me in.

70
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,800
We only listen to the chief's order.

71
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,000
Don't make it difficult for us.

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Miss Mei, if you do this again,

73
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,400
I'll be rude to you.

74
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,600
What's the matter?

75
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,800
Greetings, chief.

76
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,000
Chief.

77
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,000
Chief.

78
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,600
There's a rumor in the martial arts world

79
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,000
that my brother killed the chief Xiao

80
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,800
and was captured by Longyin City.

81
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,800
You all leave first.

82
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,000
Yes.

83
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,400
My brother is in danger.

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,800
I beg you to help him.

85
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,800
Get up.

86
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,000
Take it easy.

87
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,400
Don't forget that your brother, Na Lanyue,

88
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,600
is also in Longyin City.

89
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,600
He won't refuse to save your brother.

90
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,000
I was so anxious when I heard the news.

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
But I forgot that my brother is still in Longyin City.

92
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,800
Since you're here,

93
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
stay here

94
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,000
and stay for a while.

95
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,200
You'll be safer in Lingxu Pavilion.

96
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,600
Since my brother is not here,

97
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,200
I'll stay with you for him.

98
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,800
Yes.

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,800
Madam.

100
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,600
Your body...

101
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,200
I'm fine.

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,800
The antidote for Na Lanyue is on the way.

103
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,400
It'll be here soon.

104
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,000
Madam.

105
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,800
Somebody!

106
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,200
What should I do?

107
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,000
I've never seen such a serious symptom.

108
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,200
Master!

109
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,200
Where's the antidote? Hurry!

110
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,000
Cang Qi.

111
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,400
Where's the antidote?

112
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,400
The antidote was taken away by someone.

113
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,200
It seems that someone prepared it.

114
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,600
And he knows Lingxu Pavilion very well.

115
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,200
No.

116
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,600
Brother Yi is in danger.

117
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
He's in danger.

118
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,600
I'll go to the other room.

119
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'll go to the other room.

120
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,400
I'll go to the other room.

121
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,600
I'll go to the other room.

122
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,600
There must be an undercover around him.

123
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,200
Otherwise, no one will know when the antidote will be sent.

124
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,200
How can he stop it halfway?

125
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,200
Yes.

126
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,200
I was so worried just now.

127
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,800
I didn't expect this.

128
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,000
We must inform Brother Yi as soon as possible

129
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,400
and tell him that the antidote was taken away.

130
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,800
There's an undercover around him.

131
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,400
It's not safe in Longyin City now.

132
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,200
I'll send someone to send a message.

133
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:19,600
No.

134
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,200
Madam.

135
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,200
Madam.

136
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,800
Madam, wake up.

137
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,800
Madam.

138
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,800
Madam.

139
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,200
Na Lanyue.

140
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,800
Na Lanyue.

141
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,000
Think about your son, Na Lanyue.

142
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,800
He'll come back to see you soon, madam.

143
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,600
Madam, you must hold on.

144
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,600
When the Chihua Bead is activated,

145
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,600
people will be like ghosts.

146
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,800
Even the love of your loved ones will be poisoned and killed.

147
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,800
I'm afraid you can't wait any longer.

148
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
I told you earlier.

149
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,600
I should have asked me to go there in person to escort the antidote.

150
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,200
Now at this time,

151
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,600
there is no news yet.

152
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,600
If there is no news,

153
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,600
I'm worried about you.

154
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You haven't recovered yet.

155
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,600
So many people are watching you.

156
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,400
I can only make them pretend.

157
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,400
It's just that it's been so many days.

158
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,200
They have no news at all.

159
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,200
It's so strange.

160
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,200
Don't worry.

161
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,000
The ones who escort the antidote are all the elite disciples of Lingxu Pavilion.

162
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
They are all skilled.

163
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,400
Besides,

164
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,200
Cang Qi will personally receive it.

165
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,800
There won't be any big problems.

166
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Instead of worrying about him,

167
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,200
you'd better worry about yourself.

168
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,800
When the antidote is activated,

169
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,400
Rong Jingfeng will be punished severely.

170
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,400
I'll be punished if I have to.

171
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,800
What else can I do?

172
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,200
Under the guidance of Childe Mei,

173
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,000
the red plums are blooming again.

174
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,200
I think that Childe Mei looks a little sick.

175
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,200
But he looks handsome.

176
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,200
May I ask where these red plums come from?

177
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,200
I haven't seen any plum blossoms in the city for days.

178
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,800
There was a red plum in Childe Mei's courtyard

179
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,000
where he was ill.

180
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,200
But he stopped blooming years ago.

181
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,200
I think Childe Mei is not only reasonable,

182
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,800
but also loves to take care of flowers.

183
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Since he was born,

184
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,600
the red plums have bloomed several flowers.

185
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,400
Yes.

186
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,800
Even the second lady was so happy after hearing it.

187
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,400
She went to ask for advice.

188
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,600
Even the second lady asked for advice.

189
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,800
The plum is harder to deal with than I thought.

190
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,600
I think you should think of a solution as soon as possible.

191
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,400
Let her leave Longyin City.

192
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,600
Why is the second lady so happy?

193
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,000
She even came to see the plum blossoms.

194
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,400
I heard from the maids

195
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,600
that the plum blossoms have been in bloom for years.

196
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,600
I didn't expect that after you lived here,

197
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,800
they would bloom so well.

198
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,400
I'm a little curious.

199
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,600
So I came to see.

200
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,000
The plum of this red plum is originally of excellent quality.

201
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,200
But the way you manage your daily life is not right.

202
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,800
It lacks some nutrition.

203
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,400
After I moved in,

204
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,800
it was just a little bit of care.

205
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,400
Then it gave out the original flower color.

206
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,600
You've been living here for so long.

207
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,200
When are you going to tell the truth?

208
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
But I advise you

209
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,800
to tell it earlier.

210
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,800
So that your sister won't be worried

211
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,200
if you stay here.

212
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,800
This is the so-called justice of Longyin City.

213
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,800
You killed the leader Xiao.

214
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,400
My father treated you with courtesy.

215
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You just said that?

216
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,800
Don't forget.

217
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,000
My sister said she would kill you.

218
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,600
Does the second lady know the origin of the old temple?

219
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,200
Of course.

220
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,000
The old temple is full of books.

221
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,000
I've been taught there since I was a child.

222
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
How can I not know?

223
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Besides,

224
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,800
what's the point of Mr. Mei asking this?

225
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,800
It seems that the second lady really doesn't know.

226
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,600
All the books in the old temple

227
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,000
were collected from the Wulin family.

228
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,800
In order to get these martial arts secrets,

229
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,400
they are powerful and have no need to be crowded.

230
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,000
If this is the justice of Longyin City,

231
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,800
I have nothing to say.

232
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,800
Nonsense.

233
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
Those books were sent by them.

234
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,400
How could it be forced?

235
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,200
There are a few people in the world who dare to say

236
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,600
that they are being forced.

237
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,800
Is your family...

238
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,600
That's right.

239
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,000
The martial arts secrets of my family are also hidden in it.

240
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,200
Although I was still young at that time,

241
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,000
I still remember

242
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,000
my father was helpless

243
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,400
and didn't dare to

244
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,800
send the secret to Longyin City.

245
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I still remember

246
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,000
the secret of Longyin City.

247
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,600
Are you telling the truth?

248
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,600
I don't mean anything else.

249
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,200
But there are some words

250
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,600
that have been in my heart for too long

251
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,000
and I can't understand.

252
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,000
Second Lady.

253
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,400
Lin Jing?

254
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,600
Why are you here?

255
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,200
Lin Jing?

256
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,000
Rong Hua.

257
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,400
Come on.

258
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,600
Go out with me.

259
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,000
The flowers are so beautiful.

260
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
They are just flowers.

261
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
What's so beautiful about them?

262
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,600
Do they look good on me?

263
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,800
Are you jealous?

264
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,600
I'm jealous?

265
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,200
When did I ever get jealous?

266
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:23,800
I'm jealous.

267
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,800
You're thinking too much.

268
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Look at my eyes.

269
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Why are you looking at your eyes?

270
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,200
You're jealous.

271
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,200
Lin Jing.

272
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,800
I've been looking for you for half a day.

273
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,600
You're here.

274
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,600
You're here.

275
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,200
You're in big trouble this time.

276
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,200
What's wrong?

277
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,400
What's wrong?

278
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,600
The City Leader has already

279
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,400
set the punishment for you.

280
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,400
You'll know when you get to the door of the Hall of Mirrors.

281
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,400
Go.

282
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,800
What are you doing?

283
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,800
Hurry up.

284
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,600
Go.

285
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,400
Dad,

286
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,000
how are you going to punish Lin Jing?

287
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,400
City Leader,

288
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,600
I'll accept any punishment.

289
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
I have no complaints.

290
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
The Hall of Mirrors' Hall Leader Lin Jing

291
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,800
is not doing his job well.

292
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,800
He was in the medicinal garden

293
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,400
for a month.

294
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,600
No one in the city

295
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,600
can help him.

296
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,800
No.

297
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,600
Shi Wei?

298
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,800
Dad,

299
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,200
why did you let him do

300
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,000
such a dirty job?

301
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,400
Let's start from today.

302
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
City Leader is generous.

303
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,200
Although this punishment is lighter,

304
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,600
this kind of dirty work

305
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,200
is best suited for the Hall of Mirrors.

306
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,600
I hope your nose

307
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,800
can endure this month.

308
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,000
Master, what should we do?

309
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,000
If I don't suffer from my skin disease,

310
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,600
it's already a good fortune.

311
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,600
He's so ugly.

312
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,600
Hurry up.

313
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,600
Hurry up.

314
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,600
Hurry up.

315
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,600
Brother,

316
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,600
let's go.

317
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,600
It's smelly.

318
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
Let's go.

319
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's smelly.

320
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,400
Let's take a break.

321
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,600
It's so hot.

322
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,600
Come on.

323
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,600
Help me lift it.

324
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,600
It's too heavy.

325
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,600
It's really heavy.

326
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,600
My hand hurts.

327
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,600
Next time.

328
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,600
Next time.

329
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,600
You...

330
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,600
You...

331
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,600
What are you pretending?

332
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,600
Where did your hand hurt?

333
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,600
My foot is starting to hurt.

334
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,600
I'm so hot.

335
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,600
I'm so hot.

336
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,600
Ouch.

337
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,600
This...

338
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,600
Take it.

339
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,600
This is the secret book

340
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,600
that my family gave to Longyin City.

341
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,600
Since it's from your family,

342
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,600
of course it belongs to the original owner.

343
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,600
Thank you for your red plum last time.

344
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,600
Do you know how important

345
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,600
the red plum is to you?

346
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,600
Red plum can't be compared with it.

347
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,600
You gave it to someone

348
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,600
outside Longyin City so easily.

349
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,600
No matter how important it is,

350
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,600
it doesn't belong to us.

351
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,600
I returned it to you.

352
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,600
It's a good thing for my father.

353
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,600
I've brought the things.

354
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,600
I'm leaving.

355
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,600
I'm leaving.

356
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,600
What?

357
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,600
Miss Rong wanted to kill me

358
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,600
with the City Master's hand.

359
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,600
But she failed.

360
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
And now you're here.

361
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,600
I heard it clearly

362
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,600
when you talked to my sister.

363
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,600
I didn't expect

364
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,600
that Young Master Mei could do that.

365
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,600
Not only did he make me

366
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,600
the new flower of the City of Shumui,

367
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,600
but also Rong Hua

368
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,600
stole the secret scroll for you.

369
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,600
If I tell the City Master about this,

370
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,600
you two will be punished severely.

371
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,600
I never let Miss Rong

372
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,600
steal the secret scroll for me.

373
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,600
She did it willingly.

374
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,600
Even if it's the City Master,

375
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,600
she can't punish me.

376
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,600
If you really can't stand it,

377
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,600
just report it.

378
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,600
I thought it was some kind of martial art.

379
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,620
The martial arts of the

380
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,620
Demon Sect are just some skills.

381
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,600
I just didn't hear

382
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
what happened today.

383
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,600
If you're so stubborn,

384
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,600
I'll let you leave Rongyin City alive.

385
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
I'm so embarrassed

386
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,600
that I can't live.

387
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,600
Lu Yizhou.

388
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,600
Lu Yizhou.

389
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,600
Why are you saying that

390
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,600
you're my real brother?

391
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,600
Why am I

392
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,600
in the critical moment?

393
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
Why are you saying that you're injured

394
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,600
and not coming to help me?

395
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
I'm not your real brother.

396
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,600
Master.

397
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,600
You've finished the medicine

398
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,600
today so quickly?

399
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,600
It's not that fast.

400
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,600
Do you want to go to the pharmacy

401
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,600
and laugh at me?

402
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
I don't dare to laugh at you.

403
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,600
If you punish me like this,

404
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,600
you'd better beat me up.

405
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,600
It's so painful.

406
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,600
A man should be able to go to the pharmacy.

407
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,600
You're so easy.

408
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,600
Why don't you go?

409
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,600
I don't dare to take revenge on you.

410
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,600
Forget it.

411
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,600
I'll do my own thing.

412
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,600
Thank you, little bastard.

413
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,600
You came to visit me, the old farmer in the pharmacy.

414
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,600
You said that

415
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,600
and you're being rude.

416
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,600
Master.

417
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,600
The medicine is delivered to Li Xu.

418
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,600
Brother Tian Yao has delivered it.

419
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,600
Don't mention it.

420
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
I haven't received any news

421
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,600
in the past few days.

422
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,600
I'm really worried

423
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,600
if there's any change on the road.

424
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,600
What's wrong with you?

425
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,600
I'm fine.

426
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,600
What's missing?

427
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,600
You...

428
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,600
You...

429
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,600
You...

430
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,600
What's wrong with you?

431
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,600
I've already washed it.

432
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,600
I've even washed my clothes.

433
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,600
I don't believe it.

434
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,600
Get out.

435
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,600
How can you not believe it?

436
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,600
Then you're fine.

437
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,600
Don't come over.

438
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,600
You're fine.

439
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,600
Stop.

440
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,600
You're fine.

441
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,600
I'm fine.

442
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,600
I'm fine.

443
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,600
I'm fine.

444
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,600
I'm fine.

445
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,600
I'm fine.

446
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,600
I'm fine.

447
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,600
Stop.

448
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,600
You've gone too far.

449
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,600
It's hot.

450
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,600
You should leave.

451
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,600
Leave.

452
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,600
I don't want the pot.

453
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,600
I've really washed it.

454
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,600
Get out.

455
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,600
I'm fine.

456
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,600
I'm fine.

457
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,600
I'm fine.

458
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,600
I'm fine.

459
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,600
I'm fine.

460
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,600
I'm fine.

461
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,600
I'm fine.

462
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,600
I'm fine.

463
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,600
I'm fine.

464
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,600
I'm fine.

465
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,600
I'm fine.

466
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,600
I'm fine.

467
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,600
I'm fine.

468
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,600
I'm fine.

469
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,600
I'm fine.

470
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,600
I'm fine.

471
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,600
I'm fine.

472
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,600
I'm fine.

473
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,600
I'm fine.

474
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,600
I'm fine.

475
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,600
I'm fine.

476
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,600
I'm fine.

477
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,600
I'm fine.

478
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,600
I'm fine.

479
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,600
I'm fine.

480
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,600
I'm fine.

481
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,600
I'm fine.

482
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,600
I'm fine.

483
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,600
Written by Sun Hongli

484
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,040
Master,

485
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:19,840
did you get lost?

486
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,000
You almost get lost

487
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,600
You've improved.

488
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,200
Then why did Young Master think

489
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,560
I would have let you go

490
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,800
and come to Longyin City?

491
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,080
It's because there's something

492
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,400
that belongs to my family

493
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,480
in the old hall of Longyin City.

494
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,000
I wanted to borrow your hand

495
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,520
and get it back in the city.

496
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,760
But I didn't expect

497
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,600
Bai Wei Zhi's martial arts are so high.

498
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,520
I failed to plan it several times.

499
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,600
Just at the end of my plan,

500
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,800
I was lucky to get help from a family

501
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,920
and took out the secret key

502
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,120
from the old hall of Longyin City.

503
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,080
Wait.

504
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,560
I didn't ask you about that.

505
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,280
Why did you tell me that?

506
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,440
I seem to

507
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,560
have feelings for Miss Rong.

508
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,840
And I thought

509
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,520
you didn't deserve her.

510
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,240
So this time,

511
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,440
I'll do my best

512
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,120
to win Young Master's heart.

513
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,600
You?

514
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,120
You're not going to tell me?

515
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,120
I'm not going to tell you.

516
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,120
I'm not going to tell you.

517
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,120
I'm not going to tell you.

518
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,120
I'm not going to tell you.

519
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,120
I'm not going to tell you.

520
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,120
I'm not going to tell you.

521
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,120
I'm not going to tell you.

522
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,120
I'm not going to tell you.

523
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,120
I'm not going to tell you.

524
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,120
I'm not going to tell you.

525
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,120
I'm not going to tell you.

526
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,120
I'm not going to tell you.

527
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,120
I'm not going to tell you.

528
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,120
I'm not going to tell you.

529
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,120
I'm not going to tell you.

530
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,120
I'm not going to tell you.

531
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,120
I'm not going to tell you.

532
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,120
I'm not going to tell you.

533
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,120
I'm not going to tell you.

534
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,120
I'm not going to tell you.

535
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,120
I'm not going to tell you.

536
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,120
I'm not going to tell you.

537
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,120
I'm not going to tell you.

538
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,120
I'm not going to tell you.

539
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,120
I'm not going to tell you.

540
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,120
I'm not going to tell you.

541
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,120
I'm not going to tell you.

542
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,120
I'm not going to tell you.

543
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,120
I'm not going to tell you.

544
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,120
I'm not going to tell you.

545
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,120
I'm not going to tell you.

546
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,120
I'm not going to tell you.

547
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,120
I'm not going to tell you.

548
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,120
I'm not going to tell you.

549
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,120
I'm not going to tell you.

550
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,120
I'm not going to tell you.

551
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,120
I'm not going to tell you.

552
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,120
I'm not going to tell you.

553
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,120
I'm not going to tell you.

554
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,120
I'm not going to tell you.

555
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,120
I'm not going to tell you.

556
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,120
I'm not going to tell you.

557
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,120
I'm not going to tell you.

558
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,120
This is the root leaf of the Chihua Bead.

559
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,120
When I entered Longyin City that day,

560
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,120
I picked one and stored it.

561
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,120
I thought that one day

562
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,120
it would be useful.

563
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,120
But I didn't expect

564
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,120
that I could come so soon.

565
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,120
I'm sorry.

566
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,120
I'm sorry.

567
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,120
I'm sorry.

568
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,120
This flower leaf is extremely poisonous.

569
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,120
Smelling this smoke

570
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,120
will strengthen the reaction of the Chihua Bead.

571
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,120
My little disciple,

572
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,120
are you

573
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,120
feeling uncomfortable now?

574
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,120
My good disciple,

575
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,120
you must remember my good deeds.

576
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,120
If I didn't arrive in time,

577
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,120
I'm afraid

578
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,120
you would have gone to the hell

579
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,120
and met with Nalanxi long ago.

580
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,120
In the Ling Sect,

581
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,120
you are the most beautiful,

582
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,120
talented

583
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,120
and outstanding

584
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,120
disciple of many of my disciples.

585
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,120
I'm sorry.

586
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,120
I'm sorry.

587
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,120
You are the most outstanding one.

588
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,120
But now,

589
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,120
for the sake of your life,

590
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,120
you become like this

591
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,120
regardless of being alone.

592
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,120
You are not allowed to be a star here.

593
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,120
It seems that you were not happy

594
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,120
after you left the Ling Sect.

595
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,120
If I had known this,

596
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,120
why would I have betrayed the sect?

597
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,120
Did I betray the sect?

598
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,120
Or did the sect want to kill me?

599
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,120
Master He, are you all right?

600
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,120
What happened inside?

601
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,120
It doesn't matter.

602
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,120
You may leave first.

603
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,120
Master He.

604
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,120
Leave!

605
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,120
Master.

606
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,120
Don't forget

607
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,120
that you will die one day.

608
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,120
Shut up!

609
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,120
I'm afraid that your health

610
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,120
is worse than mine.

611
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,120
Maybe it's worse.

612
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,120
The most miserable thing in my life

613
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,120
is to be with you.

614
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,120
I can't leave you alone.

615
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:42,360
Even the

616
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,120
documents you have cultivated

617
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,120
can't be used for you.

618
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,120
Now it seems that

619
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,120
he is really in a bad state.

620
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,120
Even if you live with him,

621
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,120
his heart

622
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,120
has fallen apart.

623
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,120
We have long lost our master and disciple.

624
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,120
Why did you save me?

625
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,120
Why?

626
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,120
After all, I really can't bear

627
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,120
to see you be tortured to death

628
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,120
and come to save me.

629
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,120
I also tried my best

630
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,120
to save you.

631
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,120
I'm sorry.

632
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,120
I'm sorry.

633
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,120
I'm sorry.

634
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,120
I just want you to experience

635
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,120
the power of the poison of counter-virus.

636
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,120
The situation is not so bad.

637
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,120
Next time,

638
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,120
it won't be so easy to deal with.

639
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,120
Master, you should be more careful.

640
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,120
If you have no antidote

641
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,120
for the poison next year,

642
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,120
you should...

643
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,120
I should

644
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,120
let Nalan Yue do it himself.

645
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,120
Then

646
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,120
he can do it.

647
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,120
Actually, I have no way out.

648
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,120
Since you want to find Rong Jingfeng

649
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,120
to report to the government,

650
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,120
I will do it.

651
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,120
I will take this opportunity

652
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,120
to return to my master.

653
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,120
If Lingxu Pavilion and the Ling Sect work together,

654
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,120
I'm afraid no one in the world

655
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,120
can fight against each other.

656
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,120
As for the poison of the Chihua Bead on you,

657
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:08,120
I will still give you the antidote.

658
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,120
Whether it's an enemy or a friend,

659
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,120
you have to think about it.

660
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,120
Master.

661
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,120
You can just call me.

662
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,120
Why did you come personally?

663
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,120
I heard from my disciples

664
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,120
that Young Master Mei's art is extraordinary.

665
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,120
It's so impressive.

666
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,120
Now that you've got it,

667
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,120
it's really a legend.

668
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,120
It's really amazing.

669
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,120
But what's more surprising is

670
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,120
that Young Master Mei's

671
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,120
casual and calm personality

672
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,120
has just experienced nine deaths in a lifetime.

673
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,120
But she can still enjoy the plum blossoms

674
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,120
here.

675
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,120
Sorry to make you laugh.

676
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,120
Mei's family has been defeated for many years.

677
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,120
They have long been in a bad shape.

678
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,120
This time I left Mei's family,

679
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,120
I killed Master Xiao and got the first enemy.

680
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,120
I have no regrets.

681
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,120
So,

682
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,120
every day after this,

683
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,120
I've been stolen.

684
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,120
Are you really not afraid

685
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,120
of being able to leave Longyin City alive?

686
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,120
To be honest,

687
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,120
this time I left Mei's family,

688
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,120
I didn't plan to go back alive.

689
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,120
For someone who has lived a life of love,

690
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,120
what's the difference

691
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,120
between where she is and where she is?

692
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,120
Young Master Mei

693
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,120
really has a good eye.

694
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,120
It seems that if a person can live,

695
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,120
who would want to die?

696
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,120
What Young Master Mei said is right.

697
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,120
But in my heart,

698
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,120
I don't know if I think so.

699
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,120
I only used

700
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,120
30% of my power just now.

701
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,120
Even an ordinary person

702
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,120
can recover in a few days

703
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,120
after being beaten by me.

704
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,120
But Young Master Mei

705
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,120
used his inner power to beat me.

706
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,120
That's why I hurt you.

707
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,120
If a person

708
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,120
really lost his life and died,

709
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,120
how could he be so vigilant?

710
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,120
It seems that the truth and falsehood

711
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,120
are the same.

712
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,120
Only Young Master Mei

713
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,120
knows it best.

714
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,120
Today,

715
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,120
you're not just here

716
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,120
to test me, right?

717
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,120
Then do you think

718
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,120
why we, Longyin City,

719
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,120
still want to keep you alive?

720
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,120
I'm not afraid of you.

721
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,120
City Leader, can you tell

722
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,120
when this wound was made?

723
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,120
This wound

724
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,120
should have been

725
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,120
healed within a year.

726
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,120
Young Master Mei,

727
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,120
what do you mean?

728
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,120
I'm not afraid to tell you

729
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,120
about this today.

730
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,120
That's right.

731
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,120
The Tang family is behind the Tang family.

732
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,120
But the Tang family is not interested

733
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,120
in the Puchan Emperor.

734
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,120
Then what's the meaning

735
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,120
of this wound?

736
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,120
What happened?

737
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:41,120
After I took the Chihua Bead from the Tang family,

738
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,120
I went back to Mei's house.

739
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,120
But not long after,

740
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,120
I was chased by Lingxu Pavilion.

741
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,120
But the people who appeared at the Tang family

742
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,120
were not only me

743
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,120
but also Longyin City.

744
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,120
So they can't be sure

745
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,120
who got the Chihua Bead.

746
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,120
So,

747
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,120
except me,

748
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,120
there was also

749
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,120
Miss Rong'er,

750
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,120
Rong Hua.

751
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,120
If you don't believe me,

752
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,120
you can ask her to come and confront me.

753
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,120
See if I'm right or wrong.

754
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,120
I've already told you everything.

755
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,120
I don't know

756
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,120
if you have anything else to ask.

757
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,120
Master Mei,

758
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,120
if I told you

759
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,120
what you said,

760
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,120
I wouldn't believe a word of it.

761
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,120
Kill me.

762
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,120
Longyin City can send people

763
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,120
to investigate Lingxu Pavilion.

764
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,120
If not,

765
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,120
kill me.

766
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,120
It's also very good to eliminate the consequences.

767
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,120
Master Mei,

768
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,120
it seems

769
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,120
you should think about it.

770
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,120
Besides this,

771
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,120
what do you mean

772
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,120
to Longyin City?

773
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,120
I don't know.

774
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,120
I don't know.

775
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,120
I don't know.

776
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,120
I don't know.

777
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,120
I don't know.

778
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,120
I don't know.

779
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,120
I don't know.

780
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,120
I don't know.

781
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,120
I don't know.

782
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,120
I don't know.

783
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,120
I don't know.

784
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,120
I don't know.

785
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,120
I don't know.

786
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,120
I don't know.

787
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,120
I don't know.

788
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,120
I don't know.

789
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,120
I don't know.

790
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,120
I don't know.

791
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,120
I don't know.

792
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,120
I don't know.

793
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,120
I don't know.

794
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,120
I don't know.

795
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,120
I don't know.

796
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,120
I don't know.

797
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,120
I don't know.

798
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,120
I don't know.

799
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,120
I don't know.

800
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,120
I don't know.

801
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,120
I don't know.

802
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,120
I don't know.

803
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,120
I don't know.

804
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,120
I don't know.

805
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,120
I don't know.

806
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,120
I don't know.

807
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,120
I don't know.

808
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,120
I don't know.

809
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,120
I don't know.

810
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,120
I don't know.

811
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,120
I don't know.

812
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,120
I don't know.

813
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,120
I don't know.

814
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,120
I don't know.

815
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,120
I don't know.

816
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,120
I don't know.

817
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,120
I don't know.

818
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,120
I don't know.

819
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,120
I don't know.

820
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,120
I don't know.

821
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,120
I don't know.

822
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,120
I don't know.

823
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,120
I don't know.

824
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,120
I don't know.

825
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,120
I don't know.

826
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,120
I don't know.

827
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,120
I don't know.

828
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,120
I don't know.

829
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,120
I don't know.

830
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,120
I don't know.

831
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,120
What's the matter?

832
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,760
No cure for your illness.

833
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,920
Don't getCCC involved at the crime scene.

834
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,960
Heavenly梅开的梅花

835
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,880
We're here to get the medicine

836
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,840
as ordered by Master Rong.

837
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:58,880
Go and get it.

838
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,200
Don't you follow the rules of Longyin City?

839
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,280
Why are you here to get the medicine?

840
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,720
You don't follow the rules at all.

841
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,120
Cut the crap.

842
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,720
Master Rong is waiting for the medicine.

843
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,760
Longyin City is just a four-storied city.

844
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,280
Everyone in the world is addicted to this Chihua Bead.

845
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,760
If we, the people of Longyin City,

846
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,560
can't work together,

847
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,600
something will happen in the future.

848
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,480
Since you're here to get the medicine,

849
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,560
I'll give you an explanation

850
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,080
as the Master of the Hall.

851
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,240
From now on,

852
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,160
for the future of Longyin City,

853
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,680
we, the Hall,

854
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,120
will do everything we can

855
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,840
to help you.

856
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,880
You're an outsider.

857
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,000
You're lucky to be the Hall Master.

858
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,680
Why are you here?

859
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,120
You're trying to help us.

860
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,600
It depends on whether the Hall agrees or not.

861
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,920
So you mean

862
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,520
the other three halls

863
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,400
are outsiders

864
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,480
in the Hall?

865
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,240
So what?

866
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,640
The power of the Hall

867
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,440
is the most important thing

868
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,720
in Longyin City.

869
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,120
It's your name.

870
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,600
Who's there?

871
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,080
How dare you speak like that?

872
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,440
Master, I'm sorry.

873
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,480
Master, please spare me.

874
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,440
Please spare me.

875
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,800
Open your mouth.

876
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,400
Listen up.

877
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,280
There's some tension

878
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,320
between the four halls of Longyin City.

879
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,120
But they're not enemies.

880
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,520
From now on,

881
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,600
if you dare to speak like that again,

882
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,640
don't blame me for being rude.

883
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,680
We'll follow your instructions.

884
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,600
We'll do everything we can to help you.

885
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,840
All right, you may leave.

886
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,360
Sorry.

887
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,680
Tian Jing,

888
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,480
I'm here today

889
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,600
for the attack of Hua'er.

890
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,000
Sit.

891
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:57,880
Lin Jing,

892
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,760
remember carefully.

893
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,320
When you saved Hua'er

894
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,680
from Lingxu Pavilion,

895
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,280
did you find anything strange?

896
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,080
No.

897
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,520
Master, you mean

898
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,440
the one who killed the second lady

899
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,880
is from Lingxu Pavilion?

900
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,160
Yes.

901
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,280
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

902
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,880
I didn't know she was from Lingxu Pavilion.

903
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,400
It was Mei Ying.

904
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,800
When she came back, she was killed

905
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,120
and took the Chihua Bead.

906
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,800
I just heard my father talk about it

907
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,920
and knew it.

908
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,360
I'm sorry.

909
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,240
I'm sorry.

910
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,160
I'm sorry.

911
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:18,960
I'm sorry.

912
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,760
I'm sorry.

913
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,760
I'm sorry.

914
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,760
I'm sorry.

915
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,760
I'm sorry.

916
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,760
I'm sorry.

917
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,760
I'm sorry.

918
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,760
I'm sorry.

919
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,760
I'm sorry.

920
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,760
I'm sorry.

921
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,760
I'm sorry.

922
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,760
I'm sorry.

923
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,760
I'm sorry.

924
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,760
I'm sorry.

925
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,760
I'm sorry.

926
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,760
I'm sorry.

927
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,760
I'm sorry.

928
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:35,760
I'm sorry.

929
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,760
I'm sorry.

930
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,760
I'm sorry.

931
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,760
I'm sorry.

932
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,760
I'm sorry.

933
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,760
I'm sorry.

934
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,760
I'm sorry.

935
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,760
I'm sorry.

936
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,760
I'm sorry.

937
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,760
I'm sorry.

938
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,760
I'm sorry.

939
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,760
I'm sorry.

940
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,760
I'm sorry.

941
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,760
I'm sorry.

942
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,760
I'm sorry.

943
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,760
I'm sorry.

944
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:51,760
I'm sorry.

945
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,760
I'm sorry.

946
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:53,760
