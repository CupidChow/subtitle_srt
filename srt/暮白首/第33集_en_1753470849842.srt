1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We are in love

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
A moment of flowers, a moment of spring

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I always come and you are not here

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You don't understand

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
How much love

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The most beautiful flower, I look at it

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I find your love

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
As smooth as glass

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:14,180
The

10
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,100
the normal

11
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,100
divorce

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,140
I hope we can be together

13
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,520
My love will stay there for sure.

14
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,500
Et fake a plane ticket.

00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,080
The Love by J toleratesлушай

16
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,340
Episode welcome

Liang...

18
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,460
Liang...

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,660
ö

Any

A

25
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,420
priority

26
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,340
for

27
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:19,900
us

28
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,420
Anyway,

29
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,500
I have been waiting here

30
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,100
he must have prepared himself for the whole thing.

31
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,580
Before,

32
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,980
he broke into our spiritual school to take over the throne.

33
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,860
This is

34
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,620
still not clear.

35
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,980
If Lin Ruo Han hadn't protected him,

36
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,620
how could he have survived till now?

37
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,820
You're lucky.

38
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,980
You brought so many people

39
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,500
after hearing this news.

40
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,700
It seems that you still have

41
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,700
a grudge against me.

42
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,660
Cut the crap.

43
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,500
Where is Jing Yuan now?

44
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,740
I guessed right.

45
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,620
You really colluded with the Nalan family.

46
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,180
Did you tell them

47
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,700
that you're in the spiritual school now?

48
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,900
You don't have to argue with them.

49
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,900
We already knew about this.

50
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,700
The Lingxu Pavilion was destroyed.

51
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,300
They had to surrender to you.

52
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,220
You just let us know

53
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,500
that you wanted to show up.

54
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,700
The spiritual school used to blood my Nalan family.

55
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,700
All these years of grudges,

56
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,420
even if we're willing to take over the Nalan family,

57
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,500
I'm afraid you won't give up easily.

58
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,100
You deliberately led the people out.

59
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,900
I don't know what you're trying to do,

60
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,300
but as long as A Yue is here,

61
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,500
she won't allow you to hurt the people.

62
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,500
There's a saying in the spiritual school.

63
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,100
It's absolutely right.

64
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,900
The Nalan family

65
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,300
and the spiritual school have been friends for years.

66
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,500
They should be ended.

67
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,900
Mohua.

68
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,300
You're the enemy of the Nalan family for no reason.

69
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,500
Why?

70
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,300
All these years,

71
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,540
you've been trying to

72
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,900
get rid of the Nalan family.

73
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,100
All these years,

74
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,100
we've never stopped investigating the past.

75
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,100
We've found some clues.

76
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,900
But,

77
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,500
what's your identity?

78
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,700
Time has passed.

79
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,700
It's been so many years.

80
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,900
The longer the year,

81
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,500
the longer

82
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,700
I can't even remember who I am.

83
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,900
You knew about the poisoning of

84
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,700
the second elder of the Kangen.

85
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,580
But you just

86
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,900
watched me

87
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,100
train him into a black soldier.

88
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,700
Didn't you

89
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,100
think about it?

90
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,100
You trained me into your soldier.

91
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,300
You avenged the Nalan family.

92
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,500
You'll be free from worries.

93
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,500
You'll be free from secrets.

94
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,100
Actually,

95
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,300
every time you came here,

96
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,500
I wanted to drive the poison.

97
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,700
I should have guessed it.

98
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,700
You left me in the spiritual school.

99
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,500
I'm sure you're prepared.

100
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,900
You told me to train black soldiers

101
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,300
without fear.

102
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,100
If I guessed it right,

103
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,300
even if I hit you,

104
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,100
you wouldn't be able to

105
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,700
train me into a black soldier, right?

106
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,100
I was

107
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,700
determined to train black soldiers.

108
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,100
I thought I could be invincible

109
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,100
one day.

110
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,300
But I failed.

111
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,300
I was desperate.

112
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,100
I didn't use the three lives of

113
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,500
the Chihua Pearl to protect my heart.

114
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,700
But I was rejected.

115
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,900
I was not good at walking on fire.

116
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,700
I almost

117
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,900
learned another skill.

118
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,300
That's why I'm still young.

119
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,900
Black soldiers are the top warriors of the Nalan family.

120
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,700
But I failed again.

121
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,500
Since you belong to the Nalan family,

122
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,500
why did you fight them hard?

123
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,900
You even tried to kill them.

124
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,900
Why did you try so hard to take the Chihua Pearl?

125
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,100
Do you know

126
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,700
all the tragedy started because of you?

127
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,100
So you knew it.

128
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,100
You're right.

129
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,900
It's all

130
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,500
because of me.

131
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,700
But I just want the Nalan family

132
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,300
to become stronger.

133
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,900
In order to survive,

134
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,100
I had to train the Black Army Talisman

135
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,100
to resist the Chihua Pearl.

136
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,300
I was wrong.

137
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,700
I was wrong.

138
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,100
I was wrong.

139
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,900
I was wrong.

140
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,500
Then I used my own strength

141
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,900
to establish the Lin family.

142
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,100
I thought my disciples

143
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,300
were loyal.

144
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,500
But I never thought

145
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,700
that the traitor Ren Jingfeng

146
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,700
knew the secret of the Nalan family

147
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,100
and took the Chihua Pearl to heart.

148
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,700
Don't worry about your grudge.

149
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,500
After I become a man,

150
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,300
I will take the throne.

151
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,900
I will never let him hurt the Lin family again.

152
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,500
Back then,

153
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,500
Bai Su, Mr. Bai,

154
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,100
was admired by everyone.

155
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,900
He joined the various sects to fight against the Lin family

156
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,300
and made a big deal of it.

157
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,900
In the end,

158
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,100
you sent my mother to the Nalan family

159
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,500
to take the Chihua Pearl

160
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,100
to take the throne.

161
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:56,900
You're right.

162
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,300
But it wasn't

163
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,300
as I expected.

164
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,900
Your mother met your father,

165
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,300
Father Nalan Xin.

166
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,500
Then she betrayed the Lin family

167
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,900
for her own sake.

168
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,300
She betrayed me, her master.

169
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,100
My mother

170
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,900
didn't betray you.

171
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,100
If you can let go of your hatred,

172
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,100
then everyone can be free

173
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,300
and return peace to the world.

174
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,700
It's not good or evil.

175
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,700
My mother only chose the right way.

176
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,100
It's just because you're angry,

177
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,100
so you sent the Jinfeng

178
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,300
to attack the Nalan family

179
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,500
and took the Chihua Pearl.

180
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,900
She cut it off

181
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,900
and turned the whole grass into blood.

182
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,100
They're your blood.

183
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,700
You let them die

184
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,300
and you feel sorry for them?

185
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,300
Shut up!

186
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,300
What do you know?

187
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,300
If it's really like what you said,

188
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,900
your father was the head of the Nalan family.

189
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,100
Then you and I are...

190
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,300
Right.

191
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,500
Nalan Xin

192
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,900
is the second head of the Nalan family

193
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,100
after my father.

194
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,500
My father only has one daughter.

195
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,900
After I left the Nalan family,

196
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,700
she inherited the position of head

197
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,900
because of Wu Hou.

198
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,500
That's why others saw her.

199
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,900
How is that possible?

200
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,300
If it's like what you said,

201
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,300
you've already...

202
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,900
I'm already 100 years old.

203
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,100
I saved you

204
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,100
and forced you to learn the Ice Talisman.

205
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,100
I just entrusted you

206
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,500
with my unfinished wish.

207
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,500
Then you turned the sword

208
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,100
between Longyin City and Lingxu Pavilion

209
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,700
and destroyed the Chihua Pearl.

210
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,700
You even fought against Rong Jingfeng.

211
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,900
Isn't that just to avenge the Ling Sect?

212
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,300
If you really want to do that,

213
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,700
why did you choose to do that?

214
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,900
I'm not going to do that.

215
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,100
I'm not going to do that.

216
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,900
Go.

217
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,300
Because you are the son of Ruohan

218
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,900
and Nalan Xin,

219
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,300
whether it's the Ling Sect

220
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,700
or the Nalan family,

221
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,300
you are the rightful heir.

222
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,700
Remember,

223
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,300
the Chihua Pearl

224
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,500
must not fall into the hands of outsiders again.

225
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,900
I'll stop here.

226
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,700
As for the practice of martial arts,

227
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,300
you'd better know it.

228
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,100
I'll wait for your order.

229
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,300
I'll wait for your order.

230
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,700
I'll wait for your order.

231
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,900
Do you believe what he said is true?

232
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,500
I didn't expect

233
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,700
he would risk his life

234
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,500
to save our Songlin Pavilion.

235
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,500
And he has arranged all this.

236
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,700
I'm not sure.

237
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,700
Inform Yunxu

238
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,500
to bring them to the Ling Sect.

239
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,900
Rong Jingfeng is too suspicious.

240
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,500
He will find the Nalan family's trace sooner or later.

241
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,900
We have to get to him.

242
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,500
Yes.

243
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,700
Second Miss,

244
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,100
you asked me to change the antidote in Master's room.

245
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,700
I checked it again today.

246
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,300
I found someone touched it.

247
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,100
I sent my disciples to inquire.

248
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,100
They said Meiying was ill and had a high fever.

249
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,900
Now,

250
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,100
she is in the Hall of Life and Death.

251
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,500
We can't know the reason.

252
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,300
That's strange.

253
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,300
She is not ill.

254
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,300
Why did she have a high fever?

255
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,300
It seems that

256
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,300
she won't be visited by others.

257
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,700
Even if she has a cold,

258
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,700
she can be treated by the Hall of Life and Death.

259
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,100
Why did she steal the antidote in my master's room?

260
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,900
Meiying

261
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,300
must have something to do with her.

262
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,100
By the way, Xiaoxiao,

263
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,700
you arranged the master's funeral.

264
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,100
Do you see the hairpin in her room?

265
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,300
I didn't see it when I entered the room for Master.

266
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,500
And I remember

267
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,700
when Master's body was sent back to Longyin City,

268
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,100
there was no hairpin on her head.

269
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,300
That's strange.

270
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,900
When I went to see auntie for the last time,

271
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,700
I saw her with a hairpin.

272
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,300
I don't know why

273
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,500
I lost it when I went to find it again.

274
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,500
This hairpin is a pair of my mother's remains.

275
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,500
Auntie always cherishes it.

276
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,500
Why did she fly away?

277
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,900
Yes.

278
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,900
Master also gave her a hairpin.

279
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,500
But Master only loves this one.

280
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,300
It seems that I was careless.

281
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,100
Is this

282
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,900
related to Master's death?

283
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,500
No matter why Meiying stole the antidote,

284
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,900
we have to find a way to let her appear

285
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,500
and find out the truth.

286
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,900
But who can let Meiying

287
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,700
leave the Hall of Life and Death willingly?

288
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,900
Only my father.

289
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,700
Sister.

290
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,100
Miss.

291
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,300
I have something to discuss with you.

292
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,500
Xiaoxiao.

293
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,500
What's up?

294
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,900
I got news.

295
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,100
It is said that

296
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,700
Nalan Yue has set up a strategy

297
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,300
to gather disciples of various sects

298
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,500
to gather in Longyin City.

299
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,900
He will come back in person one day

300
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,100
and ask them to avenge their leader.

301
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,300
I didn't expect

302
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,500
he couldn't hold his breath.

303
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,700
He couldn't hold his breath

304
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,700
and wanted to avenge his leader.

305
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,100
What's wrong with you?

306
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,700
I'm fine.

307
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,300
Sister, don't worry.

308
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,700
I'm just a little dizzy.

309
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,100
It seems that

310
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,100
we can't hide this from him.

311
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,500
We have to let father know

312
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,100
and call the Hall of Life and Death.

313
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,900
I think Meiying will deal with it.

314
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,700
What's wrong with Meiying?

315
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,500
Why hasn't she come yet?

316
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,700
I think he is

317
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,100
a man who can't do anything.

318
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,500
He is so loose as the Hall Leader.

319
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,900
How can he show his true self

320
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,300
to the disciples of the Hall of Life and Death?

321
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,900
Thank you for your concern, Hall Leader Bai.

322
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,300
Greetings, City Leader.

323
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,300
Just now, I saw the Hall Leader

324
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,900
and the Hall Leader of the Hall of Life and Death.

325
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,500
I think they are all

326
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,500
in the same place.

327
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,700
I think they are all

328
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:42,900
in the same place.

329
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,900
I met something

330
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,900
and I was late.

331
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,900
Please forgive me.

332
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,500
Meiying,

333
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,500
I heard that recently

334
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,900
you have been living in the Hall of Life and Death

335
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,900
and can't go out.

336
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,700
Are you planning something again?

337
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:05,900
You used to

338
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,900
be quite concerned about the affairs of Longyin City.

339
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,300
But now,

340
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,500
all the sects of the martial arts world

341
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,700
will gather in the Tengfeng Town.

342
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,300
Why can't I hear your advice?

343
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,500
City Leader,

344
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,100
I have been busy with

345
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,300
some matters of the Hall of Life and Death recently.

346
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,500
I can't go out and do nothing.

347
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:27,900
Mr. Mei,

348
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,900
you don't look well.

349
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,100
Are you sick?

350
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,500
While everyone is here,

351
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,900
how about I

352
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,100
take your pulse?

353
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,500
If you are sick,

354
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,900
you should be treated as soon as possible.

355
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,900
In the situation of Longyin City,

356
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,700
anyone who is sick

357
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,100
will die.

358
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,700
I am fine.

359
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,500
I won't bother you.

360
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,100
No.

361
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,300
This is not right.

362
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,300
What's wrong?

363
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,500
You look...

364
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,900
Are you poisoned?

365
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,300
What?

366
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,500
Poisoned?

367
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,700
What?

368
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,300
This...

369
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,900
No wonder you haven't arrived yet.

370
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,900
You are having a high fever.

371
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,100
You are sick.

372
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,100
Why do you come here?

373
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:22,700
This...

374
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,500
That's right, Hall Leader Mei.

375
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,900
As the Hall Leader of the Hall of Life and Death,

376
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,700
I should be worried about the affairs of the city.

377
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,100
But since I took the position,

378
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,700
I have been afraid of the new capital.

379
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,100
So...

380
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:59,100
Hall Leader Mei,

381
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:01,700
Mei Ye,

382
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,500
what's wrong with you?

383
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,380
Why are you poisoned?

384
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,080
This is the poison made by the

385
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,160
Hall of Illness.

386
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,160
How could Hall Leader Mei be poisoned?

387
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,960
Thanks to the new people of the City,

388
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,460
I was able to escort Hall Leader Zi Yan out of the city to be treated.

389
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,160
But I was unable to do anything,

390
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,660
and caused Hall Leader Zi Yan to lose his life.

391
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,880
Although the City Leader has no punishment,

392
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,880
I feel very ashamed

393
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,300
and have always wanted to make up for this.

394
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,800
So,

395
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,880
I decided to sneak into the Hall of Zi Yan's room without permission.

396
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,860
I was able to use the poison to make up for this.

397
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,860
It's a pity that I overestimated myself.

398
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,860
Now that Second Young Mistress has returned to the city,

399
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,860
I know that it's hard for me to protect the position of Hall Leader of the Hall of Illness.

400
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,860
But City Leader,

401
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,860
I'm doing this for the sake of Longyin City.

402
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,860
I hope City Leader can understand.

403
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,860
Mei Ying,

404
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,860
you should know very well

405
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,860
that in the Longyin City of Rong Jingfeng,

406
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,860
there is no one who is not loyal.

407
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,860
Are all the words you just said the truth?

408
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:17,860
City Leader,

409
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,860
Mei Ying is sincere and honest.

410
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,860
Hall Leader Zi Yan died for the sake of Longyin City.

411
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,860
From now on,

412
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,860
Mei Ying is willing to try the poison.

413
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,860
If the Hall of Illness needs anything,

414
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,860
I will not hesitate to tell the truth.

415
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,860
If City Leader still doesn't believe it,

416
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,860
I'm willing to take the risk.

417
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,860
Hall Leader Mei,

418
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,860
if you don't stop,

419
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,860
your leg will probably be broken.

420
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,860
Xiao Xiao,

421
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,860
first, treat Hall Leader Mei's wounds.

422
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,860
We have studied the new medicine of the Hall of Illness.

423
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,860
How effective is it?

424
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,860
We will verify it later.

425
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,860
Yes.

426
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,860
Girl,

427
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,860
what's going on?

428
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,860
What's wrong, Hua?

429
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,860
Bai,

430
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,860
what's wrong with Hua?

431
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,860
Tell me.

432
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,860
Hua is suffering from a serious poison.

433
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,860
From today onwards,

434
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,860
I will take care of all the food and drink for Hua.

435
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,860
No one is allowed to come near.

436
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,860
I will take care of it.

437
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:27,860
Girl,

438
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,860
are you there?

439
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,860
Teacher is here to see you.

440
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,860
Teacher,

441
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,860
come down.

442
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,860
Come.

443
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,860
Girl,

444
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,860
how do you feel?

445
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,860
Is there anything uncomfortable?

446
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,860
I'm fine.

447
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,860
I'm worried about you.

448
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,860
You can't stay in Longyin City anymore.

449
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,860
With your situation,

450
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,860
in the future,

451
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,860
everyone will suspect you.

452
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,860
You will be exposed sooner or later.

453
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,860
I'll think of a way

454
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,860
to send you out of the city as soon as possible.

455
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,860
Teacher,

456
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,860
thank you for playing a show with me just now.

457
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,860
If Meiying knows,

458
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,860
she will take the opportunity to play it

459
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:07,860
and transfer it to Shi Xia.

460
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,860
Girl,

461
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,860
what are you doing to Meiying?

462
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,860
If she didn't do anything wrong,

463
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,860
why would she be worried that I would catch her?

464
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,860
This time,

465
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,860
she is smart against being smart.

466
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,860
You...

467
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,860
What plan do you have?

468
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,860
Listen to me first.

469
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,860
No matter what,

470
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,860
your safety is the most important.

471
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,860
Even if you have a big misunderstanding

472
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,860
about Nalan Yue,

473
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,860
the child in your belly is innocent.

474
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,860
Meiying died in Longyin City

475
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,860
is not only your brother.

476
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,860
She can be a fake owner.

477
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,860
Thank you for hiding it from me.

478
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,860
If it wasn't an excuse to be poisoned,

479
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,860
how could I not be noticed?

480
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,860
Teacher, don't worry.

481
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,860
After I finish my work,

482
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,860
I will leave.

483
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,860
The people of the Fourth Hall have all arrived.

484
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,860
The poison is melting.

485
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,860
We must not underestimate them.

486
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,860
Now, Longyin City is broken inside and outside.

487
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,860
How dare anyone

488
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,860
to frame the person under the eyes of the City Leader?

489
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,860
This person must not be ignored.

490
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,860
The City Leader has ordered

491
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,860
that Kongzi Hall will be fully responsible for this.

492
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,860
We must thoroughly investigate the Fourth Hall.

493
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,860
The poison is not easy to find.

494
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:51,860
Yes.

495
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,860
The Fourth Hall is not easy to find.

496
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,860
The Fourth Hall is not easy to find.

497
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,860
The Fourth Hall is not easy to find.

498
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,860
Let's go.

499
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,860
Yes.

500
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,860
Second Miss.

501
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,860
Are you okay?

502
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,860
I'm fine.

503
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,860
You didn't tell anyone about this, right?

504
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:25,860
Meiying, you are a scoundrel.

505
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,860
You used the word poison to try to get through.

506
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,860
But she never thought

507
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:32,860
that the poison on Master's hairpin was particularly high quality.

508
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,860
It's different from other poisons.

509
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,860
It must be Master

510
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,860
who used the poison at the critical moment

511
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,860
to attack Meiying with the hairpin.

512
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,860
The poison on Meiying's body was made by Master.

513
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,860
And she didn't know that

514
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,860
the poison had exposed her.

515
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,860
She is the murderer who killed Master.

516
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,860
We can't tell anyone about this.

517
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,860
If you point out her now,

518
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,860
she will deny it.

519
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:58,860
We must be sure

520
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,860
to overthrow her

521
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,860
so that we can lose my father's trust in her.

522
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,860
I didn't expect

523
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,860
Meiying to ask Master to leave the city

524
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,860
and do this.

525
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,860
Then the Second Miss

526
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,860
would have wronged Master.

527
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,860
Yes.

528
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,860
I didn't trust her enough.

529
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,860
But she didn't even say a word

530
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,860
to explain her innocence.

531
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,860
But

532
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,860
I will prove

533
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,860
her innocence.

534
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,860
I feel sorry for the Second Miss.

535
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,860
I'm sure I can make up for your pain.

536
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,860
Second Miss,

537
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,860
this is your medicine.

538
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,860
I will make it for you later.

539
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,860
But the poison in your body has not been removed yet.

540
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,860
You should rest more.

541
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,860
Don't be tired.

542
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,860
Did you pick these herbs yourself?

543
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,860
I didn't expect a little disciple

544
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,860
to know a lot about herbs.

545
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,860
Second Miss,

546
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,860
Yu'er is right.

547
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,860
You are not fully recovered yet.

548
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,860
You should go back and rest.

549
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,860
Young Mistress.

550
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,860
Close the door.

551
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:35,860
How is it going?

552
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,860
Young Mistress,

553
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,860
you should be careful.

554
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:44,860
I'm not.

555
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,860
I'm not.

556
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,860
I'm not.

557
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,860
I'm not.

558
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,860
Don't alert the enemy.

559
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,860
Don't alert the enemy.

560
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,860
You will be in trouble.

561
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,860
I know what I should do.

562
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,860
By the way,

563
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,860
go remind the patient.

564
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,860
It's a critical moment.

565
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,860
Don't spread the news.

566
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,860
There can't be any problem.

567
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,860
Yes.

568
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,860
They are exactly the same.

569
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:22,860
Mei Ying,

570
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,860
you can't escape this time.

571
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,860
Give me the thing.

572
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,860
I don't know what you are talking about.

573
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,860
Don't pretend in front of me.

574
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,860
Give me the news you want to spread.

575
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:44,860
You can't let Nalan Yue know about this.

576
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,860
What are you doing?

577
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,860
You and I are both the masters.

578
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,860
We are both the directives.

579
00:26:54,860 --> 00:27:10,380
We are both the

580
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,380
You!

581
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,860
You have already noticed.

582
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,860
The key is that you left the key.

583
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,860
You can't take it.

584
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,860
You can't take it.

585
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,860
This is a big deal.

586
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,860
There can't be any mistake.

587
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,860
If there's any problem,

588
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,860
who can take the responsibility?

589
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,860
Can you?

590
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,860
Not to mention,

591
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,860
you have the right to know this.

592
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,860
I knew

593
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,860
you can't be hidden from this.

594
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,860
This was supposed to be a happy event.

595
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,860
But the situation is critical now.

596
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,860
The fewer people know,

597
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,860
the safer Young Madam is.

598
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,860
You are confused.

599
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,860
This matter

600
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:42,860
can only be discussed by Young Master.

601
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,860
I can't let anyone know about this.

602
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,860
I'm not afraid.

603
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:48,860
I'm not afraid.

604
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,660
I know

605
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,660
that's how Young Mistress can be safe.

606
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,460
Young Master will do his best to protect her

607
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,460
and prevent Young Mistress from getting hurt.

608
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,060
I don't want to let Na Lanyue know this,

609
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,460
but you don't know

610
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,460
what's going on in Longyin City.

611
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,260
Except for Bai Tao Zhu,

612
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,860
no one here is trustworthy.

613
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,260
Once this matter is exposed,

614
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,860
it will be a big trouble for Young Mistress.

615
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,860
What is a double-dealing?

616
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,060
Now is the time.

617
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,260
Na Lanyue put you here

618
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,860
to get the situation in the city,

619
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,060
not to make you do something stupid.

620
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,460
You should take care of yourself.

621
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,460
Be cautious.

622
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,260
Otherwise,

623
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,860
your identity will be exposed soon.

624
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:28,860
I...

625
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,260
I'm careful in everything I do.

626
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,260
Why am I not cautious?

627
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,460
As a member of the Nalan family,

628
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,460
you pretend not to know Mohuan.

629
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,260
You think you're good at hiding things.

630
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,460
But you've already been exposed.

631
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,260
Let me ask you.

632
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,460
In the desert,

633
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:48,060
who would be scared by the name of Mohuan?

634
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,060
What you're hiding

635
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,060
is that you've been exposed.

636
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,860
If you really want to protect Young Mistress,

637
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,860
you must be low-key.

638
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,460
Don't make any rash moves in the Nalan family.

639
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,260
When I entered Longyin City,

640
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,460
I was fearless.

641
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,860
Even if I was found out,

642
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,260
I wouldn't involve the Nalan family.

643
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,460
The only thing Young Master told me

644
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,460
was to protect Young Mistress.

645
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,060
Even if he misunderstood her,

646
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,460
he still

647
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,860
couldn't let go of his concern.

648
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,860
I thought I could make them get back together.

649
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,860
But I neglected Longyin City.

650
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,860
Even though Young Mistress' family

651
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,260
is in danger,

652
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,860
Young Mistress has her own plans.

653
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:40,660
Don't worry.

654
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:41,860
In a few days,

655
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,060
she won't let the Nalan family down.

656
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,860
I'll take care of it.

657
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:56,860
Master.

658
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,660
This is the hairpin

659
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,860
Ziyan found in Mei Ying's room.

660
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:06,860
Master.

661
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,060
Be careful.

662
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,260
There's poison on the hairpin.

663
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,260
It's indeed Xiao Yu's hairpin.

664
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,660
Where's Mei Ying now?

665
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,860
She's in the Hall of Life.

666
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,260
She never left.

667
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,260
Take her to the Hall of Life.

668
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,260
Take her to Mei Ying.

669
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,260
I'll get her to tell me about her death.

670
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:22,860
Yes.

671
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,260
A few days ago,

672
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,260
the maid ordered Jingyuan to make the same hairpin

673
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,260
that Ziyan had.

674
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,860
Could it be that the hairpin in Mei Ying's room

675
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,660
was made up by the maid?

676
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,260
But why did she do that?

677
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,860
Could it be that Ziyan's death

678
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,460
was a secret?

679
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:19,860
Master.

680
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,060
Master.

681
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:21,860
Master.

682
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:22,660
Master.

683
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:23,460
Master.

684
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,260
Master.

685
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,260
Master.

686
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,260
Master.

687
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,260
Master.

688
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,260
Master.

689
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,260
Master.

690
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,260
Master.

691
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,260
Master.

692
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,260
Master.

693
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,260
Master.

694
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,260
Master.

695
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,260
Master.

696
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,260
Master.

697
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,260
Master.

698
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,260
Master.

699
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,260
Master.

700
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,260
Master.

701
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,260
Master.

702
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,460
Master.

703
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,260
Master.

704
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,260
Master.

705
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,260
Master.

706
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,260
Master.

707
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,260
Master.

708
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,260
Master.

709
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,260
Master.

710
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,260
Master, are we going to chase them?

711
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,860
They must have seen our power.

712
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,260
They must have shown their power.

713
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,260
It's a good thing for us.

714
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:03,860
No need to chase them.

715
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,460
Next,

716
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,060
we'll go to Longyin City.

717
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:07,860
Yes.

718
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:15,660
Master.

719
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,860
What's going on outside?

720
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,860
The situation is very bad.

721
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:19,860
Kongzi Hall

722
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,460
ordered the whole Longyin City to be searched.

723
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,260
It's already in your room.

724
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,260
We found the hairpin of Master Ziyan.

725
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,060
And it was confirmed by the sickly hall.

726
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,460
The poison that Master Ziyan was poisoned with

727
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,660
and the poison of hairpin

728
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,860
are the same.

729
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:32,860
Is it really...

730
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:33,860
Shut up!

731
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,860
It's not what you should ask.

732
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:44,660
Master.

733
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,060
If there is no antidote

734
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,060
in the room,

735
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,660
I'm afraid we can't hold on for long.

736
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:50,860
Go.

737
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,060
Go and find out

738
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,060
what's going on.

739
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,060
But you...

740
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,060
Go!

741
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,260
Yes.

742
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:17,660
Master.

743
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,260
The Holy Grail Hall has been surrounded by us.

744
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,660
They can't escape.

745
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:24,460
Good.

746
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,060
Master.

747
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:30,860
Bad news.

748
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,060
The Holy Grail Hall has been surrounded.

749
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:32,660
Now,

750
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,060
Master is going to the gate.

751
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,860
I didn't expect...

752
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,660
I really didn't expect to be sealed away

753
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,460
by Rong Hua,

754
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,060
the enthusiaco girl

755
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,660
from past days.

756
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,060
She is pushing things hard now.

757
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,060
However, she has joined the Magic School.

758
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:12,900
If I found out

759
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,740
Wow.

760
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,940
The black banag nasil

761
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,220
has weigh eyes

762
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,580
on the brocade.

763
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,460
Why didn't the gift

764
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,880
Peking horse

765
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,240
come to mine

766
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,000
Go.

767
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,120
Does your aunt really die in the hands of this traitor?

768
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,040
Your Highness,

769
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,560
Meiying's leg injury was indeed caused by my aunt.

770
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,640
The most important thing now

771
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,960
is to let her come out and face it.

772
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,560
Meiying is full of tricks.

773
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,160
We have to be careful when we come in.

774
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,080
Your Highness, rest assured.

775
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,280
Everything has been arranged well.

776
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:11,920
You...

777
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,080
City Leader.

778
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,840
City Leader.

779
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,080
I was deceived by the Double-Faced Camp.

780
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,280
I know nothing.

781
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,040
City Leader must save me.

782
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:28,800
Your Longyin City

783
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,320
is really not good enough for outsiders.

784
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,480
I've been working for you

785
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,560
and I've been born to die.

786
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,760
But you...

787
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,400
Rong Hua just came back for a few days.

788
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,640
He's in the position of Master of the Life and Death Hall.

789
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,960
You're so rude to me.

790
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,640
Don't forget.

791
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,640
He's the one who betrayed Longyin City.

792
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,640
Mei Ying.

793
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,880
I'm the one who sent Aunt to the Peak

794
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,080
and let Master and I take care of her.

795
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,800
I did mean it.

796
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,920
But the one who came to pick you up

797
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,880
should be Xiao Xiao.

798
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,960
Why did you take the initiative

799
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,000
to take on this task?

800
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,680
It's suspicious enough.

801
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,480
Besides,

802
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,640
Aunt's hairpin is not one of the two.

803
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,600
The poison on her hairpin

804
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,120
was made by her.

805
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,440
It's one of the two.

806
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,680
You keep saying

807
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,560
you want to test the poison on Longyin City.

808
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,440
But you're only poisoned by Aunt.

809
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,200
How can you explain that?

810
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,920
You wanted to sneak into Aunt's room

811
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,880
and steal the antidote.

812
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,600
If I hadn't taken the antidote away,

813
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,680
why would you be so angry?

814
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,360
Now you found

815
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,040
Aunt's hairpin in your room.

816
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,440
What else do you want to explain?

817
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,560
Nonsense.

818
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,480
How do I know

819
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,880
if you set me up

820
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,040
for Nalan Yue?

821
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,280
Set you up?

822
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,680
You're always careful.

823
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,200
How could I set you up?

824
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,200
Let me ask you.

825
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,760
Why do you have Aunt's hairpin?

826
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,200
How did you get poisoned by Aunt?

827
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,240
Can you explain it clearly?

828
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,200
You can't.

829
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,880
I swore

830
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,680
I would never let anyone

831
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,000
kill Aunt.

832
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,840
She set you up and her own brother

833
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,920
set you up.

834
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,960
No wonder I'm in Peak Loving Phalanx

835
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,040
just without you.

836
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,520
So

837
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,520
you took considering Zi Yan

838
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,100
killed all

839
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,800
of your men

840
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,440
and made trouble for Nalan Yue.

841
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,840
Zi Yan is not circles that you copied.

842
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,680
Why did you want to kill her?

843
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,080
He made me lose

844
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,480
as much as we don't treat him.

845
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:32,900
She's

846
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,480
If Zi Yan knows that

847
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,200
I let the murderer

848
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,200
go,

849
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,840
he will blame me.

850
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,640
Master, don't blame yourself.

851
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,360
Now the murderer is found.

852
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,920
Aunt will be at ease in the underground.

853
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,880
But I don't know where the little eagle

854
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,160
put her hairpin.

855
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,840
This hairpin

856
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,760
is just a sample I made.

857
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,160
It doesn't matter.

858
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,520
I'll keep this hairpin.

859
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,120
I'll keep it with me

860
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,200
as a souvenir.

861
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,440
Girl,

862
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,800
you must be

863
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,600
very sad now.

864
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:38,760
At that time,

865
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,440
Na Lan Yue was misunderstood.

866
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,000
I shouldn't be the one who's sad.

867
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,160
It's Yue.

868
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,120
When she was in pain

869
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,320
because of the counterattack,

870
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,240
I suspected that she was the murderer

871
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,760
who killed aunt.

872
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,120
But she never

873
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,360
suspected me at all.

874
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,760
I can't forget

875
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,520
the way she looked at me.

876
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:08,760
But...

877
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,480
But you didn't blame yourself.

878
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,280
Yue was right.

879
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,880
I shouldn't have suspected her from the beginning.

880
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,720
When I had doubts

881
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,400
and asked her questions,

882
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,720
our feelings

883
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,240
became stronger.

884
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,040
I can't go back to the past.

885
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,720
Na Lan Yue has made the last pass.

886
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,520
She'll be back to the palace soon.

887
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,920
I think I have to find a way

888
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,080
to send you out of the city as soon as possible.

889
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,320
I won't leave.

890
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,600
I've done too few things for her.

891
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,600
She suspected that

892
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,760
she was the murderer who killed the elders.

893
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,800
This innocence

894
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,000
is not for me.

895
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,040
I have to prove it for her.

896
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:03,800
No.

897
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,920
I won't let you stay in Longyin City.

898
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,680
It's dangerous for you

899
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,600
and your child.

900
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,280
Master.

901
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,760
Please hide it for me.

902
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,480
Not only for Yue,

903
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,600
but also for me and my child.

904
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,720
I don't want her to live in hatred

905
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,520
and grievance

906
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,000
after she was born.

907
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,480
Master.

908
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,400
Rong Hua and I

909
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,560
wanted to go to the city to find out the truth

910
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,640
and clear Na Lan Yue's name.

911
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,840
Who would have thought that

912
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,360
Mei Ying killed Master Zi Yan?

913
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,160
She is so sinister.

914
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,120
Master has ordered her body to be buried in the ashes

915
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,520
to pay respects to her.

916
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,600
Mei Ying is dead.

917
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,160
I've done a lot of things in Longyin City.

918
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,360
You should pay attention to the situation in the wind-up station.

919
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,040
Na Lan Yue

920
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,920
should be here soon.

921
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,560
We should end this."

922
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:33,900
Villain dogs will travel after returning

923
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:36,480
The moving minds will be

924
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,700
S augmentedB

925
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:38,980
S aIled

926
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,000
SiccIe

927
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:49,880
Even if the beg pictures are
