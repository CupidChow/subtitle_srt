1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I will be your enemy

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I will be your enemy

3
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I will be your enemy

4
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I will be your enemy

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I will be your enemy

6
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I will be your enemy

7
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
A'Yu, be careful

8
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I will be your enemy

9
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Huan'er

10
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Huan'er

11
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Huan'er

12
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
As long as you die

13
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Everything will end

14
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
How could this be?

15
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You want to rule the whole world

16
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You dream

17
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
A'Yu can't hurt you

18
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I can

19
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I won't lose

20
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I will never lose

21
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
When Mu Chong dies

22
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Your wound will never heal

23
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Huan'er

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Why did you do this?

25
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
A'Yu

26
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm sorry

27
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I shouldn't have kept it from you

28
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's so nice to see you again

29
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm sorry

30
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm sorry

31
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Huan'er

32
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Huan'er

33
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Huan'er

34
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Huan'er

35
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Huan'er

36
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,280
Ah يا

37
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,080
All the women

38
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,080
want the flowers to be white

39
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,920
Am I bitter?

40
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,820
The moon?-L mice

41
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,120
will also sounds

42
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,760
Even black moon

43
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,360
is light

44
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,180
Mr Bai won't miss her face.

45
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,180
You can come here with her.

46
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,140
Thank you.

47
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,120
Help me.

48
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,240
Yin Zhu.

49
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,720
Mr Bai.

50
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,740
For the omission plan,

51
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,540
A Yuan already saved Run Ye.

52
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,940
Li Ying chose us as his .

53
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,660
According to his situation now…

54
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,660
He's trapped by Mo Huan.

55
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,280
Mr Bai, please go there.

56
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,640
We'll kill them together.

57
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,120
Su,

58
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,480
promise me.

59
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,640
Don't use your inner power.

60
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,000
Okay?

61
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,800
Then you have to promise me

62
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,800
to leave with me.

63
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,640
Back then,

64
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,720
you asked me if I wanted to leave with you.

65
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,120
I was so obsessed with it.

66
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,160
I didn't know what to do.

67
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,400
But now I know

68
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,880
what is the most important thing to me.

69
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,040
Yicheng,

70
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,120
I hope my answer

71
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,560
is not too late.

72
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,000
Since you know it,

73
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,920
why didn't you leave with them?

74
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,520
Because I can't trust you.

75
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,040
If I'm not there,

76
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,640
what would you do alone?

77
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,920
You can leave

78
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,960
when you have a chance.

79
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,760
But you...

80
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,800
I'll go find you.

81
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,080
Don't worry.

82
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,080
I won't let anything happen to me.

83
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,840
Yicheng.

84
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,760
Yicheng.

85
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,320
Go.

86
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,200
I won't go.

87
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:01,840
Go.

88
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,560
I won't go.

89
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,760
If you don't go,

90
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,960
we'll all die.

91
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,720
Go.

92
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,120
Rong Su.

93
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,040
Rong Su.

94
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,400
You can't use your inner power.

95
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,280
Otherwise...

96
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,320
Leave first.

97
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,600
I'll take care of this.

98
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,400
I'll go help Yu.

99
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,360
Rong Su.

100
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,320
Listen to me.

101
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,200
Leave first.

102
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,080
I won't go.

103
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,320
Take Rong Su away.

104
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:42,640
Yes.

105
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,280
I won't go.

106
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,240
Princess Rong.

107
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,720
Princess Rong.

108
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,440
Princess Rong.

109
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,000
Princess Rong.

110
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,120
Go.

111
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,360
Let me go.

112
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,160
Let me go.

113
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,200
I won't go.

114
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,720
I won't go.

115
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,960
Princess Rong.

116
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,400
You can't go.

117
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,600
You can't leave me.

118
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,840
You said you can't leave me.

119
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,240
You must wait for me here.

120
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,000
I'll wait for you to come back.

121
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,600
You can't leave me.

122
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,200
You can't go.

123
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,240
Do you know that?

124
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,640
Don't leave me.

125
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,400
I'll wait for you.

126
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,040
Don't lie to me.

127
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,800
Don't lie to me.

128
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,040
Don't lie to me.

129
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,320
Go.

130
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,080
Princess Rong.

131
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,200
Princess Rong.

132
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,480
Princess Rong.

133
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,440
Princess Rong.

134
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,120
Princess Rong.

135
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,160
Let's go.

136
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,360
Go!

137
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,000
No!

138
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,800
Hurry!

139
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,960
Luo Yanzheng!

140
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,600
Go!

141
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,880
Luo Yanzheng!

142
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,720
Go!

143
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,120
Let me go!

144
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,920
Hurry!

145
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,160
Go, Princess Rong!

146
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,560
I won't go!

147
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,760
Luo Yanzheng!

148
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:04,760
Miss Shi lying in the social construct.

149
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,000
It's my dear sister's happy birthday.

150
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,140
Happy Birthday!

151
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,000
The simpleton,

152
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,440
what is our young master doing?

153
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,880
Yes.

154
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,720
He has

155
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,720
The rest of you, leave Longyin City immediately.

156
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,920
From now on, there will be no Longyin City.

157
00:10:52,740 --> 00:11:05,700
The

158
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,380
Master has exiled him to a foreign country.

159
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,620
We all went back because His Excellency told us to.

160
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,680
Therefore, we definitions have been ALL filled.

161
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,760
For the years and years,

162
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,580
we have kidnapped over 10,000 shops of clothing

163
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,920
and made them었어 har.

164
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,920
I'm so tired.

165
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,920
I'm so tired.

166
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,120
I don't know.

167
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,200
I'm so tired.

168
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
I'm so tired.

169
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
I'm so tired.

170
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,080
Is there something wrong with Rong Su?

171
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,680
No matter what,

172
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,600
Longyin City is also the blood of his family.

173
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,120
They've been married since childhood.

174
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,120
They can't protect themselves.

175
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,840
They must be worried.

176
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,280
You've betrayed your master

177
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,920
by escaping from Longyin City.

178
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,240
Will you regret it?

179
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,040
I've done everything for the Lin family.

180
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,120
I know it's my own fault.

181
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,600
But I've done it for my master.

182
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,720
From now on, I just want to be myself.

183
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,720
I don't want to be involved in the trouble.

184
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,880
Look.

185
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,400
Lastly,

186
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,160
we must always stick to our duty.

187
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,920
Happy Med pill will not harm people.

188
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,280
Yuzhu.

189
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,560
All I have is you.

190
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,160
You must come back.

191
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,040
You didn't give me

192
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,580
any chance after all?

193
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,320
After Rongyun City was desperately destroyed,

194
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,000
The storm has finally calmed down.

195
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,560
Everything...

196
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,320
Everything has ended.

197
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,440
Yi Dong.

198
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,120
Hold on.

199
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,880
I don't want to.

200
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,040
Hold on.

201
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,760
This is nothing to you.

202
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,280
You have to go back with me.

203
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,760
Ru Su Wan is waiting for you.

204
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:10,920
Su Wan.

205
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,440
I told Rong Su to leave earlier.

206
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,000
I just don't want him to see

207
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,560
my current storm.

208
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,920
Don't say such sad things again.

209
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,280
You have to stay alive.

210
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,280
Our family

211
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,240
is waiting for us to go back

212
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,440
to rebuild the house.

213
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,600
Besides,

214
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,360
if you don't go back with me,

215
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,000
how can I explain to Rong Su?

216
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,320
He's so smart.

217
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,160
I think he has guessed it.

218
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,800
Ah Yue.

219
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,000
If he still holds a little hope,

220
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,520
promise me.

221
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,040
Hide it from him.

222
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,040
Tell him

223
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,760
I have something else to do.

224
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,840
I don't know when the storm will come.

225
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,960
Let him rest at home.

226
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:51,840
Okay?

227
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,240
No.

228
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,560
Ah Yue.

229
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,840
I can't go.

230
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,240
I can't go.

231
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,840
Get up.

232
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,160
Don't move.

233
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,720
You're hiding.

234
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,840
I'll hold you.

235
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,600
Soon.

236
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,200
We can go back soon.

237
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:07,880
Ah Yue.

238
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,920
Ah Yue.

239
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Don't be sad.

240
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,960
People are interesting.

241
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,680
I need you to be the master.

242
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,680
Many people want to give you back.

243
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,640
But I...

244
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,760
Just take it as a job.

245
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,880
I'm out for a while.

246
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,760
I sometimes forget about Gui Xi.

247
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,120
In this way,

248
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,520
I'll be happy.

249
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,520
Before,

250
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,240
so many people miss me.

251
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,920
I'm so jealous.

252
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,880
I'm leaving.

253
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,840
You're so happy.

254
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,640
You're not like this.

255
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,360
A man.

256
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,840
What a sad story.

257
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,320
Don't tell me.

258
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,200
Ah Yue.

259
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,320
You owe me.

260
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,880
Next life,

261
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,680
I'll take it back.

262
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,240
Remember your past.

263
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,400
Are you a man?

264
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:06,880
Ah Yue.

265
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,920
Listen to me.

266
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,920
In my life,

267
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,880
you're my brother.

268
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,320
You're my biggest blessing.

269
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,240
Promise me.

270
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,040
You'll live well.

271
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,240
Support me.

272
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,800
I'll eat the food I haven't eaten.

273
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,320
See the scenery I haven't seen.

274
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,080
All the money you owe me.

275
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,920
I'll pay for it.

276
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,760
Okay?

277
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,320
Mr. Yin.

278
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,800
What do you want to see?

279
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,920
Go see it yourself.

280
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,920
What do you want to eat?

281
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,160
Take me out.

282
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,360
I'm busy.

283
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,920
I'm so tired.

284
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,920
Mr. Yin.

285
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,880
Mr. Yin.

286
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,800
Go.

287
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,120
Go.

288
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,760
Song Ah Yin.

289
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,080
Yin Zhuang.

290
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,080
Do it.

291
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,560
Do it.

292
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,040
Ah Yue.

293
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,800
Ah Yue.

294
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,640
One more thing.

295
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,520
Take good care of me.

296
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,840
Okay?

297
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,160
Go.

298
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,600
I won't let anything happen to you.

299
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,320
Song Ah Yin.

300
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,560
Yin Zhuang.

301
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,680
Yin Zhuang.

302
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,200
Yin Zhuang.

303
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,640
Yin Zhuang.

304
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,960
Wake up.

305
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,840
Wake up.

306
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,840
Yin Zhuang.

307
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,280
Wake up.

308
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,440
Yin Zhuang.

309
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,840
Yin Zhuang.

310
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,080
Wake up.

311
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,080
Yin Zhuang.

312
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,720
Yin Zhuang.

313
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,720
Yin Zhuang.

314
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,680
Yin Zhuang.

315
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,280
Yin Zhuang.

316
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,280
Yin Zhuang.

317
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,280
Yin Zhuang.

318
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,280
Yin Zhuang.

319
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,280
Yin Zhuang.

320
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,280
Yin Zhuang.

321
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,280
Yin Zhuang.

322
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,280
Yin Zhuang.

323
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,280
Yin Zhuang.

324
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,280
Yin Zhuang.

325
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,280
Yin Zhuang.

326
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,280
Yin Zhuang.

327
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,280
Yin Zhuang.

328
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,280
Yin Zhuang.

329
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,280
Yin Zhuang.

330
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,280
Yin Zhuang.

331
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,280
Yin Zhuang.

332
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,280
Yin Zhuang.

333
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,280
Yin Zhuang.

334
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,280
Yin Zhuang.

335
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,280
Yin Zhuang.

336
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,280
Yin Zhuang.

337
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,280
Yin Zhuang.

338
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,980
The Latin

339
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,680
It's your turn.

340
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,680
I've always lost to you.

341
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,400
But after three days of separation,

342
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,560
I've finally realized that

343
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,720
I've made a lot of progress in chess.

344
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,640
Even the elder son of Lingxu Pavilion

345
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,440
is no match for me.

346
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,840
Hurry up. It's your turn.

347
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:58,840
Oh.

348
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,800
Are you sure you want to do this?

349
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,440
I'm sorry.

350
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,560
Su,

351
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,040
it's time to take the medicine.

352
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,280
Girl,

353
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,680
why are you doing this?

354
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,400
You have time to torture yourself.

355
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,440
Why can't you

356
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,920
take good care of yourself?

357
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,400
If you keep doing this,

358
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,040
your legs will be broken.

359
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,080
No matter what crisis I had in the past,

360
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,000
he would appear and help me.

361
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,120
Now I'm so selfish.

362
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,200
Will he come to see me

363
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,680
and scold me?

364
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,760
Didn't you say it when you came back two months ago?

365
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,400
Lu Yizhou

366
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,160
went everywhere to find you medicine.

367
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,320
He did this

368
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,480
for you to recover soon.

369
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,120
What's the use of being healthy?

370
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,400
The only thing I can do now

371
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,400
is to wait for him to come back.

372
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,000
See if he

373
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,520
will be by my side

374
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,920
like before.

375
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,560
If he can send someone

376
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,960
to tell me a message,

377
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,720
and he still thinks of me,

378
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,560
that's enough.

379
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,320
Don't think too much.

380
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,600
Here, drink it.

381
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,240
Drink the medicine.

382
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,960
I'll help you in a while.

383
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,080
It's windy outside.

384
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,160
Don't catch a cold.

385
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,280
I just want to be alone.

386
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,880
You can go back first.

387
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,280
Su,

388
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:51,040
riding a snow Homeland Action

389
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,560
I don't know the world.

390
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,160
Don't think too much.

391
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,320
Master and I

392
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,720
will do our best to cure you.

393
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,440
There's still a long way to go.

394
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,960
People who should forget

395
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,000
and things they should forget,

396
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,120
why bother to think about it?

397
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,000
What about you?

398
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,440
Can you forget about me?

399
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,120
I can't.

400
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,480
So what?

401
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,840
We still have to live our lives.

402
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,760
You silly girl.

403
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,360
With your great political career,

404
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,280
how can you compare with me?

405
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,560
Take care of yourself soon.

406
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,320
Have a goodthank you.

407
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,840
So your life will go smoothly.

408
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,320
Let me tell you.

409
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,320
A man who won't turn back

410
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,440
will be like a vegetable.

411
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,720
If you can't leave him,

412
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,440
you've got to give up abandoning him.

413
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,840
He will notしか

414
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,080
fool around.

415
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,280
She's just messing around.

416
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,080
Okay.

417
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,880
Chen, don't drink anymore.

418
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,320
This girl

419
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,880
doesn't know whether she's pretending to be stupid

420
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,000
or not willing to face it.

421
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,280
Lan Yue is really

422
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,560
so stubborn.

423
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,560
At least, I can give them

424
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,120
a chance to say goodbye.

425
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,240
What if they forget about it?

426
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,040
What should I do?

427
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,200
Well.

428
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,760
That can't be.

429
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,360
Chen Jianji.

430
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,120
Wait.

431
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,120
I'm fine.

432
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:55,720
I...

433
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,320
You brat!

434
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,760
Where are you?

435
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,040
You think you can come here?

436
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,360
I'll beat you up.

437
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,440
I'm almost there.

438
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,280
What if I get a sprain?

439
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,520
I mean,

440
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,360
you're old.

441
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,120
Can't you walk slowly?

442
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,240
You're so reckless.

443
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,760
You fell down.

444
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,960
If you hurt others,

445
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,520
it's not good.

446
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,000
I...

447
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,960
You should be more stable.

448
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,320
Stable?

449
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,520
No, no, no.

450
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,720
You brat!

451
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,120
You're so reckless.

452
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,600
You're a man.

453
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,640
What if I hit you?

454
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,600
You're so reckless.

455
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,760
You're like a girl.

456
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,760
A girl?

457
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,200
I'm a girl?

458
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,880
I'm really...

459
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,440
Enough. Stop it.

460
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,800
You...

461
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,040
Come on. Tell me.

462
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,320
Is there anything urgent?

463
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,240
What's wrong with her?

464
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,720
You're making me confused.

465
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,640
Listen,

466
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,760
it's done.

467
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,040
Done?

468
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,440
Why should I lie to you?

469
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,520
Go back and check it.

470
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,040
Go.

471
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,080
You're so slow.

472
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:47,920
Hua.

473
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,400
Hua.

474
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,000
Are you okay?

475
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,280
I'm fine.

476
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,560
Master is so careless.

477
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,920
Stay away from him.

478
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,120
He might hurt you.

479
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,520
I'm just a little wound.

480
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,160
Master loves to fight.

481
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,760
If you let him stay,

482
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,400
it's worse than killing him.

483
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,360
Why are you laughing?

484
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,920
I'm happy.

485
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,200
I've always wanted to live

486
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,360
in the world.

487
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,920
But it's come true.

488
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,040
Hua.

489
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,120
If you keep sleeping and don't wake up,

490
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,720
I'll knock myself out

491
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,920
and go to your dream.

492
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,040
You...

493
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,760
Little boy.

494
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,160
Master.

495
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,240
You're here, too.

496
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,200
I just woke up.

497
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,680
I'm here to care about him.

498
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,080
Stop fooling around.

499
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,360
It's not the time to care about him.

500
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,520
Why not?

501
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,480
You're his master.

502
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,200
You can't leave some space for young people

503
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,600
to talk to them.

504
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,760
They've been through so many hardships.

505
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,360
They'll have to live longer.

506
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,640
You're an old man.

507
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,480
Don't be so arrogant.

508
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,000
I...

509
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,920
I just want you to go in later.

510
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,640
Don't you want a little boy to play with you?

511
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,800
You're so thoughtful.

512
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,120
Since that day,

513
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,120
I'm relieved

514
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,640
that she's awake.

515
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,880
Yes.

516
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,320
Go.

517
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,560
Go guard there.

518
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,760
Yes.

519
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,560
Go.

520
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,800
We'll never be apart again.

521
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,040
How sure were you

522
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,360
that you did that?

523
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,040
Actually,

524
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,440
I'm not sure.

525
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,400
But I had to try

526
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,160
to live or die.

527
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,480
I guess Mohua didn't expect

528
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,840
you would do that.

529
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,920
I'm sorry.

530
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,880
I'm sorry.

531
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,880
I'm sorry.

532
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,880
I'm sorry.

533
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,880
I'm sorry.

534
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,880
I'm sorry.

535
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,880
I'm sorry.

536
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,880
I'm sorry.

537
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,880
I'm sorry.

538
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,880
I'm sorry.

539
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,880
I'm sorry.

540
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,880
I'm sorry.

541
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,880
I'm sorry.

542
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,880
I'm sorry.

543
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,880
I'm sorry.

544
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,880
I'm sorry.

545
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,880
I'm sorry.

546
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,880
I'm sorry.

547
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,880
I'm sorry.

548
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,880
I'm sorry.

549
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,880
I'm sorry.

550
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,880
I'm sorry.

551
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,880
I'm sorry.

552
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,880
I'm sorry.

553
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,880
I'm sorry.

554
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,880
I'm sorry.

555
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,880
I'm sorry.

556
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,880
I'm sorry.

557
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,880
I'm sorry.

558
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,880
I'm sorry.

559
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,880
I'm sorry.

560
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,880
I'm sorry.

561
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,880
I'm sorry.

562
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,880
I'm sorry.

563
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,020
I'm sorry.

564
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,060
I think the situation here...

565
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,400
It seems it's

566
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,300
śH•Hualá Eel Australia,

567
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,680
It sounds different from

568
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,960
gere %."

569
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,160
That person

570
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,660
on the other side

571
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,840
of the stage

572
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,740
turned into the stone caught hand-cuffed by hisworkers.

573
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,700
Compared with Hua'er's safety,

574
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,860
it's nothing to be afraid of.

575
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:14,780
Mohua,

576
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,860
no matter how powerful your martial arts are,

577
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,500
you have no one by your side.

578
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,900
Even if you are above everyone,

579
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,740
you are just a poor bug

580
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,660
who is being controlled by power.

581
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,420
You thought you could control everything,

582
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:28,900
but you were wrong.

583
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:30,980
From now on,

584
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,500
as long as I'm fine,

585
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,740
Hua'er will be fine.

586
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:37,180
It all started just now.

587
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,380
Give me a family.

588
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,180
Zhao Yao will give me up one day.

589
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,540
Give me up!

590
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:47,740
Yue,

591
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,900
you just got rid of the control of the bug.

592
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,780
But you did this for me.

593
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,180
Do you know that?

594
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,020
To eradicate evil,

595
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,540
one can finally return peace.

596
00:30:59,340 --> 00:30:59,900
Let's go.

597
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,420
From now on,

598
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,900
we are in the same boat at the end of life.

599
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,380
Mohua.

600
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:35,660
Please help come back

601
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,620
at the age of eldest.

602
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:43,020
в

603
00:31:45,220 --> 00:32:00,280
and

604
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,120
That would be great.

605
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,000
In the future,

606
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,160
besides life and death,

607
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,560
there will be no more things

608
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,560
that can separate us.

609
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,200
No.

610
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,560
Even if it's life and death,

611
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,920
it can't separate us.

612
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,360
In that case,

613
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,680
I'll be miserable.

614
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,600
If you and my master are going to have a match,

615
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,920
I'll have to stay with you

616
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,920
and bleed.

617
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,360
Your master's martial arts

618
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,760
are far worse than mine.

619
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:41,960
In the future,

620
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,480
we'll live and die together

621
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,560
and be together.

622
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,760
No matter what kind of injury I get,

623
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,920
you can feel it.

624
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,280
So for you,

625
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,080
I'll protect myself.

626
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,800
What's your plan?

627
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,920
Plan?

628
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,600
What do you mean?

629
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,960
The current plan

630
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,320
is to give birth to three fat dogs.

631
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,480
You...

632
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,360
I'm not kidding.

633
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,240
From now on,

634
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,280
there's only one

635
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,760
Lin Jing left in this world.

636
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,040
The grudge and hatred of Nan Lan Yue

637
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,000
are buried with Long Yin City.

638
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,240
Our first child is Lin.

639
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,320
The second child is Rou.

640
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,200
The third child is Lin Rou.

641
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,200
How about it?

642
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,240
Okay.

643
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,040
I'll listen to you.

644
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,440
You'll listen to me?

645
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,400
I'll listen to you in the future.

646
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,000
Lin Jing!

647
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,360
You're so cunning.

648
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,120
You're ungrateful.

649
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,080
You're so mean.

650
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:51,960
I...

651
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,080
You're a bad guy.

652
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,160
Don't let me see you again.

653
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,160
If I see you again,

654
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,040
I'll...

655
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,880
I'll poke your eyes.

656
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,280
I'll hit your face.

657
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,200
I'll...

658
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,760
I'll put you on the ground.

659
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,120
I'll...

660
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,320
I'll smash you.

661
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,040
I'm so angry.

662
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,520
I'm so angry.

663
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,280
I think they're good.

664
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,400
She's sincere to that girl.

665
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,360
I really like her.

666
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:20,720
I...

667
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,400
Master, you...

668
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,880
So what?

669
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,480
She locked my disciple away.

670
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,600
My painting is pure.

671
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,800
If I didn't watch it,

672
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,320
I wouldn't have made it so clear.

673
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,120
You only care about your disciple.

674
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,160
You don't care about me.

675
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,240
Do you have a conscience?

676
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:43,640
I...

677
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:45,640
No.

678
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,480
Master.

679
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,120
Master.

680
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:49,600
Master.

681
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,520
Why don't I care about you?

682
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,000
I just want to go in and have a look.

683
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,760
Just a glance?

684
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,160
But you...

685
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,240
You insist on me staying here.

686
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,400
You don't even let me leave.

687
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,480
In my opinion,

688
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,120
the one you care about the most is your grandson.

689
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,960
You don't care about your disciple at all.

690
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,760
Who said that?

691
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,600
I've been observing your every move lately.

692
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,080
I think

693
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,600
you're much more obedient than that Wang brother.

694
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,040
I was blinded by your beauty before.

695
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,400
I didn't know you're a jade.

696
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,200
Master, you're really good at acting.

697
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,280
I have so many advantages.

698
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,520
I can't compare with those two brothers.

699
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,640
From now on, I'll be filial to you.

700
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,520
You'll find that I have more advantages.

701
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,760
It depends on your performance.

702
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,840
Don't worry, master.

703
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,320
Then I'll trouble my disciple to take a bath for me.

704
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,440
You have this?

705
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,680
In the end,

706
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,760
I still didn't listen to you.

707
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,520
I still moved.

708
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,080
But

709
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,120
these days, I sit here

710
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,760
and recall everything that happened in the past.

711
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,160
Then I look at my wounds.

712
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,800
I feel at ease.

713
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,520
My sin and my mistakes

714
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,000
in the end

715
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,600
are just my martial arts.

716
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,440
I'm just taking advantage of myself.

717
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,880
I'm sorry.

718
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,680
Don't say that.

719
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,720
Everything you did was for Longying City.

720
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,000
But our ways are different.

721
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,160
No one does it to anyone.

722
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,000
You don't have to worry too much.

723
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,920
The Grand Master will definitely think of a way

724
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,920
to cure your wounds.

725
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,200
I've done a lot of wrong things

726
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,160
and got you all involved.

727
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,400
Senior Bai and I

728
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,160
have been out of the world

729
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,320
to solve Longying City's problem.

730
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,920
But now we have to move away from Black Stone Mountain

731
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,200
and settle down here.

732
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,560
You've done too much for me.

733
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,720
I have no way to repay you.

734
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,600
Although Longying City is gone,

735
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,920
I feel more secure now.

736
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,520
I'm satisfied with everything.

737
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,400
I don't need to bother you anymore.

738
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,240
We did everything for you.

739
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,040
We're willing to do it

740
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,240
because we're a family.

741
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,640
That time,

742
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,360
if Master didn't pick us up in the city,

743
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,480
Yue wouldn't have arrived in time.

744
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,320
I got everyone involved.

745
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,520
If Sister hadn't cured her wounds in time,

746
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,320
I would have felt guilty for the rest of my life.

747
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,040
Well.

748
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,240
About the party,

749
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,160
otherwise, I would have been hurt

750
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,360
by Alluring Moon.

751
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:26,880
Never mind.

752
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,920
This injury

753
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,680
is worth it at this moment.

754
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,080
어떻게owaćWhat God List of Fates!

755
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,120
I remember

756
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,080
you lovedordinates to pick water at the discount.

757
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,960
From now on,

758
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,240
you can do whatever you like

759
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,080
with whatever you want to do.

760
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,080
Sister.

761
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:48,920
You know

762
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,040
I've never been on good terms with Lin Jing.

763
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,120
You'd better take her away

764
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,440
before we fight against each other.

765
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,360
Sister.

766
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,520
Let me play chess with you.

767
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,000
Okay.

768
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,800
Sister, you first.

769
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:14,600
Okay.

770
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,320
Until love comes

771
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,680
leading

772
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,060
May LIU keep killing

773
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,440

774
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,300
may we be forgotten

775
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,400
Seize the opportunity

776
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,280
To seize the chance

777
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,320
Love can be felt all the time

778
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,440
It might start raining

779
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:12,960
You're wrong

780
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,040
Look

781
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,480
What do you want me to do?

782
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,160
You guessed it wrong.

783
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,800
You'll be punished.

784
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,760
Who said I guessed it wrong?

785
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,320
It's not over yet.

786
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,600
It's going to rain soon.

787
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,080
You're being unreasonable.

788
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:30,160
It hurts.

789
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,200
You're so big now.

790
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,240
If you dare to bully me again,

00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,440
I'll beat you up.

792
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,640
Beat you up?

You'll hurt me if I hurt you.

797
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,080
Why are you so happy?

798
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,520
You even beat me up.

799
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,880
What are you talking about?

800
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,600
I'm not talking about anything.

801
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,120
I mean,

802
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,600
you're right no matter what.

803
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,160
Are we going east or west today?

804
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,920
East or west?

805
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:14,960
You want to know?

806
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,520
Come on.

I'll go west.

810
