1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
What?

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We are far apart

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
A moment of flowers, a moment of spring

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I never leave you

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You don't understand

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
How much love I have

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I look at the flowers with my eyes

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
One Sequence

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Havoc

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I am in error

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Promise are my pen

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I will devote myself

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Hope, underthe Consumerял

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Can be a gentle sun

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,500
A Thousand calor kilometers

16
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,200
Episode自由

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,320
Cast Ruanriosha,

18
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,360
Zhuo Xuanyuan.

19
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:24,340
Is your USA

20
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,980
I didn't even have a chance to say goodbye.

21
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,380
At that time,

22
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,500
when you made the choice,

23
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,940
I really didn't know what to do.

24
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,020
If Lingxu Valley and Longyin City are to be fought,

25
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,820
I'd rather be the one

26
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,100
who is destined to be sacrificed.

27
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:55,820
I'm sorry.

28
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,460
Today,

29
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,580
the immortal is finally safe.

30
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,020
When things are settled,

31
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,860
I'll go find a tombstone

32
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,260
and go back to the cave to make an offering to the immortal.

33
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,220
From now on,

34
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,740
it will be the anniversary of the immortal.

35
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:11,900
From now on,

36
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,780
I will also come often

37
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,700
to worship the immortal.

38
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,740
Mother,

39
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,380
I made a mistake.

40
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,340
You're considerate.

41
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,300
I don't know where I'll go after a hundred years.

42
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,340
Your father's tomb is in the north.

43
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,180
If Lingxu Pavilion can be in your hands

44
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,220
and can spread the light in the world,

45
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,540
I can go to the Netherworld

46
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,700
and meet your father.

47
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,260
Mother, why are you saying this all of a sudden?

48
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,980
You will live a long life.

49
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,500
You have to be with me.

50
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,380
Watch your grandson grow up.

51
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,780
Watch your great-grandson grow up.

52
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,340
Watch your great-great-grandson grow up.

53
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,360
Watch your grandfather grow up.

54
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:55,740
Yes!

55
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:19,660
Yuer.

56
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:24,660
Mother, did something happen?

57
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,660
No.

58
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,660
I just want to tell you that if you are not here one day,

59
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,660
you just need to remember my kindness,

60
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,660
remember our love,

61
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,660
don't feel guilty or sad.

62
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,660
Because you are the most important light in my life.

63
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,660
Mother, what are you talking about?

64
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,660
I will never let anything happen to you.

65
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,660
I will protect you all the time.

66
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,660
Your father told me the same thing.

67
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,660
It's been a few days,

68
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,660
but there is still no news from the young lady.

69
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,660
The people of Longyin City have not stopped searching.

70
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,660
The same has not been obtained.

71
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,660
It's just that we can't communicate here.

72
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,660
I'm afraid we can't wait for the young lady to come back.

73
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,660
In the past,

74
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,660
Lingxu Pavilion has always been behind me.

75
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,660
No matter what I did,

76
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,660
my mother would forgive me.

77
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,660
But now,

78
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,660
Lingxu Pavilion is gone.

79
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,660
I can't go back to the past.

80
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,660
Maybe at this time,

81
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,660
there is no news of Hua'er.

82
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,660
It's good news.

83
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,660
But it's good news.

84
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,660
Although Rong Jingfeng took away the power of Longyin City,

85
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,660
with his surname,

86
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,660
it won't be so easy to lose.

87
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,660
He will send people back to investigate.

88
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,660
We can't stay here for long.

89
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,660
We'd better leave as soon as possible.

90
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,660
Don't worry.

91
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,660
The young lady will be fine.

92
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,660
Hua'er,

93
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,660
after all these,

94
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,660
you still have feelings for us

95
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,660
as usual.

96
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,660
If you remember,

97
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,660
will you come back here?

98
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,660
I must bring justice

99
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,660
to everything that happened this time.

100
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,660
I want the whole world

101
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,660
to see and accept the crime of revenge.

102
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,660
Yes.

103
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,660
Since then,

104
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,660
no matter how hard you try,

105
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,660
no one can come back.

106
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,660
If you ask for Buddha's help,

107
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,660
there won't be so many

108
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,660
unfair things in the world.

109
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,660
And no poison that can be used to kill.

110
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,660
Believe or not,

111
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,660
it depends on everyone's heart.

112
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,660
I'm so hard-working.

113
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,660
I just hope that my wish can come true.

114
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,660
I'm sorry.

115
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,660
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,660
I'm sorry.

117
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,660
There are some things

118
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,660
that can be settled

119
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,660
no matter how many wrongs there are.

120
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,660
What will happen in the future?

121
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,660
Who can predict it?

122
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,660
You left Longyin City

123
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,660
for the sake of Nalan Yuan.

124
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,660
Now Lingxu Pavilion is destroyed by Longyin City.

125
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,660
Has your mind changed?

126
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,660
I wanted to give up

127
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,660
the idea of being surrounded by my father

128
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,660
with my own money.

129
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,660
At that moment,

130
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,660
I gave up all the ideas

131
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,660
that I had.

132
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,660
I held the heart of being killed

133
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,660
but you saved me.

134
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,660
I know you will never

135
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,660
forgive Longyin City.

136
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,660
You want to do your best

137
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,660
to seek justice for your people.

138
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,660
Since you saved my life,

139
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,660
I can kill you or kill you.

140
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,660
Whatever you want.

141
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,660
Long Jingfeng, are you willing to do it?

142
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,660
Even if you use the whole Longyin City,

143
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,660
it's not a fault

144
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,660
for the death of Nalan family and Lingxu Pavilion.

145
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,660
Do it.

146
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,660
God arranged me to save you.

147
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,660
Do you know why?

148
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,660
Just because you are

149
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,660
Rong Jingfeng's daughter,

150
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,660
her sin

151
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,660
can't be punished

152
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,660
even if she dies ten times.

153
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,660
As a person of Longyin City,

154
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,660
you are not yet responsible.

155
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,660
You should take back

156
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,660
my debt.

157
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,660
Since I'm alive,

158
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,660
I can't be ruined.

159
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,660
Don't worry.

160
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,660
I will have an explanation

161
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,660
for Longyin City and Lingxu Pavilion.

162
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,660
Go.

163
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,660
Stop.

164
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,660
I can't even eat a bun.

165
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,660
Which family are you from?

166
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,660
Meiyang and I have broken up

167
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,660
our brotherhood.

168
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,660
Why do you have to come here

169
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,660
and force each other?

170
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,660
Meiyang?

171
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,660
You...

172
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,660
You are not from Longyin City?

173
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,660
I'm not.

174
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,660
It's okay.

175
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,660
I thought he sent someone

176
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,660
to chase me back.

177
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,660
Miss,

178
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,660
I heard you say

179
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,660
that you have broken up

180
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,660
your brotherhood

181
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,660
with your sister.

182
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,660
All along,

183
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,660
I thought my brother

184
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,660
was a little competitive.

185
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,660
But I didn't expect

186
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,660
he didn't care about

187
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,660
other people's lives

188
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,660
for his own interests.

189
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,660
I can't accept

190
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,660
or tolerate

191
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,660
such a brother.

192
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,660
It's okay if he doesn't want you.

193
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,660
But, Miss Mei,

194
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,660
it's not easy

195
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,660
to get rid of them

196
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,660
if you don't know martial arts.

197
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,660
How about

198
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,660
we go together?

199
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,660
You follow me.

200
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,660
We can take care of each other.

201
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,660
How do you know my last name?

202
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,660
I know your brother,

203
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,660
Mei Ying.

204
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,660
Who are you?

205
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,660
I am...

206
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,660
I am the apprentice of Na Lanyue,

207
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,660
the master of Rong Hua Girl,

208
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,660
and the owner

209
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,660
of the Lao Zi Hall in Longyin City.

210
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,660
But,

211
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,660
it's all in the past.

212
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,660
I told you just now.

213
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,660
I am not

214
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,660
a member of Longyin City.

215
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,660
You...

216
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,660
You are Senior Bai Weizhi.

217
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,660
That's me.

218
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,660
Why do you

219
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,660
light a lantern every day?

220
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,660
I just hope

221
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,660
he can come back safely.

222
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,660
It's so late.

223
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,660
Why do you light the lantern?

224
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,660
I don't believe it,

225
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,660
but I want to know

226
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,660
how you feel.

227
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,660
I don't believe it,

228
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,660
but I think

229
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,660
the one who wishes to do it

230
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,660
must be a promising person.

231
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,660
Such a one-time help

232
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,660
may be better

233
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,660
than not asking anything.

234
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,660
Yue,

235
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,660
how about

236
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,660
we write a wish again

237
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,660
and put the lantern back in the sky?

238
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,660
What do you think?

239
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,660
It's just a trick

240
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,660
of the person who sells the lantern.

241
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,660
It's just a joke.

242
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,660
What evidence can prove

243
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,660
that he can help people make their wishes come true?

244
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,660
I'll go see what they write.

245
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,660
Is it okay to write something?

246
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,660
Let's go.

247
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,660
When it's dawn,

248
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,660
we still need to find a place to hide.

249
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,660
In the dark,

250
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,660
we can go wherever we want.

251
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,660
If praying is useful,

252
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,660
I'd like to use all my luck

253
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,660
to change to living in peace.

254
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,660
You said you were going to the Snow League in person.

255
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,660
At this critical moment,

256
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,660
the world is in a panic.

257
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,660
It's not peaceful at all.

258
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,660
You're special.

259
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,660
How can you show up so easily?

260
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,660
Besides,

261
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,660
we can't go to the Snow League.

262
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,660
Yue told me

263
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,660
that the real master of the Snow League is Mohua.

264
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,660
Everything related to the Snow League

265
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,660
is controlled by her.

266
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,660
When the Lingxu Pavilion was raided,

267
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,660
the people of the Ling Sect were there.

268
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,660
It seems that

269
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,660
they are not involved.

270
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,660
I suspect

271
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,660
Mohua has saved Yue.

272
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,660
Now she's in the Snow League.

273
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,660
So I have to go there.

274
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,660
If the answer is not what you think,

275
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,660
you'll be more disappointed.

276
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,660
I'm already in the bottom of the valley.

277
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,660
I can't sit and wait.

278
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,660
Every time I hear news,

279
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,660
it's hope for me.

280
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,660
Anyway, I don't understand you anymore.

281
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,660
Since you want to go,

282
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,660
I'll go with you.

283
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,660
You're right.

284
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,660
Although I have many grudges against her,

285
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,660
she's the descendant of the Nalan family.

286
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,660
I can't just let her go.

287
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,660
Even if she's dead,

288
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,660
I have to see it with my own eyes.

289
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,660
You're in a cold state.

290
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,660
Plus, that sword is badly injured.

291
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,660
It takes some time

292
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,660
to recover.

293
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,660
You have to learn to stand up.

294
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,660
From now on,

295
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,660
no one will pity you

296
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,660
and help you

297
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,660
no matter how low you are.

298
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,660
Saving your life

299
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,660
is my greatest kindness.

300
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,660
From now on,

301
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,660
you can only rely on yourself.

302
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,660
I'll go with you.

303
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,660
I'll go with you.

304
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,660
Have you found

305
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,660
the person you want to see?

306
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,660
Who?

307
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,660
You knew

308
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,660
I had nothing this time.

309
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,660
You agreed to let me go back to Lingxu Pavilion

310
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,660
just to thank you

311
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,660
and agree to your offer.

312
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,660
You're smart.

313
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,660
So what?

314
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,660
You have no choice.

315
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,660
Really?

316
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,660
Then I'll be straight.

317
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,660
I won't accept your offer.

318
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,660
I'll take back everything

319
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,660
Lingxu Pavilion and the Nalan family

320
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,660
suffered from

321
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,660
with my own strength.

322
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,660
Whether it's dignity

323
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,660
or my life,

324
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,660
I'll make Rong Jingfeng kneel down

325
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,660
and apologize to everyone.

326
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,660
As for the Ling Sect,

327
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,660
I will never be part of it.

328
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,660
I will never be involved

329
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,660
with the Ling Sect.

330
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,660
You're not a coward.

331
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,660
You're not filial.

332
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,660
Do you know what you're saying now?

333
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,660
What price you'll pay in the future?

334
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,660
I don't care what price I pay.

335
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,660
As long as it's the thing

336
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,660
I decided to do with Nalan Yue,

337
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,660
no one can change it.

338
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,660
You...

339
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,660
You're so stubborn.

340
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,660
You really went with your mother.

341
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,660
If the people of Luyun City

342
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,660
knew you were still alive,

343
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,660
they wouldn't let you go.

344
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,660
You can't be angry

345
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,660
if you don't go to the Ling Sect.

346
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,660
I don't

347
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,660
have any worries now.

348
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,660
No matter what the purpose of Luyun City is,

349
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,660
I'll follow it to the end.

350
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,660
Ayu,

351
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,660
the situation is already dead.

352
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,660
No matter how you fight,

353
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,660
you can't change the fact.

354
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,660
It's just your persistence.

355
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,660
If you want revenge,

356
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,660
you have to bear with what you can't bear

357
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,660
and take the long-term measures.

358
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,660
Please think twice, Young Master.

359
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,660
The Ling Sect's invitation

360
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,660
is a very important decision.

361
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,660
Your Majesty,

362
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,660
someone is asking to see you.

363
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,660
Who is it?

364
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,660
It's...

365
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,660
Nalan Yue's wife, Rong Hua.

366
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,660
Since everyone is here,

367
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,660
let's invite them in.

368
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,660
Yes.

369
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,660
Ayu.

370
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,660
Ayu.

371
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,660
It seems that this girl is really lucky.

372
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,660
Ayu.

373
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,660
Ayu.

374
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,660
She's still alive after seeing her.

375
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,660
She can still avoid

376
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,660
the chase of Long Yun City for days.

377
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,660
She's really unlucky.

378
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,660
Ayu.

379
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,660
Ayu.

380
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,660
Master, the Zhihua Pearl in her body

381
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,660
has returned to life.

382
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,660
Now only you can save her.

383
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,660
Please help us.

384
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,660
That day,

385
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,660
Master Ming promised his wife

386
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,660
and saved Young Master.

387
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,660
You can't break your promise.

388
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,660
Rong Jingfeng only knows

389
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,660
that the Zhihua Pearl can bring people back to life.

390
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,660
But he doesn't know

391
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,660
that her real purpose is more important.

392
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,660
After three lives and three deaths,

393
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,660
the Zhihua Pearl is completely different from the ordinary one.

394
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,660
Only those who use it

395
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,660
can use the Xuanbing Talisman

396
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,660
to remove the poison of self-reflection.

397
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,660
Otherwise,

398
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,660
you will die in the night

399
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,660
without any mercy.

400
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,660
No way.

401
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,660
No way.

402
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,660
You think the Nalan family was chased and killed,

403
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,660
and Lingxu Pavilion was destroyed.

404
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,660
That's your end.

405
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,660
That's before you met the Zhihua Pearl.

406
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,660
It's still far away.

407
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,660
That's your end.

408
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,660
You forced my mother

409
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,660
to sacrifice for me

410
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,660
just to make me like this?

411
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,660
That's right.

412
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,660
Since I came back to the Jianghu,

413
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,660
I've been keeping her life

414
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,660
since I found her.

415
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,660
What I really want

416
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,660
is not only the Zhihua Pearl,

417
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,660
but you,

418
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,660
Nalan Yu.

419
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,660
Nalan Yu?

420
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,660
I wonder if the Snow League has the information I want.

421
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,660
Miss Rong should know the rules of the Snow League.

422
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,660
If you want to know the information,

423
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,660
you have to pay a corresponding price.

424
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,660
The Snow League never does business with losses.

425
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,660
I understand the rules of the Snow League.

426
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,660
As long as you can give me the answer I want,

427
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,660
I will pay you the corresponding price.

428
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,660
Come with me.

429
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,660
For so many years,

430
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,660
I've never stopped looking for information about Mohuan.

431
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,660
But I still didn't get anything.

432
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,660
I didn't expect

433
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,660
she would hide here.

434
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,660
Revenge is not a matter of one move.

435
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,660
Don't be impulsive.

436
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,660
Let's go.

437
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,660
You knew all this, didn't you?

438
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,660
I...I didn't know.

439
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,660
I didn't know it would turn out like this.

440
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,660
You were unconscious.

441
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,660
This is the only way to save your life.

442
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,660
It's okay.

443
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,660
It's okay.

444
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,660
It's okay.

445
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,660
Why?

446
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,660
Why did you save me?

447
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,660
I naturally have my own plans.

448
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,660
Your Majesty,

449
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,660
Ruohua wants to see you.

450
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,660
Open the door.

451
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,660
I want to ask you

452
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,660
about the Snow League.

453
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,660
Do you know where the people of Lingxu Pavilion are?

454
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,660
It seems that someone saved you that night.

455
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,660
God made me live.

456
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,660
He must have his own plan.

457
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,660
That day,

458
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,660
I saw the people of the Ling Sect were there.

459
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,660
I don't know.

460
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,660
That day,

461
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,660
we went to Lingxu Pavilion,

462
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,660
but it was still too late.

463
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,660
Too late?

464
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,660
The Meis were destroyed.

465
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,660
The people sent by the Snow League

466
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,660
were detained by Longyin City.

467
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,660
So the news of Longyin City

468
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,660
was not reported in time.

469
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,660
Lingxu Pavilion was also not informed.

470
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,660
All this

471
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,660
is due to your father,

472
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,660
Rong Jingfeng.

473
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,660
If you can have the same

474
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,660
evil thoughts as me,

475
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,660
I'm afraid you can help Lingxu Pavilion

476
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,660
to avoid the disaster.

477
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,660
You are worried about the people of the Jianghu,

478
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,660
knowing that the Chihua Bead was destroyed,

479
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,660
and it would be difficult for Longyin City.

480
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,660
So you hurried back to save it,

481
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,660
and you brought your beloved one.

482
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,660
But do you know

483
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,660
that your father, Rong Jingfeng,

484
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,660
wanted to kill his own sister

485
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,660
and his clanmen,

486
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,660
and set a trap

487
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,660
to scare the world?

488
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,660
I ask you,

489
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,660
if Rong Jingfeng were here,

490
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,660
would you help

491
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,660
Lingxu Pavilion

492
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,660
to get justice?

493
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,660
You don't dare?

494
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,660
Right?

495
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,660
Then what qualifications do you have

496
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,660
to ask about the lives of the people of Lingxu Pavilion?

497
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,660
I will definitely

498
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,660
confess to Longyin City

499
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,660
for Lingxu Pavilion's death.

500
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,660
I have my own way.

501
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,660
The most important thing now

502
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,660
is to get justice.

503
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,660
I will do it.

504
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,660
The most important thing now

505
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,660
is to find the whereabouts of others

506
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,660
in Lingxu Pavilion.

507
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,660
Everyone in Lingxu Pavilion

508
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,660
died in the way of the day.

509
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,660
Your father, Rong Jingfeng,

510
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,660
set up a heavy ambush

511
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,660
at every exit.

512
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,660
Do you think anyone can escape?

513
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,660
Then the last fire

514
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,660
destroyed everything in Lingxu Pavilion.

515
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,660
Even the body was burned to ashes.

516
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,660
Do you think

517
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,660
the people you are looking for

518
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,660
still have hope to live on?

519
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,660
No matter what,

520
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,660
I have to hold on until the end.

521
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,660
As long as you know

522
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,660
about any news about Lingxu Pavilion,

523
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,660
tell me.

524
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,660
I will pay

525
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,660
whatever you want.

526
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,660
Rong Jingfeng once said

527
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,660
whether you are alive or dead,

528
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,660
he will find you

529
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,660
and take you back to Longyin City

530
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,660
to be punished.

531
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,660
Now your whereabouts have been exposed.

532
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,660
Aren't you afraid that the Snow League

533
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,660
will sell your news to Longyin City?

534
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,660
After all, the price he gave

535
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,660
is much higher

536
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,660
than yours.

537
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,660
That's good.

538
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,660
If the people of Lingxu Pavilion

539
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,660
know that I am still alive,

540
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,660
they will come to Longyin City

541
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,660
and take me back.

542
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,660
I'm sorry to bother you today.

543
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,660
I'm leaving.

544
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,660
Bye.

545
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,660
Your Highness,

546
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,660
the snow leaves of Longyin City

547
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,660
have been brought back by the peonies.

548
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,660
Now they are in the Snow League.

549
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,660
If you want to leave now,

550
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,660
I will take you back

551
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,660
to Longyin City.

552
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,660
I will take you back

553
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,660
to Longyin City.

554
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,660
I will take you back

555
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,660
to Longyin City.

556
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,660
I will take you back

557
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,660
to Longyin City.

558
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,660
I wonder

559
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,660
if we need

560
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,660
the people of the Snow League to protect us.

561
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,660
People of Longyin City are everywhere.

562
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,660
How long can I hide?

563
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,660
If I can't even get out of this door today,

564
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,660
how can I still stand in the underworld?

565
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,660
Yu.

566
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,660
Have you ever thought

567
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,660
what you can change when you go out?

568
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,660
Everything you want

569
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,660
can only be achieved

570
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,660
after you have been through it.

571
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,660
Isn't it what you want

572
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,660
when he is alive?

573
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,660
Yu.

574
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,660
Yu.

575
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,660
You can't leave me.

576
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,660
I will take you back

577
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,660
to Longyin City.

578
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,660
I will take you back

579
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,660
to Longyin City.

580
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,660
Yu.

581
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,660
Yu.

582
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,660
I'm sorry for what I did this time.

583
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,660
Please forgive me.

584
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,660
Stop talking nonsense.

585
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,660
But I...

586
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,660
Go away.

587
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,660
Welcome you.

588
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,660
I'm sorry.

589
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,660
Miss Liuli.

590
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,660
Miss Liuli.

591
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,660
I think

592
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,660
we should apologize to the chief

593
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,660
for Longyin City.

594
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,660
Don't be so rude.

595
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,660
I said I don't welcome you.

596
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,660
Just go.

597
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,660
But I think...

598
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,660
Miss Liuli.

599
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,660
You have been missing these days.

600
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,660
It's different.

601
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,660
You just let them go.

602
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,660
Now you only apologize

603
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,660
after you send them back.

604
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,660
Is Longyin City

605
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,660
going to

606
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,660
let Xue go so easily?

607
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,660
So I have to apologize

608
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,660
and explain the reason.

609
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,660
Miss Long.

610
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,660
Thank you for covering for me.

611
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,660
It was really too late.

612
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,660
Then we should go.

613
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,660
Let's go, Jingyuan.

614
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,660
So you are not

615
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,660
always on guard.

616
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,660
I didn't expect

617
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,660
that you would be

618
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,660
in our team.

619
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,660
What's going on?

620
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,660
Where are they?

621
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,660
Don't worry, Chief.

622
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,660
They have left safely.

623
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,660
They didn't show any flaws.

624
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,660
I think

625
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,660
they are not in the same team.

626
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,660
They are not.

627
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,660
They have left safely.

628
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,660
They didn't show any flaws.

629
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,660
But Xuanye Island is here.

630
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,660
I'm afraid Longyin City

631
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,660
will be

632
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,660
on our side.

633
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,660
Bai Weizhi has been out for so long.

634
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,660
We can't even

635
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,660
find him.

636
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,660
What?

637
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,660
Did you

638
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,960
become a

639
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,660
white-shirt?

640
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,660
You don't even know

641
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,660
what to do.

642
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,660
Chief Bai always

643
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,660
knows about

644
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,660
Longyin City's

645
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,660
hidden secrets.

646
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,660
It's hard to find

647
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,660
his whereabouts.

648
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,660
But I heard

649
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,660
that Chief Bai has a master.

650
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,660
He was a master

651
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,660
who taught him

652
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,660
the martial arts.

653
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,660
If he insists

654
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,660
on finding him,

655
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,660
he may

656
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,660
use this master.

657
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,660
You are so

658
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,660
open-minded.

659
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,660
Don't you know

660
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,660
that this old master

661
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,660
of Bai Weizhi

662
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,660
is a martial arts expert

663
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,660
who was in the same team

664
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,660
with Mo Huan.

665
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,660
You can't even

666
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,660
defeat him

667
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,660
with your little help.

668
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,660
Since we have to

669
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,660
go back,

670
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,660
Longyin City

671
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,660
will have to

672
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,660
use some unusual methods.

673
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,660
You are still talking back.

674
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,660
Chief Bai,

675
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,660
don't worry too much.

676
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,660
Bai

677
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,660
is just out

678
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,660
to relax.

679
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,660
When he's out of anger,

680
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,660
he'll be back.

681
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,660
We can't

682
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,660
push him too hard.

683
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,660
Otherwise,

684
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,660
he will do

685
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,660
something more out of line.

686
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,660
You guys...

687
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,660
Chief.

688
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,660
If you guys

689
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,660
are so soft-hearted,

690
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,660
how can you

691
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,660
help Longyin City and Chief?

692
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,660
As the leader of the Hall of Life,

693
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,660
I can't just sit around and do nothing.

694
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,660
Chief,

695
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,660
why don't you

696
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,660
let the Hall of Life handle this?

697
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,660
The Hall of Life

698
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,660
won't let you down.

699
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,660
You haven't

700
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,660
found your sister yet.

701
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,660
Don't be in a hurry

702
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,660
to do something else.

703
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,660
Enough.

704
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,660
Stop arguing.

705
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,660
This matter

706
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,660
should be handled by the Hall of Life.

707
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,660
But you have to remember

708
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,660
that this is an internal matter

709
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,660
of Longyin City.

710
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,660
Don't let it go unnoticed.

711
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,660
Yes.

712
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,660
Don't worry, Chief Mei.

713
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,660
If there's a chance,

714
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,660
the Hall of Life will

715
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,660
bring your sister back.

716
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,660
Here.

717
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,660
Here.

718
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,660
All the way here,

719
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,660
I didn't see Mei Ying

720
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:32,660
send someone to find you.

721
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,660
She can even

722
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:36,660
give up the whole Mei family.

723
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,660
I'm not that important

724
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,660
to her.

725
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,660
Only power and status

726
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,660
are what she can't give up.

727
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,660
Here's the food.

728
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:48,660
Two guests.

729
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,660
Please wait a moment.

730
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,660
Thank you.

731
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,660
Thank you.

732
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,660
Thank you.

733
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,660
Two taels in total.

734
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,660
Okay.

735
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,660
Thank you.

736
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,660
I'm a quick-witted person.

737
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,660
I don't have any money on me.

738
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,660
All the way here,

739
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,660
I spent all the money

740
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,660
of Senior Bai.

741
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,660
Don't think like that.

742
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,660
You're a weak girl.

743
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,660
How much money can you spend on me?

744
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,660
The point is,

745
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,660
I'm used to

746
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,660
spending money on you.

747
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,660
I didn't save

748
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,660
much money on the way.

749
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,660
Eat.

750
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,660
Do you know?

751
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,660
I heard that

752
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,660
there's a man

753
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,660
living on the Black Stone Mountain

754
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,660
five or six miles from here.

755
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,660
He's good at martial arts,

756
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,660
but he got

757
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,660
a incurable

758
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,660
small problem.

759
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,660
Now,

760
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,660
he's looking for

761
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,660
a master

762
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,660
to help him.

763
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,660
I know that.

764
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,660
I know that, too.

765
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,660
It's said that if he can

766
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,660
cure his illness,

767
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,660
it'll be a lot of trouble.

768
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,660
I heard that Senior Bai

769
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,660
is good at medical skills.

770
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,660
Why don't we

771
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,660
go to the Black Stone Mountain

772
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,660
and try it?

773
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:05,660
Not only can we cure people's disease,

774
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,660
we can also make some money.

775
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,660
I can see that.

776
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,660
Walking around the world

777
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,660
is not about

778
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,660
martial arts skills.

779
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,660
It's about money.

780
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,660
Money.

781
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,660
You're right.

782
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,660
I've found out

783
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,660
that the man

784
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,660
who lives in the Black Stone Mountain

785
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,660
is helping

786
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,660
the man who's on the side.

787
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,660
However,

788
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,660
I heard that many people

789
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,660
who came to the Black Stone Mountain

790
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,660
without any merit

791
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,660
were even more kind

792
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,660
because of that

793
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,660
weird-tempered man

794
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,660
who scolded him for a long time.

795
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,660
Miss Rong Hua,

796
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,660
after leaving the Snow League,

797
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,660
I asked you what you were going to do.

798
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,660
But you asked Xiao Feng

799
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:57,660
to come to the Black Stone Mountain

800
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,660
to ask a master called Bai Su.

801
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,660
You even asked him

802
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,660
if he was a playboy.

803
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,660
Why is that?

804
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,660
I heard from Master that

805
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,660
Senior Bai

806
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,660
is the only master

807
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,660
who can be compared with Mo Huan.

808
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:17,660
Although I don't know

809
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,660
why Master

810
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,660
was kicked out of the sect,

811
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:21,660
Senior Bai is my master.

812
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,660
He's also a bit distant from me.

813
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,660
You want to use this Bai Su

814
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:29,660
to help you

815
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,660
to stand firm in the martial arts world?

816
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,660
Senior Bai has a lot of master.

817
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,660
He's a famous senior

818
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,660
in the martial arts world.

819
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,660
How sure are you

820
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,660
that he will come to the mountain?

821
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,660
Before I met him,

822
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,660
I didn't know

823
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,660
how sure I was.

824
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,660
But this time,

825
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,660
we must go to the mountain

826
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,660
to do our best.

827
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,660
When the Linxu Pavilion was attacked,

828
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,660
the spiritual cult was there.

829
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,660
They must know

830
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:56,660
where the people of the Linxu Pavilion

831
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,660
who survived are.

832
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,660
But I joined the Snow League.

833
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,660
The people of the Snow League

834
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:02,660
didn't put me in the dark.

835
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,660
I must stand firm in the martial arts world

836
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,660
to be able to

837
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,660
talk to them.

838
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,660
I must stand firm in the martial arts world

839
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,660
to be able to talk to them.

840
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,660
This time,

841
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,660
we don't want to reveal

842
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,660
our identities.

843
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,660
When I've cured

844
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,660
Senior Bai's playboy,

845
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,660
I'll make a plan.

846
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,660
Yes.

847
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,660
According to the news

848
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,660
of the Snow League,

849
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,660
Hua'er

850
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,660
must have come to the mountain

851
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,660
to find the spiritual cult.

852
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,660
The spiritual cult

853
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:44,660
is the place

854
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,660
where the people of the Linxu Pavilion

855
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,660
who survived the attack

856
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,660
came to the mountain.

857
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,660
The spiritual cult

858
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,620
he must have come to this Black Stone Mountain.

859
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,620
You still can't rest assured about him?

860
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,900
As long as Hua'er is with me,

861
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,180
I can go to the North Desert without any worries.

862
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:01,980
I don't know

863
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,700
when I can see him again.

864
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,780
After I practiced the Black Ice Talisman,

865
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,780
I don't know if I'm a man or a ghost.

866
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:13,660
Young Master.

867
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,140
Senior Bai,

868
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,780
I've asked around.

869
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,340
This master

870
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:21,100
is arrogant and hard to get along with.

871
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,660
The doctors haven't taken care of him.

872
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,500
He might get angry

873
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,780
because he doesn't know what to say.

874
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,660
He'll be driven out of the house.

875
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,900
It must be hard to cure him.

876
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,100
In my opinion,

877
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,740
this master's little plaything

878
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,380
is probably caused by his bad temper

879
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,020
and his constant anger.

880
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:37,620
You know what?

881
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,420
When he gets angry,

882
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,580
he'll only get worse

883
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,020
and you'll live a long life.

884
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,020
You're right. Let's go.

885
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,060
Little girl, let me do it.

886
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,540
I'm Bai Weizhi.

887
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,620
I heard that you're a great man.

888
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,500
So I came here

889
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,140
to learn from you

890
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,100
and share your worries.

891
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:48,500
Master.

892
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:51,900
Little girl,

893
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,860
you're säul of a bright mind.

894
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,900
Why is it that you knows everything about you?

895
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,020
You don't know

896
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,900
only Bai Su.

897
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,420
Everyone hasta

898
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,260
aneny of his round-about skills.

899
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:07,420
He't dare regard his name

900
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,820
and how could he

901
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:15,700
make

902
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,140
I was just a little greedy when I was a kid.

903
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,620
I was kicked out of the school.

904
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,420
Who would have thought that after so many years,

905
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:25,300
I'd still be so rude to me after we met.

906
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:25,900
I...

907
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:27,860
Greedy?

908
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,060
Senior Bai,

909
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:33,060
you were kicked out of the school because of this?

910
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:35,700
Don't mention it.

911
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:36,700
Let's go back to the past.

912
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:37,940
Let's not mention it.

913
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,820
But now it seems that

914
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:43,060
we want to make some money.

915
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,500
I'm afraid we're going to be left out.

916
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,140
But Senior Bai,

917
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,580
you can take this opportunity

918
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:50,940
to repair the relationship between you and Bai Su.

919
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,180
How can I repair it?

920
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:58,020
I've never been convinced of Rong Jingfeng.

921
00:41:58,820 --> 00:41:59,700
Back then,

922
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,420
Master and Mohuan were well-known.

923
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,980
So after Rong Jingfeng was defeated by Mohuan,

924
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,580
I naturally didn't accept it.

925
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,060
I was so embarrassed

926
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,420
and was defeated by Master Bai Su.

927
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:12,620
If Rong Jingfeng betrays the spiritual cult,

928
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,420
and I'm kicked out of the school,

929
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,020
I...

930
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,540
I'd just come to Longyin City with him.

931
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:20,780
But Master broke off the relationship.

932
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:23,780
Senior Bai,

933
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:26,020
how did you get into the school?

934
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:28,740
Why don't you try the same method this time?

935
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:32,340
I didn't know what's wrong with my back when I was a kid.

936
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,340
Now I...

937
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,500
Let's think of another way.

938
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:23,340
The mountains are

939
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,420
Pi's hometown I went to

940
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:33,500
My heart has lost

941
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,220
You're gone

942
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:36,620
Mhm

943
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,620
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

944
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,620
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

945
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:12,620
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

946
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:14,620
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

947
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:16,620
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

948
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,620
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

949
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,620
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

950
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:22,620
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

951
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,620
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

952
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,620
