1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We are far apart

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
A moment of flowers, a moment of love

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I never know you are not here

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
How much love is in my heart

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The most beautiful flower in my eyes

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hurry to mathematics, prepare to be a model

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Spring is bitter, and when young the time feels strange

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Promise to Mikuna is a love

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Ending will be sure to share

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I hope that the well-hesto love will plan for the 앞에

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
A Love So Romantic

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Episode 05

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I got it.

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
If you let go,

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
you can't find me.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Don't cry.

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Master Wu Zhuang asked me to come and tell you

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
that Xuan Ye is fighting against the disciples of the Ling Sect

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
in Longyin City.

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
He's trying to break into the Ling Sect.

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Please decide on this.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Rong Su is the first one to offend.

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Xuan Ye is the second one to break into.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Then you tell me,

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
should I deal with Rong Su first

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
or solve Xuan Ye's problem first?

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I dare to come here alone.

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm prepared.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I told Xuan Ye

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
to go back in time

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and blow up the entrance of the Ling Sect with the gun.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Even if I die,

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I want you and the Ling Sect to die with me.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Good.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It seems that you haven't improved

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
in such a long time.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You're just a slave.

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You're just a slave.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Lu Yi Zhou

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
has several disciples guarding the entrance.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
He must keep Xuan Ye alive.

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Right.

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Tell Rong Jingfeng

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
that

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Longyin City

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
is in danger.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yes.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Go now.

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Go now.

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Guards.

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Take this girl down.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yes.

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Guards.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Guards.

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The leader should stay alive.

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The rest

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
shall be killed without mercy.

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yes.

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It seems that Lingxu Pavilion

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
also has a chance of being exposed.

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Our Lingxu Pavilion

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
will not be taken down by anyone.

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Today

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
the bloodbath of Longyin City.

65
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,120
I advise you

66
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,720
to tell him where the Hall Leader is.

67
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,000
Otherwise...

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,840
Otherwise what?

69
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,560
You plan to take this place as a flat land, right?

70
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,520
Your Hall Leader has this plan.

71
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,200
It's just a plan to return to the forbidden.

72
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,480
No.

73
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,240
He knew

74
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,240
he couldn't escape from Mohan's hand.

75
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,440
What do you want?

76
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,640
Don't worry.

77
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,120
Mohan won't kill him.

78
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,360
Don't struggle for nothing.

79
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,320
By the way,

80
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,280
I've sent all the fire medicine nearby.

81
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,920
Today, except you,

82
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,120
no one will leave alive.

83
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,360
I'll kill you today

84
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,600
to tell Rong Jingfeng

85
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,840
that he needs to pay

86
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,560
for the bloodbath of Lingxu Pavilion.

87
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:41,760
In the past,

88
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,160
whenever you heard about Mohan,

89
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,600
you must have been worried.

90
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,120
You fell into the Spirit Cult,

91
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,360
but you're so calm.

92
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,840
You're different from before.

93
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,080
Does the Grand Priest

94
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,720
always remain the same?

95
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,480
You came here

96
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,800
just to laugh at me?

97
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,880
I'm afraid I'll let you down.

98
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,160
I won't beg for mercy

99
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,800
and I won't let Longyin City down.

100
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,000
You people in Longyin City

101
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,360
are really kind.

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,200
You're the bad guys.

103
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,560
But you're so righteous

104
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,320
and so mischievous.

105
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,720
Won't you feel guilty

106
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,640
and guilty?

107
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,840
You just want to avenge Lingxu Pavilion.

108
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,040
I'm a prisoner now.

109
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,960
You can kill me directly.

110
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,920
Why bother?

111
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,640
Right.

112
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,480
YoYo English Channel YouTube

113
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,400
Mohan is right.

114
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,840
Even if you die for a while,

115
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,360
as long as you're alive,

116
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,000
there's still endless pain.

117
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,160
You're noble.

118
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,360
Like the darkness here.

119
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,440
There is no need

120
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,560
to be worried.

121
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,640
This is where I grew up.

122
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:00,920
Maybe my fear

123
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,560
is burried過 by this life of mine,

124
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,840
or I'm not used to it anyway.

125
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,400
These chains

126
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,800
were made specially for Mo Huan

127
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,800
to imprison me.

128
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,760
When I was young, I was not convinced.

129
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,280
I wanted to escape from here

130
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,240
by taking my uncle's life.

131
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,120
But I was cut off by two ribs.

132
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,800
Maybe the fear here

133
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,320
has long been gone.

134
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,880
You don't have to tell me this.

135
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,040
I used to

136
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,040
pity you for this.

137
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,280
But now,

138
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,560
I've seen through your heart.

139
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,160
No matter what you say,

140
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,760
it's no use.

141
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,040
By the way,

142
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,160
the disciple of Longyin City who came with you

143
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,920
has been killed with a rare skill.

144
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,080
Only Xuan Yi

145
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,040
is alive.

146
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,000
He's here to tell Rong Jingfeng.

147
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,360
I want you to know

148
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,640
that it's just the beginning.

149
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,600
It's not you.

150
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,480
No matter what you say,

151
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,640
it's not you.

152
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,280
You Yizhou,

153
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,160
you tried to deceive yourself.

154
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,520
But you can't deceive me.

155
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,920
If you're so cruel,

156
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,680
why did you

157
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,400
take the opportunity to come in

158
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,360
and stop Mohua?

159
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,840
You clearly have me in your heart.

160
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,200
But you dare not admit it.

161
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,760
Rong Su,

162
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,800
you overestimate yourself.

163
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,240
I wonder when

164
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,080
I'll destroy Longyin City

165
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,360
and kill your father.

166
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,760
I'll even order you to kill him.

167
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,800
I wonder if you'll have any pity.

168
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:35,960
I'll do it.

169
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,400
It's good.

170
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,800
In that case,

171
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,280
please do it yourself.

172
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,640
I don't want to fall into someone's hands

173
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,800
and take Mohua's heart.

174
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,000
Do you think I dare not?

175
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,680
I bet you dare not.

176
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,360
Okay.

177
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,760
Three days later,

178
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,520
I'll cut your meridians

179
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,720
and waste your martial arts.

180
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,840
I'll ask the disciples of the spiritual cult

181
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,760
to send you back to Longyin City.

182
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,960
I'd like to see

183
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,560
whether the love

184
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,120
is more important

185
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,160
in Rong Jingfeng's eyes

186
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,520
or his position as the City Leader.

187
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,640
Luo Yicheng, say it again.

188
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,400
Look at me and say it again.

189
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,200
Luo Yicheng.

190
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,720
Luo Yicheng.

191
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,940
부 receptor

192
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,360
Who's there?

193
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,160
The return hall, Xiaoxiao.

194
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,360
Why are you here?

195
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,200
Ms. Mei.

196
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,480
What on earth happened?

197
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,560
I'm sorry.

198
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,440
This time,

199
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,800
I took the disciples of the Holy Heir's Hall

200
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,080
to investigate Lingxu Pavilion,

201
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,200
but they were ambushed.

202
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,320
In my opinion,

203
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,000
Lingxu Pavilion is still alive.

204
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,480
It's in a state of emergency.

205
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,840
Where is Master Mei?

206
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,280
Where are the disciples of the Holy Heir's Hall?

207
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,440
I've already said it.

208
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,040
We were ambushed.

209
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,360
The disciples of the Holy Heir's Hall have no one to save.

210
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,640
Then why did you have to escape?

211
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,440
What do you mean?

212
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,200
A little sick disciple of the Holy Heir's Hall

213
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,040
You don't have to

214
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,440
put the Holy Heir's Hall in front of me.

215
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,960
How did you get the position of the Holy Heir's Hall?

216
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,640
We know it very well.

217
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,920
You just killed someone not long ago.

218
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,680
Now you've lost your man

219
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,720
and you report to the city.

220
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,720
Even if this matter

221
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,840
goes to the Holy Heir's Hall,

222
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,160
you can't blame him.

223
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,400
So you came here today

224
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,000
just to humiliate me in person, right?

225
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,760
Master Mei is serious.

226
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,360
I have a lot of things to do in the Holy Heir's Hall.

227
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,960
If it weren't for the Holy Heir's Order

228
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,240
to send me to pick up,

229
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,200
I wouldn't have bothered to care about your life and death.

230
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,040
I wouldn't have said anything about your discomfort.

231
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,480
Since we are both on different positions,

232
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,400
let's not waste time on each other.

233
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,800
Then I'll trouble Master Mei

234
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,440
to let Xiao Xiao check the injury

235
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,560
and give the medicine to Zheng.

236
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,080
No need.

237
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,400
It's just a minor injury.

238
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,520
I won't bother the Holy Heir's Hall to worry about it.

239
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,600
Since Master Mei said it's okay,

240
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,640
then Xiao Xiao will send someone back to report.

241
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,840
Please have a good rest.

242
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,120
As for the Holy Heir's Hall,

243
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,080
the City Leader has ordered

244
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,640
that Xiao Xiao will send someone to check it.

245
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,880
If there really is a fish in the water

246
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,360
and there is a hook in it,

247
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,040
it must be clear.

248
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,640
Goodbye.

249
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,480
Miss, please come in.

250
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,400
Although I'm not in any trouble this time,

251
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,600
I also trouble you to run away.

252
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,360
I thank you again.

253
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,480
Master Mei,

254
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,840
what do you want to say?

255
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,320
Ah.

256
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,600
When Miss Xiao Xiao goes to the Lingxu Pavilion

257
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600
to investigate,

258
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,240
if there is any new news,

259
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,880
please tell Master Mei.

260
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,600
After all,

261
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,720
I took the disciples of the Holy Heir's Hall to investigate

262
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,680
and was ambushed.

263
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,720
I must take revenge.

264
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,760
survived?

265
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,800
Chen Hua living despite yourself was destroyed.

266
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,880
Who is actually winning darkly.

267
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,180
You want to fight?

268
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,120
and the whole army was destroyed.

269
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,120
So the City Leader sent us to help.

270
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,120
But he didn't hurt at all.

271
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,120
What's going on?

272
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,120
You two stay here.

273
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,120
You must pay close attention to Meiyin's actions.

274
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,120
If anything goes wrong,

275
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,120
report it to me.

276
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,120
Yes.

277
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,120
Yue.

278
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,120
That's the residence of Senior Bai.

279
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,120
Master is there too.

280
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,120
Thanks to Senior Bai and the others,

281
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,120
I can control the movement of the Snow Trap

282
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,120
and cut off their source of information.

283
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,120
The Snow Trap

284
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,120
doesn't look that simple.

285
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,120
So you have to be careful.

286
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,120
I know.

287
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,120
But only by using the Snow Trap

288
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,120
can I control some of the martial arts.

289
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,120
Don't worry.

290
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,120
I have my own sense of propriety.

291
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,120
By the way,

292
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,120
Senior Bai is a kind person.

293
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,120
When you see him later,

294
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,120
don't mention him as my master's disciple.

295
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,120
Otherwise, he will be offended.

296
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,120
I know.

297
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,120
I heard

298
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,120
something about Senior Bai.

299
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,120
I didn't expect that he really exists.

300
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,120
Senior Bai has been out of the martial arts world.

301
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,120
But his disciples have made great achievements

302
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,120
and made great achievements.

303
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,120
Did Senior Bai help you get the plum blossom?

304
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,120
No.

305
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,120
Only the senior masters of Black Mountain

306
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,120
know about the cultivation of plum blossoms.

307
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,120
Only the senior masters of Black Mountain know about it.

308
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,120
How did you know?

309
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,120
I worshiped my mother before.

310
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,120
Then I went to Meiyuan to inquire about it.

311
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,120
I happened to see someone cultivating the fan.

312
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,120
So I asked around.

313
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,120
I didn't expect it was really you.

314
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,120
Forget it.

315
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,120
Let's go back.

316
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,120
Master will be very happy

317
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,120
if he knows you are back safely.

318
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,120
Let's go.

319
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,120
Let's go.

320
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,120
Among my many disciples,

321
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,120
you are the most useless.

322
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,120
Master, calm down.

323
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,120
Bai is not your disciple.

324
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,120
Fortunately, I was wise enough

325
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,120
to kick him out of the sect.

326
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,120
Otherwise,

327
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,120
he would have embarrassed me.

328
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,120
Then what should I do?

329
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,120
With your attitude,

330
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,120
you are not a good teacher.

331
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,120
Hurry up.

332
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,120
I'll go now.

333
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,120
Come back.

334
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,120
You are a traitor of Longyin City.

335
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,120
You even want to show up.

336
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,120
I asked him to go.

337
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,120
Master, don't worry.

338
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,120
I have sent people to go.

339
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,120
There are my wild lines nearby.

340
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,120
Even if I go underground,

341
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,120
I can find it.

342
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,120
You can't blame me.

343
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,120
I wanted to go myself.

344
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,120
You bitch.

345
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,120
Where have you been?

346
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,120
You are making me worried.

347
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,120
You...

348
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,120
Sorry to make you worried.

349
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,120
I'm fine.

350
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,120
Good.

351
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,120
Good.

352
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,120
Well,

353
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,120
look who I brought back.

354
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,120
Yue.

355
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,120
Master?

356
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,120
Bastard.

357
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,120
Who is your master?

358
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,120
I was wrong.

359
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,120
I...

360
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,120
I only have you.

361
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,120
Master.

362
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,120
This is

363
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,120
the young master of Lingxu Pavilion,

364
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,120
Na Lanyue.

365
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,120
I'm not blind.

366
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,120
I can see it.

367
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,120
She is

368
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,120
laughing at me.

369
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,120
I'm Na Lanyue.

370
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,120
Thank you for your care.

371
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,120
I'm glad

372
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,120
you care about me.

373
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,120
I was young and ignorant.

374
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,120
I knew my master

375
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,120
was a playboy.

376
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,120
How could I take it seriously?

377
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,120
Now that

378
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,120
I'm married to Hua,

379
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,120
I should call you master

380
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,120
just like Hua.

381
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,120
I did something wrong.

382
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,120
Please forgive me.

383
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,120
Well...

384
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,120
Listen to me.

385
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,120
Our previous grudges

386
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,120
are over.

387
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,120
Over.

388
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,120
Good.

389
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,120
Master.

390
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,120
I'm sorry.

391
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,120
I couldn't be with you

392
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,120
before.

393
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,120
I swear

394
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,120
from now on,

395
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,120
I'll take good care of you.

396
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,120
I'll do whatever you want.

397
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,120
I just hope

398
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,120
you can forgive me.

399
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,120
Enough.

400
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,120
Stop acting pitiful.

401
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,120
My little turtle

402
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,120
died in your hands.

403
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,120
She is more pitiful than you.

404
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,120
Who will sympathize with her?

405
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,120
Young man.

406
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,120
Since you're fine,

407
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,120
why did you keep avoiding me?

408
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,120
I'm sorry

409
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,120
to let these people

410
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,120
care about you for nothing.

411
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,120
What happened before

412
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,120
was too chaotic.

413
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,120
I was injured

414
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,120
because I tried to protect others.

415
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,120
I was also

416
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,120
in the process of recuperation.

417
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,120
So I really didn't have a chance

418
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,120
to tell you this news.

419
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,120
Besides,

420
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,120
Linxu Pavilion was destroyed.

421
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,120
I really didn't have the face

422
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,120
to face the people of my clan.

423
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,120
Master.

424
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,120
It's not easy for Yu

425
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,120
to come back after escaping from death.

426
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,120
How about

427
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,120
I make some dishes

428
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,120
for you today?

429
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,120
I'll let you try.

430
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,120
Good idea.

431
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,120
Good idea.

432
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,120
We usually eat

433
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,120
light food in the mountains.

434
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,120
We can take this opportunity

435
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,120
to make up for it.

436
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,120
Make up for it.

437
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,120
It's a good idea to save the life.

438
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,120
Although I'm small,

439
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,120
I'm safe.

440
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,120
It's the best way

441
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,120
to heal here.

442
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,120
Little girl,

443
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,120
she lives in your room.

444
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,120
Take your husband back to his room.

445
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,120
Master.

446
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,120
Thank you, Qian Mei.

447
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,120
We'll leave now.

448
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,120
Let's go.

449
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,120
He's really lucky.

450
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,120
It's good that he can come back alive.

451
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,620
Master.

452
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,120
Do you think

453
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,120
there's anything wrong

454
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,120
between them?

455
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,120
He's a good talker.

456
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,120
He's a good talker.

457
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,120
He's a good talker.

458
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,120
Even if he's good at hiding things,

459
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,120
it's hard for him

460
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,120
to escape

461
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,120
from me.

462
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,120
Master.

463
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,120
You mean

464
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,120
he's hiding something from her?

465
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,120
Go ask him.

466
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,120
You're so close to him.

467
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,120
Why are you asking me?

468
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,120
Master.

469
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,120
I didn't explain it clearly before.

470
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,120
It's just a misunderstanding.

471
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,120
I've only

472
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,120
thought about you.

473
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,120
Go find out

474
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,120
where he went

475
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,120
recently.

476
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,120
Why did he get so badly hurt?

477
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,120
Who healed him?

478
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,120
Why do you

479
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,120
care so much about this girl?

480
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,120
I'll go check it out.

481
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,120
Go.

482
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,120
You're so happy.

483
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,120
I'm happy

484
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,120
that you're back safe and sound.

485
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,120
I'm happier

486
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,120
to cook for you.

487
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,120
You're so happy.

488
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,120
I'm happy too.

489
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,120
I'll help you cut the vegetables.

490
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,120
I didn't expect you

491
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,120
to be a cook.

492
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,120
Cooking

493
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,120
is not that hard for me.

494
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,120
Here.

495
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,120
Really?

496
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,120
I don't know why

497
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,120
you suddenly met Young Madam

498
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,120
and followed her to Black Stone Mountain.

499
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,120
I followed her secretly,

500
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,120
but you didn't need to follow me.

501
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,120
That's why I came back first.

502
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,120
How come?

503
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,120
It was clearly Brother Nalan

504
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,120
who was worried that

505
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,120
Rong Hua knew about this.

506
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,120
He told her not to leak it out

507
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,120
and hid it together.

508
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,120
Now he has made thousands of requests.

509
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,120
He can't let anyone

510
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,120
know about it.

511
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,120
Why did he...

512
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,120
Miss Mei, don't worry.

513
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,120
Young Master

514
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,120
has his own plans.

515
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,120
Brother Nalan

516
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,120
always knows what to do.

517
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,120
But when he met

518
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,120
Sister Rong Hua,

519
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,120
he was confused.

520
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,120
Now,

521
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,120
he hasn't recovered from his power

522
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,120
and he's taking a rash move.

523
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,120
If he meets

524
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,120
someone from Longyin City,

525
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,120
he'll be in a bad situation.

526
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,120
I'll go to Black Stone Mountain

527
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,120
and find Young Master.

528
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,120
I'll go with you.

529
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,120
If anything happens,

530
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,120
we can take care of it.

531
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,120
Where did A Yue

532
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,120
go in the middle of the night?

533
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,120
I don't know.

534
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,120
You're a married girl.

535
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,120
You're so lucky.

536
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,120
You didn't eat fruit

537
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,120
in the whole yard.

538
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,120
But you have this bad luck.

539
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,120
You're so...

540
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,120
Master,

541
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,120
A Yue hasn't recovered yet.

542
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,120
I have to take care of him.

543
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,120
You're so healthy

544
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,120
that you can eat and drink.

545
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,120
Of course you won't

546
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,120
argue with me.

547
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,120
That's true.

548
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,120
But you...

549
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,120
Thank you for your understanding.

550
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,120
By the way,

551
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,120
did you see A Yue?

552
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,120
She...

553
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,120
She wasn't in the room?

554
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,120
I thought you two

555
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,120
were together.

556
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,120
That's strange.

557
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,120
She said she'd help me

558
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,120
clean up.

559
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,120
Why did she disappear

560
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,120
so suddenly?

561
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,120
Don't worry.

562
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,120
Maybe

563
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,120
she's on the mountain

564
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,120
to have a look.

565
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,120
No.

566
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,120
I have to go find her.

567
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,120
Wait.

568
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,120
I have something to ask you.

569
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,120
What's wrong, Master?

570
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,120
Do you know

571
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,120
where this kid

572
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,120
is hiding these days?

573
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,120
I heard

574
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,120
Lingxu Pavilion was destroyed.

575
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,120
The fire was burning all night.

576
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,120
No one was alive in the room.

577
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,120
How did he escape?

578
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,120
I always feel

579
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,120
that I felt

580
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,120
a sense of loss

581
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,120
when I saw him this time.

582
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,120
Master,

583
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,120
I also want to ask

584
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,120
if you

585
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,120
have any idea

586
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,120
about the scene

587
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,120
that happened that night

588
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,120
and if he doesn't want to tell me,

589
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,120
forget it.

590
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,120
After all,

591
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,120
it's more important

592
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,120
that he comes back safe and sound.

593
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,120
I'll bear

594
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,120
the responsibility

595
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,120
with him in the future.

596
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,120
You silly girl,

597
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,120
you forgot

598
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,120
that the hatred between a family and a friend

599
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,120
is not fair.

600
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,120
If one day

601
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,120
Longyin City and the Nalan family

602
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,120
are really on the opposite sides,

603
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,120
how will you face your father

604
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,120
and Nalan Yue?

605
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,120
No matter how much

606
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,120
wrongful things Rong Jingfeng did,

607
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,120
he is your blood relative after all.

608
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,120
But he has a deep hatred

609
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,120
between him and Nalan Yue.

610
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,120
This...

611
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,120
Can you bear this?

612
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,120
The mountain road is uneven.

613
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,120
Miss Mei, be careful.

614
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,120
It's okay.

615
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,120
I'm worried about Nalan Yue.

616
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,120
We should take the necessary steps

617
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,120
to find him first.

618
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,120
I

619
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,120
have a question

620
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,120
for Miss Mei.

621
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,120
Brother Cang Qi,

622
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,120
it's okay to say it.

623
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,120
Why are you so persistent

624
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,120
and always stay by Young Master?

625
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,120
You know

626
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,120
he won't respond.

627
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,120
I'm sorry.

628
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,120
I'm sorry.

629
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,120
I'm sorry.

630
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,120
I'm sorry.

631
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,120
I didn't mean anything else.

632
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,120
If you don't want to say it,

633
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,120
you can just say it.

634
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,120
Do you think I'm stupid?

635
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,120
I also think

636
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,120
I'm stupid.

637
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,120
But

638
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,120
I just want to

639
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,120
be with him.

640
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,120
It's enough

641
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,120
to see him well.

642
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,120
He doesn't need to respond.

643
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,120
Maybe

644
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,120
he can't understand

645
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,120
my thoughts.

646
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,120
I understand.

647
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,120
It's Brother Nalan.

648
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,120
This is the residence

649
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,120
of Senior Bai.

650
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,120
Senior's martial arts are unspecified.

651
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,120
You can't go any further

652
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,120
to avoid revealing your whereabouts.

653
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,120
I'm afraid that Young Master's secret

654
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,120
will be exposed.

655
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,120
I'm afraid that Young Master's secret

656
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,120
will be exposed.

657
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,120
It's not Brother Cang Qi's fault.

658
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,120
I'm afraid of Brother Nalan's safety.

659
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,120
So I asked him to bring me here.

660
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,120
Brother Nalan,

661
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,120
even for the safety of Sister Rong,

662
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,120
you can't show up here.

663
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,120
If...

664
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,120
I have my own plans.

665
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,120
You can do as planned.

666
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,120
I just want to see him.

667
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,120
After I make sure he's safe,

668
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,120
I'll go back soon.

669
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,120
Brother.

670
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,120
Yue.

671
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,120
Where are you?

672
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,120
Yue.

673
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,120
Miss Mei, let's leave here first.

674
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,120
Young Master has his own plans.

675
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,120
We can't expose ourselves now.

676
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,120
I hope Young Master

677
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,120
won't forget the mission of the Nalan family.

678
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,120
Brother Nalan,

679
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,120
you must be careful.

680
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,120
Yue.

681
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,120
Who were you talking to?

682
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,120
Who were you talking to?

683
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,120
I wasn't talking to anyone.

684
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,120
I've been here for a while.

685
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,120
I didn't see anyone.

686
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,120
You must have seen it wrong.

687
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,120
Did I really see it wrong?

688
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,120
It's cold and humid in the mountains tonight.

689
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,120
Why did you come out?

690
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,120
I came to see you.

691
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,120
I thought you left without saying goodbye.

692
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,120
I should have found you a rope

693
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,120
to tie you up.

694
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,120
Then you wouldn't have left me.

695
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,120
Tie me up?

696
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,120
That's too much.

697
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,120
How do you want to tie me up?

698
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,120
I can tie you up however I want.

699
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,120
I wanted to come back

700
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,120
and watch the stars with you again.

701
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,120
But I didn't expect the rain

702
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,120
to rain so suddenly.

703
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,120
Last time I saw the stars

704
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,120
was when I was still a child.

705
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,120
At that time, I thought

706
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,120
you were a thief who was addicted to the Chihua Beads.

707
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,120
I didn't expect

708
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,120
I married this thief.

709
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,120
Everything is as it was yesterday.

710
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,120
Your lies

711
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,120
have been gone for so long.

712
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,120
You may not believe it.

713
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,120
That night's stars

714
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,120
were the most beautiful stars I've ever seen.

715
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,120
What a pity.

716
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,120
I can't see the stars tonight.

717
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,120
How can you not see them?

718
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,120
I can see them.

719
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,120
Where?

720
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,120
Look at me.

721
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,120
There's only one in my eyes.

722
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,120
How annoying.

723
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,120
Why are you so romantic?

724
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,120
Hua.

725
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,120
Every word I say to you

726
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,120
is true.

727
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,120
Otherwise,

728
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,120
you can take my heart out

729
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,120
and take a good look at it.

730
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,120
I'll take a look.

731
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,120
I'm sorry.

732
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,120
I'm sorry.

733
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,120
I'm sorry.

734
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,120
I'm sorry.

735
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,120
Did I hurt you?

736
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,120
It's okay.

737
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,120
Why are you so nervous?

738
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,120
What's wrong?

739
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,120
I just hope

740
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,120
that I can be like this every day

741
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,120
and watch the stars with you for the rest of my life.

742
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,120
That's not easy.

743
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,120
When the dust settles down,

744
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,120
we'll have plenty of time

745
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,120
to watch the stars with me every day.

746
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,120
Okay.

747
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,120
When the dust settles down.

748
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,120
The End

749
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,120
Master,

750
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,120
did something happen?

751
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,120
What?

752
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,120
Su Er is in the hands of Ling Jiao?

753
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,120
A few days ago,

754
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,120
I went to the gate to investigate the lung of Ling Xuge.

755
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,120
I didn't expect that

756
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,120
he was ambushed.

757
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,120
Now Su Er

758
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,120
is in the hands of Mohuan.

759
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,120
It seems that

760
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,120
Ling Xuge is really a ghost.

761
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,120
Mohuan

762
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,120
is best at controlling people's hearts.

763
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,120
I think he has made up his mind

764
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,120
to destroy our Longyin City step by step.

765
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,120
Everything

766
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,120
must be in his plan.

767
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,120
Master, don't worry too much.

768
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,120
Yin Xiang and Xiao Xiao

769
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,120
have taken the disciples of Bingzi Hall

770
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,120
to pick up Mei Ying.

771
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,120
The priority now

772
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,120
is to save Su Er from Mohuan.

773
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,120
Su Er will be in danger

774
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,120
if she is in Ling Jiao for one more day.

775
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,120
Zi Yan,

776
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,120
are you okay?

777
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,120
I'm fine.

778
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,120
Look at your body.

779
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,120
Don't worry.

780
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,120
Come on, let's sit down.

781
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,120
Come on.

782
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,120
Slowly.

783
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,120
I don't want

784
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,120
Su Er to be out of danger earlier.

785
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,120
I've sent a letter to Xuanye.

786
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,120
The city will send more disciples

787
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,120
to support them.

788
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,120
But

789
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,120
to deal with Mohuan,

790
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,120
I'm afraid it's not enough

791
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,120
to rely on these disciples.

792
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,120
I wanted to

793
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,120
go to the north in person.

794
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,120
But the situation in the city

795
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,120
is that no one can be a witness for a day.

796
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,120
I've found that

797
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,120
Longyin City

798
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,120
has long been a place of humiliation.

799
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,120
People who leave

800
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,120
and die

801
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,120
are no longer

802
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,120
in the same situation as before.

803
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,120
Zi Yan.

804
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,120
If at this moment,

805
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,120
Hua Er and Bai are in the city,

806
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,120
I'm afraid

807
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,120
that...

808
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,120
Forget it.

809
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,120
The past is hard to accept.

810
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,120
It's okay if you don't mention it.

811
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,120
What?

812
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,120
What's wrong?

813
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,120
I'm afraid

814
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,120
I can hold on.

815
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,120
I can still hold on.

816
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,120
Or

817
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,120
I'll take you on a trip this time.

818
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,120
What nonsense are you talking about, Zi Yan?

819
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,120
Listen to me.

820
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,120
I'll meet up with Xiao Xiao and Mei Ying first.

821
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,120
Then we'll go to the north

822
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,120
to save Su Er.

823
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,120
In this city,

824
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,120
you have to be the witness.

825
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,120
At this moment,

826
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,120
Longyin City

827
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,120
can't be in any trouble anymore.

828
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,120
Zi Yan.

829
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,120
Stop talking nonsense, okay?

830
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,120
How can you

831
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,120
leave the city

832
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,120
with your body like this?

833
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,120
No.

834
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,120
I'm fine.

835
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,120
Don't worry, City Leader.

836
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,120
If you're not worried,

837
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,120
I'll prove it to you right now.

838
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,120
Zi Yan.

839
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,120
Zi Yan.

840
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,120
Zi Yan!

841
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,120
Someone, come here!

842
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,120
Come here!

843
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,120
Come here!

844
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,120
Take it.

845
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,120
What's the smell?

846
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,120
Why is it so sour?

847
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,120
It's a vinegar-based fruit.

848
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,120
You're kidding me, right?

849
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,120
Try this.

850
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,120
This is sweet.

851
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,120
How do I know this is sweet?

852
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,120
You'll know when you taste it.

853
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,120
Then you try it first.

854
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,120
I worked hard to pick it up.

855
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,120
Of course you have to taste it first.

856
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,120
That's right.

857
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,120
You worked hard to pick it up.

858
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,120
That's why you have to eat it first.

859
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,120
You're right.

860
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,120
Then you have to eat it when I eat it.

861
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,120
I'll try it.

862
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,120
I knew it.

863
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,120
This is sweet.

864
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,120
It's very sweet.

865
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,120
It's so good.

866
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,120
Let's go.

867
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,120
Let's go back.

868
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,120
Here.

869
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,120
What's wrong with you?

870
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,120
It's okay.

871
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,120
It's just a relapse.

872
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,120
It'll be fine in a while.

873
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,120
Are you okay?

874
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,120
Senior Bai and Master are both here.

875
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,120
How about they help you look?

876
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,120
Do you want to go with them?

877
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,120
I'm relieved.

878
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,120
Hua.

879
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,120
Old man, are you reasonable?

880
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,120
Who is unreasonable?

881
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,120
You sneaked in.

882
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,120
You're lucky to meet me.

883
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,120
If you meet my master and my senior,

884
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,120
it's not as simple as you.

885
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,120
Find Miss Rong for me.

886
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,120
I need to talk to her.

887
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,120
I'm so confused with you.

888
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,120
I don't understand.

889
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,120
You're so noisy.

890
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,120
What did you say to me?

891
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,120
How can you know I don't understand?

892
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,300
Longying City's

893
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,120
patient, Zi Yan,

894
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,120
has been gone for a long time.

895
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,120
I know she's Miss Rong's aunt.

896
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,120
So I came to report to you.

897
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,120
Why do you treat her like a donkey?

898
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,120
Make it clear.

899
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,120
What's wrong with Zi Yan?

900
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,120
Miss Rong, you're finally here.

901
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,120
What's wrong with my aunt?

902
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,120
Tell me.

903
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,120
You're anxious?

904
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,120
Untie me first.

905
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,120
I...

906
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,120
I didn't tie your mouth.

907
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,120
I won't say it.

908
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,120
Untie me.

909
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,120
You should know better than me

910
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,120
about Zi Yan's condition.

911
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,120
Why did you hear the news

912
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,120
and take this?

913
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,120
I thought she was fine.

914
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,120
I...

915
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,120
I shouldn't let Zi Yan continue to practice poison.

916
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,120
Rong Jing Fang

917
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:09,120
didn't take care of her and protect her.

918
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,120
If I knew it,

919
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,120
I shouldn't have let her go

920
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,120
and handed Zi Yan to her.

921
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,120
Master, don't worry.

922
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,120
Although no one in Longying City can cure her,

923
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,120
it doesn't mean no one in the world can cure her.

924
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,120
You're right.

925
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,120
No one in Longying City can cure her.

926
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,120
But I, Bai,

927
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,120
will go back to Longying City right away.

928
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,120
If I still do nothing,

929
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,120
I'll show my face

930
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,120
and beg my master to go out.

931
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,120
I must cure Zi Yan.

932
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,120
I'll take her away from Longying City.

933
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,120
You're going back to Longying City now?

934
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:46,120
I'm afraid it's easy to go into the city and hard to go out.

935
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,120
Master.

936
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,120
My aunt is seriously ill.

937
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,120
I'm also anxious.

938
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,120
But we can't mess up the situation now.

939
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,120
We have to think of a solution.

940
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,120
You...

941
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,120
Master.

942
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,120
Master.

943
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,120
It's been a long time.

944
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,120
Mr. Nalan looks

945
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,120
much better than before.

946
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,120
I advise you

947
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,120
to be more cautious.

948
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,120
You should know

949
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,120
that you'll lose more words if you speak out.

950
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,120
Anyway,

951
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,120
I've sent you the message.

952
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,120
You can do the rest

953
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,120
as you like.

954
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,120
Miss Rong,

955
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,120
I have something to tell you alone.

956
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,120
Just tell me what you want to say.

957
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,120
Why are you so sneaky?

958
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,120
This is our own business.

959
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,120
You're an outsider.

960
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,120
It's none of your business.

961
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,120
Xue Meng.

962
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,120
When did Hua'er become your member?

963
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,120
I'm not the one.

964
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,120
Now I work with Xue Meng.

965
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,120
I'll share the news in the future.

966
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,120
I'll go.

967
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,120
It's quiet enough.

968
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,120
No one will bother us.

969
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,120
What else do you want to tell me?

970
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,120
Why is Nalan Yue here?

971
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,120
When did you two meet?

972
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,120
Xue Meng's people

973
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,120
knew that Yue was still alive.

974
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:33,120
I was afraid that I would offend Mohuan

975
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,120
and complained to my father.

976
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,120
I didn't say anything.

977
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,120
Don't panic, Miss Li.

978
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:43,120
I didn't mean to hurt you and Xue Meng.

979
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,120
What else do you want to tell me?

980
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,120
Mei Ying has the news.

981
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,120
She's staying in the town

982
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,120
and wandering around Mei's mansion.

983
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,120
I think she's made up her mind

984
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,120
to find the person who bought her house.

985
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,120
Then take this opportunity

986
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,120
to teach her a lesson.

987
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,120
Master.

988
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,120
I've made up my mind

989
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,120
to go back to Longyin City to save Zi Yan.

990
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,120
Please allow me.

991
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,120
Master, don't worry.

992
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,120
I've made up my mind

993
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,120
to protect you.

994
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,120

to protect you.

1007
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,120

to protect you.

1016
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,120

to protect you.

1026
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,120
Your Natural gift

1027
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,120
has been visited by Princess.

1028
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,120
It's important

1029
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:29,120
I love you with all my heart.

1030
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:33,120
