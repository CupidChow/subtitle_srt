00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 15

3
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Hua!

4
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Master!

5
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Hua!

6
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Today, I, Na Tianyue, will be fair.

7
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I will be punished by Jiang Huochan.

8
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yue.

9
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yue, hang in there.

10
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yue.

11
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yue.

12
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This sword...

13
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
was used by my father to hurt Yue.

14
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I thought...

15
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yue's blood was still on it.

16
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
No matter what I do now,

17
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I can't make up for

18
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
the blood debt I owe to the Heaven.

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Now,

20
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
if you still want to threaten the City Leader and Long Yuncheng

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
with your own life,

22
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm afraid it's useless.

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Lingxu Pavilion and Long Yuncheng

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
can only live once.

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
If this continues,

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
when will you stop fighting?

27
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
When will you stop fighting?

28
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
A'Qi.

29
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I beg you to hang in there.

30
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Stop it.

31
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Ruohua.

32
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yue.

33
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'll leave first.

34
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'll meet you at the River of Poverty.

35
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'll be with you.

36
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'll be with you.

37
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'll be with you.

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'll wait for you to come.

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But I only wish that you'll come later.

40
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
A little later.

41
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Don't rush to find me.

42
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Don't worry.

43
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
No matter how long it takes,

44
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'll always

45
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
wait for you.

46
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Ruohua.

47
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'll wait for you at the River of Poverty.

48
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Ruohua.

49
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Ruohua.

50
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Ruohua.

51
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Ruohua.

52
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Ruohua.

53
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Ruohua.

54
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Ruohua.

55
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Ruohua.

56
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Ruohua.

57
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Ruohua.

58
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Ruohua.

59
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Ruohua.

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Go and save her.

61
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yes.

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Ruohua.

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You're so stupid.

64
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yue.

65
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yue.

66
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yue.

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The next month, you'll die.

68
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yue.

69
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You'll be fine.

70
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Master.

71
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You're a good martial artist.

72
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Please show mercy.

73
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
If something happens to you,

74
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'll do my best to help you.

75
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'll do my best to help you.

76
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Please show mercy.

77
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Master.

78
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Do you have a plan?

79
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The next month, you'll die.

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Your body hasn't recovered.

81
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's cold here.

82
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm afraid that after a while,

83
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
your body will be colder.

84
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You asked me to save her.

85
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But you're the only one who can save her.

86
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You or her?

87
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
There's only one way to survive.

88
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It depends on your choice.

89
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Madam.

90
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You can't do that.

91
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
If Young Master has a will,

92
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
he won't agree to do that.

93
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
If he wakes up,

94
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
how can I explain to him?

95
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
How can he accept it?

96
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
He must accept it.

97
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I can't watch him die.

98
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I want him to live.

99
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I can't.

100
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I brought him into this world.

101
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'll decide his life or death.

102
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I want him to live well.

103
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
My body is already cold.

104
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'll die before I know it.

105
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Yizhou.

106
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
When Yuer wakes up,

107
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
tell him that this is the only thing I can do for him.

108
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So he won't feel guilty.

109
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Master.

110
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But from now on,

111
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Nalan Yue can only live without mercy.

112
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
She's alive.

113
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Can she accept this?

114
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
She's alive.

115
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's better than dying.

116
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Senior.

117
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Have you really decided that?

118
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Do you know that in the future...

119
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
She has no choice.

120
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm leaving.

121
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Ruohan.

122
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Think about it.

123
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Lingxu Pavilion's defeat today...

124
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Isn't it all because of your wife?

125
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Lingxu Pavilion has already been destroyed.

126
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Do you want your son...

127
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
to be the victim of this tragedy?

128
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Do you think...

129
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
you still have time to build another Lingxu Pavilion?

130
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Lingxu Pavilion has been destroyed.

131
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I have nothing to say.

132
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Even if I have to die today,

133
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm willing to do it.

134
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I just hate...

135
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I hate that I'm not worthy of being punished...

136
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
and get justice for the Nalan family.

137
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You're a bitch.

138
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Even if you're a burden to the Nalan family,

139
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
as long as you're not decisive enough,

140
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
you'll never be Rong Jingfeng's opponent.

141
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But...

142
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Nalan Yue is different.

143
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
If you die for her today,

144
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm sure you'll get what you want in the future.

145
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
My wife died three times.

146
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The Crown Princess has died.

147
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
If this doesn't work,

148
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'll have to try.

149
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Lingxu Pavilion is destroyed.

150
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I've lost my apprentice.

151
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I failed to keep the Nalan family safe.

152
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I failed to make them happy.

153
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Even if I don't save Yue'er today,

154
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I have no right to live.

155
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
My wife.

156
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You...

157
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Who doesn't want Young Master to continue to live?

158
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
The victims of Lingxu Pavilion...

159
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
are all my family.

160
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm the master of the Pavilion.

161
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'll take the blame for my past.

162
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You're all living people.

163
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Remember what you've learned today.

164
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
From now on,

165
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
you must live well.

166
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Don't let the Nalan family die.

167
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
My wife.

168
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
We failed to do anything.

169
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
But Lingxu Pavilion can't keep us safe.

170
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Don't worry.

171
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
From now on,

172
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'll protect you forever.

173
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'll never give up.

174
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Lingxu Pavilion

175
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Lingxu Pavilion

176
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm ashamed to face my husband.

177
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm ashamed to face the Nalan family.

178
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Just bury me here

179
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
and live with Lingxu Pavilion.

180
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
My wife.

181
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
My wife.

182
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Lingxu Pavilion

183
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
He's finally blooming.

184
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
My wife.

185
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
My wife.

186
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Lingxu Pavilion

187
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Lingxu Pavilion

188
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Did you find your sister's tracks?

189
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I've sent my disciples to search everywhere.

190
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
No news yet.

191
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
What's your plan for Rong Hua?

192
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I didn't expect

193
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
she'd rather die

194
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
than bow her head for a Nalan.

195
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
But no matter she's alive or dead,

196
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I'll find her back.

197
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Yes.

198
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
But remember.

199
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You have to bring her back to Longyin City.

200
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'll handle it myself.

201
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Yes.

202
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Bring the bow and arrow.

203
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Send my order.

204
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Tell all the sects in the world.

205
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
From tonight,

206
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
there will be no Lingxu Pavilion in the world.

207
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Yes.

208
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Lingxu Pavilion

209
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Brother Nalan.

210
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Brother.

211
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Why are you here?

212
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You're awake.

213
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Where am I?

214
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Lingxu Pavilion.

215
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
How is Lingxu Pavilion now?

216
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Lingxu Pavilion has been destroyed.

217
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Master Rong ordered to burn everything.

218
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Lingxu Pavilion

219
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
is now a ruins.

220
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Ruins?

221
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Just like the Mei family.

222
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It's you.

223
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
When the Mei family was in trouble,

224
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
my brother asked for Lingxu Pavilion.

225
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Even if I didn't marry Nalan Yue,

226
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
the master treated me like a family.

227
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
He even sent people to protect the Mei family.

228
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
How could you harm the Lingxu Pavilion in such a bad way?

229
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
What do you know?

230
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Rong Jingfeng threatened me with poison.

231
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
If I don't follow his order,

232
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
how can I survive?

233
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Even so,

234
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
you shouldn't do this.

235
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
The Mei family has always been in the war.

236
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
My parents were always unwilling to give up their children

237
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
and died with great care.

238
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I don't want you to be a coward.

239
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Xue Man.

240
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You are my sister.

241
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You are my only family in this world.

242
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
You should understand my difficulties.

243
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
The so-called difficulties are all excuses.

244
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I would rather not be your sister.

245
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You said you wanted to rebuild the Mei family.

246
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
But in order to make a living,

247
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
you ruined my family business.

248
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You still care about my feelings.

249
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
There are always difficulties in the city.

250
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
The Mei family was destroyed for a moment.

251
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
The Lingxu Pavilion was destroyed.

252
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It was the best time for me to join the Longyin City.

253
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You took me to the seat of the Hall Leader of the Holy Weapon Hall.

254
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I could make a living.

255
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
The Mei family would be in danger.

256
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
So what if you become the leader of the martial arts world?

257
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
But you ruined the happiness of many people.

258
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You are hypocritical and cowardly.

259
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I will never communicate with you.

260
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I don't care what you think of me.

261
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I don't care if you agree with me.

262
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Anyway, I did everything for the Mei family.

263
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Come back to Longyin City with me today.

264
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And from today on,

265
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
don't mention the Lingxu Pavilion in front of me.

266
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I didn't expect you to be so cold-blooded.

267
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Xue Man, you are so cruel.

268
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Xue Man, you are so cruel.

269
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You deserve to die.

270
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Xue Man, you deserve to die.

271
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
What are you doing?

272
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Put down the knife.

273
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Since you are so cruel,

274
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
why don't you send Xue Man to the Lingxu Pavilion?

275
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Instead of living,

276
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
why don't you die with the Lingxu Pavilion?

277
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It's ridiculous.

278
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It's ridiculous.

279
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,800
Toula.

280
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,080
Toula.

281
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,520
What's going on?

282
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,560
In the past valuable years,

283
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,560
screen letter is contained our brothers.

284
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,520
Right?

285
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,200
One, two, three.

286
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,600
From now on,

287
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,560
you can pursue your position.

288
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,640
I have nothing to do with it.

289
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,640
If you want to take revenge,

290
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,440
you can do it now.

291
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,680
You really want to break off the brotherhood with me?

292
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,360
Brotherhood?

293
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,720
I don't want you.

294
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,760
I won't kill innocent people.

295
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,040
Now,

296
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,480
we should try to find the proper method.

297
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,120
Your Highness,

298
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,760
Is Hua'er alive or dead?

299
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,920
Is there any news?

300
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,880
Now,

301
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,880
you're still thinking about her life and death.

302
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,840
But even if she's still alive,

303
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,160
she must have been full of grudges against us.

304
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,960
But she's your daughter after all.

305
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,240
It's because she's my daughter

306
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,480
that I feel heartache.

307
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,160
City Leader.

308
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,400
Your face...

309
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,600
Don't be poisoned by hatred.

310
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,520
I've tried all kinds of methods

311
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,920
with Bai for days.

312
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,520
I failed to cure your wound.

313
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,440
How come you suddenly

314
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,160
recovered?

315
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,360
That's ridiculous.

316
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,320
Actually,

317
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,160
Mohan didn't do anything to me that day.

318
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,520
I took the medicine and delayed the illness.

319
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,240
If I hadn't done that,

320
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,600
how would those sects

321
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,560
believe my words?

322
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,040
How could they

323
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,640
turn their target to the spiritual cult?

324
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,920
Why did you

325
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,920
keep this from me and Bai?

326
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,840
Bai is a child.

327
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,160
If he knows about this,

328
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,040
he will leave Longyin City.

329
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,120
How can I control him?

330
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,280
There can't be any trouble

331
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,120
between us and Lingxu Pavilion

332
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,560
in Longyin City.

333
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,360
You know that

334
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,880
Bai has always been fond of Hua.

335
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,680
If he knows,

336
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,200
he will definitely kill me.

337
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,040
I know.

338
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,320
He will definitely protect Hua

339
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,160
and help Lingxu Pavilion.

340
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,560
But we can't

341
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,760
fight against Lingxu Pavilion.

342
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,400
Think about it.

343
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,400
If Bai really helps Lingxu Pavilion,

344
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,280
how can we deal with him?

345
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,560
So,

346
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,360
you trapped him in the city.

347
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,440
How can you hide it from him?

348
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,280
If he knows,

349
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,280
I'm afraid...

350
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,000
I believe

351
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,920
he will never know.

352
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,960
Because in this world,

353
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,160
except me,

354
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,880
only one person knows.

355
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,000
Why do I feel

356
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,680
that I don't know you anymore?

357
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,800
I'm afraid in the eyes of the City Leader,

358
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,760
except for yourself,

359
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,160
there is no one you can trust.

360
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,400
You only open my eyes and Bai's.

361
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,920
You want to join Mei Ying in secret.

362
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,880
I don't know why.

363
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,680
But you attacked Lingxu Pavilion

364
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,800
because of Hua's wedding.

365
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,320
You really hurt his heart.

366
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,120
When he abandoned Longyin City,

367
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,320
he didn't think about hurting his father's heart.

368
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,600
Whether Hua is right or wrong,

369
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,040
she is your daughter after all.

370
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,520
Now,

371
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,920
she is missing.

372
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,720
She doesn't know her life.

373
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,920
If she really has a chance,

374
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,640
how will you

375
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,800
explain to her in the future?

376
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,240
Stop talking!

377
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,320
Rong's daughter

378
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,960
is under the protection of God.

379
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,600
In a few days,

380
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,680
I will definitely learn from her.

381
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,000
Zi Yan.

382
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,240
I always thought

383
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,080
that even if no one in this world

384
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,680
understands me,

385
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,040
at least you are by my side.

386
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,440
You understand me.

387
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,920
You are willing to help me.

388
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,320
But now,

389
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,880
I really feel disappointed.

390
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,520
Why can't you think for me?

391
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,200
If I don't do this,

392
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,800
what else can I do?

393
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,360
All these years,

394
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,560
we have saved so many people with the Chihua Bead.

395
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,680
It's like we have offended so many people in the world.

396
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,960
I can't

397
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,040
get rid of the grudge in this world.

398
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,840
Do you really want me to take

399
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,960
the disciples of Longyin City

400
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,680
to wander around in the world

401
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,880
and avoid the pursuit of others every day?

402
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,640
This meal

403
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,680
will definitely be a win-win.

404
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,040
Although Lingxu Pavilion is in a bad shape,

405
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,920
Longyin City

406
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,080
is not really in a win-win situation.

407
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,000
Whatever we lose,

408
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,640
you will understand it in the future.

409
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:50,800
Zi Yan.

410
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,160
Zi Yan.

411
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,600
What are you doing here?

412
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,000
I'm here to see

413
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,640
if I will be killed

414
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,320
by my sister.

415
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,800
I'm afraid it will be more painful

416
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,200
and more painful than a knife wound.

417
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,280
No wonder I just saw Mei Xueman leaving in a hurry.

418
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,800
You didn't send someone to stop her.

419
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,560
We have broken off the brother-sister relationship.

420
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,360
She wants to leave Longyin City.

421
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,240
Since I can't keep her,

422
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,720
why should I stop her?

423
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,600
If Miss Rong is here to laugh at me,

424
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,160
please go back as soon as possible.

425
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,240
It seems that your sister is still being kind.

426
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,600
If the stab is in the heart,

427
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,080
it won't be so painful without Young Master.

428
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,760
Where is Rong Hua?

429
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,080
Do you have any news about her?

430
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,640
If you really want to know,

431
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,480
you can go and find her yourself.

432
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,600
She is still a child.

433
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,600
You don't really

434
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,760
care about your daughter, do you?

435
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,960
No one can guess

436
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,440
what you think.

437
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,560
But when she was in the Palace of Spirituality,

438
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,200
I guessed that it must be because of Rong Hua.

439
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,280
It's just that Mei Xueman.

440
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,280
I understand your feelings for Rong Hua.

441
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,200
But she is willing to be abandoned

442
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,560
for Nalan Yue.

443
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,080
She even wants to die

444
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,520
and fight for the imperial power with Nalan Yue.

445
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,240
Do you really know

446
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,680
how much you have done for her?

447
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,000
Life and death are predestined.

448
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,200
What can I do about it?

449
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:57,840
I'm tired.

450
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,920
Miss Rong, please go back.

451
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,360
Mr. Mei,

452
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,920
you should recuperate.

453
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,320
No matter how serious the injury is,

454
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,080
it will be healed in time.

455
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,240
Master Bai,

456
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,200
Xiao Jia brought you food.

457
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,120
Little girl, you came just in time.

458
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,560
I've been working on some new dishes

459
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,960
while I was on my guard.

460
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,280
You can give me some ideas

461
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,520
and I can improve them in time.

462
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,320
When I go out and get familiar with them,

463
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,920
I'll give you some tips.

464
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,280
Master Bai, you are generous.

465
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,040
You've been locked up for a long time.

466
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,200
You don't have any doubts or concerns.

467
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,400
When his評論成员

468
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,640
entered our company,

469
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,280
he surprised me.

470
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,840
He robbed her money.

471
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,800
He can give me some advice?

472
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,840
I'll take good care of her.

473
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,840
That's why

474
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,000
I am locked up here.

475
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:19,840
It's because Yuzheng

476
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,000
accused me of secretly speaking on own terms before.

477
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,840
However, this was my business.

478
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,840
It's so ugly.

479
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,320
Is it because Hua'er left home?

480
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,480
You can't bear it?

481
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,440
It's okay.

482
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,840
Although Hua'er

483
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,560
went to Lingxu Pavilion,

484
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,480
Na Lanyue

485
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,320
will do it.

486
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,680
I believe

487
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,960
he will

488
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,200
treat Hua'er with sincerity.

489
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,240
But there's one thing.

490
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,880
If you want to get married again,

491
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,520
it's not as easy as before.

492
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,640
Wait for a few days.

493
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:10,880
Wait for a few days.

494
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,280
After they finish their wedding,

495
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,800
I'll take you to see them secretly.

496
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,440
What's wrong?

497
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,360
What's wrong, girl?

498
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,800
Why are you crying?

499
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,680
Master Bai.

500
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,400
I just...

501
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,960
I just knew it.

502
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,760
I shouldn't have told you

503
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,600
about this.

504
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,120
But I knew something happened.

505
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,200
I couldn't pretend not to know.

506
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,440
After all, it's about Lady Yuzhan.

507
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,200
You're her master.

508
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,480
You should know it.

509
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,040
What happened?

510
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:48,720
Tell me.

511
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,920
Master...

512
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,000
Master!

513
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,600
Серene!

514
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,240
Suלap mozz!

515
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,360
Master Bai isn't here!

516
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,760
Send some men to search the place.

517
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,720
You two go back first.

518
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,040
Yes, Master.

519
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,600
Thehard!

520
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,120
Xuxu, you two go after her.

521
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,840
When did you find out that she's missing?

522
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,080
Just now.

523
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,320
I'm going to deliver the food.

524
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,480
I can't be alone.

525
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,960
If she doesn't mean to escape,

526
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,600
then there's no need to make a fuss.

527
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,560
I'll take some people to the station.

528
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,640
Master Bai.

529
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,960
That's all Xiao Xiao can do.

530
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,360
You must take her back.

531
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,680
You must protect her.

532
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,440
Go.

533
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,640
It's there.

534
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,600
It's there.

535
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,000
Look, it's there.

536
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,880
Look, she's so young.

537
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,000
She must be married to that Zhuang Shu.

538
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,640
How could this happen?

539
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,880
What a pity.

540
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,080
Master,

541
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,520
how about I go up there?

542
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,560
It's okay.

543
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,880
There must be a result.

544
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,240
I need to confirm it myself.

545
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:20,920
Master.

546
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,320
We've been searching for days,

547
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,640
but we didn't find her.

548
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,600
They suddenly came to report

549
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,000
that they found her.

550
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,880
There must be something wrong with this.

551
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,560
We'd better be careful.

552
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,920
When did you find her?

553
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,720
Just half an hour ago.

554
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,600
She was badly injured.

555
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,680
She's out of breath.

556
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,120
She might not be able to return to the heaven.

557
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,080
Yeah.

558
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,360
Let's go.

559
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,160
It's you.

560
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,240
It's me.

561
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,120
I didn't teach you a lesson.

562
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,120
Do you really think I can bully you?

563
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,160
You imprisoned so many of my disciples.

564
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,640
If it's spread to the world,

565
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,160
how can I establish my own clan?

566
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,160
Don't think that you're done.

567
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,880
You can just let me go.

568
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,520
I have my revenge.

569
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,760
Today,

570
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,040
I'm here to teach you a lesson

571
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,320
for my disciples.

572
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,920
Longyin City had a young man

573
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,280
who was willing to help.

574
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,600
But Miss Liuli followed him

575
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,600
and asked about Longyin City.

576
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,960
She kept touching the bottom line.

577
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,120
We just kept you in the cell for a few days.

578
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,440
We didn't hurt you.

579
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,360
You've given us enough dignity.

580
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,920
If you dare to mess with us again,

581
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,200
don't blame me for being rude.

582
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,520
Miss Rong,

583
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,560
you're really ungrateful.

584
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,480
In the whole world,

585
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,520
we've never been afraid of anyone.

586
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,400
I wonder

587
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,320
how Miss Rong is going to be rude to us.

588
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,040
You're the one

589
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,760
who's going to listen to your father.

590
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:17,880
Here.

591
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,660
Call 뭐 Usailang.

592
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,640
Yes.

593
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:31,800
Xuanye,

594
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,200
are you going to rise from the dead?

595
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,680
Please calm down.

596
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,160
Miss Liuli is right.

597
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,240
We really had a thing to hide

598
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,240
she was sent to help by Are youético,

599
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,000
You have a grudge too,

600
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,400
So this time,

601
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,400
and kill her.

602
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,760
Don't bother her.

603
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,240
This time,

604
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,840
I'll send you back to the Snow Tower

605
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,080
with no mercy.

606
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,160
I just feel sorry for Miss Liuli

607
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,720
and my wife.

608
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,440
Who wants you to send her?

609
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,920
It's better to not offend people

610
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,360
when you're walking in the martial arts world.

611
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,640
If you're too funny,

612
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,160
I'm afraid that ten Snow Towers

613
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:06,920
can't protect you.

614
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,200
Xuanye, pass my order.

615
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,720
All disciples withdraw.

616
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,920
Go back to Longyin City in a hurry.

617
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,040
There are no clues these days.

618
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,120
If this continues,

619
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,120
there may not be any news.

620
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,120
You have no clues.

621
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,080
The Snow Towers may have answers.

622
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,280
The people who Longyin City is looking for

623
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,600
are dead or alive.

624
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,960
The Snow Towers have known it.

625
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,800
Besides,

626
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,560
Miss Rong,

627
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,480
don't you want to know

628
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,720
the whereabouts of others?

629
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,860
Sales,

630
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,060
Xiuge has been in coma for few days.

631
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,480
She didn't want to let outsiders

632
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,880
dig into her body one day.

633
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,080
So she ordered me to bury her

634
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,600
in the warehouse

635
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,640
and leave the ashes here.

636
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,120
But

637
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,040
the funeral

638
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,200
needs Young Master to handle it.

639
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,560
I don't need

640
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,720
anyone to take care of it.

641
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,960
This is the last thing

642
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,400
I can do for you.

643
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,400
You're the one

644
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,560
I was most worried about.

645
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,760
Lingxu Pavilion is gone.

646
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,280
You must be strong, Yue.

647
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,160
When I was a kid,

648
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,560
my mother never showed me her smile.

649
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,200
She never showed us her smile.

650
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,920
She was very strict with us.

651
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,880
At that time,

652
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,960
I never thought about

653
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,240
her thoughts.

654
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,720
Until I...

655
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,240
But she was holding

656
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,760
the hatred of the Nalan family.

657
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,560
I never thought about

658
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,600
the problem from her perspective.

659
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,880
Instead, I kept

660
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,120
running away from Lingxu Pavilion.

661
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,120
From now on,

662
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,840
I have no chance

663
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,200
to leave this family.

664
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,440
I was supposed to send Madam back to the North Palace

665
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,960
with Cang Tiyuan.

666
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,160
But Madam chose to stay here.

667
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,920
She wanted to bury with Lingxu Pavilion.

668
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,080
If you keep doing this,

669
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,520
how can I let Madam rest assured?

670
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,040
I have my own plans.

671
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,240
I can't rest assured.

672
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,680
Yue,

673
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,440
I know you're upset.

674
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,640
I know it too.

675
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,640
But you can't

676
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,840
change any fact.

677
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,400
Why are you so angry?

678
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,680
You're in a bad mood.

679
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,320
You're not in a good mood.

680
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,320
You're not in a good mood.

681
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,320
You're not in a good mood.

682
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,320
You're not in a good mood.

683
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,040
You're crying.

684
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:07,920
After today,

685
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,920
we can start over.

686
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,160
No matter what happens,

687
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,920
we'll face it together.

688
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,320
I...

689
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,280
I've already decided.

690
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,840
My mother gave me two lives.

691
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,080
I can't let her down anymore.

692
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,560
Today,

693
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,160
I'll bury all the past

694
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,560
with my mother.

695
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,440
I'll help her

696
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,480
if she doesn't have time.

697
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,200
Madam chose to kill you with the Chihua Bead.

698
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,480
I know it clearly.

699
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,000
But we can't persuade her.

700
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,800
We're not happy either.

701
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,080
Can you stop torturing yourself?

702
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,000
Everyone was there.

703
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,640
Why didn't you stop her?

704
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,720
Others don't understand me.

705
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,400
Don't you understand me too?

706
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,400
You said it so many times.

707
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,760
My mother didn't want to see me sad.

708
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,200
She didn't want to see me sad.

709
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,720
But I...

710
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,360
I'm willing to see things

711
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,920
become like this?

712
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,400
Why didn't you stop her?

713
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,880
Stop her!

714
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,480
It's...

715
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,520
It's my fault.

716
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,120
I couldn't stop Madam.

717
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,080
But how can I stop her?

718
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,280
I'm the one who has the Chihua Bead today.

719
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,760
I'll make this decision too.

720
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,440
If Madam is seriously injured,

721
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,400
what will you do?

722
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,760
Madam wanted to take revenge.

723
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,200
But she still hopes you're safe.

724
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,240
Do you know that?

725
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,280
30 years ago

726
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,320
I'm sorry.

727
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,120
I'm sorry.

728
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:02,920
I'm sorry.

729
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,720
I'm sorry.

730
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,480
I'm sorry.

731
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,480
I'm sorry.

732
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,480
I'm sorry.

733
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,480
I'm sorry.

734
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,480
I'm sorry.

735
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,480
I'm sorry.

736
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,480
I'm sorry.

737
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,480
I'm sorry.

738
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,480
I'm sorry.

739
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,480
I'm sorry.

740
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:14,480
I'm sorry.

741
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,480
I'm sorry.

742
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,480
I'm sorry.

743
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,480
I'm sorry.

744
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,480
I'm sorry.

745
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,480
I'm sorry.

746
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,480
I'm sorry.

747
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,480
I'm sorry.

748
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,480
I'm sorry.

749
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,480
I'm sorry.

750
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,480
I'm sorry.

751
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,480
I'm sorry.

752
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,480
I'm sorry.

753
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,480
I'm sorry.

754
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,480
I'm sorry.

755
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,480
I'm sorry.

756
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,480
