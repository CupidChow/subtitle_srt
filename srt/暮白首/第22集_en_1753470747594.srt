1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I will be your enemy

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I will be your enemy

3
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I will be your enemy

4
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I will be your enemy

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I will be your enemy

6
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I will be your enemy

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,960
A remove the scars in my heart

8
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,900
Uhm, My Boyfriend

9
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,960
Why are you selling me?

10
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,860
Sell Ling Xmaybe

11
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,560
No

12
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,640
If I'm with you

13
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,120
I won't hesitate

14
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,120
Now Ling X stor cohesive

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:08,580
I want to have a look at all the

16
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,060
things you said to me in Lingxu Pavilion.

17
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,400
I really hope you never went to Lingxu Pavilion.

18
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,280
All the disciples in the Pavilion said that you betrayed the Young Pavilion.

19
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,560
I caused all this.

20
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,960
If I didn't take you back that day,

21
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,800
all of this wouldn't have happened.

22
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,440
In the end,

23
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,880
you still choose to believe Ling Xun.

24
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,680
The truth is,

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I have to believe it.

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,600
That's right.

27
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,920
Your guess is reasonable.

28
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,400
I'm not lying.

29
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,720
Ru Su.

30
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,880
I just want you to tell me in person.

31
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,960
As long as you deny it,

32
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,360
I can choose to believe it again.

33
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,760
You can't even believe it yourself.

34
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,920
Can you really believe me?

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,640
I thought I didn't have to believe it.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,720
In the end,

37
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,480
I overestimated

38
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,920
our relationship.

39
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,440
Yes.

40
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,320
We were in different camps from the beginning.

41
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,520
How can we believe it?

42
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,600
When we met,

43
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,800
I already knew it.

44
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,440
You already have the answer.

45
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,600
Why do you have to make me tell you?

46
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,600
It's not like this in Ling Xun Pavilion.

47
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,560
I believe I'm not wrong.

48
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,960
I just want you to tell me in person.

49
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,560
You didn't tell anyone that day.

50
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,120
Is it because you're worried about the safety of Lu Yi City

51
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,080
or to tell Rong Jing Feng about it?

52
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,080
As you said,

53
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,080
it's no use

54
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,440
to pursue it anymore.

55
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,440
You used me

56
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,960
to make the Nalan Yue case so serious.

57
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,240
If I tell you,

58
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,320
I just want to find out

59
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,880
the news about Ling Xun Pavilion.

60
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,040
What will you do?

61
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:51,760
You...

62
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,280
Unless you kill me yourself,

63
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,600
you can't explain to Ling Xun Pavilion.

64
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,480
If the head of the Pavilion knows the hurt of Nalan Yue,

65
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,760
he will surely be very upset

66
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,600
about what he said that day.

67
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,920
If it weren't for your persistence and persistence,

68
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,600
how could it end today?

69
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,080
It's no use

70
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,120
to talk about it anymore.

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,040
The knife is poisoned.

72
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,240
I'll send you back to the city after I get this.

73
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,960
The head of the Pavilion will definitely not detoxify.

74
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,360
This wound is not serious.

75
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,640
Chase them.

76
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,680
Don't let them run away.

77
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,640
Chase them.

78
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,120
Go.

79
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,720
Lu Yi Zhou,

80
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,560
I owe you.

81
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,720
I owe you in return for your kindness.

82
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,720
If you can't escape this time,

83
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,800
I will never forgive you.

84
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,920
I haven't been able to learn how to use poison from my aunt.

85
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,480
I'm afraid I put too much poison on her.

86
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,480
It must be too much.

87
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,600
Ni Tian has been chasing us.

88
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,080
It seems that our plan has been failed.

89
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,640
We can't let her escape.

90
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,120
We can't let her escape.

91
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,160
We can't let her escape.

92
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,440
The flower has been used up.

93
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,280
An Yu,

94
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,280
no matter what happens,

95
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,400
you should take the first step.

96
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,640
My father's goal is you.

97
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,240
If you leave, I'll be fine.

98
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,600
Don't worry.

99
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,840
I have my own plans.

100
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,120
Be careful.

101
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,880
No.

102
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,600
An Yu.

103
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,600
An Yu,

104
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,720
stop the old news.

105
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,320
Rong Jin Feng,

106
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,600
you traitor.

107
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,160
You haven't changed at all in all these years.

108
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,360
You're just a coward.

109
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,400
Today I'll clean the door for you.

110
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,560
An Yu,

111
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,640
it feels so good to be able to escape at once like this.

112
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,160
Why aren't you going to work?

113
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,240
I didn't expect you'd be involved in it too.

114
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,720
It seems like

115
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,680
your shifu

116
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,120
had arranged you

117
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,320
to protect Zhou experienced inould of this Nalan Yue.

118
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,000
Li Argong,

119
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,800
they heard us and then they ran.

120
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:56,720
Come on.

121
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,640
This is the best I can do.

122
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,440
Come on.

123
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,240
Dalan Yue.

124
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,240
You have nowhere to run.

125
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,000
Just surrender.

126
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,040
Come on.

127
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,680
Take them all.

128
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,080
Dad.

129
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,080
No.

130
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,040
Hua.

131
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,400
Shut up.

132
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,040
Listen.

133
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,000
I won't let you be taken away by the bitch again.

134
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,280
Think it over.

135
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,800
If she didn't do it for the sake of the thief,

136
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,200
why would she take you away so hastily?

137
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,480
Take them down.

138
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,020
The

139
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,360
Protect Young Master.

140
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,720
Dalan Yue.

141
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,600
Don't run.

142
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,280
The leaders are all dead.

143
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,120
Today,

144
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,760
Brother Yan Xun must give an explanation.

145
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,920
Take Dalan Yue away.

146
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,960
I'll take care of the back.

147
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,720
Now,

148
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,200
in front of all the martial artists,

149
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,040
you still want to escape?

150
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,120
Hua.

151
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,920
Come here.

152
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,760
Come to me.

153
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,040
Dad.

154
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,960
Please let us go.

155
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,680
You...

156
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,480
He is the famous leader of the spiritual sect

157
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,160
who is the most powerful and powerful in the martial arts world.

158
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:57,920
Don't call him.

159
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,400
Don't call him.

160
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,520
My disciple.

161
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,040
You betrayed the spiritual sect.

162
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,560
You set up your own sect.

163
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,880
I'm not against it.

164
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,440
But when did you learn to be so stingy?

165
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,160
I've been doing it for a long time.

166
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,560
I've been doing it for a long time.

167
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,760
I've been doing it for a long time.

168
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,840
I've been doing it for a long time.

169
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,880
I've been doing it for a long time.

170
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,560
What?

171
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,240
Master, please be wise.

172
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,680
This matter

173
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,120
was originally done by Dalan Yue,

174
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,960
who killed many martial arts masters in Longyin City.

175
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,800
This matter

176
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,440
is the personal grudge between Longyin City and Lingxu Pavilion.

177
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,360
I hope you don't get involved in it.

178
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,480
It's just that everyone is here.

179
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,160
It's not hard to prove it.

180
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,480
City Leader Rong said that

181
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,880
it was Dalan Yue who kidnapped your daughter.

182
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,160
Rong Hua is here too.

183
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,200
Why don't you let her talk about it?

184
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,000
What's going on?

185
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,320
Master Ming is the master of the spiritual sect.

186
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,120
But why are you helping Lingxu Pavilion secretly today?

187
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,760
It seems that

188
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,880
you've been colluding with each other for a long time.

189
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,800
Today, the matter is not decided.

190
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,080
It's right in front of you.

191
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,080
I don't think there's anything to say.

192
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,800
Even if I've been patient for a while today,

193
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,760
how could many martial arts masters

194
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,480
let this murderer go?

195
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,720
Rong Hua,

196
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,160
did Dalan Yue kidnap you?

197
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,800
Only you can tell us

198
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,480
the truth.

199
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,800
Lingxu Pavilion didn't mean to harm us.

200
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,720
Yue and I really love each other.

201
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,880
We'll be back in Lingxu Pavilion this time.

202
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,240
There's no way to hold us back.

203
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,560
There's another reason for the destruction of the flowers.

204
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,040
City Leader Rong,

205
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,760
who destroyed the flowers in Longyin City?

206
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,280
What's the truth?

207
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,520
Please tell us.

208
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,320
Hua,

209
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,560
I don't know

210
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,680
what kind of method Dalan Yue used.

211
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,840
Now he's controlling your thoughts.

212
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,240
I'm really heartbroken.

213
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,800
I hope you can wake up soon

214
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,920
and go home with me.

215
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,320
I'm not going home.

216
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,480
Dad,

217
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,360
I'm telling the truth.

218
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,160
All martial artists,

219
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,520
please recall it carefully.

220
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,400
The first one who said that

221
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,840
Dalan Yue was the murderer

222
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,280
wasn't me.

223
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,960
It was the dead sect leaders.

224
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,680
Now,

225
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,640
is it true that I'm telling the truth

226
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,760
or they're just making up the truth?

227
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,240
The truth is in front of you.

228
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,080
Rong Jingfeng,

229
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,040
you're really a despicable person.

230
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,520
Tu'er,

231
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,120
you're so good at acting.

232
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,800
But

233
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,200
I won't fall for your trick.

234
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,800
All martial artists,

235
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,880
this is not the truth.

236
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,400
You decide for yourselves.

237
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,680
Come on.

238
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,120
Hurry.

239
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,040
Master,

240
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,320
something bad happened.

241
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,000
What happened? Why are you in such a hurry?

242
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,680
Miss,

243
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,440
something bad happened.

244
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,600
She's seriously injured.

245
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,200
She's not feeling well now.

246
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:15,840
Give me the gun.

247
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,440
Bai.

248
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,400
Why are you so angry?

249
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,400
Save Master and Su'er.

250
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,280
And the others over there.

251
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:23,880
This time,

252
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,960
their parents are seriously injured.

253
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,560
And they're not feeling well.

254
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,960
It's very dangerous.

255
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,520
I can treat Su'er's poison.

256
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,280
But she needs you

257
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,480
to treat her internal injury.

258
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,320
Water is coming.

259
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,760
Hurry up.

260
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,480
What's the time?

261
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,080
Stop being angry.

262
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,600
Here's the ointment.

263
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,320
Hurry up.

264
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,120
I really owed you in my last life.

265
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,840
Hurry up.

266
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,360
Hurry up.

267
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,200
Master.

268
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,640
You must try your best to cure all the injuries.

269
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,280
No matter if you're from the City of Longyin.

270
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:06,880
Hold on.

271
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,680
Don't worry, Master.

272
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,680
I'll do my best.

273
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,600
The City of Longyin

274
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,120
Leave us.

275
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,640
Yes.

276
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,680
Your aunt

277
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,880
has cured the poison in your body.

278
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,800
In the future,

279
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,280
take the medicine on time.

280
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,320
Otherwise,

281
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,760
you'll get sick.

282
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,280
You're from Rong Hua.

283
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,840
Why did you save me?

284
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,720
I saved you

285
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,120
doesn't mean I agree with you.

286
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,680
But no matter what,

287
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,960
you're from the City of Longyin.

288
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,960
Even if I still hold you responsible,

289
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,040
I won't let you die.

290
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,560
This kind of relationship,

291
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,880
you and your father

292
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,080
may never be able to get along.

293
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,160
Remember.

294
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,120
In the next days,

295
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,040
take good rest in bed.

296
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,040
If you don't get well,

297
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,520
don't even think about leaving the City of Longyin.

298
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,160
Those from the Lingxu Pavilion,

299
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,800
did they escape?

300
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,320
With the help of Mo Huan and the disciples,

301
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,720
they escaped.

302
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,600
Otherwise, your father

303
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,960
wouldn't have given up easily.

304
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:11,760
I'll

305
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,000
be disappointed.

306
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,720
The death of the City of Longyin

307
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,000
is a great tragedy.

308
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,880
Now the City of Longyin has lost the Chihua Bead.

309
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,160
It's very difficult

310
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,120
to regain the power in the martial arts world.

311
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,840
How to move forward in the future

312
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,200
depends on your father's decision.

313
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,600
I'll go.

314
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,240
That's good.

315
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,880
At least it can delay some time.

316
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,920
The City of Longyin and the Lingxu Pavilion

317
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,280
won't have a conflict in the future.

318
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,400
Get out!

319
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,440
I don't want you to be together.

320
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,200
These wounds

321
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,720
will only make me more sober.

322
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,920
But I know

323
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,040
I have to get back

324
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,520
everything that the City of Longyin lost.

325
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,440
It seems that the City Chief

326
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,200
is still angry.

327
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,360
I'll take all the responsibility

328
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,560
for what you want to do.

329
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,400
I'll take all the responsibility.

330
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,800
You'll take all the responsibility?

331
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,160
Can you afford it?

332
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,320
You were the one

333
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,240
who failed this time.

334
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,520
The status of the City of Longyin

335
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,000
collapsed instantly.

336
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,080
Even if I punish you,

337
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,240
I can't get it back.

338
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,080
Is the status of the City of Longyin really that important?

339
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,040
The Chihua Bead was destroyed.

340
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,640
We can continue to cultivate it next year.

341
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,160
Why did you set up this situation

342
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,240
and make it so difficult to get it back?

343
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,000
You're so straightforward.

344
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,080
You always know

345
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,800
that you're out there having fun

346
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,560
and making yourself so free.

347
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,400
How do you know

348
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,280
what it feels like to be on the shoulder of a heavy bullet?

349
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,920
The status of the City of Longyin

350
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,000
is related to the lives of many people.

351
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,520
For the status of the City of Longyin,

352
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,640
many people

353
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,160
will sacrifice their lives.

354
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,640
But no matter what,

355
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,040
Rong Hua is your daughter.

356
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,600
Dalan Yue, talk about her!

357
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,640
How could it be like this?

358
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,920
It took her?

359
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,560
She didn't anxiety.

360
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,120
It's very serious.

361
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,800
The demon soul used its internal force

362
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,200
to destroy my heart.

363
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,440
But others think

364
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,640
I was just badly injured.

365
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,000
But who knows

366
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,760
its internal force is filled with the poison.

367
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,960
These poisons

368
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,080
will slowly contaminate my body

369
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,720
and make my skin pale.

370
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,640
Then I'll look like a half-man and half-ghost.

371
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,080
I can only live in the darkness forever.

372
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,040
The master of Longyin City

373
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,840
will never be able to raise his head again.

374
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,640
He wants to destroy Longyin City.

375
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,200
Turn around.

376
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,920
The Poison

377
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,200
This poison is not incurable.

378
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,800
After Ziyan and I are hurt,

379
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,560
we will find a solution.

380
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:51,920
Now,

381
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,680
you need to take the medicine

382
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,560
to cure your internal injury.

383
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,920
After the injury is stable, you can detoxify.

384
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:58,840
Tomorrow,

385
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,600
I'll go out and collect herbs.

386
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,200
I'll keep this secret from others.

387
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,920
The Poison

388
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,960
Xuanye, put me down!

389
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,160
Put me down!

390
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,400
Put me down!

391
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,080
How dare you!

392
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,880
How dare you treat me like this!

393
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,840
Do you want to

394
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,720
help us?

395
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,320
Xuanye has realized

396
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,440
the sincerity of Xue Meng.

397
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,000
I dare not bother you again.

398
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,200
You've been

399
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,920
trapping me all the way.

400
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,120
If it's known,

401
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,000
I don't know if I'll throw it

402
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,120
into your face.

403
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,360
Xuanye is such a person.

404
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,440
You...

405
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,480
How dare you bully me like this!

406
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,240
I did this

407
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,840
for the safety of Miss Liuli.

408
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,000
Now I'm sending her off safely.

409
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,720
I'm leaving.

410
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,760
Are you so sure?

411
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,080
After Longyin City,

412
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,240
won't you ask for help from Xue Meng again?

413
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,520
I...

414
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,400
Now,

415
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,840
Longyin City is in a bad situation.

416
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,680
Xuanye can't care about it.

417
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,440
I have to go back

418
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,000
at this moment.

419
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,520
I should be more responsible

420
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,800
for Longyin City and the Confucius Hall.

421
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,640
Stop right there!

422
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,320
I'm not done yet!

423
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,400
Xuanye!

424
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,800
Don't let me see you again.

425
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,680
I'll see you again.

426
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,200
I'll beat you to death!

427
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,000
You're still so young.

428
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,560
You don't have plans.

429
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,280
If you didn't tell me in time,

430
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,440
you would have died

431
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,120
in Rong Jingfeng's knife.

432
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,880
You would have died in Rong Jingfeng's knife.

433
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,720
Thank you for your help.

434
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,360
I was too rash

435
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,560
to act hastily.

436
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,120
I didn't expect

437
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,760
Rong Jingfeng to be so sinister.

438
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,080
If I hadn't helped you,

439
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,120
I'm afraid I would have died.

440
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,760
You know your mistake.

441
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,720
If Lord Ming hadn't arrived in time,

442
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,680
none of you would have survived.

443
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,560
It seems that

444
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,560
you're determined to

445
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,720
take the life of that boy.

446
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,800
If we hadn't split up,

447
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,160
it would have been hard for you to escape.

448
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,400
Rong Jingfeng is a bastard.

449
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,560
He's a traitor.

450
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,360
He even tried to

451
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,560
defy you in front of the martial artists.

452
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,000
Luckily, you're good at martial arts.

453
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,200
You hit him in front of everyone.

454
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,440
It's also a good chance to let those people

455
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,200
know your strength.

456
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,120
I was punished for

457
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,800
being so rash.

458
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,000
Don't be too happy.

459
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,600
All these years,

460
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,000
there have been many ups and downs in the martial arts world.

461
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,000
Rong Jingfeng has always

462
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,200
tried to change the situation.

463
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,200
This time,

464
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,600
I don't know how to fight back.

465
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,600
Don't worry too much.

466
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,600
The Snow League has received the news.

467
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,200
Nalan Yue and the others have returned to Lingxu Pavilion.

468
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,000
It takes a while

469
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,200
for the Dragon City to be rebuilt.

470
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,600
Maybe there will be a peaceful day in the future.

471
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,600
But this time, there's a lot of noise.

472
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,400
I'm afraid that all the martial arts schools in the world

473
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,400
have been ready to fight.

474
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,600
It's not that easy.

475
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,400
Your Majesty.

476
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,400
Xuan Ye has received the news of the Dragon City.

477
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,800
He's back to his original position.

478
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,400
It's not easy to hold him back for these days.

479
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,600
He's back to the Five-Gamers' Division.

480
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,200
If there's nothing else,

481
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,600
you can leave now.

482
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,600
Chief,

483
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,600
shouldn't we keep following up

484
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,800
to control the every move of the Dragon City?

485
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,800
Keep an eye on the every move of the Dragon City.

486
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,200
No matter what happens,

487
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,400
we can't let go of it.

488
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,000
Yes.

489
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,400
I'll take my leave.

490
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,000
Mother.

491
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,400
If you keep wasting your energy like this,

492
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,200
how can you hold on?

493
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,600
You're badly injured.

494
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,000
You rushed back in a hurry.

495
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,800
You must have not had a good rest.

496
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,800
I'm afraid that if you don't get treated in time,

497
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,800
you'll leave a bad mark.

498
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,200
Don't worry.

499
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,400
I'll take care of it.

500
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,600
I'll take care of it.

501
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I'll take care of it.

502
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,400
I'll take care of it.

503
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,800
I'll take care of it.

504
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I'll take care of it.

505
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,200
I'll take care of it.

506
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,200
Mother.

507
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,400
There's a week,

508
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,200
a week without me,

509
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,400
and a month without me.

510
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,800
I can't do anything.

511
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,600
Besides,

512
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,800
Mohua has given me a lot of energy.

513
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,600
Once I recover,

514
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,800
all the energy of the people

515
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,800
will be the most important thing for me.

516
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,600
I just want to get back the credit

517
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,600
for your father and the Nalan family.

518
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,600
I've been strict with you since I was a child.

519
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,200
That's why I feel guilty to you.

520
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,200
Mother, what are you talking about?

521
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,400
Yue'er.

522
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,600
If you can't come back safely this time,

523
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,600
I'll be very worried.

524
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,600
I'll be very worried.

525
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,600
I'll be very worried.

526
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,400
I'll be very worried.

527
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,800
I'll be very worried.

528
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,400
I'm afraid that you...

529
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,000
I didn't understand

530
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,000
the pain in my heart before.

531
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,800
I didn't understand

532
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,800
the justice you've been talking about.

533
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,400
Until this time,

534
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,400
Rong Jinfeng showed me his true face.

535
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,200
I finally understood

536
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,200
the pain you've been going through.

537
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,200
I also understood

538
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,000
the pain you and the Nalan family

539
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,200
have been going through all these years.

540
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,400
I don't want anything now.

541
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,400
I just want you to be safe

542
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,600
and live a happy life with Rong Hua.

543
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,400
This Wando jade pendant

544
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,000
is the first gift

545
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,200
your father prepared for you.

546
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,400
It's also the only one.

547
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,600
The jade is made of four levels of peace.

548
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,200
I've been carrying it with me

549
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,200
to make a wish.

550
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,200
But today I realized

551
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,200
that your safety

552
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,400
is your father's greatest hope.

553
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,800
Mother, don't worry.

554
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,600
I will protect myself.

555
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I will also

556
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,200
protect the whole Li Xuk.

557
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,600
And Rong Hua.

558
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,200
And Rong Hua.

559
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,400
For you,

560
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,800
she went against Rong Jinfeng

561
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,200
and broke up with Long Yin City.

562
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,800
Although she didn't say it,

563
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,400
she was very bitter.

564
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,800
She doesn't have anyone to rely on now.

565
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Only you.

566
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,800
I understand.

567
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,400
Miss Rong, is it beautiful?

568
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,200
It's really beautiful.

569
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,200
Miss Rong,

570
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,600
have you chosen the fabric for the wedding dress?

571
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,000
You are A'Yue's sister.

572
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,000
We will be sisters from now on.

573
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,200
No need to be friends.

574
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,400
The wedding ceremony is a hassle.

575
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,800
I have to trouble you with something.

576
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,600
Then I'll call you Hua'er.

577
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,800
You don't have to be polite.

578
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,800
I sincerely wish you well.

579
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,800
I'm happy

580
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,400
to do all this for you.

581
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,200
Before,

582
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,200
the young master was injured

583
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,200
and was sent back to the hall.

584
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,200
Everyone was in a mess.

585
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,400
Only the master

586
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,000
believed that the young master would be fine.

587
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,600
He ordered people to continue preparing for the wedding.

588
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,200
The master didn't let bad news

589
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,800
go to the hall and disrupt the order.

590
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,800
He himself was in a coma.

591
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,200
I think

592
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,200
he also hopes to see you

593
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,400
get married and get married.

594
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,800
And live happily together.

595
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,800
So,

596
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,400
what I can do

597
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,600
is to prepare for all this.

598
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,000
I was too willful back then.

599
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,400
A'Yue said that she would find out

600
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,800
if there was a decision.

601
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,400
If I didn't insist on going back to Longyin City,

602
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,600
those things wouldn't have happened.

603
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,200
I heard that Longyin City was badly injured.

604
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,800
Fortunately,

605
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,800
my sister's family is safe.

606
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,200
Maybe,

607
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,200
a lot of things

608
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,600
are not that bad

609
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,400
when it comes to good things.

610
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,400
These two pairs of cloths

611
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,800
are pretty.

612
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,600
I'll keep one pair

613
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,400
and give the other pair to my sister.

614
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,600
It's a wedding gift.

615
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,000
Hua'er laughed at me.

616
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,400
When did I say I was getting married?

617
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,600
I...

618
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,800
It seems that

619
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,600
the Young Master's wife is anxious to be a concubine.

620
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,000
She's looking for another half for my sister.

621
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,600
But

622
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,200
if you want to find my sister,

623
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,000
you have to

624
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,600
force me to do it.

625
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,400
You can't let my sister suffer.

626
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,800
Of course.

627
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,400
You two haven't got married yet.

628
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,400
You're just teasing me.

629
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,200
I won't talk to you anymore.

630
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,600
It seems that

631
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,800
you didn't tell her

632
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,800
that Mei Ying was injured in Longyin City.

633
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,200
She and Mei Ying are siblings.

634
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,000
But they have different personalities.

635
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,600
It's better to let her

636
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,800
be happy than to worry.

637
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,600
You two...

638
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,200
What's wrong with you?

639
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,200
Are you not feeling well?

640
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,400
No matter what happens in the future,

641
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,200
I'll be by your side.

642
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,000
Lin Xu Pavilion

643
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,800
is our home.

644
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,600
Xuan Yi.

645
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:21,800
City Leader.

646
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,000
I'm late.

647
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,000
I couldn't fight with Longyin City.

648
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,600
Please punish me.

649
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,800
Get up.

650
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,600
City Leader, you...

651
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,600
Longyin City was wrongly punished this time.

652
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,600
I was also badly injured.

653
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,800
I shouldn't have been so serious.

654
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,800
I'm here

655
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,200
to tell you

656
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,200
that Longyin City is in need of people.

657
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,600
I need you to help me solve some problems.

658
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,800
City Leader, please give me orders.

659
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,400
This time, it's a last resort.

660
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,400
Many people who used to beg Longyin City

661
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,400
have to leave

662
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,400
because of this situation.

663
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,800
If this continues,

664
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,600
we will be trampled by the people of Jianghu.

665
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,800
But as long as I, Rong Jingfeng, am here,

666
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,600
I will never let Longyin City be taken for granted.

667
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,200
Now,

668
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,600
I need you to help me solve a problem.

669
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,800
Xuanye is willing to help Longyin City.

670
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,400
City Leader, who will be punished?

671
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,400
I want you to take the disciples of Kongzi Hall

672
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,800
to destroy Mei River.

673
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,200
Yes.

674
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,800
City Leader,

675
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,000
I'll take you to the temple.

676
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,800
Yes.

677
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,400
I'll take you to the temple.

678
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,000
City Leader.

679
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:08,600
Has Mei Yuan already

680
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,000
taken care of the disciples as I told him?

681
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,000
City Leader, don't worry.

682
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Everything has been arranged

683
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
according to your instructions.

684
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,600
There will be no accident.

685
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,400
Where is Second Miss?

686
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,000
Is she still in Lingxu Pavilion?

687
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,600
That's right.

688
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,000
Second Miss hasn't returned yet.

689
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,200
I'll ask a doctor to come and have a look.

690
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,000
They're here.

691
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,400
It's them.

692
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,000
Tell them to go.

693
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,800
Make sure they are guarded.

694
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,400
Make sure they are guarded.

695
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,200
Yes.

696
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,800
If you have nothing else to do,

697
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,600
I'll go.

698
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,200
Listen to me.

699
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,600
Don't forget what I said.

700
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,400
Wait for me!

701
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,200
藏 manageable.

702
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:17,800
Like my sword.

703
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,920
is about to go south.

704
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,920
But we still don't know

705
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,800
what the mission is.

706
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,040
You just came back from Longyin City.

707
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,160
You're in a hurry to go out.

708
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,080
There must be a mission.

709
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,800
Send the message back.

710
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,040
Tell the people of the Little Selection Alliance

711
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:30,920
to send more people.

712
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,720
Follow them.

713
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,400
Yes.

714
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,560
Su'er.

715
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,840
How is your injury?

716
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,080
Have you been

717
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,600
resting at home recently?

718
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,480
Thank you for your concern, City Leader.

719
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,520
I'm fine now.

720
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,000
I'm sorry

721
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,960
to bother you and Master Bai.

722
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,360
But

723
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,160
there are many things to deal with in the city.

724
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,800
I don't want to delay the official affairs.

725
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,040
Okay.

726
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,480
But

727
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,320
don't be too tired.

728
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,120
Take care of yourself.

729
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,360
The last time I went to the sea,

730
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,160
Mei Ying agreed to help Mei Zhen.

731
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,200
But when the time came,

732
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,800
she ran away.

733
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,640
Master Bai.

734
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,280
We can't let

735
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,080
such a treacherous person go.

736
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,080
I've sent Xuanye to kill Mei Jiang.

737
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,480
You have to take someone to pick her up.

738
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,880
This time, Mei Jiang

739
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,560
must be destroyed in one go.

740
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:35,720
Yes.

741
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:36,920
I'll do it now.

742
00:37:37,160 --> 00:38:02,160
Be careful on the road.

743
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:02,640
Okay.

744
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:03,960
Don't go.

745
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,440
We were stuck in long slums.

746
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,600
They're not doing anything.

747
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,880
Your Highness.

748
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,960
Ms. Mei, what happened?

749
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,720
Nothing.

750
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,400
A letter from my family

751
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,320
Just call me Xue Man.

752
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,720
Then from now on,

753
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,360
you don't have to worry

754
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,600
about yourself.

755
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,760
Did something happen to Mei family?

756
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,440
Actually, it's my brother.

757
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,200
Ever since he came back from Longyin City,

758
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,680
he's been feeling unstable.

759
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,040
I feel something is wrong.

760
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,080
It's hard to figure out

761
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,640
what's on his mind.

762
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,080
Why would he suddenly go to Longyin City?

763
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,160
I'm afraid he knows

764
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,600
the truth.

765
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,040
Ever since my father left,

766
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,120
my brother has been taking care of

767
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,480
every little thing.

768
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,720
I know what he's going to do.

769
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,480
But anyway,

770
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,680
he'll make sure Mei family is safe.

771
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,520
But this time,

772
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,280
ever since he came back,

773
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,280
he's been like a different person.

774
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,200
He's always worried and scared.

775
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,240
He even has to light up the fire in his bedroom.

776
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,600
He has also sent a lot of people

777
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,720
to patrol the house.

778
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,880
But I asked him

779
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,960
and he didn't say anything.

780
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,080
Are you worried

781
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,880
that Mei Ying has been in trouble?

782
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,760
In a few days,

783
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,640
it'll be the wedding day

784
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,320
of Young Master and Rong Hua.

785
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,000
I'm worried that Rong Hua

786
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,280
won't be able to attend the wedding.

787
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,080
So I'm thinking of going back

788
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,280
to visit my brother today.

789
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,400
You

790
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,680
should live in Linxu Pavilion.

791
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,280
I'll send someone

792
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,560
to check on your brother.

793
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,840
If there's any news,

794
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,200
I'll tell you right away.

795
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,480
Are you

796
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,160
hiding something from me?

797
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,320
Could it be that

798
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,720
this Linxu Pavilion incident

799
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,000
also has my brother's part?

800
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,320
Master.

801
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,960
Four 어느

802
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,440
It seems that I have no piece of Inter 우루

803
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,800
We're pleased

804
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:34,620
A

805
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,760
Master, what happened?

806
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,560
Inform Lingxu Pavilion

807
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,160
that Longyin City sent someone to kill Mei Jiang.

808
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,720
Mei Ying was in a fight with Lingxu Pavilion in Longyin City.

809
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,240
She died a long time ago.

810
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,840
But what does this have to do with Lingxu Pavilion?

811
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,600
I'm worried that

812
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,520
Rong Jingfeng's death

813
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,200
is not here.

814
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,760
If Lingxu Pavilion does the defense in advance,

815
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,720
you can be safe.

816
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,320
I'll tell Senior Sister now.

817
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,000
Young Master.

818
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,320
Young Master, hurry up.

819
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,480
Hurry up.

820
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,080
What's wrong, Young Master?

821
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,000
Hurry up.

822
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,200
Young Master, what's wrong?

823
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,600
Did you hear that?

824
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,000
There are so many footsteps

825
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,400
approaching us.

826
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,000
No.

827
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,000
I didn't hear anything.

828
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,960
Did you hear it wrong?

829
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,960
It must be them.

830
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,080
They are here.

831
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,080
It must be them.

832
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:03,720
Hurry up.

833
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,000
It's them.

834
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,200
It's them.

835
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,080
It's them.

836
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:33,640
I...

837
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,000
I...

838
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:35,520
I...

839
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:35,880
I saw.

840
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,520
uphold light and the five moral verses of the protection agreement.

841
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,400
Protecting people from debauching and immorality with heart-wrenching love.

842
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,480
Protecting the course of the world from destruction.

843
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,080
Protect the world from the assisted 뭘.
