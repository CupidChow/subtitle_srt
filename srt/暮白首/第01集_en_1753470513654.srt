1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of death.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of death.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of death.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of death.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of death.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of death.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of death.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of death.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of death.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of death.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of death.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of death.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of death.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of death.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not afraid of death.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of death.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of death.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of death.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of death.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of death.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of death.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of death.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of death.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of death.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of death.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of death.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of death.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of death.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,800
I'm not afraid of death.

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,720
Don't push!

31
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,640
Don't be stupid.

32
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,760
Why did you come here?

33
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,320
Give that thing to me and you'll have to spend your whole life.

34
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,960
Just now, I accidentally dropped it and fell into the water.

35
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,200
Congratulations!

36
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,760
I picked Lu Yin euipon.

37
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,560
Steamed look like pushes the river away.

38
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,120
kinds of subversive weapons in your way.

39
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,120
Who are you?

40
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,360
Look at your capable

41
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,360
and graceful Ladyем花

42
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,280
who's so good at fighting them.

43
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,640
That's admirable.

44
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,720
How about you know I'm Lady missed?

45
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,200
Besides,

46
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,320
how can you know I can't handle them?

47
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,080
Even if you don't come,

48
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,240
Okay, do it yourself Luckily

49
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,440
go

50
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,280
I'm going

51
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,080
I am Lin Jing, a man from Nanyang.

52
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,080
Let's go.

53
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,080
What are we going to do?

54
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,080
Go.

55
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,080
Did my master really ask you to save me?

56
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,080
Of course.

57
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,080
Don't worry.

58
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,080
No one will peek.

59
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,080
You are really weak.

60
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,080
Why don't you think about it?

61
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,080
Please escort you back safely.

62
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,080
I have something to ask you.

63
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,080
I know what you want to ask.

64
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,080
Longyin City is very famous in the world.

65
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,080
The city's owner has two daughters.

66
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,080
The eldest daughter is very skilled.

67
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,080
She is very good at martial arts.

68
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,080
She is the second daughter.

69
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,080
What's wrong with the second daughter?

70
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,080
She is favored by the beast.

71
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,080
The two daughters

72
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,080
have completely different personalities and skills.

73
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,080
Of course, it's not difficult to tell.

74
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,080
I saved you this time

75
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,080
because I was entrusted by my apprentice.

76
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,080
Where did you get the apprentice?

77
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,080
Because I said

78
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,080
a very unreliable apprentice.

79
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,080
You are the second daughter of Longyin City.

80
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,080
You changed clothes like this.

81
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,080
You didn't change it yourself, did you?

82
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,080
None of your business.

83
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,080
This time, the second daughter's letter

84
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,080
did the master see anything wrong?

85
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,080
She has never been on good terms with the master.

86
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,080
This time, she is a little embarrassed.

87
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,080
I'm sorry.

88
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,080
Rong Hua has never been on good terms with the master.

89
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,080
She rarely gets close to me.

90
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,080
But this time, she is in a hurry

91
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,080
and wants me to go out of the city to pick her up.

92
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,080
If you want to know my attitude,

93
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,080
you can't fall into the trap.

94
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,080
Send the apprentice to keep an eye on her immediately.

95
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,080
And that Lin Jing.

96
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,080
I don't know what the origin is.

97
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,080
What is the purpose of following Rong Hua?

98
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,080
Master is worried

99
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,080
that the second daughter will take the initiative

100
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,080
to ask for help.

101
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,080
It's a trap.

102
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,080
Whether Rong Hua gets the Chihua Bead or not,

103
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,080
I will never give up the position of the master.

104
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,080
I want to see

105
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,080
what tricks she can play.

106
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,080
What tricks?

107
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,080
Lin Jing has been helping me since the beginning.

108
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,080
Is it a trap?

109
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,080
It's hard to predict people's heart.

110
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,080
I have to be careful.

111
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,080
I have to leave this night

112
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,080
and take her out of the trap

113
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,080
and continue to investigate.

114
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,080
I have to be careful.

115
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,080
What's wrong?

116
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,080
Nothing.

117
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,080
I just fell by accident.

118
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,080
Very fresh.

119
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,080
I didn't see it.

120
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,080
You have the habit of looking at the stars at night.

121
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,080
But it's late at night.

122
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,080
It's really not safe for you to be out alone.

123
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,080
I think

124
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,080
I should accompany you.

125
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,080
I'm suddenly sleepy.

126
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,080
You go by yourself.

127
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,080
How can I go alone?

128
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,080
It's interesting to go alone.

129
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,080
Let's go.

130
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,080
Look at the stars.

131
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,080
Longying City is like a full sky full of stars

132
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,080
with a deep grass.

133
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,080
If I want to find the truth,

134
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,080
I must go to Longying City.

135
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,080
No matter the result is bad,

136
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,080
I have to solve this problem myself.

137
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,080
Why are you running?

138
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,080
Why do you think it's so expensive to chase?

139
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,080
You are looking at the stars.

140
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,080
Why are you...

141
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,080
Little angel,

142
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,080
don't scare the stars away.

143
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,080
Lin Jing is being followed by someone in the tea house.

144
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,080
The martial arts is extraordinary.

145
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,080
It seems to be a difficult opponent.

146
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,080
Let's go.

147
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,080
Where are you going?

148
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,080
Let's go.

149
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,080
Be careful.

150
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,080
You should learn martial arts from me in the future.

151
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,080
Look, there's only one roof left.

152
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,080
It's so high.

153
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,080
You are so good at martial arts.

154
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,080
You even teach me martial arts.

155
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,080
What?

156
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,080
Nothing.

157
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,080
I said it's okay.

158
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,080
Do you know?

159
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,080
Every star in the sky

160
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,080
has its own story.

161
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,080
What story can the stars have?

162
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,080
The star is the five-tailed fox, the dust is the light.

163
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,080
The sky is the seven-tailed dragon.

164
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,080
The self-willed man is the man who is always on the south.

165
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,080
The sea is the summer, the south is visible.

166
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,080
Look there.

167
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,080
That place is the seven-tailed fox.

168
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,080
Does it look like the rock with the long tail?

169
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,080
It's there.

170
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,080
I see it.

171
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,080
It's there.

172
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,080
Rocks face east, the world is spring.

173
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,080
Rocks face south, the world is summer.

174
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,080
Rocks face west, the world is autumn.

175
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,080
Rocks face north, the world is winter.

176
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,080
So smart.

177
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,080
It's late.

178
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,080
Let's go.

179
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,080
Do you want to come?

180
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,080
Okay.

181
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,080
Do you know what the stars like?

182
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,080
The stars like the way they look in your eyes.

183
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,080
It turns out

184
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,080
that they are not as annoying as you think.

185
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,080
Do you like the way the stars look in your eyes?

186
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,080
I like the way they look in your eyes.

187
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,080
Do you like the way the stars look in your eyes?

188
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,080
Of course.

189
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,080
If you like it,

190
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,080
I will be outside your bed all the time.

191
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,080
So when you want to see the stars,

192
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,080
you don't have to fall out of the window.

193
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,080
Only by entering Longyin City

194
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,080
can I find the truth of my father's death.

195
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,080
I can't miss this opportunity.

196
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,080
I wanted to get rid of this Tuo Youping.

197
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,080
I didn't expect it to be so stupid.

198
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,080
It seems I have to think of something.

199
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,080
Lin Jing.

200
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,080
Don't blame me.

201
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,080
You lost something?

202
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,080
You followed me all the way.

203
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,080
Did you come for the Chihua Bead?

204
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,080
Why don't you say something?

205
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,080
Now you lost the Chihua Bead.

206
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,080
Except you, there is no one else.

207
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,080
It seems you have a reason.

208
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,080
Maybe the things on the lake

209
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,080
are not as good as you think.

210
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,080
You are so stupid.

211
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,080
You are so stupid.

212
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,080
You are also stupid.

213
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,080
Finished?

214
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,080
What?

215
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,080
You are so disappointed

216
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,080
that you have been caught by me?

217
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,080
I am always honest.

218
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,080
No matter what kind of misdeeds and misunderstandings,

219
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,080
we should find out and investigate it.

220
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,080
Am I right?

221
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,080
What do you want?

222
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,080
Since you said

223
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,080
I stole your Chihua Bead,

224
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,080
shouldn't you check it yourself?

225
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,080
See if the Chihua Bead

226
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,080
in your Longyin City

227
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,080
is on me.

228
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,080
Master Tang, there is a problem.

229
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,080
Miss Shanglai is the one who did this.

230
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,080
She only deals with Lin Jing.

231
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,080
They are here.

232
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,080
They are going to kill me.

233
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,080
Who is the one she wants to kill?

234
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,080
Lin Jing or me?

235
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,080
Or the Chihua Bead?

236
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,080
Miss Shanglai.

237
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,080
But she is here to receive the medicine.

238
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,160
I know the person outside.

239
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,000
You're hurt?

240
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,080
I'm fine.

241
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,880
You're hurt because of me.

242
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,920
How can you be fine?

243
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,880
Get up.

244
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,600
Leave now.

245
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,120
What's going on?

246
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,880
I don't have time to explain it to you.

247
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,760
Just leave.

248
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,760
You don't want to explain it to me?

249
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,400
I won't leave.

250
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,680
It's dangerous here.

251
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:13,880
Leave now.

252
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,480
This...

253
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,600
Your wound is poisonous.

254
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,320
How about I do it?

255
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,440
Poisonous?

256
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,280
You're so good.

257
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,120
I'll give you a chance.

258
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,200
You do it.

259
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,600
Bear with it.

260
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,600
Bear with it.

261
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,680
You wrote a letter to me

262
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,520
and asked me to come to pick you up.

263
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,480
I asked the disciples of Kongzi Hall

264
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,640
to help you get out of the trouble.

265
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,080
But you ordered them to retreat.

266
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,760
Instead, you protected that Lin Jing.

267
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,160
What's your plan?

268
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,320
I did ask Sister to pick me up.

269
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,040
I just want you to take

270
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,720
the Chihua Bead back to the city.

271
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,880
I didn't ask you to hurt that Lin Jing.

272
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,080
Besides,

273
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:49,800
the poison on the label

274
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,120
is made by the Bingsi Hall.

275
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,760
The common people don't have the antidote.

276
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,480
Sister, give me the antidote.

277
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,800
This Lin Jing

278
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,040
has a strange background.

279
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,080
These days,

280
00:18:59,400 --> 00:18:59,800
I saw him

281
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,000
pestering you to be the Hall Leader.

282
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,440
He must have a bad intention.

283
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,000
Since you got the label,

284
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,280
it means he's unlucky.

285
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,480
Why bother to save him?

286
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,760
It's better to kill a suspicious person

287
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,240
than to leave a hidden danger.

288
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,400
Although I don't know his background,

289
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,720
he saved my life.

290
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,480
The disciples of Kongzi Hall

291
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,840
came to protect each other

292
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:21,880
with such a big battle.

293
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:21,920
with such a big battle.

294
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:21,960
with such a big battle.

295
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,280
But the label didn't catch his eye.

296
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,880
Lin Jing was well-behaved and avoided it.

297
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,520
If I get hurt for nothing,

298
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,800
Sister will be kind to me.

299
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,760
Sister was kind to me and made me do bad things.

300
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,960
I feel sorry for her

301
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,960
for being punished by me.

302
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,240
It seems that you are worried for nothing

303
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,480
and are just nervous.

304
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,240
I didn't say that.

305
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,360
I know clearly

306
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,360
why Sister came here.

307
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,040
I'm afraid that others will misunderstand Sister.

308
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,480
Anyone who wants to eat the porridge

309
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:55,960
will die.

310
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,960
People in Longyin City

311
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,680
are so unreasonable.

312
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,240
Sister,

313
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,640
this is the porridge.

314
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,640
Please take it back.

315
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:26,880
Father.

316
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,160
Hua is back.

317
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,560
Father.

318
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,320
Hua.

319
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,560
Hua is back.

320
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,520
I've been worried about you.

321
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,160
It's good that you are back.

322
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,000
It's good that you are back.

323
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:43,880
Where is the thing?

324
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,560
Show it to me.

325
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,200
Father.

326
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,120
I was delayed on my way.

327
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,320
So I asked Sister to bring the thing back.

328
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,360
Sister.

329
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,360
City Leader.

330
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,240
The porridge is here.

331
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,600
City Leader.

332
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,400
It's here.

333
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,360
Good. Hua.

334
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,440
The Chihua Bead is the best treasure in Longyin City.

335
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,400
You didn't lose the face of Longyin City this time.

336
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,400
The Chihua Bead

337
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,680
is the best medicine in the world.

338
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,680
It's unique in Longyin City.

339
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,800
Hua successfully got it back this time.

340
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,400
It's a great achievement.

341
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,320
The position of Hall Leader of the Holy Weapon Hall

342
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,360
has been vacant for a long time.

343
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,360
It's time to find a leader.

344
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,560
You've found a leader.

345
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,840
I studied medicine since I was a kid.

346
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,760
I'm good at keeping people's hearts.

347
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,600
I think the position of Hall Leader

348
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:35,960
is not his fault.

349
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,280
Father.

350
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,000
Why don't we open it and take a look?

351
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,160
Okay. Let's take a look.

352
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:47,880
Hua.

353
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,480
What's going on?

354
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,120
Hua.

355
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,920
What are you doing?

356
00:21:59,080 --> 00:21:59,960
Where's the Chihua Bead?

357
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,040
Take it out.

358
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,120
Did someone steal it

359
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,680
and take it away?

360
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,360
Xiao Xiao.

361
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,480
Hong Su.

362
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,360
I gave it to you.

363
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,400
Did something happen on the way?

364
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,320
Rong Hua.

365
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,080
I didn't open the box

366
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,160
since the day you gave it to me.

367
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,080
It's okay if you're greedy.

368
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,760
How can you be so insolent about eating the Chihua Bead?

369
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,200
Make it clear.

370
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,360
Don't think about slander.

371
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,760
Sister.

372
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,760
Don't worry.

373
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,760
Listen to me first.

374
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,520
Father.

375
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,760
I traveled through the vast sky this time.

376
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,640
I remember you told me

377
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,520
that you and mother met there.

378
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,480
Later, mother left early

379
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,240
and didn't have a chance to go there again.

380
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,600
So I brought this stone back

381
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,280
to make it a gift for father.

382
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:42,920
This girl.

383
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,840
I see.

384
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,360
Hua is really thoughtful.

385
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,600
But

386
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,000
where is our Chihua Bead?

387
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,000
Father.

388
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,280
Sister is so good at martial arts.

389
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,880
She didn't find the Chihua Bead.

390
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,600
How can I be the best?

391
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,280
Besides,

392
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,560
with my martial arts,

393
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,320
how can I know

394
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,480
where the Chihua Bead is?

395
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,320
Master Tang was killed.

396
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,040
The Chihua Bead was stolen.

397
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,240
Is it

398
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,520
a fake murder?

399
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,200
I think you

400
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,520
don't have to worry

401
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,320
or worry.

402
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,080
Isn't the Chihua Bead

403
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,320
the treasure of your Longyin City?

404
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,440
Everyone in this world knows.

405
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,360
Those who took the Chihua Bead

406
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,520
must take the antidote.

407
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,240
If there is no antidote, it's useless.

408
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,320
Master, don't worry.

409
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,960
I think this murderer

410
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,400
will be sent to the door soon.

411
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,920
Who are you?

412
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,000
Father.

413
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,760
I forgot to tell you.

414
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,000
His name is Lin Jing.

415
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,560
When I met the killer on the way,

416
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,880
he saved my life.

417
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,360
Later, sister may have some misunderstandings about him.

418
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,600
So I hurt him by accident.

419
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,280
I really can't cure the poison on him.

420
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,880
So I brought him back.

421
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,040
But don't worry.

422
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,720
When he's healed,

423
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,720
I'll let him go.

424
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,360
I see.

425
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,760
I finally escaped from home

426
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,600
and came here.

427
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,680
Actually,

428
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,240
I'm part of Longyin City.

429
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,760
To be honest,

430
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,000
besides saving my life,

431
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,560
I have a certain identity.

432
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,320
This...

433
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,040
This...

434
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,840
Young Master,

435
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,280
why do you say that?

436
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,200
Let your Master Bai...

437
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,200
Master Bai...

438
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,560
Let Master Bai

439
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,600
explain it to you.

440
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,520
Bai.

441
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,240
What's going on?

442
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,840
Actually,

443
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,960
he's not an important person.

444
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,000
Bai,

445
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,800
don't be so stupid.

446
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,400
What's going on?

447
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,520
Tell me the truth.

448
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,400
Elder.

449
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,040
Elder.

450
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,840
Why are you so careless?

451
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,440
It's you, you brat.

452
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,640
Put me down.

453
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,120
I finally got you up.

454
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,360
How can I let you go so easily?

455
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,880
I know.

456
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,400
You hit your foot in the barbecue chicken, right?

457
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,160
No.

458
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,080
I...

459
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,320
I saw you eat it yourself.

460
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,240
The barbecue chicken

461
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,920
with plum wine

462
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,960
is the best.

463
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,040
Elder.

464
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,560
You're a glutton.

465
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,840
You won't end up well.

466
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,000
I made it very clear.

467
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,160
The barbecue chicken

468
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,480
must be with plum wine.

469
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,440
Okay.

470
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,800
Forget it.

471
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,240
I'll take my leave.

472
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,480
I have a lot of work to do.

473
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,040
I won't be a part of your business.

474
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,240
What...

475
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,840
What do you want to say?

476
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,720
I want you to

477
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,080
treat me as your master.

478
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,160
So I can be taken care of

479
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,240
on my way home from the wedding.

480
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:14,840
Okay?

481
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,960
You're so arrogant.

482
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,160
You're hopeless.

483
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,360
If I'm hopeless,

484
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,360
you can

485
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,160
set yourself free.

486
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:24,800
Well...

487
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,040
I'll take you as my master.

488
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,840
Louder.

489
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,720
I can't hear you.

490
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,200
Master.

491
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,280
Good boy.

492
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,680
I...

493
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,880
I've seen you before.

494
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,960
That's right.

495
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,120
Miss.

496
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,880
Master Bai is your master.

497
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,600
Today, a master

498
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,440
of Master Bai came out.

499
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,480
Then this one called Lin Jing

500
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,280
is your master, right?

501
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,040
You're so insincere.

502
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,840
Don't mention him again.

503
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,560
Do you hear me?

504
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,400
Then on your way back to the city,

505
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,840
would the one who tried to attack

506
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,080
be the one who did it on purpose?

507
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,600
For example,

508
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,400
the people of Longyin City.

509
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,880
Where did you hear

510
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,400
these rumors?

511
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,920
I don't even know who the murderer is.

512
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,000
How did you know?

513
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,360
You don't know.

514
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,560
Before you came back to the city,

515
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,400
the rumors had spread all over the city.

516
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,080
It's obvious that someone is not good enough for you.

517
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,200
Even the master suspects that it's that person.

518
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,360
Tell me.

519
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,640
My sister is the master of Kongzi Hall.

520
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,800
How could she do such a thing?

521
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,120
Don't talk about it behind my back.

522
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,640
Okay.

523
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,360
Master Xue is not good at it.

524
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,280
But he was injured so badly.

525
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,240
What is the source of the Lingxue Pavilion?

526
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,720
In the martial arts world,

527
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,720
you can only see shadows, not the stars.

528
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,360
If their power continues to expand,

529
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,040
it will be the place where I, Longyin City, will be.

530
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,440
It's time to investigate it.

531
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,480
I've sent people to investigate.

532
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,680
Lingxue Pavilion is a mysterious sect that has appeared in recent years.

533
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,400
Many people are curious about it and try to ask.

534
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:32,960
But

535
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,880
they have no regrets.

536
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,280
No one in the world has ever seen the people of Lingxue Pavilion alive.

537
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,240
There are even rumors that

538
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,000
Lingxue Pavilion's disciples

539
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,920
have the ability to enter the world

540
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,720
and spread the world.

541
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,880
It's just a rumor.

542
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,840
As long as Lingxue Pavilion really exists,

543
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,280
there will be a day when it will be exposed.

544
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,080
If there is a chance,

545
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,400
I will personally ask for it.

546
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,800
This time,

547
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,320
I could have taken back the Chihua Bead

548
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,520
and used it to help Master Tang

549
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,000
get closer to the City Master.

550
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,440
But

551
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,720
I didn't get anything from Second Miss.

552
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,320
Rong Hua seems to be right.

553
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,160
The City Master is very obsessed with it.

554
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,000
The Chihua Bead was stolen this time is too strange.

555
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,920
I suspect there is another hidden agenda in it.

556
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,880
Master Tang suspects that Second Miss

557
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,480
hid the Chihua Bead and was not guilty.

558
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,240
Second Miss,

559
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,000
what are you doing?

560
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,640
It's okay. Don't worry.

561
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,360
I'll be waiting at the door.

562
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,720
Someone is coming. Tell me.

563
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,160
If you're worried about this person,

564
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,560
just drive him away.

565
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,920
Why do you have to go to the Lord?

566
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,160
I'll investigate it myself.

567
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,240
How can I drive him away without evidence?

568
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,360
Besides,

569
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,800
I brought this person back.

570
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,320
Of course I have to investigate it.

571
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,440
Go.

572
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,800
It's strange.

573
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,880
Where is Lin Ji?

574
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,720
Wait for me.

575
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,240
What are you waiting for?

576
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,640
I'm right here.

577
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,040
You...

578
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,480
When did you come in?

579
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,000
I didn't expect that our second Miss

580
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,400
would not only like night-vision,

581
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,760
but also like to sneak into other people's rooms.

582
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,680
I'm sorry.

583
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,880
I didn't mean to disturb you.

584
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,680
I'm sorry.

585
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,840
I didn't mean to disturb you.

586
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,880
I didn't mean to disturb you.

587
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,880
I didn't mean to disturb you.

588
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,080
You...

589
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,080
You...

590
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,560
You don't even want to walk through the door,

591
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,720
but you have to climb through the window?

592
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,800
When I returned to my room,

593
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,960
I saw someone guarding the door.

594
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,040
I was curious of what happened.

595
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,520
So I went around the window

596
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,960
and climbed into the window to see what happened.

597
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,240
I didn't expect that

598
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,120
our second Miss

599
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,920
would do something

600
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,840
that's unbecoming in my room.

601
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,360
What are you talking about?

602
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,360
I'm here to give you a candle.

603
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,960
I'm not good-hearted.

604
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,360
Last time,

605
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,760
you framed me for stealing things,

606
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,360
and searched me all over my body.

607
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,360
You're innocent.

608
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,960
I was hurt without any reason.

609
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,360
This time,

610
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,360
shouldn't you take the initiative

611
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,760
to search me all over my body?

612
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,360
Don't come over.

613
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:21,960
You...

614
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,960
Don't come over.

615
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:30,960
You...

616
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,160
Go away.

617
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,160
What are you doing?

618
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,360
Miss.

619
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,360
Miss.

620
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,160
It's late.

621
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,360
What are you doing here?

622
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:43,760
I...

623
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,960
I'm just passing by.

624
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,760
Kongzi Hall lost an important item.

625
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:47,960
We have to search it.

626
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:48,760
It's none of your business.

627
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,360
Leave.

628
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,760
No, Miss.

629
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:51,760
Miss.

630
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,160
Miss.

631
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,160
No, Miss.

632
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:54,560
Let go of me.

633
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,160
Miss.

634
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,560
Go away.

635
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,360
Let go of me.

636
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,560
Here they are.

637
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,560
Good evening.

638
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,560
Miss.

639
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,360
What's going on?

640
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,560
A girl's house?

641
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,960
If this kind of thing is spread in the city,

642
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,560
how can it be?

643
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,360
Dad.

644
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,760
I'm just sending candles to the neighbor.

645
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:34,960
City Leader.

646
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,160
When I entered the room,

647
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,960
I saw Rong Hua holding the candle.

648
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,960
You know how to speak for your sister today.

649
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,960
Then tell me first.

650
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,560
Is your sister's prediction

651
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,160
related to you?

652
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,560
So the one who the City Leader suspected is always me.

653
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,760
No matter what I say or do,

654
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,160
you already know I'm behind all this.

655
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,960
I've been born and died for Longyuan City.

656
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,160
I've killed a lot of people I should kill.

657
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,560
But I won't admit my crime.

658
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,360
Enough.

659
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,760
Don't think I don't know what you're thinking.

660
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,360
From the first few days,

661
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,960
you've been sending people to stare at your sister.

662
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,560
Don't you know what you want to do?

663
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,560
You're still arguing with me now.

664
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:21,960
I'm not.

665
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,360
Dad.

666
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,160
Dad.

667
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,960
You really misunderstood my sister.

668
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,360
This has nothing to do with my sister.

669
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,560
I told my sister to come to pick me up

670
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,360
and bring Zhi Hua Zhu back to the city.

671
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,360
If my sister is a little selfish,

672
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,560
she can open the wooden box and find out the truth.

673
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,360
In my opinion,

674
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,560
my sister is not at all selfish to Longyuan City.

675
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,560
She's loyal.

676
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,160
Okay.

677
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,160
You don't have to help her anymore.

678
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,960
If she's really like that,

679
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,760
that's good.

680
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:53,960
I'm sorry.

681
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,960
Thank you for explaining to me in front of the City Leader.

682
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,560
I also want to thank my sister for clearing up the relationship with Lin Jing.

683
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,160
I haven't had time to thank you for the secret interaction.

684
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,360
Sister.

685
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,960
We are sisters.

686
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,760
I have always been a sister to you.

687
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,960
I've always been a sister to you.

688
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,160
Rong Hua.

689
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,360
I will find out the truth about the assassin

690
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,560
and get rid of Lin Jian Chi secretly.

691
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:38,960
I have something to do.

692
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,160
I gotta go.

693
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,160
According to the order of the City Leader,

694
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,760
did you get any news?

695
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,960
There are indeed people from the south of the Yangtze River.

696
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,160
But it seems that

697
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,160
they moved away several years ago.

698
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,360
So I took the pictures of Lin

699
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,360
and gave them to the people nearby.

700
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,760
Some people say that they do have a portrait.

701
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,760
But it's hard to tell

702
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,760
if it's been ten or nine.

703
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,960
The rest of the news

704
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,560
needs to be carefully analyzed.

705
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,160
It may take some time.

706
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,360
Okay.

707
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,560
No need to inquire about the news anymore.

708
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,160
The City Leader's death

709
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,160
is a big deal.

710
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,760
For the safety of Longyin City,

711
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,360
we can't let go of the possibility

712
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,760
of killing the wrong person.

713
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,760
Find a chance

714
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,560
to get rid of him.

715
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,760
But you have to remember

716
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,560
that you can't leave any clues.

717
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:40,960
Yes.

718
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,560
Go.

719
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,160
I'm so angry.

720
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,760
I'm so angry.

721
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,360
I'm so angry.

722
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,160
Where are you going?

723
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,760
Why are you angry?

724
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,960
You just escaped from the wedding.

725
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,360
It's not good to go anywhere.

726
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,760
Why do you have to come to Longyin City?

727
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,960
I can go anywhere.

728
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,560
Why can't I stay in Longyin City?

729
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,760
Because you are not welcome here.

730
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,160
Impossible.

731
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,960
Your father just asked me to stay here for a while.

732
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,960
I can see that

733
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,760
everyone in Longyin City likes me.

734
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,360
You are so shameless.

735
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:31,960
I've had enough.

736
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,360
I order you to get out of Longyin City.

737
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,360
What are you looking at?

738
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,760
Little disciple is quite cute.

739
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,960
Who lied?

740
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,960
Don't be so self-righteous.

741
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,360
Besides,

742
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,760
I don't need you to tell me if I'm cute or not.

743
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,360
I know it myself.

744
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,160
What?

745
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,160
You're still here?

746
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,360
Why are there so many people at night?

747
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,360
Is someone going to marry again?

748
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,360
I'm going to the wedding.

749
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,360
I'm going to the wedding.

750
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,360
I'm going to the wedding.

751
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,360
I'm going to the wedding.

752
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,360
I'm going to the wedding.

753
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,360
I'm going to the wedding.

754
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,360
I'm going to the wedding.

755
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,360
I'm going to the wedding.

756
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,360
I'm going to the wedding.

757
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,360
I'm going to the wedding.

758
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,360
I'm going to the wedding.

759
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,360
I'm going to the wedding.

760
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,360
I'm going to the wedding.

761
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,360
I'm going to the wedding.

762
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,360
I'm going to the wedding.

763
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,360
I'm going to the wedding.

764
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,360
I'm going to the wedding.

765
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,360
I'm going to the wedding.

766
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,360
I'm going to the wedding.

767
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,360
I'm going to the wedding.

768
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,360
I'm going to the wedding.

769
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,360
I'm going to the wedding.

770
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,360
I'm going to the wedding.

771
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,360
I'm going to the wedding.

772
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,300
You can give it to her.

773
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,520
She doesn't look like a located person.

774
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,000
Looks like she used name

775
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
to get the ground.

776
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,200
That tonight was urgent as the situation caused the sudden지도her.

777
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,120
You must have the wrong place.

778
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,320
It is the city of Longyin.

779
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,040
Don't you think it is easy to show off a nothinathe.

780
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,000
Hurry up and leave.

781
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,000
I was not at the wrong place.

782
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,040
I don't know which girl

783
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,080
you want to marry.

784
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,640
Is the marriage in Shengge

785
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,480
a marriageable marriage in half the night?

786
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,080
I wonder if the man in your heart

787
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,360
is still in the city

788
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,640
still still is a Ghost Lord charmer of our city

789
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,200
00,

790
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,360
Let's start at first.

791
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,080
Cao Yongtai.

792
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,240
there's a ghost.

793
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,320
Just wait.

794
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,000
He is in the city now.

795
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,800
Please make yourself at home.

796
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,480
How dare you!

797
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,680
My patience has reached its limit.

798
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,920
This game should end.

799
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,480
If you don't leave,

800
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,160
don't blame me for being rude.

801
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,280
You are too impatient.

802
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,800
Say another word and try it.

803
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,840
Lin Jing is in the city now.

804
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,400
If you can let him leave the city,

805
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,000
I will take someone to leave.

806
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,280
I will not stay for long.

807
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,360
Lin Jing?

808
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:15,800
Yes.

809
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,760
Did he say he was going to run away from the wedding?

810
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,080
You made this up.

811
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,560
Go back with someone.

812
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,120
And stop it.

813
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,080
You are wrong.

814
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,480
If I really go back,

815
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,240
I will be irresponsible to that girl.

816
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,480
I don't think so.

817
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,240
You stay here.

818
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,440
I am annoyed by you.

819
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,280
Sister.

820
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,640
Why are you here?

821
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,360
What's wrong with your neck?

822
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,360
The syringerapin

823
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,120
You...

824
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,080
you run away with a woman?

825
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,200
Obviously.

826
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,960
You should be camera corps Chao.

827
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,200
If you can westwardly

828
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,640
take women back with you,

829
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,080
it won't hurt me a lot casually.

830
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,360
Anyway,

831
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,760
did you think about my story

832
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,000
when you tried to run away from our marriage?

833
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,880
You said you were bored at home

834
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,400
You wanted to go out and watch the show before you get married

835
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,320
Relax

836
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,480
I thought about it

837
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,880
Many years of brother

838
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,920
I'll help you with this little thing

839
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,640
I didn't expect you to run away from marriage

840
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,680
You can't imagine how Mrs. Shi will punish me

841
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,680
Just now, I know how to care about me

842
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,280
And ask me if I was hurt

843
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,600
You know that Miss Mei is waiting for you at home

844
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:09,880
Finished

845
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,240
When can you get rid of your trouble?

846
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,120
I don't say how can you know the power of it

847
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,120
Lin Jing

848
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,240
Your family has found it

849
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,800
Hurry up and go back with him

850
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,800
Don't delay

851
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,040
Go

852
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,640
Okay

853
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:24,840
Go back

854
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,240
Lin Jing

855
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,120
I'm talking about that side, not this side

856
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,160
You stop for me

857
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,440
Lin Jing

858
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,520
What happened just now was really a disturbance

859
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,120
It was inconvenient for the City Leader and everyone

860
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,280
Please forgive me

861
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,440
If not

862
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,480
I'm afraid I can't force Lin Jing to show up

863
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,400
There are many disturbances tonight

864
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I'm leaving

865
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,360
stop

866
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,640
Longyun City is not a place for children to go freely

867
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,880
Miss Rong is still injured

868
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,720
Not easy to move

869
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,240
As long as Lin Jing is in the city for a day

870
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,440
I will come again

871
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,880
Miss Rong

872
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,720
Are you afraid we won't have a chance to meet?

873
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,720
ridiculous

874
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,080
Who wants to meet you again?

875
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,440
If you don't want to meet me again

876
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,640
Then quickly tear Lin Jing out of Longyun City

877
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,680
So it's not a good way to get both sides together

878
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,080
I'm sorry

879
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,080
I'm sorry

880
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,080
I'm sorry

881
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,080
I'm sorry

882

I'm sorry

883

I'm sorry

886

I'm sorry

887
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,080
I'm sorry

888
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,080
I'm sorry

889

I'm sorry

890

I'm sorry

897
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,080
I'm sorry

898
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,080
I'm sorry

899
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,080
I'm sorry

900
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,080
I'm sorry

901
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,080
I'm sorry

902
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,080
I'm sorry

903
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,080
I'm sorry

I'm sorry

908
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,080
I'm sorry

909
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,080
I'm sorry

910
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,080
I'm sorry

911
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,080
I'm sorry

912
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,080
