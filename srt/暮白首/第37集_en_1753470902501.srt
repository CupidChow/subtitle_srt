1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,120
No强调

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I will be your enemy

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I will be your enemy

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I will be your enemy

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I will be your enemy

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I will be your enemy

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The Long Ballad

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Episode 16

9
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What's your plan for the future?

10
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Me?

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I want to live a rich and rich life

12
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I have saved a lot of money

13
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I will buy a big yard in Jiangnan

14
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Like a plum tree

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Plant some flowers and plants

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I will buy some servants

17
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I don't have to worry about anything

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You smile

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Don't fool around

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You are always so happy

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I thought you wouldn't smile since you were a kid

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's not a bad thing to laugh

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Why are you so stubborn?

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Xuanye

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
If you have no plans in the future

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Come to Jiangnan to find me

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
My house is big

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I will take you in

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's still a good chance

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Ok

31
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
If I have a chance in the future

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I will definitely go to you

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I will go to you

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Su

35
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Why are you standing here?

36
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Are you looking for me?

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Nothing

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What's wrong?

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So unhappy

40
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm just thinking

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What is missing in Mr. Bai's trip?

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I have arranged for others to prepare for the food and clothing

43
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You don't have to worry

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You just need to cheer up

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We will send them out of the city together

46
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
This Mr. Bai

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
All the martial arts are so poor

48
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's a pity

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's a pity

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
If he can help us deal with Mohuan

51
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It should be a useful chess piece

52
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's a pity

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's a pity

54
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
City leader

55
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What's wrong?

56
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Is Mr. Bai really dying?

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Su

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I have warned you more than once

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
There is no human feelings in this world

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Some are just the same logic as the city king losing the king

61
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Sometimes we have to make choices for our Longyin city

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Maybe

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You have to encounter some setbacks

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
To know what kind of path you should take

65
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I will go to the city

66
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Dad

67
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm sorry

68
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Dad

69
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You all come to Longyin city today

70
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So brave

71
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What's wrong?

72
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Is there any misunderstanding?

73
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I will go to the city

74
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Rong Jingfeng

75
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You are too vicious

76
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You actually poisoned my master

77
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Fortunately, your evil plan has been cut out by my master

78
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
After I have a secret contact with my two brothers

79
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I will investigate everything

80
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And changed the medicine

81
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Otherwise

82
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
My master will be poisoned by you

83
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It turns out that you have been making trouble

84
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I have personally pulled this old money

85
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It shouldn't be so fast

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I was secretly moving my hands and feet in the medicine

87
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
My master looks very weak

88
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Actually not damaged at all

89
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Today

90
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
My two brothers came to Longyin city

91
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I came to Longyin city

92
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
To accept the heroes

93
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
To reveal your evil plan

94
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Master Long

95
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
We have always been against you

96
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
But we don't think you are a good person

97
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Today

98
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You have to give us an explanation

99
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Heroes

100
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Calm down

101
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Rong Jingfeng poisoned me

102
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Because I know the truth about his misdeed

103
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
He is the former disciple of Mohua

104
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The previous chiefs

105
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
In Longyin city

106
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's not what Na Lanyue did in the sea of flowers

107
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What Na Lanyue did

108
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It was his plan

109
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
He killed the chiefs

110
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And put this matter on the head of the spiritual cult and the spiritual school

111
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
This time I found out the truth

112
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
He tried to kill people

113
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Everything

114
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It was all done by him

115
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Long Jingfeng

116
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I really didn't expect

117
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You have been hiding so deep for so many years

118
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Today we must kill you

119
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
To avenge the chiefs

120
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Everyone

121
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I think you can see

122
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
This senior Bai Su

123
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
He is sick

124
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So his brain

125
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Is not clear

126
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Heroes

127
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Don't be fooled by this nonsense

128
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Everyone came from afar

129
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
They are all my guests

130
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I welcome you

131
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
But if you keep messing around

132
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Don't blame me for not being affectionate

133
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Come on

134
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Take some people who are in the past

135
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Get me out of Longyin city

136
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Dare to resist

137
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
No matter what

138
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Su'er

139
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's useless

140
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I have already withdrawn all the disciples

141
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Out of Longyin city

142
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What the city chief did

143
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
There should be an explanation

144
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You

145
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's you

146
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Dad for half a lifetime

147
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Are planning for our Longyin city

148
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
What are you doing

149
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
How can you lure the wolf into the world

150
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
How can you choose to oppose your father

151
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The city chief said

152
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
For the future of Longyin city

153
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
No matter how difficult the decision is

154
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Must be made at the moment

155
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
This is my decision

156
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
But I am your father

157
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Because you are my father

158
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So I can't see you keep making mistakes

159
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Ronghua said

160
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Real strength comes from the heart

161
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Not false

162
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So he proved innocence for Lingxu

163
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
He doesn't want to see you go to the dead end

164
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You are so ungrateful

165
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I know you are like this

166
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I shouldn't have found you from the desert

167
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Rong Jingfeng

168
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You are selfish and evil

169
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
If it weren't for your ambition

170
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Ziyan wouldn't have died so badly

171
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So far

172
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You still know nothing?

173
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You really can't see

174
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Everyone

175
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Although my father did a lot of wrong things

176
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But please

177
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
For the sake of saving many people

178
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Please have mercy

179
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
He used the Shi Hua pig as a bait

180
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
He didn't really want to save people

181
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
His purpose is to control our several sects

182
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And he used them

183
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Today the truth is clear

184
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Rong Jingfeng is innocent

185
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Zuoer

186
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You are so muddled

187
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You don't know humanity

188
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Today, Long Yicheng

189
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Is ruined in your hands

190
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Father

191
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I can see right and wrong

192
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So anyway

193
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I will hate you

194
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And face it together with Long Yicheng

195
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Lu Su

196
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
What are you going to do?

197
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Don't do as your father

198
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Do it

199
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Who dares to mess around in Long Yicheng

200
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You can't hurt my father's life

201
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Don't move

202
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I, Rong Jingfeng

203
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Today

204
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I will tolerate the disaster

205
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You can do whatever you want to me

206
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I just beg you

207
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Let go of my Su

208
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Don't destroy my Long Yicheng

209
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I beg you

210
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Don't hurt my father

211
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Don't hurt my father

212
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Don't hurt my father

213
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Don't hurt my father

214
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Don't hurt my father

215
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Don't hurt my father

216
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Don't hurt my father

217
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Don't hurt my father

218
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Don't hurt my father

219
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Don't hurt my father

220
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Don't hurt my father

221
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Don't hurt my father

222
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Don't hurt my father

223
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Don't hurt my father

224
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Don't hurt my father

225
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Don't hurt my father

226
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Don't hurt my father

227
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Please see

228
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
starting today

229
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
My father is not in Long Yicheng

230
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
All business in Long Yicheng

231
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I will take care of it

232
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
His rest of life

233
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
and blood.

234
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,480
If we end it like this,

235
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,160
it will be a great advantage for her.

236
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,920
My father has been proud of it all his life.

237
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,400
He never wants to admit defeat.

238
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,080
As his daughter,

239
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,320
I can only try my best to protect his life.

240
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,320
As for this sin,

241
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,400
I'll pay it back in the next life.

242
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,320
Let my father

243
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,880
at this prison

244
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,080
repent and atone for his sins.

245
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,200
The overall situation is important.

246
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,800
I'll do as Miss Rong Su says.

247
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,760
The key to this cell

248
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,360
will be kept by Senior Bai from now on.

249
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:34,060
Even if I find தzewicanaumbered不会

250
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,440
,

251
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,900
Father.

252
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,960
Take good care of yourself.

253
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,840
Go.

254
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,440
Go.

255
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,240
Go.

256
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,160
Go.

257
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,680
What a good luck.

258
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,080
Senior Bai

259
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,840
finally got through this.

260
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,840
Rong Qing Feng.

261
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,960
My father saved him.

262
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,520
But he is my father after all.

263
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,680
If this

264
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,280
can make your father repent,

265
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,840
it might not be a bad thing.

266
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,280
Actually,

267
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,560
I can see everything

268
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,080
you've done

269
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,400
for our Lin Xun Pavilion.

270
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:38,880
Young Master.

271
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,320
There's news.

272
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,080
But

273
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,280
something has changed.

274
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,240
Greetings, Young Master.

275
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,520
We received a secret letter

276
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,480
and are leaving in the dark.

277
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,120
All the Nalan family

278
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,280
has left the spiritual school.

279
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:02,960
But I don't know

280
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,040
what you're trying to do.

281
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,680
Are you trying to

282
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,880
turn the tables?

283
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,000
I never said

284
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,200
I'm a member of the spiritual school.

285
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,720
Why would I turn the tables?

286
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,280
I asked everyone to leave

287
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,840
because I don't want you

288
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,920
to have any connections.

289
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,280
Are you really going to attack the spiritual school?

290
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,240
I've made up my mind.

291
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,400
You can choose to

292
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,160
attack the spiritual school with me

293
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,480
or not.

294
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,440
I've asked Cang Qi

295
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,640
to find a place to settle down.

296
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:31,880
Those who don't go

297
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,520
can live in seclusion.

298
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,160
It's not easy to attack the spiritual school.

299
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,320
Just the three of you?

300
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,360
Isn't it a game of rock-paper-scissors?

301
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,080
Today,

302
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,440
we can attack the spiritual school.

303
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,920
It's a game of rock-paper-scissors.

304
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,240
You have no full preparation.

305
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,720
If you let us fight with you,

306
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,400
we'll die.

307
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,520
I believe in Yue.

308
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,640
Cang Qi will die with Young Master.

309
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,120
You go there.

310
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,400
Yes.

311
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,080
Don't worry too much, Your Grace.

312
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,640
With Buzhuo helping the spiritual school,

313
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,240
there shouldn't be any problem.

314
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,000
He saved the lives of the Nalan family before.

315
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,520
In theory,

316
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,800
even if he attacks,

317
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,720
he won't care about Buzhuo.

318
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,240
A few days ago,

319
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,760
Nalan Yue acted secretly.

320
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,320
He had already

321
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,200
removed the Nalan family from the spiritual school.

322
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,640
When I got the news,

323
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,080
they had already met.

324
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,120
But

325
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,120
they didn't meet.

326
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,720
It seems that Nalan Yue

327
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,720
has been planning for a long time.

328
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,920
He's waiting for this day.

329
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,400
But I didn't expect that

330
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,040
Rong Su would work with Rong Hua.

331
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,400
Not only did he arrange for Bai Su to leave the city,

332
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,040
he also returned the innocence of the spiritual school.

333
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,400
He even imprisoned his own father.

334
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,480
What are they planning?

335
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,840
No matter what they plan,

336
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,880
the situation of Nalan Yue now

337
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,440
is much more than what you planned.

338
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,560
Do you have the person I asked you to find?

339
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,680
I've found him.

340
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,160
He's waiting for you.

341
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,200
Bring him here.

342
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:34,800
Yes.

343
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,360
Your Grace.

344
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,040
Yes.

345
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,520
I have just told Qi Lun to forget the truth.

346
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,440
Thank you, Your Majesty.

347
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,440
You know Yirong

348
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,760
to escape the chase?

349
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,680
If I didn't go to the famous village

350
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,280
to spread the news to Xiao Xue,

351
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,320
nobody would find me in my entire life.

352
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,240
You regret to bring yourself to your home

353
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,640
and entered the City by yourself.

354
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,640
I'm not sure.

355
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,800
It's only temporary.

356
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,760
It seems that your mind

357
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,720
is far more than that.

358
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,360
I can't hide anything from you.

359
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,640
Tell me.

360
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,960
What do you want

361
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,800
to reveal?

362
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,640
I want the antidote to the Chihua Bead.

363
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,760
I can't die yet.

364
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,040
If you can save me,

365
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,360
I will work for the Ling Sect

366
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,760
to the end.

367
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,360
The Ling Sect is the first sect

368
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,720
that has been defeated by the world.

369
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,520
Why do you have to work for it?

370
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,160
You have to be sincere to ask for help.

371
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,640
Besides,

372
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,400
there are so many people

373
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,240
who want to kill you.

374
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,240
You have no value

375
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,720
to use, right?

376
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,920
Since I dare to come to you,

377
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,120
it means that I have a Chihua Bead in my hand.

378
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,120
If you, the one who is so smart,

379
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,120
have no value at all,

380
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,120
then today

381
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,520
is your death day.

382
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,120
I've been hiding from the Chihua Bead

383
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,120
but I've also found out a lot of information.

384
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,720
Bai Su's strength

385
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,320
is in the fact that he has several disciples.

386
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,120
Especially the Wang family.

387
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,520
Their positions in the martial arts world

388
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,720
are extraordinary.

389
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,520
And they also control

390
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,520
the sources of information in the martial arts world.

391
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,320
The Snow League has been relying on them

392
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,520
for these years, right?

393
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,320
So these days,

394
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,920
I've been thinking about it.

395
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,320
I have a plan in my mind.

396
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,120
But...

397
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,120
Stop pretending.

398
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,520
What's your plan?

399
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,520
Tell me.

400
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,520
But this will hurt the Snow League.

401
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,120
But

402
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,520
it can completely break Bai Su's arm.

403
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,520
Master Ming, think about it.

404
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,920
If the Wang family's dual knot

405
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,320
no longer monopolizes the news of the martial arts world,

406
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,320
then the conflict between Master Ming and Bai Su

407
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,920
will have no consequences.

408
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,920
Of course,

409
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,720
this will cut off the source of information of the Snow League.

410
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,320
But in return,

411
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,920
no one can stop your Marquis Yan.

412
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,320
Who doesn't know

413
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,320
Bai Su's position in the martial arts world?

414
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,120
Why bother to talk about it?

415
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,920
Besides,

416
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,920
if it can cut off his back so easily,

417
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,520
the Lin family has long been powerful.

418
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,520
Why wait until today?

419
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,520
Yes.

420
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,520
It can't be done in the past.

421
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,520
But now

422
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,520
is a good opportunity.

423
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,520
Bai Su once said

424
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,920
he would trap Rong Jingfeng in Longyin City.

425
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,520
If he broke his promise,

426
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,320
then the Wang family's dual knot

427
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,520
will be affected.

428
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,720
So now,

429
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,520
the most important thing

430
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,520
is to start with Rong Jingfeng.

431
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,520
I'm sure

432
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,520
he will be able to do it.

433
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,320
Start with Rong Jingfeng.

434
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,720
It seems that your Mei Ying

435
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,120
has really put a lot of effort into it.

436
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,520
I know that

437
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,120
with my own strength,

438
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,720
even if the plan is ruined,

439
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,720
I have no other choice.

440
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,520
I can only finish it

441
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,520
if I work with you.

442
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,720
Longyin City is here to capture the traitor Mei Ying.

443
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,520
Please hand him over.

444
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,320
Master,

445
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,320
this time Mei Ying is a trick.

446
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,720
Please save her.

447
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,920
You are a good person.

448
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,120
Please save me.

449
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,720
We have already made a move.

450
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,720
Who leaked our whereabouts?

451
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,120
Master, don't worry.

452
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,320
We have prepared it.

453
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,920
Please make a move first.

454
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,520
Mei Ying has been hiding for so long.

455
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,720
She has to find a way out for herself.

456
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,320
Before, she tried to make a alliance with Ling Xu.

457
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,320
After failing, she ran to Longyin City.

458
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,120
Now she is being hunted.

459
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,320
She has no other choice but to run to Ling's.

460
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,120
We sent her to escape

461
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,320
to lure you out and stop you.

462
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,320
You little rascals

463
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,320
are not worthy of my action.

464
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,520
And me, Meng Huan.

465
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,520
You are in such a hurry to find Mei Ying.

466
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,120
How can you not leave any clues?

467
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,320
If you want to lure her out,

468
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,320
it's not easy.

469
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,920
You think you can stall here

470
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,320
and get time for Nalan Yue

471
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,120
to enter Ling's?

472
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,120
A trick

473
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
borrowed from Yinzhao.

474
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,120
Young Master,

475
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,960
all leaders of Lin Sect have been defeated.

476
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,920
I have to share the spirit of the spirit world with you tomorrow.

477
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,160
You saved my life.

478
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,200
I will never forget it.

479
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,360
I know that

480
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,000
you are here because of Mohan's order.

481
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,640
You have your difficulties.

482
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,320
But I also have my difficulties.

483
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,320
I don't want to be controlled by Mohan.

484
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,560
I'd rather die than that.

485
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,160
It's useless.

486
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,000
Even if you pass this level,

487
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,000
you can't find the answer.

488
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,960
You have no way to turn back.

489
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,840
I know that there is no way out.

490
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,920
But I have to try.

491
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,040
In order to relieve the poison in my body,

492
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,800
Rong Hua forced the coldness in her body.

493
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,520
Rong Jinfeng is now trapped in Longyin City.

494
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,000
There is rarely a day of peace in the world.

495
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,040
I can't let anything happen here again.

496
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,280
You think for the people of the world.

497
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,920
I should help, but I'm not stopping you.

498
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,120
But as a person who knows the world,

499
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,560
I'm destined to be with you.

500
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,480
I made a dream to the world.

501
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,200
I will protect you.

502
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,600
But I can't disobey the order of my master.

503
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,920
Your parents

504
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,920
sacrificed for the Nalan family.

505
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,800
Master's old family tried to prove himself.

506
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,000
They have been planning for the whole life for the spiritual leader.

507
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,400
They are too persistent.

508
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,440
But you are different from them.

509
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,480
Maybe you can find a way out for the spiritual leader

510
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,200
and the Nalan family.

511
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,160
Let go.

512
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,120
You're still wounded.

513
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,240
You're such a nuisance.

514
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,020
What's wrong?

515
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,020
Don't finish?

516
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:39,940
Let's go.

517
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,140
Leave the plains!

518
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,280
Don't chase us!

519
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,320
Stop!

520
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,000
We've finally found the plains.

521
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,860
Even if we're really

522
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,860
Wei Mingye Tai.

523
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,340
He's protecting Mo Huan.

524
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,220
How can you help him?

525
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,500
We're here

526
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,780
to stall Mo Huan.

527
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,500
Moreover,

528
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,300
Mo Huan's spirit is as strong as a branch.

529
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,740
He knows we're here for this.

530
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,900
He'll definitely be more careful.

531
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,700
Young Hero Lu is right.

532
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,860
Mo Huan is sinister and cunning.

533
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,460
He always kills like a horse.

534
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:10,860
If he doesn't suffer,

535
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,380
he won't back down.

536
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,740
He must have a backer

537
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,340
to lure us into a trap.

538
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,940
He's really a cheap bastard.

539
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,180
Thank you for helping us, Elder Bai.

540
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,260
But I still have a request.

541
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,620
I hope Elder Bai can stay in the North Emperor.

542
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,500
With you here,

543
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,180
we'll be safe.

544
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,980
But Yue is fighting against them

545
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,260
and the Spiritual Cult.

546
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,660
We can't know the result yet.

547
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:35,900
But...

548
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,420
But the poison in Yue's body

549
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,180
can't be delayed anymore.

550
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,980
I hope Elder Bai can help us.

551
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,100
We can break through together

552
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,860
and make Yue and his clan safe.

553
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:54,180
Clan Leader! Clan Leader! Clan Leader!

554
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:57,180
Clan Leader! Clan Leader! Clan Leader!

555
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:00,180
Clan Leader! Clan Leader! Clan Leader!

556
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,180
We've taken the Spiritual Cult.

557
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,420
Mo Huan never thought

558
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,940
that he'd get it today.

559
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,580
Thanks to Young Master and Madam's help,

560
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,980
we've been able to break through.

561
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,380
We're really lucky.

562
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,980
Young Master and Madam have been helping us a lot.

563
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,260
That's why we were able to take the Spiritual Cult

564
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,260
and get the imperial palace.

565
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,180
The old grudge of the Nalan clan

566
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,580
has finally been cleared.

567
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,620
It's also a way to deal with evil.

568
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,500
This time, we're going to fight against Brother Lu.

569
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,500
He's held Mo Huan back

570
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,460
and fought for time.

571
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,060
That's how we can take the Spiritual Cult.

572
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,780
But we can't let it go.

573
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,100
If Mo Huan comes back,

574
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,740
it'll be another bad battle.

575
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,100
Killing Mo Huan

576
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,580
and avenging the dead clan

577
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,660
is something we must do.

578
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,300
No matter what,

579
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,380
we'll fight him sooner or later.

580
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,580
Right,

581
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,820
we'll fight the dead and Mo Huan!

582
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,620
Fight to the death!

583
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,140
Fight to the dead and Mo Huan!

584
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,860
Fight to the dead and Mo Huan!

585
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,540
Fight to the dead and Mo Huan!

586
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,100
Fight to the death!

587
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,780
Fight to the dead and Mo Huan!

588
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,740
анияium, I bow in respect Before the Clan Leader.

589
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,600
Prior to the Clan Leader,

590
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,580
the Nalan clan will no longer squeeze into 5 True Worlds.

591
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,420
Nalan Yue is the son of Nalan Xin.

592
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,420
I am the successor of the clan leader.

593
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,220
From now on,

594
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,340
we will follow the order of the clan leader

595
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,500
to re-establish the Dalai clan

596
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,140
and be with our deceased friend.

597
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,700
Re-establish the Dalai clan!

598
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,620
Re-establish the Dalai clan!

599
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,340
Re-establish the Dalai clan!

600
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,020
Re-establish the Dalai clan!

601
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,700
Re-establish the Dalai clan!

602
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,100
Until now,

603
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,940
everything is for the sake of the Xi Chuan injustice

604
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,140
and for the sake of the Dalai clan.

605
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,500
The world is in chaos.

606
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,100
Mother,

607
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,100
don't worry.

608
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,700
I will be safe and sound.

609
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,140
I will protect the Dalai clan

610
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,220
and bring them to justice

611
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,220
in the world.

612
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,740
This Jade-Pen is

613
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,340
the first gift

614
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,580
your father prepared for you.

615
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,700
It's also the only gift.

616
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,220
It means that you will be safe.

617
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,780
If my mother

618
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,540
is in heaven,

619
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,940
I will be happy.

620
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:44,940
Your Majesty,

621
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,700
shh.

622
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,460
Your Majesty,

623
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,740
the poison on my body

624
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,580
can only be cured by you.

625
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:01,980
I...

626
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:06,620
Yes.

627
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:11,220
I can cure your poison,

628
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:12,940
but

629
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,460
the antidote is in the Ling Ling Sect.

630
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,700
It depends on whether you can

631
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,220
do what you want.

632
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:37,300
Yes.

633
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,180
I will definitely do it.

634
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,660
You have been releasing my news all the way,

635
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,860
isn't it to attract Rong Su's attention?

636
00:33:45,700 --> 00:34:13,920
Even if I don't come to the

637
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,820
Dragon Mirror Hall,

638
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,540
by then,

639
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,060
all the people in the world

640
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,260
will attack the Dragon Scale City again

641
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,940
because of the anger.

642
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:26,860
And Bai Su

643
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,980
will lose faith in others.

644
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:49,620
Holy-

645
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,700
Who are you?

646
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,700
We are here to take you away from the dark house.

647
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,700
Don't mention this traitor in front of me again.

648
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,700
What on earth does he want?

649
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,700
If you have any questions, you should ask Master Mei in person.

650
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,700
We are just following orders.

651
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,700
Get lost.

652
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,700
Get lost!

653
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,700
What are you doing?

654
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,700
What are you doing?

655
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,700
What are you doing?

656
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,700
What are you doing?

657
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,700
You...

658
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,700
Master Bai, I've searched everywhere in Longyin City.

659
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,700
But I still can't find any trace of Rong Jingfeng.

660
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,700
I've sent people out of the city to block the Tifeng Town.

661
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,700
I'll take my men to search the place.

662
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,700
Wait.

663
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,700
They must have planned this secretly.

664
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,700
If we go to Tifeng Town again, it's useless.

665
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,700
I was careless.

666
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,700
I thought I would be safe if I gave the key to the lock to Master.

667
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,700
Who knew that I would be safe if I went to Tifeng Town again?

668
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,700
I'm sorry.

669
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,700
I'm sorry.

670
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,700
I'm sorry.

671
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,700
If I gave the key to the lock to Master,

672
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,700
I would be safe.

673
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:42,700
Who knew that Rong Jingfeng would escape?

674
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,700
Actually, when I was searching the house,

675
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:48,700
I found traces of fighting everywhere.

676
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:52,700
I'm afraid Rong Jingfeng didn't want to escape.

677
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,700
He was kidnapped by someone.

678
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,700
He was caught.

679
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,700
Master Bai,

680
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,700
we've checked the whereabouts of the missing disciples.

681
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,700
They were also the trusted men of Mei Ying who was in the Shengzi Hall.

682
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,700
But they were hidden well.

683
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,700
They were not found when we checked last time.

684
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,700
This time, they were caught.

685
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,700
You three can leave first.

686
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,700
Yes.

687
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,700
You and the other three halls guard Longyin City.

688
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,700
I'll go out to find out where Rong Jingfeng is.

689
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,700
I'll ask my senior to help me.

690
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,700
Don't let anyone know about this.

691
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,700
Otherwise, all the sects in the world

692
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,700
will not let us go easily.

693
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,700
Master Bai, you'd better bring more disciples with you.

694
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:41,700
Now, we don't know what Mei Ying is up to.

695
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,700
We're in the light, she's in the dark.

696
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,700
We should be careful.

697
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:08,960
The

698
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,700
Yue,

699
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,700
are you okay?

700
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,700
Is there any news about the Xuanbing Talisman?

701
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,700
We've occupied the spiritual cult for several days.

702
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,700
But we can't find anything about the Xuanbing Talisman.

703
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,700
Maybe Mohan has been prepared

704
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:40,700
to destroy everything about the Xuanbing Talisman.

705
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,700
We can't drag it out anymore.

706
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,700
I'm afraid if we keep doing this,

707
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:52,700
I'll be unable to control the Xuanbing Talisman's reaction.

708
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,700
This is the one I asked Yunxu

709
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,700
to use the best Xuan Iron to make.

710
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,700
If I cause any reaction after this,

711
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,700
you can use it to trap me.

712
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,700
I don't want to hurt anyone around me anymore.

713
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,700
Especially you.

714
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,700
I've decided.

715
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,700
I'll make you pay for it.

716
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,700
I've decided.

717
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,700
I want to break up with Mohan.

718
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,700
There are hundreds of people in Xuanbing now.

719
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,700
They're waiting for your order outside the spiritual cult.

720
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,700
No matter what the reason was,

721
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,700
at the moment of becoming Xuanbing,

722
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,700
there's no other choice.

723
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,700
If you die,

724
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,700
none of them can live.

725
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,700
Yue,

726
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,700
I know you've already had plans

727
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,700
when you were fighting against Mohan.

728
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,700
But no matter what,

729
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,700
you have to give them an answer.

730
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,700
I don't want to be Mohan's puppet forever.

731
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,700
I don't want to see the Nalan family

732
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,700
keep saying that Mohan is cruel.

733
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,700
It's just that

734
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:21,700
I was protecting them back then.

735
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:24,700
I took them to the spiritual cult in person.

736
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,700
I...

737
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,700
I...

738
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,700
I...

739
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,700
I...

740
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,700
I...

741
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,700
Yue,

742
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,700
I understand your situation.

743
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,700
No matter what,

744
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,700
I'll support you.

745
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,700
Don't worry.

746
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,700
Old Senior Bai and I

747
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,700
are already looking for a way

748
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,700
to get rid of the poison of the Xuanbing Talisman.

749
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,700
I'll be there for you.

750
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,700
This time,

751
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,700
I didn't let the people of Longyin City

752
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,700
enter the spiritual cult.

753
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:06,700
First,

754
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,700
to prevent them from doing so.

755
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,700
Second,

756
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,700
I don't want them to meet in private

757
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,700
and cause any conflict

758
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,700
and hurt the people of both sides.

759
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,700
With Rong Su's temper,

760
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,700
Lu Yi Zhou might suffer a bit.

761
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,700
What's wrong?

762
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:29,700
I just received news

763
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,700
that there's a rumor in the martial arts world

764
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,700
that Rong Jing Feng has escaped from Longyin City

765
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,700
and is heading to the North Desert to seek Rong Su.

766
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,700
And now,

767
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,700
all the people of the martial arts world

768
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,700
have come to the North Desert.

769
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,700
Why don't we know

770
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,700
about this news?

771
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:45,700
No.

772
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,700
Someone must have cut off our news.

773
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,700
I wonder what happened

774
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,700
between you two.

775
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,700
