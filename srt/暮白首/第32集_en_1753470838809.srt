1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
What?

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,800
What?

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We are in love

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
A moment of flowers, a moment of spring

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I never come and you are not here

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You don't understand

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
How much love

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The most beautiful flower, I look at it

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Sayachara

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Sea and rocks

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,120
If there are outcasts, purpose and

12
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:15,440
Perfect purple

13
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:23,080
Hope love are beyond plain

14
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,920
Power

15
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,920
The Long Ballad

16
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,920
Episode 16

17
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,920
Who are you?

18
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,920
How dare you break into the Holy Hall?

19
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,920
The Long Ballad

20
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,920
You're out of line.

21
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,920
I'll ask you a question.

22
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,920
You don't know me?

23
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,920
So you're the Second Miss.

24
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,920
But the Holy Hall is strict.

25
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,920
Except for my disciples,

26
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,920
no one is allowed to enter the Holy Hall without permission.

27
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,920
Please leave the Holy Hall

28
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,920
as soon as possible.

29
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,920
How dare you!

30
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,920
It's the Holy Hall.

31
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,920
You haven't been back for a long time.

32
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,920
I guess you don't know the rules of the Holy Hall.

33
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,920
Why don't you

34
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,920
tell me the details about the Second Miss?

35
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,920
I think you're just a senior disciple of the Holy Hall.

36
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,920
Xiaoxiao is going to be the Hall Leader of the Holy Hall.

37
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,920
How dare you be so rude?

38
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,920
So what if I'm the Hall Leader of the Holy Hall?

39
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,920
You've seen it all.

40
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,920
This is the Holy Hall.

41
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,920
Except for Hall Leader Mei,

42
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,920
no one is allowed to enter.

43
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,920
Even if the rules of the Holy Hall are like this,

44
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,920
you can't be rude.

45
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,920
Mei Ying wants to be polite to the Second Miss.

46
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,920
She should be respected.

47
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,920
Not to mention you.

48
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,920
If the City Leader knows about this...

49
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,920
Greetings, Second Miss.

50
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,920
No need.

51
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,920
Xiaoxiao, let's go.

52
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,920
By the way,

53
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,920
I want to remind you.

54
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,920
Since you're a disciple of the Holy Hall,

55
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,920
you should keep your duty.

56
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,920
There are four or five

57
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,920
wrong medicines in this pharmacy.

58
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,920
If this gets out,

59
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,920
I don't know whose eyes are lost.

60
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,920
Second Miss,

61
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,920
why are you still in the mood

62
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,920
to drink tea leisurely here?

63
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,920
Actually, I've been looking for an opportunity

64
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,920
to remind you to come here.

65
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,920
But you saw it with your own eyes today.

66
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,920
You should understand.

67
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,920
It seems that Mei Ying

68
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,920
has changed the disciples of the Holy Hall

69
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,920
from one person to another.

70
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,920
The rest

71
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,920
are her relatives.

72
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,920
Since she took over the Old Hall,

73
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,920
she has used all kinds of means

74
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,920
to attract disciples from all over the country.

75
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,920
The Holy Hall

76
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,920
is no longer the same as before.

77
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,920
Very good.

78
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,920
What's the situation

79
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,920
between the two halls now?

80
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,920
Master told me before he died

81
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,920
that the Holy Hall

82
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,920
can't be

83
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,920
taken over by Mei Ying no matter what.

84
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,920
So as long as I'm here,

85
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,920
Mei Ying will not

86
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,920
let the Holy Hall be taken over.

87
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,920
And the Second Miss

88
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,920
is also very wary of Mei Ying.

89
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,920
She keeps an eye on the empty hall.

90
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,920
Mei Ying has been blocked

91
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,920
by several times

92
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,920
since she was a child.

93
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,920
We have to do something about it.

94
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,920
Mei Ying has always been very resourceful.

95
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,920
Second Miss,

96
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,920
aren't you worried at all?

97
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,920
Master ordered

98
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,920
the Fourth Hall to hold a meeting tomorrow morning.

99
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,920
But there is no place for you in the Fourth Hall.

100
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,920
Since I was born,

101
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,920
my father has been avoiding me.

102
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,920
He doesn't believe me anymore.

103
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,920
Let alone the public business.

104
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,920
After Master died,

105
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,920
Master was hit by a beast

106
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,920
and his body was in a bad shape.

107
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,920
Now Mei Ying has two halls

108
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,920
and controls

109
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,920
more than half of the disciples in the city.

110
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,920
In the future, Long Yun City...

111
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,920
Let's make a surprise attack at the mansion first.

112
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,920
We have to cut Mei Ying's background.

113
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,920
I will take back

114
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,920
the Holy Hall.

115
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,920
But how do we

116
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,920
cut her background?

117
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,920
It starts with the Old Hall.

118
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,920
It's safer for you.

119
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,920
Zi Yan,

120
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,920
this is theめて it has just roast.

121
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,920
You must like it.

122
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,920
Huang Xili, you said

123
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,420
you don't like darkness.

124
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,920
I don't like darkness.

125
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,920
I don't like darkness.

126
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,920
Do you regret it now?

127
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,920
Stop messing around.

128
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,920
If it weren't for the fact that you hid the truth

129
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,920
about the Chihua Bead,

130
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,920
you would have been in deep trouble.

131
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,920
If you didn't

132
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,920
want to destroy the Lingxu Pavilion

133
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,920
and bring people to revenge,

134
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,920
you wouldn't have lost the best chance

135
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,920
to cure yourself

136
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,920
because you were trapped in Longyin City.

137
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,920
Miss,

138
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,920
it's a crime to catch thieves.

139
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,920
Meiying sneaked into my master's room

140
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,920
at night.

141
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,920
She must have a secret.

142
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,920
Why don't we take her down?

143
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,920
Don't worry.

144
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,920
Let's go in and have a look.

145
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,920
The medicine box is not

146
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,920
as white as it used to be.

147
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,920
These are

148
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,920
the antidotes that auntie used to poison.

149
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,920
Why did she use these?

150
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,920
Xiao Xiao,

151
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,920
do you know

152
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,920
which bottle of antidote she used?

153
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,920
Master kept this box

154
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,920
all by himself.

155
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,920
I don't know how much she used before.

156
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,920
Xiao Xiao

157
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,920
really doesn't know.

158
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,920
How about this?

159
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,920
You give all these antidotes

160
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,920
according to the amount of gold leaf.

161
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,920
What else should I give her?

162
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,920
Miss has returned to the city.

163
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,920
What should we do next?

164
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,920
I want her to get rid of Meiying with me.

165
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,920
But if that happens,

166
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,920
Miss will be in Longyin City again.

167
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,920
Then the position of the city's leader

168
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,920
will be...

169
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,920
Do you think

170
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,920
she can kill Na Lanyue?

171
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,920
Miss is very kind.

172
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,920
She didn't care about her life.

173
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,920
How can she be hurt now?

174
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,920
That's right.

175
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,920
She can get rid of Meiying with me.

176
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,920
But she won't kill Na Lanyue

177
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,920
no matter what.

178
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,920
They had a wedding in Lingxu Pavilion before.

179
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,920
How can she be the leader

180
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,920
of Longyin City

181
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,920
when she is so unfilial?

182
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,920
Then the position of the city's leader

183
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,920
will be hers.

184
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,920
You are very thoughtful

185
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,920
and thoughtful.

186
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,920
You are not like the second lady.

187
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,920
You are obsessed with love.

188
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,920
Master, I...

189
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,920
It's okay.

190
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,920
You can leave now.

191
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,920
Then tomorrow

192
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,920
the city's leader will call the head of the hall.

193
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,920
Is the second lady not qualified to be the leader?

194
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,920
Since she is so proud of herself

195
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,920
and wants to get the Holy-Colored Hall back,

196
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,920
let me see

197
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,920
if she can do it.

198
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,920
You can leave now.

199
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,920
You can leave now.

200
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,920
You can leave now.

201
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,920
I have let you go.

202
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,920
Miss Rong chose to lose

203
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,920
from the beginning.

204
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,920
You are very thoughtful.

205
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,920
But many times,

206
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,920
losing is just a matter

207
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,920
of time.

208
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,920
I hope you can be more considerate.

209
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,920
Nalan Yue

210
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,920
actually chose to be the leader

211
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,920
and became Mohuan's leader.

212
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,920
Although they retreated,

213
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,920
they will surely come back.

214
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,920
We, Longyin City,

215
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,920
can't sit back and wait.

216
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,920
We can only take down the Holy-Colored Hall

217
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,920
by taking the chance of the battle.

218
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,920
Everyone,

219
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,920
do you have any good ideas?

220
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,920
Longyin City will definitely

221
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,920
avenge the grudge of Zi Yan.

222
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,920
The head of the hall will continue to call the head of the hall

223
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,920
to gather the disciples

224
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,920
to take over Longyin City.

225
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,920
Of course,

226
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,920
all the disciples

227
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,920
will be included in the hall,

228
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,920
but they must be loyal to Longyin City

229
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,920
and the city's leader.

230
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,920
No one in the city

231
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,920
can take over the hall

232
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,920
and cultivate their own power.

233
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,920
Longyin City will never fight a war without preparation.

234
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,920
I have sent out the top disciples of Kong Si Hall

235
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,920
to go to Jiangnan and the north desert

236
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,920
to investigate and get information.

237
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,920
As long as there is news,

238
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,920
we can make detailed project strategies.

239
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,920
In addition,

240
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,920
I have also strengthened the city's defense

241
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,920
and increased the food and clothing in the city.

242
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,920
And I have doubled the number of secret guards

243
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,920
of the Holy-Wind Formation.

244
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,920
In this way, even if the enemy attacks,

245
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,920
we can also respond calmly.

246
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,920
OK.

247
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,920
City Leader,

248
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,920
the Holy-Colored Hall recently...

249
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,920
Father.

250
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,920
Greetings, father.

251
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,920
Who let you break into the hall?

252
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,920
Yesterday,

253
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,920
I have made the funeral of my father

254
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
a little proper.

255
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,920
All the major sects in the world

256
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,920
are addicted to death.

257
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,920
I have done everything I could.

258
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,920
So I came to report to my father.

259
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,920
Second Miss,

260
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,920
these are all the back rooms of the city.

261
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,920
You don't have to get the Hall of Ceremonies.

262
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,920
The funeral of Ziyan is not a small matter.

263
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,920
Why can't you get the Hall of Ceremonies?

264
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,920
City Leader wants to discuss business with us.

265
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,920
If you have finished reporting,

266
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,920
you can leave.

267
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,920
City Leader hasn't spoken yet.

268
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,920
There is no place for you to speak here.

269
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,920
Ziyan's funeral...

270
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,920
You did well.

271
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,920
But you have finished reporting.

272
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,920
You can leave.

273
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,920
I have always been very loyal to my work.

274
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,920
I also have to participate in the fight against the Holy-Colored Hall.

275
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,920
After all,

276
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,920
Xiao Yu has been raising me for so many years.

277
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,920
The fight against the Holy-Colored Hall is such a big thing.

278
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,920
Only the Hall Leader is qualified to participate in it.

279
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,920
Mr. Mei,

280
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,920
thank you for taking care of the Holy-Colored Hall for me.

281
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,920
I don't understand what you said.

282
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,920
But who can take the place of the Hall Leader of the Holy-Colored Hall?

283
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,920
It's up to City Leader.

284
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,920
You can't interfere in this matter.

285
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,920
Rong Hua,

286
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,920
have you had enough?

287
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,920
I didn't have enough.

288
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,920
You didn't have enough.

289
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,920
The Hall Leader is qualified to take the place of the Hall Leader.

290
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,920
This is the rule of Longyin City.

291
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,920
I understand.

292
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,920
Okay.

293
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,920
How capable are you?

294
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,920
Don't you think you've caused enough trouble?

295
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,920
Isn't it big enough?

296
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,920
Ms. Cheng,

297
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,920
are you trying to compete with me?

298
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,920
City Leader.

299
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,920
Speak.

300
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,920
The Black Stone Mountain Alliance

301
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,920
is about to send a group of hukas to greet you.

302
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,920
The Black Stone Mountain?

303
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,920
Longyin City

304
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,920
offended Bai Su some time ago.

305
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,920
Now they suddenly sent someone

306
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,920
and also the people of the Snow League.

307
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,920
Did they say

308
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,920
why they came here?

309
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,920
They said they came to see the Hall Leader of the Holy-Colored Hall,

310
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,920
Rong Hua.

311
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,920
You two came from afar.

312
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,920
I thank you here.

313
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,920
Ms. Cheng,

314
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,920
you asked me to come here in person

315
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,920
because you were late for many years.

316
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,920
Before leaving,

317
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,920
I asked you to come here

318
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,920
to greet you.

319
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,920
If you encounter any trouble in the future,

320
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,920
just write to the Black Stone Mountain

321
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,920
and let me know.

322
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,920
Thank you for your kindness.

323
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,920
There's a big event in Longyin City recently.

324
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,920
It's not convenient for the people of the Jianghu to be lazy,

325
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,920
so I sent Liuli to come.

326
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,920
Ms. Cheng is good at medicine and is good at martial arts.

327
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,920
She is a disciple of the Holy-Colored Hall.

328
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,920
It's a doctor's duty to heal the wounds.

329
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,920
Thank you for your kindness.

330
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,920
As the Hall Leader of the Holy-Colored Hall,

331
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,920
I will manage it well.

332
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,920
We thank you, Ms. Cheng.

333
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,920
It's none of your business.

334
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,920
I sent you to thank you

335
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,920
for your kindness.

336
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,920
Mr. Mei,

337
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,920
you can't even protect your ancestral house.

338
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,920
I wonder how you became the Hall Leader of the Holy-Colored Hall.

339
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,920
Forget about the other things.

340
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,920
I just want to ask you what medical skills

341
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,920
you can use to be the Hall Leader.

342
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,920
Uncle Wang,

343
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,920
Mr. Mei is now the Hall Leader of the Holy-Colored Hall.

344
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,920
You said that

345
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,920
to hit the face of our Longyin City.

346
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,920
Then why didn't you ask for permission?

347
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,920
What are you doing

348
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,920
with the position of Hall Leader?

349
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,920
This is a big event in Longyin City.

350
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,920
You want to be the Hall Leader

351
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,920
and make a decision.

352
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,920
Right, Mr. Mei?

353
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,920
I'm sorry.

354
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,920
I'm sorry.

355
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,920
I'm sorry.

356
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,920
I'm sorry.

357
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,920
I'm sorry.

358
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,920
I'm sorry.

359
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,920
I'm sorry.

360
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,920
I'm sorry.

361
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,920
I'm sorry.

362
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,920
I'm sorry.

363
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,920
I'm sorry.

364
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,920
I'm sorry.

365
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,920
I'm sorry.

366
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,920
I'm sorry.

367
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,920
I'm sorry.

368
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,920
I'm sorry.

369
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,920
I'm sorry.

370
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,920
I'm sorry.

371
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,920
Come on, talk to me.

372
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,920
I know

373
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,920
you're still doing something.

374
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,920
You saved a lot of people

375
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,920
in the martial arts world.

376
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,920
Now these Hall Leaders

377
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,920
are all grateful to you.

378
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,920
They're willing to avenge your aunt.

379
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,920
They're willing to fight against the spiritual religion

380
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,920
with us.

381
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,920
I'm just the king of Longyin City and my father.

382
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,920
I'm just the king of Longyin City and my father.

383
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,920
I've gained some reputation in the martial arts world.

384
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,920
The Holy Hall is supposed to cure people.

385
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,920
But

386
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,920
I can't save my aunt anymore.

387
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,920
I know

388
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,920
you want to be the Hall Leader of the Holy Hall.

389
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,920
The Holy Hall should be mine.

390
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,920
I was young and ignorant.

391
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,920
I didn't know how to cherish it.

392
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,920
After going through so much,

393
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,920
I just want to protect Longyin City.

394
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,920
If father agrees,

395
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,920
I want to fight with Mei Ying

396
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:55,360
fairly and with a high-level of

397
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,920
You can ask father to agree.

398
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,920
You can ask father to agree.

399
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,920
But you have to promise father

400
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,920
to swear in front of your aunt

401
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,920
to cut off Nalan Yue

402
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,920
and find evidence to avenge your aunt.

403
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,920
I swear

404
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,920
I will avenge my aunt

405
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,920
for the murder of Gui He

406
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,920
and for the crime of slandering the court.

407
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,920
I will find evidence

408
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,920
and avenge my aunt.

409
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,920
Zi Yan,

410
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,920
you heard it, right?

411
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,920
I'm sorry.

412
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,920
What are you doing?

413
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,920
You just hit me so hard.

414
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,920
You want my life?

415
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,920
You followed me secretly

416
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,920
in broad daylight.

417
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,920
I thought it was

418
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,920
a spy who sneaked into Longyin City.

419
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,920
Of course I'm here to support

420
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,920
your second young lady.

421
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,920
Didn't you see

422
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,920
how great she was

423
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,920
in your living room?

424
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,920
Xue Meng never does business without reason.

425
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,920
Why did you suddenly help

426
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,920
the second young lady this time?

427
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,920
No one can tell.

428
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,920
Go.

429
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,920
I'm just following orders.

430
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,920
The chief won't

431
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,920
tell me everything.

432
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,920
But

433
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,920
I really like

434
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,920
your second young lady.

435
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,920
Then please leave Longyin City

436
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,920
as soon as you finish your work.

437
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,920
You can't go to Longyin City.

438
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,920
If anything happens this time,

439
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,920
I can't protect you.

440
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,920
What?

441
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,920
It's not a mess

442
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,920
if you take me to the city.

443
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,920
It's not a good idea to go to the city in broad daylight.

444
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,920
Let go.

445
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,920
Listen.

446
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,920
If you don't take care of me,

447
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,920
you'll lose your reputation in Longyin City.

448
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,920
Let go.

449
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,920
No.

450
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,920
Let go.

451
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,920
I'll take you away.

452
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,920
You said that?

453
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,920
No.

454
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,920
I'm worried.

455
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,920
Let go.

456
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,920
What are you doing?

457
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,920
Go.

458
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:44,800
The starry sky

459
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,920
Natalia has done just that.

460
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,160
But I don't understand.

461
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,240
You know that Na Lanyue

462
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,640
provoked Longyin City.

463
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,520
You are too careless.

464
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,560
But why did you agree to send

465
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,000
the spiritual disciples to help?

466
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,800
Na Lanyue has been holding her breath.

467
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,200
If she didn't find a chance

468
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,200
to ask Rong Jingfeng for justice,

469
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,680
how could she have a peaceful practice?

470
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,400
Besides,

471
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,400
after this,

472
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,560
she should understand that

473
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,840
with her half-dead body,

474
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,080
she wants to take revenge on her own.

475
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,840
She is just thinking too much.

476
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,720
Na Lanyue and Rong Hua

477
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,920
have broken up.

478
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,880
But about Zi Yan,

479
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,600
I think

480
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,640
it's not like Na Lanyue's practice.

481
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,400
But after the incident,

482
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,560
she didn't say a word.

483
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,000
She didn't make any excuses.

484
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,840
Good.

485
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,040
Today has been you all through our whole agency's troubles.

486
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,680
We have already spent the best time

487
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,360
but it's not a big city in있는.

488
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,800
For example,

489
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,320
we are not fully developed

490
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,640
after this trip.

491
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,640
At the end, sheYou finally knew

492
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,120
how to hide her mind

493
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,280
and quélid.

494
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,960
But now, she has a key point.

495
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,820
You deserve much more.

496
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,060
These few days,

497
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,460
I've gotten a good end

498
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,380
in Roots There's лучше bot

499
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,380
than it all,

500
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,620
Scout震

501
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,420
You've been helping's like Gemeviropols

502
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,320
all these days.

503
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,160
But I do not!

504
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,180
What are you really doing

505
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,660
in the water?

506
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,400
Sweden!

507
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,080
Of course it's the secret poison of our Tang clan.

508
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,520
You might as well try it.

509
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:29,280
I guarantee you will be completely

510
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,680
Then Lan Yue, you don't have to make a fuss.

511
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,160
Come on.

512
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,400
You're looking for your own death today.

513
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,760
Don't blame me for taking you as the first experimental product.

514
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:22,340
TheOffering of the

515
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,280
Yue.

516
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,240
If she thought otherwise,

517
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,360
she would rush over here.

518
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:37,960
It's such a relief that you're fine.

519
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,840
Looks like Nan lan

520
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,200
Otherwise,

521
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,200
we won't be able to stop Tang's density.

522
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,480
You really came up with this idea.

523
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,520
First, use the Xuanbing Talisman to stimulate the flower gas.

524
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,600
Then use the female bugs in the body

525
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,640
to manipulate other female bugs.

526
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,920
The second elder of Tang's Sect

527
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,120
has been trained as the first Xuanbing.

528
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,200
I've seen

529
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,320
the power of the Xuanbing Talisman.

530
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,680
It's just the beginning.

531
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,800
When you really become the Xuanbing Talisman,

532
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,120
you'll be able to experience its true power.

533
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,840
Now that you've already been trained,

534
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,200
why don't you try it first?

535
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:28,920
You...

536
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,760
Why don't I try it today?

537
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:12,880
This...

538
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,320
The poisonous bugs in your body

539
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,760
will heal your wounds quickly

540
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,560
when they hear the sound of the sound of the sound.

541
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,560
As long as the poisonous bugs are still there,

542
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,880
your life can be saved.

543
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,720
Compared to dying,

544
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,320
you can still handle

545
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,480
the pain of healing your wounds.

546
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,840
Na Lanyue,

547
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,320
you're so vicious.

548
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,400
If I die,

549
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,360
the female bugs in my body will die.

550
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,440
I'll be able to stop it.

551
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,560
If the female bugs in my body die,

552
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,680
all the bugs in my body will die.

553
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,640
Are you sure

554
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,640
you want to find your own way to death?

555
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,800
That's right.

556
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,360
I'm not a novice.

557
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,840
I should practice more in the future

558
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,840
and be more diligent.

559
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,760
Xue Man.

560
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,680
What are you doing in my room?

561
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,320
Brother Na Lan,

562
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,280
I...

563
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,440
I've seen you work so hard recently.

564
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,240
So I made some food that you like.

565
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,400
I know that

566
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,240
it's not as good as Sister Rong Hua's cooking.

567
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,200
I don't know if it suits your taste.

568
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,480
Okay.

569
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,560
I'll cook it for you.

570
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:36,960
Okay.

571
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,640
I'll cook it for you.

572
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:39,800
Okay.

573
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,840
I'll cook it for you.

574
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,840
I'll eat it later.

575
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,480
As long as you like it,

576
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,800
I'll cook it for you often in the future.

577
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,360
I know

578
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,320
you've been sad about Sister Rong Hua recently.

579
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,160
Xue Man,

580
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,400
don't mention her anymore.

581
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,040
It's...

582
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,000
It's Xue Man's unwise decision...

583
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,600
I'm tired.

584
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,320
I want to take a break.

585
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,640
You can go out.

586
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,920
Brother Na Lan.

587
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,520
sequесс

588
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,760
Take a look.

589
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,840
Stop!

590
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,840
Stop!

591
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,840
Why did you cut my master's red plum?

592
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,840
Brother Dongqing is here.

593
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,840
Have a cup of tea with me.

594
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,840
Greetings, Lady Yuzhan.

595
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,840
I wonder why you

596
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,840
cut my master's red plum?

597
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,840
That's strange.

598
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,840
It's a dragon-shaped thing.

599
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,840
Do I need to ask you

600
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,840
how I want to deal with it?

601
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,840
I just want to turn this garden upside down.

602
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,840
But this plum tree is really bad.

603
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,840
I plan to change it to something else.

604
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,840
This is my master.

605
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,840
The red plum has been in the garden for a long time.

606
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,840
Even if the second lady wants to turn the garden upside down,

607
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,840
she should have informed us in advance.

608
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,840
I can take someone to move it away.

609
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,840
No need.

610
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,840
When I cut this red plum,

611
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:28,460
I'll use its branches to remove the

612
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,840
Wait a minute.

613
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,840
My father is sick now.

614
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,840
I'm in charge of the big and small affairs in Longyin City.

615
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,840
If you dare to disturb my father,

616
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,840
I'll follow the rules of Longyin City

617
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,840
and do it in public.

618
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,840
I'll go to the hall and talk to him.

619
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,840
Go!

620
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,840
Keep cutting.

621
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,840
Yes.

622
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,840
You're in a good mood.

623
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,840
You're here to turn the garden upside down.

624
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,840
Master, I'm not trying to turn it upside down.

625
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,840
But this plum tree is really bad.

626
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,840
When I cut it,

627
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,840
I'll use its branches to burn the stove.

628
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,840
You're so thoughtful.

629
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,840
But I'm thinking about you.

630
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,840
I'll go to the hall and talk to him.

631
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,840
I'll go to the hall and talk to him.

632
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,840
I just joined the two disciples of Laozi Hall.

633
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,840
I think they're quite talented.

634
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,840
I'll bring you here if you're not sure.

635
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,840
Come on.

636
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,840
Greetings, Miss.

637
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,840
Greetings, Miss.

638
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:45,840
Master, you remember what I said to you before.

639
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,840
I didn't expect you to love me so much.

640
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,840
I don't love you.

641
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,840
Who do I love?

642
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,840
You're so good.

643
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,840
Master.

644
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,840
Master.

645
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,840
I'm here.

646
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,840
Greetings, Master Mei.

647
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,840
I wonder what you want me to do.

648
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,840
Why don't you let me come and tell you?

649
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,840
I'm here.

650
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,840
I came here to get the medicine before I left the city.

651
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,840
At that time, your Master Zi Yan was here.

652
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,840
I've always admired his ability to cure poison.

653
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,840
And the medicine made by the Hall of Sickness is really extraordinary.

654
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,840
Now the new Hall Master is appointed.

655
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,840
It is said that the new medicine has been developed.

656
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,840
So I came here specially.

657
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,840
I wonder if I can try it.

658
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,840
I'm just a little disciple.

659
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,840
The new medicine was developed by Hall Master Xiao.

660
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,840
If you want to try the medicine,

661
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,840
I'm afraid you have to ask Hall Master Xiao.

662
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,840
I have no right to make the decision.

663
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,840
I think you have a lot of ideas.

664
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,840
Tell me who you are.

665
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,840
What do you mean?

666
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,840
I came to Lingxu Pavilion before I left the city.

667
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,840
I once took the medicine from the Hall of Sickness.

668
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,840
I don't have to tell you the reason.

669
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,840
I came here today to ask for the responsibility.

670
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,840
It's just because there were a lot of things before.

671
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,840
Plus Zi Yan's illness.

672
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,840
But that doesn't mean I forgot.

673
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,840
The medicine was given by you.

674
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,840
If no one knows,

675
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,840
how dare you?

676
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,840
The Yu family is guilty of crime.

677
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,840
Hall Master Mei is very proud of his master.

678
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,840
He brought a lot of people out of the city.

679
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,840
But none of them came back alive.

680
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,840
Now there is no evidence.

681
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,840
Hall Master Mei's words alone.

682
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,840
You have to have a reason to frame him.

683
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,840
You are shameless.

684
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,840
Tell you what.

685
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,840
I came here alone today.

686
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,840
I've already given the Hall of Sickness a face.

687
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,840
Tell me who is behind all this.

688
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,840
I won't let you die.

689
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,840
If Hall Master Mei insists on using the drug as an excuse,

690
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,840
to blame the Banshi for not doing a good job,

691
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,840
and blame the Hall of Sickness,

692
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,840
then let Yun'er take the responsibility alone.

693
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,840
Okay.

694
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,840
But please don't blame the Hall of Sickness and others.

695
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,840
Since Hall Master Mei just left,

696
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,840
the whole thing will be taken by Xiao Xiao.

697
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,840
I can't stand your torture.

698
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,840
Okay.

699
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,840
I really don't have any evidence.

700
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,840
I know you are a good person.

701
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,840
But this doesn't mean I can let you go easily.

702
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,840
Longyin City is so big.

703
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,840
If you don't have one, you have one.

704
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,840
If you disappear from today,

705
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,840
do you think someone will notice?

706
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,840
Think about it.

707
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,840
If Hall Master Mei is guilty,

708
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,840
I have no excuse.

709
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,840
You can kill me.

710
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,840
But I don't want Xiao Xiao to be sad about this.

711
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,840
I want to go out with you.

712
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,840
I want to kill you and listen to your advice.

713
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,840
But please don't tell the Hall of Sickness about my death.

714
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,840
Okay.

715
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,840
I will help you.

716
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,840
Hall Master Mei.

717
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,840
What are you doing?

718
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,840
The four halls are different from each other.

719
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,840
They don't interfere with each other.

720
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,840
Hall Master Mei is the leader of the Hall of Life.

721
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,840
Even if the disciples of the Hall of Sickness make any mistakes,

722
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,840
it's not your turn to do it.

723
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,840
I heard the disciples say that the City Leader has ordered

724
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,840
that if the four halls are not in harmony,

725
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,840
the four Halls will be killed and the Hall of Life will be destroyed.

726
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,840
It's a good chance.

727
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,840
I wonder if Hall Master Mei has heard of it.

728
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,840
I'm just asking about something.

729
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,840
Don't make a big deal out of it.

730
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,840
Besides,

731
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,840
I'm also the leader of the Hall of Life.

732
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,840
I need you to teach me.

733
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,840
I don't dare.

734
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,840
I'm just reminding Hall Master Mei.

735
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,840
You are worthy of being a member of Rong Hua.

736
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,840
You are so quiet and quiet.

737
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,840
Don't lose face to your master.

738
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,840
Your name is Yun?

739
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,840
I checked.

740
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,840
You just entered Longyin City not long ago, right?

741
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,840
I came from the North Desert.

742
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,840
The winter there is much colder than now.

743
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,840
I heard from Hall Master Xiao

744
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,840
that you are also from the North Desert, right?

745
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,840
Yes.

746
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,840
