Episode 16

3
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Master Bai.

4
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Master Bai.

5
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Come with me.

6
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
If you don't leave,

7
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
don't blame me for not caring about the master and servant for years.

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You...

9
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Liuli.

10
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's because I was wronged by Master.

11
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Before I met Liuli,

12
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I thought I could get everything out of Longyin City

13
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
for Master.

14
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Even my life.

15
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
But now I'm afraid.

16
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm afraid the mirror in my hand

17
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
can't help Master.

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I can't stand a stupid person like you.

19
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Get out of here.

20
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Don't come to me.

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
If he didn't treat you sincerely,

22
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
he would have taken me far away.

23
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Why bother to suffer such humiliation?

24
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Sister.

25
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm going to see the King.

26
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Liuli.

27
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Take Xuanye away.

28
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Go.

29
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Thank you, Miss.

30
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Xuanye ran away.

31
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
No wonder Master didn't like me.

32
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
No wonder Master didn't like me.

34
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You know

35
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
my temper better than I do.

36
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yes.

37
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Let's go.

38
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Go.

39
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
She's gone.

40
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You don't have to pretend anymore.

41
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
She's finally gone.

42
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's better to leave.

43
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You drove her away

44
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
because you were afraid she would think of her old love

45
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
and get involved in this chaotic struggle.

46
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Longyin City is dead now.

47
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's hurt.

48
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The whole city is already in ruins.

49
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Xuanye is the person I trust the most these years.

50
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
She's also the most loyal to me.

51
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But now,

52
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
it's better to leave as soon as possible.

53
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The world is changing.

54
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
There are so many people who can treat each other sincerely.

55
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What can be done,

56
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
can be done.

57
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Although Liuli is strange,

58
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
she's a little clever.

59
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
But luckily,

60
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
she's sincere to Xuanye.

61
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Ahjie,

62
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
you've really changed a lot.

63
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
By the way,

64
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm going to the Tifeng Town.

65
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Ahyue hasn't come back yet.

66
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm afraid she'll be in trouble.

67
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
No.

68
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You can't show up in Tifeng Town.

69
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's too dangerous.

70
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Don't worry, Ahjie.

71
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
All right.

72
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Yes.

73
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I saw Na Wanyue and Mingying

74
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
running out of the city.

75
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Don't worry, Master.

76
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I've arranged a large number of people

77
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
to chase after them along the way.

78
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Is there any other movement

79
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
in the city recently?

80
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
There's no movement

81
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
in the city.

82
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Everything is normal.

83
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Has Jin Que

84
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
found out

85
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
where Rong's sisters are?

86
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Don't worry, Master.

87
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm worried.

88
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Jin Que is investigating.

89
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I believe

90
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
there will be a result soon.

91
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm afraid Jin Que

92
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
won't be able to

93
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
do anything to his apprentice.

94
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It doesn't matter.

95
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'll give him half a day.

96
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
If there's no result,

97
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
he'll do it himself.

98
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yes.

99
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Madam.

100
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
How is it?

101
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
He's been hiding for a while.

102
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But Master said

103
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
he'd give you half a day.

104
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
If there's no result,

105
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
he'll do it himself.

106
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm afraid this time...

107
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It doesn't matter.

108
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's his luck

109
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
that Liuli escaped

110
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
under such circumstances.

111
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
What's there to be afraid of?

112
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Madam.

113
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What are you doing?

114
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm sure I can't hide it anymore.

115
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm going to ask Master Ming

116
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
for forgiveness

117
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
so as to avoid your relationship

118
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
so as to avoid you being implicated.

119
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You and I are a couple.

120
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Why should I avoid it?

121
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I know Master better than you do.

122
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Once he's suspicious,

123
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
he'd rather kill him

124
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
than let go of any of his friends.

125
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm sure you'll find someone

126
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
who's related to you.

127
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yes.

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Mei Ying is the best example.

129
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Don't panic.

130
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I said you were going to

131
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
make Liuli confess.

132
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
But I took away the guard.

133
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
In a while,

134
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
no one will suspect me.

135
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But what can we do

136
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
if we hold him back?

137
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Master only gave us half a day.

138
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
By then...

139
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Madam, don't worry.

140
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
No matter what happens in the future,

141
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'll keep you safe.

142
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
But who can escape

143
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
from Master's hands?

144
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Girl!

145
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Girl!

146
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Master.

147
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
No matter what you say today,

148
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm going to find him.

149
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm not here to stop you.

150
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I...

151
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I know you're useless.

152
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So I'll go with you.

153
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You know me best.

154
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm not going to let you grow up.

155
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Let's go.

156
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Where are you going?

157
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You...

158
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Yuan,

159
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
where have you been all night?

160
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I went to Longyin City this time.

161
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I saw two birds with one stone.

162
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Liuli and Xuanye have come to go on a trip.

163
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What else can we do?

164
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I took Meiying out of Longyin City

165
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
without any reason.

166
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Mohua is hunting her everywhere.

167
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And

168
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Xuanman went to see Meiying

169
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
according to the plan of the previous shop.

170
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
This is also the way to convince Xuanman.

171
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
After all, they are brothers and sisters.

172
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
How can they be abandoned so easily?

173
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Liuli is dead.

174
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Please leave her with us.

175
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Master,

176
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Liuli is indeed fine.

177
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
She's really dead.

178
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Liuli,

179
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I failed to take good care of you.

180
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm sorry.

181
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I failed to take good care of you.

182
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm sorry.

183
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
For the sake of her many years of service to the Snow League,

184
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
she has a full life.

185
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Thank you, Master.

186
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I still can't rack my shift.

187
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,360
How will I sacrifice for tipo

188
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,000
holding on?

189
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Although I was afraid,

190
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I mean,

191
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Stupid I was...

192
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,760
Brother!

193
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,000
Xue Man!

194
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,000
Brother!

195
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
The Nalan family and the Yun family

196
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,320
are in a tight situation.

197
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,240
Let's leave here

198
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,280
and go back to the Meis.

199
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:44,800
Let's go!

200
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,480
Stop!

201
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,520
Miss Mei, you...

202
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,040
Brother Cang Qi!

203
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,600
Brother Cang Qi!

204
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,760
Please let us go!

205
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:54,920
Just...

206
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,640
Just take it as

207
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,160
my brother and I

208
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,920
died in the sword of the people of the Ling family.

209
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,200
You deceived the family and framed the bad guys.

210
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,120
I can't do it.

211
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,960
Brother Cang Qi!

212
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,600
Xue Man!

213
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,320
You don't have to beg for mercy.

214
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,720
I fought with him to the death.

215
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,720
I may not lose.

216
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,720
You're different from him.

217
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,440
You...

218
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,680
You just did something wrong.

219
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,960
Go back with me.

220
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,640
Explain it to the master.

221
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,880
He won't blame you.

222
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,640
Brother Cang Qi!

223
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,600
I beg you!

224
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,960
I know I've done this

225
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,560
to break the big plan of Brother Nalan.

226
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,520
But in this world,

227
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,120
I only have my brother and his family.

228
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,960
I beg you to let us go.

229
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,960
I beg you.

230
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,000
Today,

231
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,640
I'll let you go

232
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,120
for Miss Mei's sake.

233
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,600
If I meet you again,

234
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,240
don't blame me.

235
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,600
Miss Mei.

236
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,240
Su An Jeg ambient report of Tui degrees.

237
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,480
Too late to Our��리� hard-to-문기

238
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,160
in the order of

239
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,200
cloning and

240
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,920
ret damaging of the people's land gifts.

241
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,640
we will all be defeated.

242
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,840
We can't delay it.

243
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,600
Let's get rid of the body

244
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,800
to avoid more nightmares.

245
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,160
Master Ming.

246
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,480
Master Ming.

247
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,480
We're about to bury Liuli.

248
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,480
abandoned new relatives

249
00:13:53,480 --> 00:14:02,260
too distant for her

250
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,440
You really make my head take off.

251
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,360
I thought

252
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,840
how God doctor is without Rodrigues.

253
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,480
Master,

254
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,000
I alone made this marriage.

255
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,840
It's not about her.

256
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,800
I,

257
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,800
I don't believe it.

258
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,640
Master,

259
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,240
I did it on my own.

260
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,480
Since Liuli escaped,

261
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,040
Jin Que has been in a state of panic.

262
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,040
He's not at ease.

263
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,320
If I hadn't stopped him,

264
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,800
he would have already

265
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,040
asked for forgiveness from Mingzun.

266
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,200
Why did you stop him?

267
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,720
After Liuli escaped,

268
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,200
Master must be very angry.

269
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,480
I'm worried that

270
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,200
you might not be able to

271
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,600
ask Ming Shi about the incident

272
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,040
and then

273
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,600
he would have punished Jin Que.

274
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,520
You're afraid that I'll kill him?

275
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,440
Jin Que,

276
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,720
did Liuli really escape on her own?

277
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,840
Does it have nothing to do with you?

278
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,160
Your Majesty,

279
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,160
I really can't bear to

280
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,360
be cruel to Liuli.

281
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,880
When I was looking for him,

282
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,240
I let him escape on purpose.

283
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,240
Wu Liang is really stubborn.

284
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,520
She wouldn't listen to me.

285
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,520
As for how she escaped,

286
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,600
I really don't know anything.

287
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,560
I know it has nothing to do with you.

288
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,560
Because I sent someone

289
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,600
to keep an eye on you

290
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,960
early in the morning.

291
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,880
I also know

292
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,240
you'll definitely find a way

293
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,640
to let Liuli go.

294
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:52,920
So,

295
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,840
when she was being asked to leave,

296
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,160
I sprinkled some chasing powder on her.

297
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,560
The first place she left the city

298
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,080
was a hotel

299
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,560
outside the south of the city.

300
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,080
Mingzun,

301
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,680
you still won't let her go?

302
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,320
A mere Liuli

303
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,920
is nothing to me.

304
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,080
What I really want

305
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,120
is the whereabouts of Rong's second sister.

306
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,200
Now that Nalan Yue has more power,

307
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,520
half of Mei Ying has escaped.

308
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,320
If something happens to them,

309
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,360
I'm afraid

310
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,920
I'll really have no one to trust.

311
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,840
You two are together to deceive me.

312
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,480
You should take the responsibility.

313
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,640
You two can eat your food

314
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,560
and stay in the city

315
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,520
to think about it.

316
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,360
Remember,

317
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,360
spread the whereabouts of Rong's sister.

318
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,960
כל

319
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,840
The things that Yue talked about

320
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,000
is definitely my lack of constraints.

321
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,720
Now that it's how she was sent,

322
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,640
it must have reason.

323
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,120
The flowers all end.

324
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,560
Who to meet

325
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,160
on an endorsement?

326
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,960
What if I'm left behind?

327
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:19,160
Love is deep, but hard to let go

328
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:24,560
Why do I turn around and look at the love?

329
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:29,760
The hardest to enjoy, but hard to keep

330
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,360
What if I'm left behind?

331
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,960
Love is deep, but hard to let go

332
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:43,560
Why do I turn around and look at the love?

333
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,960
Is this?

334
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:51,560
The eternity?

335
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,760
Cang Qi has sent a message back.

336
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,960
He said Xue Man and Mei Ying went south

337
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,760
and quietly headed to Mei's mansion.

338
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,760
If it's true, it's a good thing.

339
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,760
Bad news!

340
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,360
What's wrong, Master?

341
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,960
I just got news from the second master.

342
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,760
Mei's brother and sister's escape route was found out by the spiritual cult.

343
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,560
The spiritual cult disciples who were searching everywhere are now gathering.

344
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,760
They are heading south.

345
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,160
They found out about this route so quickly.

346
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,960
There must be something wrong with it.

347
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,960
This...

348
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,560
Mo Huai has a plan to kill Mei Ying.

349
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,360
If Mei is with him,

350
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,160
it's dangerous.

351
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,560
Cang Qi has been following them in secret.

352
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,960
But with his ability, he can't defeat the spiritual cult.

353
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,160
You should go and save them.

354
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,160
Why can't I be with you at this time?

355
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,360
How about this?

356
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,160
I'll send a message to Cang Qi.

357
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,160
Tell Cang Qi to call all the people around to help.

358
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,760
You have to go there yourself.

359
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,360
Xue Man is in danger alone.

360
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,360
We can't ignore her safety.

361
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,560
Besides, Mei Ying is cunning.

362
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,360
I always think there will be an accident.

363
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,960
If it's not,

364
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,960
if you let me go, I'll...

365
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,560
With Master and Sister, you don't have to worry.

366
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,760
Right.

367
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,160
With me, why are you worried?

368
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,960
Go.

369
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,560
I'll take care of myself.

370
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,560
Wait for your return safely.

371
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,960
Okay. I'll go first.

372
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,160
Go.

373
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,760
Go.

374
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,160
Go.

375
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,560
Go.

376
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,360
Go.

377
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,160
If Master Ming blames us,

378
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,960
can you take responsibility?

379
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,160
Brother, you actually...

380
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,560
If not,

381
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,560
how can I prove my innocence to Master Ming

382
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,560
and save you and me?

383
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,960
I'll go tell Master Ming.

384
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,360
As long as we send people to follow them in secret,

385
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,160
we can find the clue of Nalan Yue.

386
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,360
Then the truth will be revealed.

387
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,160
Go.

388
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,760
Master Ming has used up all his patience.

389
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,760
If you can get Nalan Yue out,

390
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,160
it's worth it to risk your lives.

391
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,560
I've always been loyal to Master Ming.

392
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,160
Why does he treat me like this?

393
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,160
Isn't it the greatest loyalty to be loyal to one's life?

394
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,360
Xuan Man!

395
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,160
Xuan Man!

396
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,760
Xuan Man!

397
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,160
Xuan Man!

398
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,760
What's going on?

399
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,560
The whole south trip to Mei's Manor,

400
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,760
only I and Xuan Man knew about it.

401
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,960
Why would the people from the Ling Sect come here?

402
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,760
How did you know I was going back to Mei's Manor?

403
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,960
Could it be that

404
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,160
Xuan Man didn't escape from you before?

405
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,360
Were you all just acting?

406
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,760
No matter what,

407
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,760
Xuan Man wants you to live.

408
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,560
That's why she begged me to spare your life.

409
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,360
She only wanted you to stay in Mei's Manor

410
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,560
and never leave.

411
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,160
Xuan Man.

412
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,160
Xuan Man.

413
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,760
Xuan Man.

414
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,560
Miss Mei.

415
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,760
Xuan Man.

416
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,160
Brother Nalan.

417
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,760
Did you come to save me?

418
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,960
Yes.

419
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,360
I never thought that

420
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,760
there's a place in my heart

421
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,560
that's still suspicious.

422
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,960
Don't say anymore.

423
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,960
Let's go to the clinic.

424
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,760
No need.

425
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,760
I know I can't do it anymore.

426
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,960
I'm sorry.

427
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,360
I can see you again today.

428
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,160
Xuan Man has already lost her mind.

429
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,160
She has no regrets.

430
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,760
What are you talking about?

431
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,160
She could die!

432
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,960
Brother Nalan.

433
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,960
Promise me.

434
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,160
Protect my brother.

435
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,160
In the end,

436
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,480
we still hope to see him

437
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,760
in the beauty's palace.

438
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,080
The blood is full under the wine.

439
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,600
It's a fate.

440
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,840
Okay.

441
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,680
I promise you.

442
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,640
Thank you.

443
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,680
Dalan Yu.

444
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,840
If there's a future,

445
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,160
I hope I can be

446
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,160
the girl who loves you wholeheartedly.

447
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,640
We'll live and die together.

448
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,080
We'll live together for a hundred years.

449
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,000
Xuan Ma.

450
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,840
Xuan Ma.

451
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,680
Xuan Ma.

452
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,680
Xuan Ma.

453
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,160
Xuan Ma.

454
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,720
Xuan Ma.

455
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,960
Xuan Ma.

456
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,160
Xuan Ma.

457
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,840
She's not better to live so coolly with me.

458
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,600
We'll get talk competition anyway.

459
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,000
Of course, I won't表示 to you.

460
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,320
When it's time to train her descencies,

461
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,200
you mustn't cheat on her self.

462
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,880
Be remaining a maximalist

463
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,160
The Lulongyin City is just a place with no land.

464
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,160
But I can't believe that

465
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,160
Mohua is taking over the martial art world.

466
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,160
Mohua is a vicious and vicious woman.

467
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,160
Everyone hates her.

468
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,160
We should unite the whole martial art world

469
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,160
and get rid of her.

470
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,160
You're too naive.

471
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,160
Now all the sects

472
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,160
are eager to avenge their leaders

473
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,160
and kill our family.

474
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,160
I'm so happy.

475
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,160
I wonder where Yue is now.

476
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,160
Can we bring her back safely?

477
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,160
Master has gone to the front to inquire about the news.

478
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,160
We'll go meet him now.

479
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,160
Don't waste time.

480
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,160
Okay.

481
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,160
Let's go.

482
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,160
Are you still worried about Nalan Yue?

483
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,160
Don't let them surprise father.

484
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,160
We can't let the people of Lulongyin City go easily.

485
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,160
Go.

486
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,160
Father.

487
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,160
Sister.

488
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,160
Father.

489
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,160
Sister.

490
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,160
Father.

491
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,160
Sister.

492
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,160
Sister.

493
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,160
Sister.

494
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,160
Sister.

495
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,160
Sister, what's wrong?

496
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,160
Go.

497
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,160
I'm tired of watching

498
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,160
this good show today.

499
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,160
Those ugly people

500
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,160
should leave the stage.

501
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,160
You told them

502
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,160
where we were hiding.

503
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,160
They are all

504
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,160
the ones who lost high and stepped low.

505
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,160
And they are ungrateful.

506
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,160
How can they deserve

507
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,160
to kill you two?

508
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,160
You two

509
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,160
are really close.

510
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,160
If Rong Jingfeng

511
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,160
knew about this,

512
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,160
he would be grateful

513
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,160
to me

514
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,160
for saving him.

515
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,160
Sister.

516
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,160
If he doesn't

517
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,160
stop bleeding

518
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,160
in a second,

519
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,160
he will die of heart failure.

520
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,160
I'm the only one

521
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,160
who can save him now.

522
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,160
If you want to kill us,

523
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,160
just be happy.

524
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,160
If you want to save us,

525
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,160
tell me.

526
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,160
What conditions do you have?

527
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,160
You are really

528
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,160
a smart person.

529
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,160
Are you begging me?

530
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,160
But there should be

531
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,160
a way to beg others.

532
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,160
You are so strong.

533
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,160
It feels like I'm begging you.

534
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,160
What do you want?

535
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,160
I want you

536
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,160
to help me

537
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,160
and serve my family.

538
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,160
Rong Jingfeng thought that

539
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,160
he could escape from me

540
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,160
after he died.

541
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,160
In his dreams,

542
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,160
as long as there is

543
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,160
a little bit of blood in your family,

544
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,160
he will never escape.

545
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,160
My control.

546
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,160
Please,

547
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,160
save my sister.

548
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,160
Don't act rashly in front of me.

549
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,160
You want to kill me

550
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,160
and control the West Hall.

551
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,160
But you want me to bow down.

552
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,160
It's impossible.

553
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,160
No one wants to kill you.

554
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,160
Now your heart is damaged.

555
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,160
If you get angry again,

556
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,160
even if someone wants to save you,

557
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,160
it's useless.

558
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,160
You can decide

559
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,160
whether to die or live.

560
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,160
If I can survive

561
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,160
with the help of the Ling family,

562
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,160
I will die.

563
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,160
I will die.

564
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,160
I will die.

565
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,160
If I can survive

566
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,160
with the help of the Ling family,

567
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,160
I would rather die.

568
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,160
But the people around you

569
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,160
tried their best to save you.

570
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,160
You are so arrogant.

571
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,160
It's a pity

572
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,160
for Rong Hua's sincerity.

573
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,160
He made such a sacrifice

574
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,160
to save you.

575
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,160
But you don't know how to cherish it.

576
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,160
Rong Hua.

577
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,160
Where is he?

578
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,160
What are you going to do to him?

579
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,160
If Rong Hua wants to get rid of the hatred,

580
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,160
he can come to me.

581
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,160
If he dares to hurt Rong Hua,

582
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,160
I won't let him go.

583
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,160
Your martial arts are being used by Ming Zun.

584
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,160
How can you protect him?

585
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,160
If you don't want to get Rong Hua involved,

586
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,160
you can rest in peace.

587
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,160
Those who do wrong things are the ones who are in danger.

588
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,160
Don't add more to the blood.

589
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,160
I never leave a useless person.

590
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,160
Not to mention the family business.

591
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,160
Where is Rong Hua?

592
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,160
What conditions did he agree to?

593
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,160
What conditions did he agree to?

594
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,160
I'm afraid that he's guilty

595
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,160
and I'll call you a god.

596
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,160
Are you afraid?

597
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,160
If I don't go even if I die,

598
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,160
what's there to be afraid of?

599
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,160
But if you fall into my hands,

600
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,160
living is more painful than dying.

601
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,160
That's why

602
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,160
your sister was like that.

603
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,160
You...

604
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,160
You saved Yue

605
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,160
to fulfill your own ambitions.

606
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,160
You let him practice the Black Ice Talisman

607
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,160
to control everyone in the world.

608
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,160
You failed to tell the truth

609
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,160
to the Chihua Bead that you died.

610
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,160
So you entrusted all your hopes

611
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,160
to Yue.

612
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,160
I'm sorry.

613
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,160
I'm sorry.

614
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,160
I'm sorry.

615
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,160
It's a pity

616
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,160
that the woman of Nalan Yue

617
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,160
can't become a great thing.

618
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,160
But now I've found

619
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,160
a weapon that can control her

620
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,160
more than the Black Ice Talisman.

621
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,160
It's you.

622
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,160
I want Nalan Yue to know

623
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,160
what I'll end up with.

624
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,160
You should thank me.

625
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,160
This way, you can test

626
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,160
how much Nalan Yue loves you.

627
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,160
How did this happen?

628
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,160
The Black Ice Talisman that Nalan Yue

629
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,160
practiced is totally different.

630
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,160
That's right.

631
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,160
I failed because

632
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,160
Chihua Bead failed.

633
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,160
But it's not because of nothing.

634
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,160
This bug was taken from the Red Flame Lotus.

635
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,160
And this bug in your body

636
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,160
is separated from the mother bug in my body.

637
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,160
That's why it looks like this.

638
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,160
I'll go.

639
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,160
Be careful.

640
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,160
What's wrong with Rong Hua?

641
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,160
Rong Hua said

642
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,160
you're different from the mother bug and the mother bug.

643
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,160
You're not a bad person.

644
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,160
You're just forced by the mother bug.

645
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,160
Now Rong Hua is in danger.

646
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,160
You...

647
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,160
Stop talking.

648
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,160
It's different now.

649
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,160
No one can stop the fate of the Lord of the Deceased.

650
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,160
You should think about it.

651
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,160
Do you want to live

652
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,160
or become someone else's burden?

653
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,160
Wait.

654
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,160
Give me the medicine.

655
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,160
I'm willing to take it.

656
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,160
I didn't expect it to be so quick.

657
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,160
How could this happen?

658
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,160
I really didn't expect

659
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,160
that the Moon Mirror of Nalan

660
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,160
broke through the last barrier

661
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,160
and gained more power.

662
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,160
But

663
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,160
she thought she could deal with me in this way.

664
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,160
I don't know.

665
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,160
I'm the most familiar person

666
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,160
with the Black Ice Talisman.

667
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,160
And now

668
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,160
I have you.

669
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,160
Right.

670
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,160
I've just

671
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,160
put the bug I've been raising

672
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,160
into your body.

673
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,160
And this bug

674
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,160
will be controlled by the mother bug in my body.

675
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,160
I've created a new one

676
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,160
following the black ice talisman.

677
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,160
The purpose is

678
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,160
to deal with the Moon Mirror of Nalan.

679
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,160
You're crazy.

680
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,160
Don't think too much.

681
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,160
Don't think too much.

682
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,160
You can't control her.

683
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,160
Of course I can't control her.

684
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,160
But now I have you,

685
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,160
I can easily deal with her.

686
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,160
Don't forget.

687
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,160
The person who is closest to you

688
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,160
is not the Moon Mirror of Nalan.

689
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,160
It's me.

690
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,160
If I'm not careful,

691
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,160
you'll die with me.

692
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,160
Do you think the Moon Mirror of Nalan

693
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,160
will be willing to kill me?

694
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,160
You've put so much effort

695
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,160
to control me

696
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,160
to threaten Yue.

697
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,160
She thought

698
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,160
she could escape from my control.

699
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,160
I want to see

700
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,160
when one day

701
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,160
she knows

702
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,160
what you've been through

703
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,160
and what she's been through.

704
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,160
Guess

705
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,160
what she'll react.

706
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,160
You're crazy.

707
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,160
I won't be your puppet.

708
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,160
Don't try to control everything.

709
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,160
You mean

710
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,160
you want to die

711
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,160
without any involvement?

712
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,160
It's easy for you to die.

713
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,160
What about your sister?

714
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,160
Have you thought about her?

715
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,160
Sure.

716
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,160
If you want to die,

717
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,160
I won't let you be too lonely.

718
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,160
Then I'll let your sister

719
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,160
run to the netherworld with you.

720
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,160
It's like

721
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,160
your Rong family

722
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,160
reuniting underground.

723
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,160
Your Highness.

724
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,160
Your Highness.

725
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,160
Your Highness.

726
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,160
Your Highness.

727
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,160
Your Highness.

728
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,160
Your Highness.

729
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,160
Your Highness.

730
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,160
Your Highness.

731
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,160
Your Highness.

732
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,160
Your Highness.

733
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,160
Your Highness.

734
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,160
Your Highness.

735
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,160
Your Highness.

736
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,160
Your Highness.

737
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,160
Your Highness.

738
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,160
Your Highness.

739
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,160
Your Highness.

740
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,160
Your Highness.

741
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,160
Your Highness.

742
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,160
Your Highness.

743
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,160
Your Highness.

744
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,160
Your Highness.

745
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,160
Your Highness.

746
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,160
Your Highness.

747
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,160
Your Highness.

748
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,160
Your Highness.

749
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,160
Your Highness.

750
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,160
Your Highness.

751
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,160
Your Highness.

752
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,160
Your Highness.

753
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,160
Your Highness.

754
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,160
Your Highness.

755
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,160
Your Highness.

756
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,160
Your Highness.

757
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,160
Your Highness.

758
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,160
Your Highness.

759
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,160
Your Highness.

760
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,160
Your Highness.

761
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,160
Your Highness.

762
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,160
Your Highness.

763
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,160
