1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,300
The entertainment mastereden

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,700
Young comer

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Untamed

4
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,040
There are countless kind people in the world.

5
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,320
Then why did An Yue choose the daughter of the enemy?

6
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,000
This hatred has nothing to do with them.

7
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,840
Lin Jing, why are you so cruel to me?

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The Untamed

9
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,280
I should have known

10
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,000
you are the son of Lin Ruohan

11
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,760
and Na Lanxi.

12
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,120
Look at your eyes.

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,720
I'm so familiar with you.

14
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,000
I won't let you be burned to death.

15
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,640
I won't let you die.

16
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,720
I think you'd better not force yourself.

17
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,120
You know the poison Ziyan made.

18
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,120
Yes, that's the look in your eyes.

19
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,760
You'd better think about how to protect yourself.

20
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,600
That's the look in your eyes.

21
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,400
You look like Na Lanxi.

22
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,040
If you die like this,

23
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,840
it will be too easy for you.

24
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The Untamed

25
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The Untamed

26
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,640
The Chief asked me to pick up a person.

27
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,640
But I didn't want to go out.

28
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,840
Such a big thing happened in Longyin City.

29
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,480
Who told the secret of the Nalan family to Rong Jingfeng?

30
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,120
Lingxu Pavilion has never been out.

31
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,640
Could it be him?

32
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,160
Never underestimate Lingxu Pavilion's means.

33
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,120
The Martial Soul Hall may have been surrounded by spies.

34
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,040
Don't let any suspicious person go.

35
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,040
Yes.

36
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:02,960
Brother.

37
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,040
Brother.

38
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,920
Brother.

39
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:09,880
Let's go.

40
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,840
Go and help them.

41
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,480
Yes.

42
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,960
Come with me. Hurry.

43
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:27,920
Go.

44
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,440
If I hadn't saved you in time,

45
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,280
you and the other disciples would have been exposed.

46
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,320
You don't have enough experience in the martial arts world.

47
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,960
You shouldn't have come here.

48
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,520
Thank you for your help.

49
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,000
I was worried that I would come alone.

50
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,320
But it happened suddenly.

51
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,560
We don't know the young master's situation in the city.

52
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,920
Is he alive or dead?

53
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,600
So we know that Longyin City

54
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
must have set up the King of the Sky Tower in the Tengfeng Township.

55
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,280
But even so,

56
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,760
I can only risk my life.

57
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,040
You went to Longyin City before.

58
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,640
Many people in the city know each other.

59
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,960
It's too arrogant to act rashly now.

60
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,600
Remember.

61
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,400
Don't show up in the town.

62
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,440
Since I promised my senior sister,

63
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,840
the lives of the Nalan Yue will be fine.

64
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,120
I don't know if you believe me.

65
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,400
I don't know if you believe me.

66
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,120
I need to see your disciples.

67
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,720
The master of the Hall said

68
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,880
that you are the one who trusts me.

69
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,400
How can I not believe you?

70
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,800
As long as I can save the young master,

71
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,320
not only the disciples of Lingxu Pavilion will take your wood,

72
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,160
even if it's my life,

73
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,000
it's not a problem for you to transfer the poison.

74
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,640
Please.

75
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,400
Second Miss.

76
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,440
Second Miss.

77
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,720
You haven't been in the water for days.

78
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,960
You'll only hurt your body.

79
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,840
Second Miss.

80
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,840
That Nalan

81
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,200
used you to deceive us.

82
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,080
He doesn't love you at all.

83
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,120
For him,

84
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,480
you are not worth it.

85
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,480
I don't want to think he is that kind of person.

86
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,000
Now my father and aunt don't want to see me.

87
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,080
I don't have the face

88
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,720
to see other people in Longyin City.

89
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,000
Second Miss, don't think too much.

90
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,000
The master and master

91
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,400
are just busy with the post-mortem.

92
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,480
They are not able to get over it.

93
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,360
In fact, everyone is thinking about you.

94
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,960
As long as you are willing to bow down

95
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,160
and take the initiative to admit your fault,

96
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,360
and completely end up with that Nalan Yue,

97
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,480
everyone will not blame you.

98
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,040
Here.

99
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,720
Miss.

100
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,080
Really?

101
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,400
Yes.

102
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,400
If you think it through,

103
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,720
I'll go to the master now

104
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,640
and ask him to persuade the master.

105
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,720
As the second miss,

106
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,280
we all know that

107
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,880
you will never

108
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,560
collude with Lingxu Pavilion

109
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,240
to harm Longyin City.

110
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,240
Second Miss,

111
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,480
eat something quickly.

112
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,560
I'll go to the master now.

113
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,760
Eat more.

114
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,080
Xiao Xiao.

115
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,400
Greetings, Miss.

116
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,560
Why are you so happy?

117
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,240
Now that the city is in a state of emergency,

118
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,640
you are walking around like this.

119
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,640
How is that appropriate?

120
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,200
Miss.

121
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,520
It's the second miss.

122
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,840
She finally agreed to eat.

123
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,200
She even agreed to sever her relationship with Nalan Yue.

124
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,480
That's why I was in a hurry

125
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,600
to report to the master.

126
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,840
Miss.

127
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,360
I'm sorry.

128
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,680
I didn't mean to offend you.

129
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,440
I'm sorry.

130
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,200
I'm sorry.

131
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm sorry.

132
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,120
Miss.

133
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,400
Do you have any orders?

134
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,720
Nothing.

135
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,480
You may leave.

136
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,480
Yes.

137
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,800
By the way,

138
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,120
since the second miss has changed her mind,

139
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,480
just remove the guard in front of her.

140
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,600
Yes.

141
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,560
Thank you, Miss.

142
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,320
It seems that Mr. Mei is more capable than I thought.

143
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,960
Now, the city of Longyin

144
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,920
is your place of attack.

145
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,720
I heard that Miss Rong

146
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,440
removed the guard in front of Rong Hua's door.

147
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,280
I don't understand the meaning of it anymore.

148
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,400
I don't believe she will really give up on Nalan Yue.

149
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,520
Once the guard at the door is removed,

150
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,600
she will definitely go to save her.

151
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,280
You are so good at playing tricks.

152
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,640
But why did you tell me?

153
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,840
I didn't set up a trap.

154
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,960
Rong Hua is my sister after all.

155
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,960
Why should I make it difficult for her?

156
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,680
Then why are you doing this?

157
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,760
Since she cares about Nalan Yue so much,

158
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,560
let them meet each other.

159
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,520
It's a good thing that she has been here for many days.

160
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,760
But no matter what,

161
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,680
they can't get out of the city of Longyin

162
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,960
which is heavily guarded.

163
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,720
I will stop her then.

164
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,960
When the case of Hua Hai is cleared,

165
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,800
she can give up.

166
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,960
Then I would like to ask Mr. Mei

167
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,280
to take care of Rong Hua.

168
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,280
Whether you can win her heart

169
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,400
depends on your ability.

170
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,040
Report to the city gate immediately.

171
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:39,840
Yue.

172
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,160
Why are you here?

173
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,520
You...

174
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,680
You suffered.

175
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,880
This is a poisonous bug.

176
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,720
Wait a minute.

177
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:08,960
Let me help you.

178
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:14,760
No.

179
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,960
Why did you betray me?

180
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,320
You betrayed Li Xuge.

181
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,440
I didn't.

182
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,720
I didn't do that.

183
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,640
Yue.

184
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,960
Don't worry.

185
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,440
I'll heal your wound.

186
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:30,960
Rong Hua.

187
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,240
Look at me.

188
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,680
Yue.

189
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,440
I said I didn't.

190
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,960
Are you doubting me?

191
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,440
During this period,

192
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,120
to prove your innocence,

193
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,440
I have been living

194
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,080
with my family's misunderstanding.

195
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,440
Have you ever thought about my feelings?

196
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,040
I feel bad

197
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,640
for what you said.

198
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,120
Yue.

199
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,160
It's my own wishful thinking.

200
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:06,760
City Chief.

201
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,440
Why did you

202
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,000
withdraw the guard at the gate?

203
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,040
Why did you let him save Nalan Yu?

204
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,640
City Chief, please forgive me.

205
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,800
It's a misunderstanding.

206
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,000
What misunderstanding?

207
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,080
Let me ask you.

208
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,240
Did you go to Lingxu Pavilion

209
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,280
and start to sympathize with Nalan's family?

210
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,800
City Chief, Rong Su didn't mean that.

211
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,880
Forget it.

212
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,200
Yue.

213
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,120
I will forgive you.

214
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,520
No.

215
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,020
Yue.

216
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,200
No.

217
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,600
Dad.

218
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,440
What happened?

219
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,680
to do what I did.

220
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,520
It's good that you know it's wrong.

221
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,080
It's okay.

222
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,480
I'm here.

223
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:22,680
Come on.

224
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,280
Rong Hua is so blind.

225
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,920
He thinks

226
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,520
you're a good person who can entrust his life to him.

227
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,760
I will always think about it.

228
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,440
I really mean the worst thing I have done.

229
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,840
But since you are dead...

230
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,480
Not dead, I'm a dead man.

231
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,880
Rest in peace.

232
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,120
You soft deepest thoughts.

233
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,800
I just want to say

234
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,840
Let's do something big.

235
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,360
Okay.

236
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,320
With your skills,

237
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,440
you're so bold to break into the martial arts world.

238
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,240
How am I here?

239
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,600
Xun Yi.

240
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,120
I have a lot of money.

241
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,560
Xuan Yi.

242
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,640
Xuan Yi.

243
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,600
Where are you going?

244
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,080
Xuan Yi.

245
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,680
Stinky wood.

246
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,440
Where are you going?

247
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,280
Don't follow me.

248
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,320
The plan has changed.

249
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,760
I need to rush back to Longyin City immediately.

250
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,480
Why?

251
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,080
The leaders of the major sects

252
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,440
were killed in Longyin City.

253
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,040
These people

254
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,080
were the ones who wanted to save the host justice.

255
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,000
The leaders of the major sects were killed in the West Tree?

256
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,520
The murderer is the young master of Lingxu Pavilion, Na Lanyue.

257
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,760
He was locked up in Longyin City.

258
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,600
Such a big thing happened in the city.

259
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,880
The Hall Leader needs me.

260
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,200
The Hall Leader needs you?

261
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,280
Lai Zi.

262
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,000
Do you like your Hall Leader?

263
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,280
I like him.

264
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,720
I like him.

265
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,200
I like him.

266
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,480
Your Hall Leader?

267
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,040
Don't talk nonsense.

268
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,640
I guessed right.

269
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,320
You are usually like a wooden tree.

270
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,920
Why are you blushing

271
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,520
when you mention your Hall Leader?

272
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,200
How dare you!

273
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,640
You are rude to our Hall Leader.

274
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,520
My life

275
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,320
was saved by the Hall Leader.

276
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,560
I have no respect for him.

277
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,440
If you say anything again,

278
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,640
I will be rude to you.

279
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,040
I'm so scared.

280
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,440
What do you think of me?

281
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,120
Aren't you afraid

282
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,800
that I will spread the news

283
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,000
that you like your Hall Leader

284
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,360
all over Jiangnan and Beimeng?

285
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,040
How dare you!

286
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,840
You damn wooden tree!

287
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,600
You wouldn't have been in the West Tree if you hadn't said that.

288
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,320
Anyway,

289
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,080
I'm still a girl.

290
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,800
I even tried my best

291
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,080
to help you with the plan

292
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,320
to solve the crisis in Longyin City.

293
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,320
Look.

294
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,320
How funny is this!

295
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,520
You ungratefulources!

296
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,720
How am I ungrateful!

297
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,160
I cought you.

298
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,840
This is so painful.

299
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,400
It broke.

300
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,880
A wooden tree.

301
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,000
It hurts.

302
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,200
I'll send the rest of the money to the Little Snow Queen.

303
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,800
Thank you for your help, Miss Liuli.

304
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,200
You'll go back now.

305
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,200
The journey is long.

306
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,800
When you get there, you can't change anything.

307
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
You can't help at this time.

308
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,200
You can't even complete the task

309
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,200
your Hall Leader gave you.

310
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,200
Kneel down.

311
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,200
Luckily, Hua'er is fine.

312
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
You can see the real face of Nalan Yue.

313
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,200
Our family

314
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,200
won't be angry about this anymore.

315
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,200
Tell him.

316
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,200
He even removed the guard at the door of Hua'er

317
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,200
and let Hua'er go to see Nalan Yue.

318
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,200
If there were no fights on the way,

319
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,600
if there were no fights on the way,

320
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,400
they would have already gone through Longyin City.

321
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,400
Luckily, I have the name of the fairy.

322
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,400
I'm keeping an eye on them in secret.

323
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,000
Otherwise, do you know what kind of consequences

324
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
will be caused?

325
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Chengchu is blaming me.

326
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,200
I just wanted them to meet again.

327
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,000
I've already decided on Rong Hua's idea.

328
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,600
Before Rong Hua went out,

329
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I've already set up a heavy defense

330
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,600
outside the dark house and on the way out of the city.

331
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,800
I will never let them leave.

332
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,600
You still dare to deny it?

333
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
All right.

334
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,400
Rong Su is always steady

335
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,800
and takes care of the overall situation.

336
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,400
He always puts Longyin City first.

337
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,600
I think

338
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,400
he must have made a complete preparation

339
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,000
to let Hua'er go out.

340
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Then tell me.

341
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,200
What's going on with Yin Ruohan?

342
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,200
Yin Ruohan.

343
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,600
Don't think I don't know.

344
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,600
You met Yin Ruohan in Lingxu Pavilion.

345
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,800
And you also guessed

346
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,600
who he was, didn't you?

347
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,600
What?

348
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,600
Yes.

349
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
After you came back,

350
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,200
you did ask me about Yin Ruohan's secret.

351
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,200
But

352
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,600
you didn't mention the secret of Lingxu Pavilion.

353
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,800
You guessed

354
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,200
that the owner of Lingxu Pavilion is Yin Ruohan.

355
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,200
And Lin Jing

356
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,800
is the descendant of Nalan Xi, right?

357
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,600
I dare not.

358
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,000
You dare not or you don't want to

359
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,200
or you have other plans?

360
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,000
Calm down.

361
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,200
I did ask you about Yin Ruohan.

362
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,200
But I just doubted

363
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,600
and didn't have any plans.

364
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,400
Before, when Rong Hua entered Lingxu Pavilion,

365
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,600
he was about to get married.

366
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,200
I...

367
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,200
Don't think I don't know your trick.

368
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,200
You want Hua to get married?

369
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,200
This Longyin City is yours, right?

370
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,800
I tell you, don't think about it.

371
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,200
Even if you are the eldest daughter of Rong Jingfeng,

372
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,400
you can't be the owner of Longyin City.

373
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,600
Miss, you took the medicine.

374
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,800
Miss, I beg you.

375
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,000
Just take the medicine.

376
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,400
I really feel sorry for you.

377
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,400
Miss Rong.

378
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,400
Mr. Lei.

379
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,400
Miss Rong.

380
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,200
Why do you do this?

381
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,800
I'm sorry.

382
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,400
Mr. Mei.

383
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,400
Are you here to laugh at me?

384
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,400
No, of course not.

385
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,400
I have something to talk to Miss Rong.

386
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,600
Xiao Xiao, you can leave now.

387
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,000
Please persuade Miss Rong.

388
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,600
Miss Rong.

389
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,600
I was going to

390
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,200
save Young Master for you.

391
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,800
But Mei Chengxiang didn't tell you.

392
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,800
You and he became like this.

393
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,400
My father may not lie to me.

394
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,800
That Lan Yue has been using my feelings for him.

395
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,800
All this is just my wishful thinking.

396
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,800
This is the plum fragrance I made for Miss Rong.

397
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,800
It helps her sleep on the floor before going to bed.

398
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,200
It will help her sleep well.

399
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,400
Father.

400
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,200
Master.

401
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Don't stand on ceremony.

402
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,400
I came here to see if Miss Rong is feeling better.

403
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,200
I came here to see if Miss Rong is feeling better.

404
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,400
I came here to see if Hua'er is feeling better.

405
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,400
I'll leave now.

406
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,000
You can go.

407
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,200
Sit down, Hua'er.

408
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,400
How is it?

409
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,400
It's fine.

410
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,200
Father.

411
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,400
I was too muddled.

412
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,200
I was too emotional.

413
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,800
No one would have thought

414
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,400
that there is such a big secret behind Lingxu Pavilion.

415
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,400
It's the most important thing to take care of yourself.

416
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,200
Master.

417
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,000
I really love Rong Hua.

418
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,400
If you want to approach Hua'er with your own purpose,

419
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,800
and get what you want,

420
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,600
and hurt Hua'er's heart,

421
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,400
I, Rong Jingfeng, will never let you off.

422
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,200
And the whole Mei family.

423
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,600
I've already revealed Lingxu Pavilion's secret to you.

424
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,680
That means I've already

425
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,400
become your and Long Yingcheng's subordinate.

426
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,800
Mei family has no way out now.

427
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,600
Who else can we rely on except Long Yingcheng?

428
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,600
That's the best.

429
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,400
What we're going to do next is

430
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,400
to recruit all the people of the Jianghu.

431
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,400
Then we'll take this opportunity to attack Lingxu Pavilion.

432
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,200
Lingxu Pavilion

433
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,800
is not a place

434
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,000
where you can't go.

435
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Lingxu Pavilion

436
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
must pay a price this time.

437
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,000
I'm a dead man.

438
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,800
Mei Yingyuan is a noble lady.

439
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,000
She's been rewarded with a lot of rewards by Long Yingcheng.

440
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,800
Good.

441
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,800
Thank you, Mr. Mei, for coming with me

442
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,200
and saying goodbye to her.

443
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,600
We're old friends.

444
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,800
It's my honor.

445
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,200
Ms. Cheng.

446
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,800
Without the order of the City Leader,

447
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,400
we can't let you in.

448
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,800
I'm here to say goodbye to her.

449
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,200
Open the door.

450
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,800
I didn't expect to see you two together.

451
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,600
Nan Lanyue.

452
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,600
Even if you and Lingxu Pavilion

453
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,800
have a grudge against Long Yingcheng and the City Leader,

454
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,800
you shouldn't have killed Ms. Rong.

455
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,800
What's wrong with me hurting her?

456
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,600
Nan Lanyue.

457
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,000
Do you have anything else to say?

458
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,600
What do I have to say to you?

459
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,200
Go and tell the City Leader

460
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,800
that Nan Lanyue hurt Mei Ying.

461
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,200
Go!

462
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,200
What are you doing here?

463
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,200
Hurry up!

464
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,600
Hurry up!

465
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,200
Search!

466
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,200
Don't chase!

467
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,200
Hurry up!

468
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,200
Stop!

469
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,800
I'm here.

470
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,800
The City Leader ordered me to come.

471
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,800
The City Leader ordered you to come.

472
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,600
2nd Miss.

473
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,600
I'm here to deliver medicines.

474
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,800
You're not a disciple of me.

475
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,800
Please take the medicine while it's hot.

476
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,200
I've arranged a disciple to enter the city.

477
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,400
When the time is right,

478
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,400
I'll save her.

479
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,800
The city is heavily guarded.

480
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,400
If we break in,

481
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,000
it's not a good idea.

482
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,200
Do you have a good idea?

483
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,400
I'm in a bad mood.

484
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,200
I want to go out and relax.

485
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,600
Greetings, 2nd Miss.

486
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,400
This is the City Leader's order.

487
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,200
Now the city is under investigation.

488
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,200
There is no exception.

489
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,400
Please don't mind.

490
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,000
Which is more ill- licenses.

491
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,200
My Lord.

492
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,600
Did you take her car?

493
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,400
See you, 2nd Miss.

494
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,400
I'll leave it here.

495
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,560
You may go now

496
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,400
Master

497
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,120
Master will take you to eat

498
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,160
Stay away

499
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,360
how did it happen?

500
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,020
Your Reverial Supervisor,

501
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:02,620
it...

502
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,780
It was the Pure Moon that Ms. Hold1 snuck away.

503
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,620
And we only just avenged

504
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,860
if it's in season.

505
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,900
Iral from differentques

506
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,620
Granduncle will give news to all different clans around the world.

507
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,060
They all knew

508
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,500
to save Nalan Yue,

509
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,500
he kidnapped the second lady of Longyin City.

510
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:33,660
Yes.

511
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,980
And we, Longyin City,

512
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,540
have to go to Taofang

513
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,780
with justice.

514
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:47,820
Be careful.

515
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:49,940
Be careful.

516
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,620
Are you feeling better?

517
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,340
Yes.

518
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,100
This time,

519
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,100
we underestimated Mei Yin and Rong Su.

520
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:05,500
Except for Rong Jing Feng,

521
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,980
they also participated in this.

522
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,300
Rong Su shouldn't stay here for long.

523
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,780
We have to hurry up.

524
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,580
Yes.

525
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,580
After I heal your bones,

526
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,060
we'll leave immediately.

527
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,500
Rong Su?

528
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,460
Lu Yi Zhou,

529
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,060
help me.

530
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,220
Here.

531
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,420
Rong Hua,

532
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,380
it's because of me

533
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,780
that you and Longyin City

534
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,620
have such a big accident.

535
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,740
Don't say that.

536
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,820
This is the black and white of Longyin City.

537
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:54,860
It's their fault.

538
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,140
What does it have to do with you?

539
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:00,220
I have no interest in being with you.

540
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,740
Now Lin Xu Ge is in trouble.

541
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,980
I will face it with you.

542
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,220
All disciples of Kong Si Hall,

543
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,860
check every place.

544
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,820
Don't miss any small place.

545
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,340
If anyone is suspicious,

546
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,380
take them all down

547
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,540
and make a decision later.

548
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,580
Yes.

549
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,420
Wait.

550
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,060
If you make any resistance

551
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,700
today,

552
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,740
you can kill them all.

553
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:38,660
Yes.

554
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,420
City Leader means

555
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,220
even if the other party is Rong Hua,

556
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,540
you don't have to worry about it.

557
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:51,940
Su Er,

558
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,540
let me tell you again.

559
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,380
Hua Er

560
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,860
was just kidnapped by Nalan Yue.

561
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,580
Rong Hua is not your enemy.

562
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,820
Do you understand?

563
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,100
Yes.

564
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,020
What are you waiting for?

565
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:11,980
Go and take action.

566
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,060
Yes.

567
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,880
9 merely

568
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:56,060
costs 1,500 thousand gold.

569
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,340
Yes.

570
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,260
So be it.

571
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,780
If this case ends,

572
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,860
you have to end it yourself.

573
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,980
Thank you.

574
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,060
Then I must let you go out.

575
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,260
Handcuff her.

576
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,180
Typical you,

577
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,380
I see.

578
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:18,860
OK.

579
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:21,860
Disappointed?

580
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,980
You people in Longyin City are really ungrateful.

581
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:35,020
You're so bold and reckless.

582
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,220
Do you really think that all the people in the martial arts world

583
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,060
are afraid of your martial arts?

584
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:54,380
It seems that you're determined to use me as your enemy.

585
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,820
Whether it's an enemy or a friend,

586
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,980
you already had an answer when you left the Lingxu Pavilion.

587
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:01,980
Martial arts?

588
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,300
Notre Dame.

589
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,780
There is nothing worth for Miss Rong

590
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,500
to bring the yin first at the seal of the city.

591
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:42,860
Disappointed?

592
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,060
The entire Feeling Wind Akt has been surrounded.

593
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,300
That一直 là due à combinationDeux Sages de la Bogle Romande.

594
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,940
Still, he can't escape.

595
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,580
Go.

596
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,180
Go.

597
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:53,700
Go.

598
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:57,660
Go.

599
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:59,740
Stop the car.

600
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,780
I can only send you here.

601
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,420
It will be very dangerous when we get back.

602
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,660
Be careful.

603
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:14,740
Master.

604
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,460
Thanks.

605
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,340
You...

606
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:18,940
You...

607
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,700
Don't be so polite with me.

608
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:21,460
I...

609
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,540
I think this old man

610
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,700
is really good at medicine.

611
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:26,700
He...

612
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,580
I don't know if he can take care of you on the way.

613
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,380
Shut up.

614
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,980
If it weren't for the girl's secret message,

615
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,380
Yue'er's wound

616
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,060
wouldn't be so bad.

617
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,140
By the way,

618
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,540
I left some medicine for you.

619
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,580
It's a waste of time.

620
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,140
All right.

621
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,220
I won't waste your time.

622
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,100
I'm leaving.

623
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,020
Master.

624
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,780
My father came prepared this time.

625
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,980
He gave the flower shop to Lin Xu.

626
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,180
Thanks to Master,

627
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,660
we can escape smoothly.

628
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,780
But I'm worried

629
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,820
you'll have troubles when you go back.

630
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,060
Why don't you go with us?

631
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,740
You silly girl.

632
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:08,980
What can I do?

633
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,620
I've been following your father

634
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,700
all the way.

635
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,780
I don't believe it.

636
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,460
This old man

637
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,620
is still blaming me.

638
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,860
Even if you can escape,

639
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,460
you'll go to Longyi City

640
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,900
with those who don't know

641
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,980
and don't know.

642
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,020
What's the point?

643
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,860
Why don't you just go with us

644
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,340
like Hua'er said?

645
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,260
Although you're a little greedy,

646
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,660
Lin Xu can still

647
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,140
control you.

648
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,180
You have to keep your words.

649
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,300
When Lin Xu is happy,

650
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,060
I'll be there.

651
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,780
If you don't

652
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:53,020
treat me well,

653
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,140
I'll punish you.

654
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:57,580
All right.

655
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:58,980
It's not safe here.

656
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,180
You should hurry up.

657
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,220
If anyone from Longyin City comes,

658
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,380
no one can escape.

659
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:04,420
By the way,

660
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,180
Luo Yizhou

661
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,540
is delaying us.

662
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,300
He's in Tianfeng Town

663
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,460
to delay Rong Su's family.

664
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,180
Don't worry.

665
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,740
You go ahead.

666
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,780
When I see him,

667
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,420
I'll protect him

668
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,460
and leave safely.

669
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,420
Thank you, Master.

670
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,780
Take care.

671
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:25,940
See you later.

672
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:28,980
See you later.

673
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,700
Master,

674
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,540
you found the whereabouts of Nalan Yue

675
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,420
and the second lady.

676
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,300
We're here to find them.

677
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:48,940
Yes.

678
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:49,580
Let's go.

679
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,180
Go.

680
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:50,780
Go.

681
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,300
Go.

682
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:51,780
Go.

683
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,180
Go.

684
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:52,780
Go.

685
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,300
Go.

686
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:53,780
Go.

687
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,300
Go.

688
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:54,780
Go.

689
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,300
Go.

690
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:55,780
Go.

691
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,300
Go.

692
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,300
Go.

693
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:57,780
Go.

694
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,300
Go.

695
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:58,780
Go.

696
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:59,300
Go.

697
00:39:59,300 --> 00:39:59,780
Go.

698
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,300
Go.

699
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,300
Go.

700
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,300
Go.

701
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,300
Go.

702
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,300
Go.

703
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,300
Go.

704
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,300
Go.

705
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,300
Go.

706
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,300
Go.

707
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,300
Go.

708
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,300
Go.

709
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,300
Go.

710
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,300
Go.

711
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,300
Go.

712
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:18,460
They've escaped from the

713
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,460
wind.

714
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,460
The disciples of Longyin City

715
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,460
have sent people to chase them.

716
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,460
Bailu,

717
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,500
we'll kill him

718
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,500
today.

719
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,500
Yes.

720
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,500
Go.

721
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,500
Go.

722
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,500
Go.

723
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,500
Go.

724
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,500
Go.

725
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,500
Go.

726
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,500
Go.

727
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,500
Go.

728
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,500
Go.

729
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,500
Go.

730
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,500
Go.

731
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,500
Go.

732
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,500
Go.

733
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,500
Go.

734
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,500
Go.

735
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,500
Go.

736
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,500
Go.

737
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,300
Go.

738
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,300
Go.

739
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,300
Go.

740
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,300
Open your eyes

741
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,300
and look at me.

742
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,940
How dare you treat me like this?

743
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:50,940
You want to rebel?

744
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,740
I was slandering you for nothing.

745
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,940
You dare to point a sword at me.

746
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,660
Step down.

747
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,660
We came to arrest the people

748
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,660
at the order of City Chief.

749
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,060
Hope City Chief can help us.

750
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,140
Since I took charge of Laozi Hall,

751
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,940
I've been doing my best every day.

752
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,220
Even if I get a good meal,

753
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,420
I'll share it with you.

754
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,660
But now you

755
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:24,060
don't even care about me.

756
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,340
Am I the one you want to catch?

757
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,020
Am I?

758
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,580
We don't want to make it hard for you,

759
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,740
but we're disciples of Longyin City.

760
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,660
We just want to help you.

761
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,940
Did Long Jingfeng ask you to catch me?

762
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,540
Did he ask you to kill me?

763
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,100
Tell me.

764
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,100
What did he do to you?

765
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,220
Zi Yan.

766
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:45,500
You...

767
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:47,340
Stop it.

768
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,540
Go back to the city with me.

769
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,420
You're going back to the city so soon?

770
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,100
Did Hua'er expose the whereabouts

771
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,220
and get taken back by the City Leader?

772
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,500
You're so muddled.

773
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,700
You still want to help them?

774
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,780
Aren't you afraid that the City Leader will blame you?

775
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:01,420
I...

776
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,820
You don't understand even if I tell you.

777
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,500
Get out of my way.

778
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,980
Or I'll be rude to you.

779
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:10,820
I'm not.

780
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,580
Or I'll be rude to you.

781
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:19,700
Zi Yan.

782
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:20,780
Hua'er, it's already like this.

783
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,900
I can't let you keep making mistakes.

784
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,780
It's not too late to go back.

785
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,580
I'll plead with the City Leader.

786
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,220
You're disciples of the Qing Mountain.

787
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,020
The City Leader will not punish you.

788
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:31,860
Zi Yan.

789
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,940
This time, you're really wrong.

790
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,060
Ei Wei,

791
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,260
take Bai Commentary to here.

792
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,340
Don't worry.

793
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,380
When you go back to väakon� capital,

794
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,180
itäten i madness will only add to it.

795
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:47,820
I will.

796
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:53,220
Those who want to try the other although they're dead,

797
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:56,140
please continue to pursue Gseldjyn.

798
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,500
I will not bow to you.

I will love you until I die.

800
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:45,420
I will love you until I die.

801
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:49,940
I will love you until I die.

802
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:55,260
I will love you until I die.

803
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:58,780
I will love you until I die.

804
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:03,100
I will love you until I die.

806
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:10,260

I will love you until I die.
