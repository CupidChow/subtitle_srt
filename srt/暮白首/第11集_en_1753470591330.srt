1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The King Of Blaze

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I just heard my father talk about this.

4
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Cheng Ruo,

5
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I went to Lingxu Pavilion before

6
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and didn't investigate this matter thoroughly.

7
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And I left the Chihua Bead in Lingxu Pavilion.

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm not good at it.

9
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
All right.

10
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Since it's come to this,

11
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
let's not care about the past.

12
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But I have to remind you of something.

13
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Mei Ying is a cunning person.

14
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
When you're helping her,

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
you must pay attention.

16
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I know, Cheng Ruo.

17
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Father,

18
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
don't worry.

19
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'll help you with the Chihua Bead.

20
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I won't let Mei Ying get in the way.

21
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
All right.

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm relieved.

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Rong Hua,

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
you have to take this lesson.

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
When you go out again,

26
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
you must be more careful.

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'll remember it.

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
All right. I'm leaving.

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Father, take care.

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It seems that the sword wound you forged for Mei Ying

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
has successfully hidden your father's eyes.

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's time for her to help us.

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
My father is always smart.

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
No matter how much the wound looks like,

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
it won't be long.

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Then let's take a step by step.

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Since your father came to ask about this,

38
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
it means that Mei Ying has already

39
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
replied to your father

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
according to our plan.

41
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I really underestimated Lin Jing.

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
This is really a good way

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
to kill people on the street.

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The disciple in front of me

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
humiliated Rong Hua in public.

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
He has already become

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
a serious target of Lin Jing.

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
He will be in trouble this time.

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
He took the City Leader's hand

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
and misled me.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
He not only avenged the old grudge,

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
but also gave Kong Zitang

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
a death sentence.

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I heard that

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
the City Leader went to the Holy Hall after seeing Mei Ying.

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What is the City Leader investigating?

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Why did he only go to see Rong Hua

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
after he finished looking for Mei Ying?

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
After Mei Ying was caught,

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
the City Leader interrogated her in person.

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We have no clue.

62
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
We must not act rashly.

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
We must not act rashly.

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
If we interrogate Mei Ying

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
at this point,

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm afraid that we will be

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
guilty and will show flaws.

68
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Pass on the message.

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Let all the disciples

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
of Kong Zitang contact each other today.

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
If anyone is not careful,

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I will not let the City Leader do it.

73
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I will not let him do it.

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And,

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
don't bother Mei Ying

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
again today.

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
We will think of another way

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
in a few days.

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm going to the Holy Hall.

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Miss Rong, you are late every day.

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I wonder if Lu Mu came to disturb you.

82
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It seems that the City Leader

83
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
has been very important to Lin Jing these days.

84
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I don't want an outsider

85
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
to walk around in Longyin City.

86
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What did you say?

87
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Anyway,

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I have done my best

89
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
to avoid the injury last time.

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm in Longyin City now.

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm at least a guest.

92
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The City Leader of Longyin City has a lot of fame.

93
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
How can he not know the way?

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What are you doing?

95
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Look at you.

96
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Your hands are frozen.

97
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The winter in Longyin City

98
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
is really colder than in Jiangnan.

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Leave me alone.

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What on earth are you doing?

101
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
When will you let go?

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I...

103
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm sorry.

104
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You just said

105
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
the winter in Longyin City is very cold.

106
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
But now you drag me to the wall.

107
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
What's the purpose?

108
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Longyin City is located in the north.

109
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The sky is vast.

110
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
When you enter the winter,

111
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
it's cold and cold.

112
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
There are no people.

113
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I really don't understand

114
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
why your father made a city here.

115
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Is it to train the mind

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
of the disciples of Longyin City?

117
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I chose this place

118
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
for Chihua Bead.

119
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Chihua Bead is cold.

120
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
If you don't live in a cold place,

121
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
you can't survive.

122
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Go.

123
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's strange.

124
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I rarely see your father

125
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
go out alone.

126
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I wonder what's wrong with Longyin City.

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I need you to go there in person.

128
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The City Master will leave the city

129
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
every year in winter.

130
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
He must have bought

131
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
good fox balls for Rong Hua.

132
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Rong Hua is in a cold season.

133
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The winter in Longyin City

134
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
is not good.

135
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But it's not easy to get fox balls.

136
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's not easy.

137
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Just ask someone to buy it.

138
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Why bother the City Master to go there in person?

139
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
The City Master never

140
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
takes care of Rong Hua.

141
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
If he wants to buy it in person,

142
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
who can stop him?

143
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Don't you want to see

144
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
what your father is hiding?

145
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Fox balls are not

146
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
to be bought every year.

147
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What?

148
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Are you afraid of being discovered

149
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
and afraid to go?

150
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You are not here

151
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
at all.

152
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But you are so curious

153
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
that

154
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
what Lin Jing sent you

155
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
to find out?

156
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You think too much.

157
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Whether it's Lin Jing's order or not,

158
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
you are not curious

159
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
what the medicine

160
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
your father sold to Hu Lu Ling.

161
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
The City Master is very cautious.

162
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Don't leak the information.

163
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Otherwise, you will bear

164
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
all the consequences.

165
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's my mother's game

166
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
to share the burden for Miss Rong Hua.

167
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Let's go.

168
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Go.

169
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Why are you like this?

170
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You don't know what to do.

171
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
We have worked so hard to save you.

172
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You don't know how to be grateful.

173
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I shouldn't have saved you.

174
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You are so talkative.

175
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Aunt.

176
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Hua Er.

177
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What's wrong with you?

178
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I've never seen you

179
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
so angry.

180
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Aunt,

181
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
are you here to see Mei Ying?

182
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I haven't been here

183
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
since the dark house.

184
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I don't know

185
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
how her poison is cured.

186
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Aunt.

187
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
She is not worth

188
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
your visit.

189
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
What's wrong with you?

190
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
She is so mean.

191
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
In order to save her,

192
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
we found the best medicine

193
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
and took good care of her.

194
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
After that,

195
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
she was so mean

196
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
and ungrateful.

197
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
We shouldn't have saved her.

198
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Enough.

199
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Why are you so angry?

200
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Her life is in your father's hands.

201
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
She doesn't dare to have children.

202
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Aunt.

203
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I think

204
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
we should stop her

205
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
before my father is here.

206
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
With your ability,

207
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
she will suffer.

208
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You little girl.

209
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You have taken revenge.

210
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I should be blamed

211
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
for that.

212
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Alright.

213
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Go with me to see her.

214
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
No.

215
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Aunt,

216
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
you didn't see her

217
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
so angry.

218
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's amazing.

219
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I won't go.

220
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Aunt.

221
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
She is not worth your visit.

222
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Let's go.

223
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Let's go.

224
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Go.

225
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Hurry.

226
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Be careful.

227
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Jingfeng is always careful.

228
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Any small changes in this room

229
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
can cause her attention.

230
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Stay away from her.

231
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You are the head of the Shaoge Hall.

232
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You are so determined

233
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
to find a cure.

234
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Lan Yu.

235
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You are hiding it well.

236
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
But you can't keep it from me.

237
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I won't bother you

238
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
with this.

239
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Now you are helping me

240
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
with the art of plum blossoms.

241
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You can still

242
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
make fun of others.

243
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Just wait a while.

244
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You are so generous.

245
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
How can you be sure

246
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
that I will help you?

247
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Before,

248
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Rong Hua gave you

249
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
the secret of your martial arts.

250
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Her purpose

251
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
is to help you.

252
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You should know it well.

253
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I was surprised

254
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
by your action.

255
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
But I didn't expect

256
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
that Miss Rong Hua would help you.

257
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
She really

258
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
loves you.

259
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Lan Yu.

260
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You have already let my sister down.

261
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Please don't let her down.

262
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It seems that Young Master Mei

263
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
is quite concerned

264
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
about our Young Master.

265
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
But I advise you

266
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
to save your mind.

267
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I won't give you any chance.

268
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I won't give you any chance.

269
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Did you really

270
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
find some clues?

271
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Where is the clue?

272
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
There is nothing.

273
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Nothing.

274
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
When the Chihua Pagoda is crowded,

275
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
you can help me

276
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
with your art of plum blossoms.

277
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
By then,

278
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
you will have a chance

279
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
to leave Longyin City.

280
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Leave?

281
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Where can I go?

282
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
With Rong Jingfeng's power,

283
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
killing me is easy.

284
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Is it possible that

285
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Lingxu Pavilion can protect me?

286
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Maybe,

287
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
as the leader of the Hall of Lin,

288
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I can enter Longyin City.

289
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Maybe,

290
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I can be the second headmaster

291
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
to be used by Rong Jingfeng.

292
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
As the leader of the Hall of Shao,

293
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
it's not difficult to do this.

294
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm here.

295
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You were sick a few days ago.

296
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You must be weak.

297
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's about to winter.

298
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You should be more careful.

299
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Don't worry, aunt.

300
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Now I have you to take care of me.

301
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm almost fed to death.

302
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
How can I be afraid of cold?

303
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You don't look like a good person.

304
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I didn't expect you to take care of me.

305
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You are so kind.

306
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Aunt, I'm sorry.

307
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I didn't mean to lie to you.

308
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Your face...

309
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Aunt, your pulse...

310
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm fine.

311
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
How can you be fine?

312
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You are surrounded by toxins.

313
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You are so addicted every day.

314
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
How can you be fine?

315
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I know what I should do.

316
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
No.

317
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Go back to my room now.

318
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
You are so hurt.

319
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
My father doesn't know it.

320
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Your father is busy all day.

321
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Why bother him?

322
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Master, come and see.

323
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
My aunt's body...

324
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Is it because of the toxins?

325
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I knew something would happen sooner or later.

326
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm going to kill them.

327
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Bai, I'm fine.

328
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You...

329
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Aunt, don't wait for my father.

330
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
He is the one who really treats you well.

331
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
He is right in front of you.

332
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You...

333
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
What are you talking about?

334
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Go.

335
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Go and see how to deal with it.

336
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Go.

337
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm going.

338
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Go.

339
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Bai, I'm fine.

340
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Go.

341
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
The tickets for the guests are free.

342
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Come and have a look.

343
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
The tickets for the guests are free.

344
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Come and have a look.

345
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
He has left.

346
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Who are you?

347
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Is my daughter all right?

348
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Don't worry.

349
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
We just borrowed a carriage from you.

350
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It won't hurt anyone.

351
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Mother.

352
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
This shop is specialized in leather and wool.

353
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I heard that the shop just came from the north.

354
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It sells all the leather goods in Shangcheng.

355
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Nothing special.

356
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Don't worry.

357
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
We'll leave when we get to the safe place.

358
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Let's go.

359
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Let's leave here first.

360
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I ordered my disciples to investigate the forest of the jade.

361
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
They found the jade.

362
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It seems that the person who took the antidote this time

363
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
is Xiao Xue Meng.

364
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I think so.

365
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Xiao Xue Meng took the antidote.

366
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Mo Huan has the antidote.

367
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
There are so many coincidences in the world.

368
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
But Mo Huan went to the Lingxu Pavilion to deliver the antidote this time.

369
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I owe him one.

370
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Mo Huan's whereabouts are uncertain.

371
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
No one can stop him in the Lingxu Pavilion.

372
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
If there is no countermeasure,

373
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I'm afraid he will be unfavorable to you.

374
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Not to mention the Lingxu Pavilion.

375
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm afraid no one can stop him in the world.

376
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
But this time, Xiao Xue Meng took the antidote.

377
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
He was exposed.

378
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
The person behind him who controlled it was exposed.

379
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
You mean that

380
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Mo Huan controlled the power of the Xiao Xue Meng?

381
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
This matter cannot be announced.

382
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Let alone tell Young Master.

383
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You send him a letter.

384
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Tell him that the antidote has been received.

385
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Tell him to forget about it.

386
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Yes.

387
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Besides, you go and arrange it.

388
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm going to Xiao Xue Meng.

389
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Mo Huan is in charge of the power of the Young Master.

390
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Why do you still want to find Shang Wen?

391
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
He can't move me now.

392
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Do as I say.

393
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Yes.

394
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
The North Wilderness.

395
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Besides the fur of the fox,

396
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
is there anything else special?

397
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
The North Wilderness.

398
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I heard from Master.

399
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
The Lingxu Pavilion was in the North Wilderness.

400
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
In order to expand their power,

401
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
they swept the Central Plains and Wulin all the way south.

402
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
They survived under such a difficult condition.

403
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It means that their will power is very strong.

404
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I think it's a good thing.

405
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It means that their will power is very strong.

406
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
No wonder.

407
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:56,440
As soon as the dragon

408
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
drink this medicine while it's hot.

409
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
By the way,

410
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
you can't be in a hurry to solve the medicine.

411
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You should drink some hot wine and warm up.

412
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
What's wrong?

413
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
There's something wrong with the wine.

414
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
The wine in the wine pot is fine.

415
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
But the wine in the wine cup is sour.

416
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Sour?

417
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It must be that you accidentally

418
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
got some powder on your hand.

419
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
It's not a big deal.

420
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It's just a little bit.

421
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
You got powder on your hand.

422
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
The powder fell into the cup.

423
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
What is it?

424
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It can change the taste of wine instantly.

425
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I know.

426
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's the ice crystal of the North Wilderness.

427
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Ice crystal?

428
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Ice crystal is the heart of the thousand-year ice.

429
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It grows in the northernmost coldness.

430
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You can only find it on the cliff.

431
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
The heart of the ice is not melted for a long time.

432
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It needs to be broken by the inner force

433
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
to be used.

434
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
No wonder Rong Jinfeng

435
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
has to stay in the hotel for a few days

436
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
after he's done with the antidote.

437
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It seems that this ice crystal

438
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
will cost a lot of inner force.

439
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Come on.

440
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Sit down and drink the medicine.

441
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I asked Lu Yi Zhou to open Rong Su.

442
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I didn't expect that he would find out

443
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
such a news without any warning.

444
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It seems that

445
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Rong Jinfeng always goes out

446
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
to buy

447
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
this ice crystal.

448
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
People always think that

449
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
the owner of Longyin City

450
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
is so powerful.

451
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
But in fact,

452
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
it's hard to say.

453
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Zi Yan always

454
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
makes poison.

455
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
He's a good man.

456
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Zi Yan always

457
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
makes poison.

458
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
He's addicted to it little by little

459
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
to hurt his heart.

460
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
But no matter who persuades him,

461
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
he insists on doing it to satisfy you.

462
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
And you?

463
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
You're sitting here

464
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
and ignoring it.

465
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Just because you're the City Leader,

466
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
can you let others down?

467
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Tell me clearly today

468
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
what you think.

469
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
What do you want to do

470
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
by dragging it like this?

471
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Wait!

472
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Bai,

473
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I'll send others

474
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
to take care of Zi Yan.

475
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Send others?

476
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Does Zi Yan need others?

477
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Sit down first

478
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
and calm down.

479
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Let's talk slowly.

480
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
How can I calm down?

481
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Rong Jinfeng, I tell you.

482
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
From now on,

483
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I won't let you see Zi Yan again.

484
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Oh, right.

485
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
When spring comes,

486
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I'll take it away.

487
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Then you'll be alone in Longyin City

488
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
for the rest of your life.

489
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Stop!

490
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
You're unreasonable.

491
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Where are you taking it?

492
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
What will it do if it leaves Longyin City?

493
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I tell you.

494
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
You're dragging Zi Yan like this

495
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
and you'll only get him into trouble.

496
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Besides,

497
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
you should know the rules of Longyin City.

498
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
If you want to leave Longyin City,

499
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
you know what the consequences are.

500
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I don't care about the rules.

501
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I, Bai, will do whatever I say.

502
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
You dare?

503
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I dare!

504
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Dad.

505
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Master,

506
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
is it useful to argue like this?

507
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
What's most important to me now

508
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
is to save his life.

509
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I'll take care of your aunt.

510
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
She'll be fine.

511
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Dad,

512
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
calm down first.

513
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I've done a lot for Longyin City

514
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
all these years.

515
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
You...

516
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
All right, Hua.

517
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Stop talking.

518
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I'm really tired.

519
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Dad,

520
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
are you really going to be so cold-blooded?

521
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I'm also sincere to you.

522
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
We all appreciate

523
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Master's kindness to me.

524
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
But you don't care about him at all.

525
00:24:46,000 --> 00:25:14,700
Your plan is not as

526
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,460
You...

527
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,580
Why are you so angry?

528
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,300
You're old.

529
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,140
Why are you still jealous of Rong Jinfeng?

530
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,460
I... I'm jealous of him.

531
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,980
You're still not jealous?

532
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,380
Look at you.

533
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,780
You've already talked to Rong Jinfeng.

534
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,060
Why don't you

535
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,140
treat Zi Yan nicely?

536
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,100
Don't care about who he is.

537
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,620
You've been

538
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,980
so kind to him

539
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,300
and so professional.

540
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,940
It's enough to impress him.

541
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,860
If I treat someone nicely,

542
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,540
I'll treat him with sincerity

543
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,940
and never take any revenge.

544
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,380
Rong Jinfeng is really

545
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,620
too hard-hearted.

546
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,900
I can't stand him.

547
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,500
Zi Yan

548
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,900
is trying to poison Xiao Hei Wu.

549
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,060
He's been poisoned so much

550
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,380
that he's so confused.

551
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,020
He...

552
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:08,860
He...

553
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,380
I've been by his side

554
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,340
and take care of him.

555
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,940
But Zi Yan...

556
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,220
Zi Yan is holding my clothes

557
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:27,180
and yelling at the City Leader.

558
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,380
Rong Jinfeng

559
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,420
doesn't even say a word.

560
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,020
Tell me.

561
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,020
What's going on?

562
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,100
I think

563
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,700
we should think

564
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,220
in many ways.

565
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,980
If that's the case,

566
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,380
I don't think you're at fault.

567
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,660
You...

568
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,740
You've grown up like this.

569
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,980
Zi Yan can still

570
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:57,980
take you as the City Leader.

571
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:01,740
It's so mysterious.

572
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,020
You're content with it.

573
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,420
What's the matter?

574
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,740
You're still talking nonsense.

575
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,540
I'm not.

576
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,540
What's the matter?

577
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,540
You're still talking nonsense.

578
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,460
I'm not talking nonsense.

579
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,980
Master, I really want you to be happy.

580
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,540
Men

581
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,180
should be generous.

582
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,580
Don't be too hard on them.

583
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,020
What's wrong with you again?

584
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,700
What are you upset at?

585
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,820
I'mpaid for my burned back infantry.

586
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,060
I'm not the congressman of the mountain,

587
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,940
I'm the Management Director.

588
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,500
No, you are.

589
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,620
All right.

590
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:47,580
Why are you

591
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,740
Really?

592
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,580
Give him some.

593
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,380
How many people in the world

594
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:21,980
know about this place?

595
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,620
I looked everywhere, but I couldn't find you.

596
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,220
I didn't expect you to come here.

597
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,780
Hua, why are you here?

598
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,740
It's too cold here.

599
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,740
Go back now.

600
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,460
I just walked here

601
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,980
and smelled a faint scent of plum.

602
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,420
But there's no plum tree here.

603
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,700
Why is there a scent of plum?

604
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,540
There are plum scents in all the walls around here.

605
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,340
It's made by the plum tree.

606
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,580
With the plum tree art,

607
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,660
it can mesmerize people.

608
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,540
In a few days,

609
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,340
the Chihua Bead will be completed.

610
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,700
If Mo Huan

611
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,420
makes the Chihua Bead

612
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,860
and we send more disciples to guard it,

613
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,300
it won't work.

614
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,220
The plum flower formation

615
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,900
may collapse for a while.

616
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,180
My father took care of the Chihua Bead

617
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,620
in person.

618
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,100
This time, he asked him to give the flower sea

619
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,460
to the Holy Grail Hall.

620
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,940
I guess it's not a good thing.

621
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:17,620
If I don't get the seed of the Chihua Bead this time,

622
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,260
I'm afraid it won't be easy

623
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,740
to get it in the future.

624
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,780
I think there's someone who can help us.

625
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,020
Who?

626
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:35,740
My aunt.

627
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,660
I can take this opportunity

628
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,020
to try my father's sincerity.

629
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,340
I don't believe

630
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,420
he hasn't had any feelings for my aunt

631
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,620
for so many years.

632
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,700
Your aunt?

633
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,300
Is it really okay?

634
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,900
There's no better way now.

635
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,980
Let's try it first.

636
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,100
If my aunt can give up,

637
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,020
it may be a good thing.

638
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,220
The Lord of the Lingxu Pavilion

639
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,020
is here.

640
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,340
I don't know why.

641
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,380
He's so young.

642
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,020
He could get the antidote from the Lingxu Pavilion.

643
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,140
He's really capable.

644
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,660
I'm afraid there's some misunderstanding.

645
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,180
Liuli doesn't know

646
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,460
that the Lord of the Lingxu Pavilion

647
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,300
is here.

648
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,860
I'm afraid he doesn't know

649
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,900
that the Lord of the Lingxu Pavilion

650
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,900
is here.

651
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,980
I don't know what's going on.

652
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,420
I'm afraid he doesn't know

653
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,580
that the Lord of the Lingxu Pavilion

654
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,660
is here.

655
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,740
It's okay if you don't admit it.

656
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,300
But this thing

657
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,580
fell into the hands of the disciples of the Lingxu Pavilion.

658
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,700
It's so careless.

659
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,900
Even if I don't blame you,

660
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,780
your master will discipline you.

661
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,700
With only a peony ball,

662
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,380
the Lord of the Lingxu Pavilion made a conclusion.

663
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,700
Who knows if this is

664
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,740
the reason why the Lingxu Pavilion

665
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,940
set up a trap.

666
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,860
Whether it's true or not,

667
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,860
you know it best.

668
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,820
I'm not here for this.

669
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,980
I'm here to see your master, Guan Buzhuo.

670
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,660
Let him come and talk to you.

671
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,020
Please wait, Lord.

672
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,220
It's been 20 years.

673
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,540
It's time to meet your master.

674
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,380
This is also a lesson for you.

675
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,260
In the martial arts world,

676
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,420
if there is any mistake,

677
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,380
it's a chance for the other party

678
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,100
to kill himself.

679
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,620
I know my mistake.

680
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,500
There will be no next time.

681
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,740
But the Lord of the Lingxu Pavilion

682
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,300
is waiting outside.

683
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,380
Should I invite him in

684
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,860
or...

685
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,420
I'll invite him in.

686
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,300
I'm sorry.

687
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,140
He's already at the gate.

688
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,820
How can we send him out?

689
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,060
He's here to talk to you.

690
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,940
What do you think we should do?

691
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,900
What can I do?

692
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,060
I can't avoid it.

693
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,220
Let him in.

694
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:42,540
Yes.

695
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,900
Next is your private matter.

696
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,620
I can't help you.

697
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,060
I...

698
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,220
My junior is really lucky.

699
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,220
He's always rough.

700
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,220
He must have found a good partner

701
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,820
to have this chance.

702
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,060
I'm sorry.

703
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:11,860
Madam,

704
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,100
after so many years,

705
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,940
will he meet you?

706
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:25,780
Master,

707
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,220
this way, please.

708
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,180
You can only go alone.

709
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,620
It's gonna be alright, Murong.

710
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,600
Are you sure you can elder brother

711
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,780
live with me forever?

712
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,620
You wait here.

713
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,400
You'll be fine here

714
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,300
to be together with me.

715
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,320
You've got my word.

716
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,280
Junior Brother.

717
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,580
When you and Na Lanxi

718
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,940
chose to betray the Lingxu Pavilion,

719
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:03,900
it should have been decided.

720
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,100
Because of our test,

721
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,660
I didn't want to betray the Spiritual Cult.

722
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,660
Because Rong Jingfeng was so bold to kill,

723
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,300
I had to be his enemy.

724
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,580
But no matter what happened,

725
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,860
no matter what my identity is,

726
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,900
you will always be my junior.

727
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,220
You won't change for anyone or anything.

728
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,620
Back then, Master

729
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,340
was strict with the rules and strict with the rules.

730
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,580
It was all because of you.

731
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,500
I never forget that.

732
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,660
You're here today

733
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,660
not for the sake of Xu Jiu, right?

734
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,340
Master's whereabouts are uncertain.

735
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,580
After he left in Lingxu Pavilion a few days ago,

736
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,660
he didn't tell me anything.

737
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,020
I came here

738
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:54,340
to ask you to help me.

739
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,020
Although I betrayed the sect

740
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,180
and left the house for many years,

741
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,860
I haven't been able to

742
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,980
take back the Chihua Bead seeds for so many years.

743
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,100
I'm disappointed in you.

744
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,260
I'm disappointed in you.

745
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,580
But Rong Jingfeng

746
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,580
betrayed the Spiritual Cult and hurt Master.

747
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,620
I can see it clearly.

748
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,380
I'm willing to help Master

749
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,020
destroy Longyin City in Lingxu Pavilion.

750
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,420
After the matter is settled,

751
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,060
no matter how Master punishes me,

752
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,780
I have no complaints.

753
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,300
Didn't you set up Lingxu Pavilion

754
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,340
to destroy Longyin City?

755
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,460
After the matter of Rong Jingfeng

756
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,580
is settled, Master needs to punish him personally.

757
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,380
I'm not as strong as before.

758
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,340
I can't risk my life to take the antidote every year.

759
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,420
That's why I asked Master to help me.

760
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,900
I'm willing to go back to Master

761
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,460
and help the Spiritual Cult to destroy Longyin City.

762
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:02,980
If Master

763
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,420
really wants to kill you,

764
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:05,900
what should you do?

765
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,700
If that's the case,

766
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,780
I can only beg you

767
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,620
to take care of my son, Nalan Yue.

768
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:18,900
Because in this world,

769
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,700
you're the only one I can entrust.

770
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,060
I hope you can keep me safe.

771
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,300
No matter what, you have to hold on.

772
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,060
The world is changing so fast.

773
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:32,780
Who can hold on?

774
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,740
The Chihua Bead is coming.

775
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,820
Stay at the entrance.

776
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,660
If anyone wants to break into the Qi,

777
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,140
just take them down.

778
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,780
I'll handle it myself.

779
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,500
City Leader, don't worry.

780
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,220
When the time comes,

781
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,460
Mei Ying will set up a formation outside with the art of plum blossoms.

782
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,420
Anyone who wants to enter

783
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,540
will be trapped inside.

784
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,580
How sure are you of the formation?

785
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,540
Everyone

786
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:13,220
is confident in their own control.

787
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,300
Mei Ying is in charge of the art of plum blossoms.

788
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,900
I can't keep it.

789
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,100
But City Leader, don't worry.

790
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,660
Even if there's no formation,

791
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,820
I've arranged everything.

792
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,180
Good.

793
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:33,460
What do you think of Mei Ying?

794
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,460
This is a piece of cake.

795
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,500
It depends on whether it works.

796
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,780
It also depends on whether the person who uses it can use it well.

797
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,700
Mei Ying has her own unique point of view.

798
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,020
But I suggest

799
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,220
not to keep her in the city.

800
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,260
Then how do you think

801
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,700
I should use her?

802
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,460
You can use her.

803
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:02,860
City Leader,

804
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,580
you can rebuild the Mei family.

805
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,300
If you can make Mei Ying go to Yun Ning,

806
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,460
she will be loyal to you.

807
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,820
The most skilled person in the Mei family

808
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,540
is the art of plum blossoms.

809
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,740
Let's see

810
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,740
if she works or not tonight.

811
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,380
Forgive me, City Leader.

812
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,700
I can't be your servant anymore.

813
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,660
I've been suffering from high fever for days.

814
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,140
This is not a way to go on.

815
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,060
Master.

816
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:51,900
Hua.

817
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,260
How is Aunt?

818
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,220
I'm wondering.

819
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,660
I've been taking medicine for days.

820
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,340
But I can't see any improvement.

821
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,740
It's worse.

822
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,020
Don't worry, Master.

823
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,140
Maybe the medicine is not right.

824
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,020
That's why her condition is worse.

825
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,220
What should we do?

826
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:09,820
This...

827
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,020
Why is Aunt's body

828
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,500
getting colder?

829
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,380
I'm afraid it won't last long.

830
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:24,980
This...

831
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,300
What if...

832
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:27,900
I...

833
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,100
No, I have to find your father.

834
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:29,820
No, no, no.

835
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:30,820
Master,

836
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,700
you should stay here with Aunt.

837
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,740
It's the time for the Chihua Bead to solidify.

838
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,780
Why don't you let me try it?

839
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:39,780
Yeah.

840
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,980
How could I forget?

841
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,820
Today, the Chihua Bead is open.

842
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,860
How could your father come here?

843
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:45,420
Then...

844
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,300
Then you go.

845
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,980
I'll leave Aunt to you.

846
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,460
In the world,

847
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:57,820
sometimes

848
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,460
they're just like mosquitoes and bugs,

849
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,540
Murderous funded options

850
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,380
come to a use

851
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,300
for all those who eagerly want it.

852
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,780
Only those

853
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,580
strong in the world

854
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,700
can survive.

855
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:22,460
That's why

856
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,340
they're relatively wary of me.

857
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,260
The poisonous insects

858
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,380
are the same.

859
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,100
That's why they risked their lives

860
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,500
to take the flower king of the Red Eye Lotus.

861
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,660
Only by working with the flower king,

862
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,060
can they survive.

863
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:44,860
Father!

864
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,500
Oh no!

865
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,020
Hua!

866
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:48,620
Huan'er!

867
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,340
Go and see auntie!

868
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,460
She's dying!

869
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,620
Today is the coldest day in Longyin City.

870
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:56,900
Why did you come here?

871
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,980
Are you still alive?

872
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,060
Go and see auntie!

873
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,260
She's dying!

874
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,100
What's wrong with your auntie?

875
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,420
She's unconscious.

876
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,860
She keeps calling out for her father.

877
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,660
All these years, she worked so hard

878
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,460
for her father

879
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,860
and Longyin City!

880
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:20,900
I know.

881
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,420
Do you really have to be so heartless?

882
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,460
If you really don't care,

883
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,900
just tell her yourself

884
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,260
and let her die.

885
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,780
What do you know about kids?

886
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,020
Stop talking nonsense.

887
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,060
Go back to your room.

888
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:39,540
Father!

889
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:43,020
Auntie's body is very toxic.

890
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,580
All the drugs can't save her.

891
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,620
Master said she'll die in an hour.

892
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:50,300
Now only father can save auntie in Longyin City.

893
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,140
Do you really have to be so heartless?

894
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:17,540
This...

895
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,300
This shouldn't be happening.

896
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,140
I made this prescription myself.

897
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,420
How can it be useless?

898
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,300
Is this...

899
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:24,660
Master.

900
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,060
Master.

901
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,140
Please save my master.

902
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:30,740
Qing Feng.

903
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:33,740
Qing Feng.

904
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:35,740
Zi Yan.

905
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,300
Qing Feng.

906
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,140
Zi Yan, I'm here.

907
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:44,740
Qing Feng.

908
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,420
Do I know how to treat you?

909
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,900
So it seems I care about you.

910
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,780
There's only one chance to draw the seed.

911
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:10,780
When Chihua harvest you,

912
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:11,940
do it now.

913
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,300
The moon is bright and the moon is bright

914
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:30,300
If the soul returns, the candle will light up the night

915
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:38,300
The moon is bright and the moon is bright

916
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:47,300
Even if it's far away, it's okay to miss it

917
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:55,300
The trees and trees are just the shadow of the years

918
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:05,300
I'm willing to sing and dance, and sing with my heart

919
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:11,300
Who will tell me that I love you so much

920
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:16,300
Even if I have to sacrifice my life for you

921
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:20,300
I will not stop until the end of the world

922
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:26,300
If love is not a dream, a smile, and a promise

923
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:29,300
I will love you until I die

924
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:33,300
I will wait for the years to come before I can take it

925
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,300
I will not regret it even if I have to die

926
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,300
I will always remember you

927
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:47,300
The Moon is Bright and the Moon is Bright
