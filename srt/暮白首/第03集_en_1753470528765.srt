1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We are in love

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
A moment of flowers, a moment of spring

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I never notice you

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You don't understand

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
How much love I have

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I look at the flowers with my eyes

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Looking for the answer, to have it by my side

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I am a grabber at the same time

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,640
In见定

10
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,340
恋人爱画

11
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,600
弹缘轻松玩

12
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,680
为定成宝

13
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,680
为 愿一场花摺

14
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,680
The King's Avatar

15
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,680
Episode 16

16
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,680
As long as you take the antidote with white flowers,

17
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,680
the toxicity in your body

18
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,680
can be guaranteed for years.

19
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,680
Naturally,

20
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,680
the feeling of being greedy and alive

21
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,680
is not a big deal.

22
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,680
But what if I can't take the antidote on time?

23
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,680
The person who took the red flower pearl

24
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,680
has been recorded in the Dragon Silver City's Confucius Hall.

25
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,680
If it is poisoned in the future,

26
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,680
Dragon Silver City will send its disciples

27
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,680
to kill it and get it back.

28
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,680
This is the most secret secret of Dragon Silver City.

29
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,680
It is also the most important secret

30
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,680
that I and Rong Jingfeng care about.

31
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,680
Now the red flower pearl is in a mess.

32
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,680
First, it was stolen,

33
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,680
and then it was destroyed

34
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,680
under the eyes of the Dragon Silver City.

35
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,680
So the Confucius Hall sent its disciples

36
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,680
to come here not for nothing.

37
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,680
Do they suspect

38
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,680
that the red flower pearl is in the hands of our Lingxu Pavilion?

39
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,680
If the Dragon Silver City really has a chance to learn,

40
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,680
they should know that

41
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,680
the red flower pearl was not taken by Lingxu Pavilion.

42
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,680
Even if it appears in Lingxu Pavilion,

43
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,680
the murderer is someone else.

44
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,680
But it's just a gift for the owner of the Pavilion.

45
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,680
It's because it's not in the hands of the Dragon Silver City that I feel strange.

46
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,680
It seems that we have underestimated Rong Jingfeng.

47
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,680
He is more filial and virtuous than we thought.

48
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,680
It's a pity that the murderer we sent out last time

49
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,680
couldn't bring Rong Hua back to the lake.

50
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,680
We exchanged the red flower pearl for her daughter's life

51
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,680
to stop her from continuing to destroy the evil world.

52
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,680
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,680
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,680
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,680
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,680
I'm sorry.

57
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,680
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,680
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,680
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,680
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,680
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,680
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,680
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,680
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,680
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,680
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,680
You brat.

68
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,680
You're much cuter in silence

69
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,680
than you usually are.

70
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,680
You're awake.

71
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,680
You're sleeping soundly.

72
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,680
I won't disturb you.

73
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,680
You've been sleeping all night.

74
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,680
Yes.

75
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,680
I don't know how to sleep.

76
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,680
How can I sleep?

77
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,680
You're finally better.

78
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,680
If you don't get better,

79
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,680
I'm going to send you back to the Dragon Silver City.

80
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,680
You're lucky that you didn't send me back.

81
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,680
Otherwise, my father would misunderstand you again.

82
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,680
You're worried about me.

83
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,680
Mu...

84
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,680
Where's Mu Yan?

85
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,680
Why did you see him?

86
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,680
Mu Yan went to the mountain to pick herbs this morning.

87
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,680
He'll be back around dusk.

88
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,680
But he made a special order when he went out.

89
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,680
You must use those herbs to make wine on time.

90
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,680
Then it won't be a big deal.

91
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,680
Did he see your wound?

92
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,680
My wound is fine.

93
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,680
By the way,

94
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,680
the people on the mountain yesterday

95
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,680
obviously came for the Dragon Silver City.

96
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,680
Do you know who they are?

97
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,680
How dare they go against the Dragon Silver City?

98
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,680
I wonder if the people on the lake and the people on the lake

99
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,680
are the same people.

100
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,680
How can they be the same people?

101
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,680
Why are you so sure?

102
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,680
They...

103
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,680
Their martial arts are different.

104
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,680
You can't tell?

105
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,680
I can't tell.

106
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,680
Little rabbit,

107
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,680
I know you can't practice your inner skills because of your cold.

108
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,680
So I studied it.

109
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,680
I made a special set of martial arts for you.

110
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,680
So you can protect yourself when I'm not around you.

111
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,680
Really?

112
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,680
Of course.

113
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,680
I'm always a man of my word.

114
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,680
Thank you, Master.

115
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,680
Have you been captivated by my charm?

116
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,680
Yes.

117
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,680
Don't pinch my face.

118
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,680
My face is precious.

119
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,680
Pinch it again.

120
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,680
Let me pinch it again.

121
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,680
I said I can't.

122
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,680
Why is it like this?

123
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,680
Okay.

124
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,680
Hurry up.

125
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,680
Let me pinch it.

126
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,680
Okay.

127
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,680
Don't be afraid.

128
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,680
Pinch it again.

129
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,680
Pinch it again.

130
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,680
One last time.

131
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,680
Pinch it again.

132
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,680
How is it?

133
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,680
It's a good match.

134
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,680
Is it good?

135
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,680
I...

136
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,680
Master.

137
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,680
Master.

138
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,680
You girl.

139
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,680
You...

140
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,680
You...

141
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,680
You...

142
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,680
What are you doing?

143
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,680
How can you be a master?

144
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,680
I've only been away from Longning City for one day.

145
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,680
And you let my little rabbit go far away?

146
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,680
Impossible.

147
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,680
I saw her grow up.

148
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,680
I'm the one who loves her the most.

149
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,680
If I were her,

150
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,680
how could I see her in danger?

151
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,680
You love her the most.

152
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,680
Do you know that

153
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,680
Rong Hua committed a crime yesterday

154
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,680
and was hunted down by someone?

155
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,680
Girl.

156
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,680
What happened?

157
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,680
Why is the rescue resumed?

158
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,680
Master.

159
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,680
Don't worry.

160
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,680
I'm fine now.

161
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,680
I just don't know

162
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,680
what's going on in Longning City.

163
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,680
I'm afraid this time,

164
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,680
the City Leader won't let Lin Jing go easily.

165
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,680
Brother.

166
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,680
Have you figured out

167
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,680
the background of those killers?

168
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,680
They came from a great distance.

169
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,680
I didn't expect that

170
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,680
Lingjiao had been a master for many years.

171
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,680
And he could return to his wife.

172
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,680
I think Rong Jingfeng has found out the murderer.

173
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,680
He has also figured out the background.

174
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,680
He must know

175
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,680
that the murderer came from Lingjiao.

176
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,680
If that's the case,

177
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,680
the person who led me and Rong Hua out of the city

178
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,680
is also from Lingjiao?

179
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,680
Rong Su took his disciples from Kong Si Hall

180
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,680
to search for people in the city.

181
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,680
That will surely lower the guard

182
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,680
of Longning City.

183
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,680
What are their purpose?

184
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,680
The second sister of Rong family was attacked.

185
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,680
Master Xue died in Longning City.

186
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,680
Chihua Bead was destroyed.

187
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,680
No one noticed the body was carved on the city gate.

188
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,680
I think Lingjiao must have prepared

189
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,680
to do this.

190
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,680
Rong Jingfeng won't give up easily.

191
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,680
It's done by Lingjiao.

192
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,680
I can't stand by and watch.

193
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,680
We are born in the martial arts world.

194
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,680
We have to shoulder the burden.

195
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,680
Brother, thank you for your medicine.

196
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,680
I have something to do. I'll go first.

197
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,680
Wait.

198
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,680
Come back.

199
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,680
Rong Jingfeng is suspicious of you.

200
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,680
He even claims that you killed Master Xue.

201
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,680
Do you still want to go back to Longning City?

202
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,680
Since he insisted on killing me,

203
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,680
I'd rather run away than run away.

204
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,680
He'd better prove himself.

205
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,680
Besides,

206
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,680
this was done by Lingjiao.

207
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,680
It's not a small matter.

208
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,680
How can I just sit and watch?

209
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,680
Where is the way out, where do you run to?

210
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,680
When you go back,

211
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,680
you really have to let Madam have a good look.

212
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,680
Are you born to be a killer?

213
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,680
Brother.

214
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,680
Greetings, father.

215
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,680
He's got oil powder in his house.

216
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,680
How can he be safe?

217
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,680
All right.

218
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,680
It's good that Tian'an is back.

219
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,680
Brother.

220
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,680
What's wrong with you?

221
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,680
I'm begging you to take back your order.

222
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,680
Ling Jing is definitely not the murderer who killed Master Xue.

223
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,680
We can't order him to be killed.

224
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,680
What are you doing?

225
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,680
Say it properly. Get up, get up, hurry up.

226
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,680
You said this...

227
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,680
Hua'er,

228
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,680
this kind of thing is not your turn to interrupt.

229
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,680
Now in our Longyun City,

230
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,680
there is only one outsider named Lin Jing.

231
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,680
After Master Xue was killed,

232
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,680
he went out of the city and disappeared.

233
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,680
He's not the biggest suspect. Who is?

234
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,680
You said Lin Jing was the murderer.

235
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,680
What about the evidence?

236
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,680
What is the motive of his murder?

237
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,680
You're asking a strange question.

238
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,680
He's a murderer.

239
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,680
Of course he has his purpose and motive.

240
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,680
Father is now going to order him to be caught.

241
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,680
Isn't it just to ask what his motive is?

242
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,680
What is it exactly?

243
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,680
Girl, since you haven't found out yet,

244
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,680
it means there is no conclusion yet.

245
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,680
Believe your father, he will decide.

246
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,680
If you haven't found out the truth,

247
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,680
don't make any conclusions.

248
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,680
He's definitely not the murderer.

249
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,680
Enough.

250
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,680
I have my own conclusion on this matter.

251
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,680
You keep yourself in check first.

252
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,680
When you become the Hall Leader in the future,

253
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,680
you'll be involved in Longyin City.

254
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,680
You're already so old.

255
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,680
You're always playing around.

256
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,680
Do you know that

257
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,680
your sister is going to find you

258
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,680
so that the murderer can take advantage of it?

259
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,680
You're still not repenting and making trouble here.

260
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,680
Go back.

261
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,680
I'll send you to the house for three days.

262
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,680
You can't go out without my order.

263
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,680
Father,

264
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,680
it doesn't matter how long you're going to keep me in check.

265
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,680
But I still beg you

266
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,680
to withdraw the order to go after the murderer.

267
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,680
Little girl,

268
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,680
stop talking.

269
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,680
What's wrong, Si Yan?

270
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,680
Your Majesty,

271
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,680
Lin Jing rushed back to Longyin City alone.

272
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,680
Now the City Gate is surrounded by the disciples of Kongzi Hall.

273
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,680
Please decide

274
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,680
how to deal with it.

275
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,680
He really dares to come back.

276
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,680
Little girl.

277
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,680
Hua, stop.

278
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,680
Where are you going?

279
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,680
Come back.

280
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,680
Tell me.

281
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,680
I just want to go inside

282
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,680
and tell you.

283
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,680
Why are you doing this?

284
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,680
Why?

285
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,680
City Master has ordered

286
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,680
that Lin Jing will be arrested

287
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,680
regardless of death or life.

288
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,680
Stop.

289
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,680
Second Miss.

290
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,680
They don't let me in.

291
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,680
Why are you back?

292
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,680
I'm worried about your safety.

293
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,680
Bai can't even protect himself.

294
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,680
How can he protect you?

295
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,680
You'd better go.

296
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,680
The farther you go, the better.

297
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,680
I've thought about it.

298
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,680
From now on,

299
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,680
I don't want to be a coward anymore.

300
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,680
I'll go in

301
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,680
and prove my innocence.

302
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,680
Why are you so stubborn?

303
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,680
My father doesn't care about your innocence.

304
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,680
You'd better go.

305
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,680
Hurry up.

306
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,680
What's going on?

307
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,680
Father.

308
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,680
Father.

309
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,680
If you insist on investigating this,

310
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,680
I can prove Lin Jing's innocence.

311
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,680
You're a girl.

312
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,680
What can you prove?

313
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,680
Go back to the city.

314
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,680
I was worried about the crime yesterday.

315
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,680
Lin Jing saved me.

316
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,680
I'm fine

317
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,680
after taking care of me all night.

318
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,680
What did you say?

319
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,680
You and this brat last night.

320
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,680
That's right.

321
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,680
When the master was killed,

322
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,680
I was with him.

323
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,680
Bai.

324
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,680
You're ridiculous.

325
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,680
You disappeared for a day and a night.

326
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,680
You didn't dare to go home

327
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,680
because you were afraid that the cold memory would be exposed.

328
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,680
I haven't been a criminal for many years.

329
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,680
I got sick suddenly yesterday.

330
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,680
Don't you know that?

331
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,680
Before I left,

332
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,680
I asked Xiaoxiao to put away the teacup you prepared for me.

333
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,680
I found that there was oil powder in it.

334
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,680
Is this a coincidence?

335
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,680
When the master was killed,

336
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,680
the city was under surveillance.

337
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,680
Everything

338
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,680
needs to be asked by my sister.

339
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,680
Su'er.

340
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,680
Is that true?

341
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,680
Whether there is a problem with the tea

342
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,680
can be checked by my father.

343
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,680
I've been trying to fight for something.

344
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,680
But my sister has been pushing me.

345
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,680
If I don't resist,

346
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,680
I don't think I'll be alive.

347
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,680
Since my sister likes to compare,

348
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,680
I'll go with her.

349
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,680
Longyin City is in danger now.

350
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,680
You two

351
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,680
are still so ignorant.

352
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,680
Now the crisis is everywhere.

353
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,680
The enemies are all in the dark.

354
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,680
We can't mess up.

355
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,680
Father.

356
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,680
I believe Lin Qing.

357
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,680
He can protect Longyin City.

358
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,680
I'll go with you.

359
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,680
Ziyan.

360
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,680
You must find out

361
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,680
Hua'er's poisoning.

362
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,680
Yes.

363
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,680
Go back to the city.

364
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,680
Let's go back.

365
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,680
Rong Hua.

366
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,680
There is indeed

367
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,680
oil powder in this cup of tea.

368
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,680
But it's not heavy.

369
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,680
It didn't poison Hua'er.

370
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,680
But these oil powders

371
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,680
are enough to make him sick.

372
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,680
How can that be?

373
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,680
Master.

374
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,680
This medicine is hard to find.

375
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,680
There was some left in the Holy Weapon Hall.

376
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,680
I checked the records.

377
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,680
The oil powder of the Holy Weapon Hall

378
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,680
was all stolen

379
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,680
two days ago.

380
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,680
But I didn't find anything.

381
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,680
I'll go back.

382
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,680
Go.

383
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,680
Longyin City

384
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,680
should be well organized.

385
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,680
I'm not dead yet.

386
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,680
Just sitting under my nose like this.

387
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,680
It's ridiculous.

388
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,680
It's been a long time.

389
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,680
It's time to find another leader.

390
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,680
Master has been busy all day.

391
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,680
There must be something missing.

392
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,680
Bai is right.

393
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,680
Ziyan.

394
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,680
You just keep on arranging.

395
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,680
In a few days, we'll start

396
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,680
to select the leader.

397
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,680
Yes.

398
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,680
Remember.

399
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,680
You have to tell everyone

400
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,680
that as long as it's the people of Longyin City,

401
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,680
they are all qualified to participate.

402
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,680
Okay.

403
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,680
The leader of Holy Weapon Hall?

404
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,680
Sounds interesting.

405
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,680
I'm also qualified.

406
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,680
Lian Jing.

407
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,680
Don't think

408
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,680
that you and Master Xue's death

409
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,680
can be forgotten here.

410
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,680
You want to participate in the Hall Leader Competition.

411
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,680
At least, you should be

412
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,680
a member of Longyin City.

413
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,680
City Leader.

414
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,680
Just tell me

415
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,680
what you want.

416
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,680
Okay.

417
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,680
Ziyan, did you hear that?

418
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,680
Lian Jing

419
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,680
wants to join Longyin City.

420
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,680
You can handle it.

421
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,680
Remember.

422
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,680
You have to take it seriously.

423
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,680
Yes.

424
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,680
Are you still mad at me?

425
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,680
I don't dare to.

426
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,680
You don't dare to?

427
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,680
If there's nothing else,

428
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,680
we'll go.

429
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,680
See you.

430
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,680
What are you doing here?

431
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,680
Are you trying to make fun of me?

432
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,680
The little fish said

433
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,680
I can't go to the Hall Leader Competition.

434
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,680
I can't go.

435
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,680
But I can't go.

436
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,680
I'll go with you.

437
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,680
I'll go with you.

438
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,680
I'll go with you.

439
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,680
I'll go with you.

440
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,680
I'll go with you.

441
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,680
I'll go with you.

442
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,680
I'll go with you.

443
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,680
I'll go with you.

444
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,680
I heard that your wound hasn't healed yet.

445
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:29,740
Although you're in the

446
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,680
I can't do it.

447
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,680
If father sees us fighting,

448
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,680
will he be happy?

449
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,680
In your heart,

450
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,680
I'm really a person

451
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,680
who doesn't care about your life

452
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,680
for the sake of the whole world.

453
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,680
Sister thinks that leaving me a life

454
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,680
is a wish.

455
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,680
But in my eyes,

456
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,680
if the real family

457
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,680
needs me to exchange my life

458
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,680
for the happiness of the family,

459
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,680
I'm willing to do it.

460
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,680
Today is different from the past.

461
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,680
I can give you

462
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,680
what you wanted

463
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,680
in your previous position.

464
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,680
But now,

465
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,680
I will never give it to you.

466
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,680
I didn't know what you cared about before.

467
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,680
It's like you don't care about anything

468
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,680
except for playing.

469
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,680
But now,

470
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,680
you want to fight with me

471
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,680
for Lin Jing.

472
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,680
That's because you don't want to

473
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,680
and you forced me.

474
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,680
Rong Hua.

475
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,680
You forced me.

476
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,680
How do you feel?

477
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,680
I feel better.

478
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,680
By the way, Lin Qing.

479
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,680
I came here to tell you

480
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,680
that you must take the position

481
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,680
of Hall Leader of the Holy-Bodhism.

482
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,680
You're willing to

483
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,680
let me take the position?

484
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,680
I'm not.

485
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,680
I'm not.

486
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,680
I'm not.

487
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,680
I'm not.

488
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,680
I'm not.

489
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,680
I'm not.

490
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,680
I'm not.

491
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,680
You want me to be

492
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,680
the victim of the competition between you and your sister?

493
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,680
Of course not.

494
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,680
Since you came to Longyin City,

495
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,680
you must choose your own formation.

496
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,680
You were formed

497
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,680
because of me.

498
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,680
I also want to help you

499
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,680
to expand your formation.

500
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,680
By the way,

501
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,680
did Mu Yan teach you

502
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,680
how to make the acupuncture just now?

503
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,680
Yes.

504
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,680
Thanks to Mu Yan's preparation in advance.

505
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,680
He also crushed some herbs

506
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,680
and made a medicine bag

507
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,680
that you used every day.

508
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,680
Wait a minute.

509
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,680
You must use it every day.

510
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,680
Don't forget it.

511
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,680
Did Mu Yan make this medicine bag?

512
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,680
Did he make it himself?

513
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,680
Yes.

514
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,680
He left.

515
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,680
No.

516
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,680
This acupuncture needle

517
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,680
is different from what Mu Yan used to use.

518
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,680
And the formula of this medicine bag

519
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,680
was also not made by Mu Yan.

520
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,680
Mu Yan is good at external injuries.

521
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,680
My cold disease

522
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,680
can't be suppressed so quickly

523
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,680
even if a doctor with a good medical skill.

524
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,680
Especially Mu Yan.

525
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,680
From yesterday to now,

526
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,680
I haven't seen him.

527
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,680
Could it be...

528
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,680
So you suspect

529
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,680
that Mu Yan is suspicious?

530
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,680
Is the person you saw

531
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,680
really Mu Yan?

532
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,680
Help!

533
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,680
Help!

534
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,680
Help!

535
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,680
Help!

536
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,680
Here.

537
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,680
Okay.

538
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,680
Miss, take care.

539
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,680
He's so good at dealing with people.

540
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,680
I'll save the culture later.

541
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,680
The Chengpu Army of Longsu

542
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,680
is falling into the trap.

543
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,680
Be careful.

544
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,680
You are in the market.

545
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,680
You followed this girl here.

546
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,680
What's the purpose?

547
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,680
This gentleman is talking to you.

548
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,680
Say it.

549
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,680
What's the purpose?

550
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,680
You don't want to say it?

551
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,680
I'm not afraid.

552
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,680
Mister.

553
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,680
Thank you for stopping the scoundrel.

554
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,680
Protect me.

555
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,680
You just do it.

556
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,680
No need to do it.

557
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,680
You must have no experiences in the martial arts world.

558
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,680
Remember.

559
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,680
Money cannot be stolen.

560
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,680
When I saw you

561
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,680
buying paper money,

562
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,680
I was sure that you

563
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,680
were spoiled by your parents.

564
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,680
I'm so sorry.

565
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,120
You're really

566
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,280
a wicked woman.

567
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,040
Where do you live?

568
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,640
I'll send you home.

569
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,680
Send me home?

570
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,480
Okay.

571
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:07,920
This way.

572
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,840
Let's go.

573
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,920
This way.

574
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,200
Why are you circling around?

575
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,200
Yes.

576
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:27,920
It's big.

577
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,560
So close.

578
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,000
I didn't expect you to be from Longyin City.

579
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,040
What?

580
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,200
You know people from Longyin City?

581
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,880
Is the lady in Longyin City

582
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,960
always that kind of person?

583
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,280
Lady Rong?

584
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,200
She's always like that since she was a kid.

585
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,680
So she suffered a lot.

586
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,400
Are you close to her?

587
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,120
Otherwise,

588
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,480
how do you know she's from the past?

589
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,480
I'm happy to meet you today.

590
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,800
But I think

591
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,920
you're not interested in Lady Rong.

592
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,320
Why don't you come in and have a seat with me?

593
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,240
She has many things to tell you.

594
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,680
Anyway, in this world,

595
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,360
no one knows her better than me.

596
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,040
No.

597
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,960
Since I've sent you here safely,

598
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,440
I'll go now.

599
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,520
Wait.

600
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,120
I just remembered

601
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,480
I have something to do in the market.

602
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,760
Go and tell my family.

603
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,840
I'll be back soon.

604
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,240
Why is it you?

605
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,320
I'm asking you.

606
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,720
Where's Mu Yan?

607
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,720
Mu Yan?

608
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,000
Is she the lady who brought me in just now?

609
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,840
Where is she now?

610
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,760
Didn't you go back to Longyin City?

611
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,840
Why did you set up an ambush here?

612
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,120
You two are not friends?

613
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,120
You're not friends?

614
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,120
You're not friends?

615
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,120
You're not friends?

616
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,120
You're not friends?

617
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,120
You're not friends?

618
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,400
Are you two going to deal with

619
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,120
a girl with no strength?

620
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,640
We're not going to deal with a girl on purpose.

621
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,840
But Mu Yan is fake.

622
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,680
weak stainless steel

623
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:11,880
Can you

624
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,240
come down with that kite?

625
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,000
But his appearance and age

626
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,960
are a bit out of line with what you said.

627
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,320
Who is he?

628
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,520
This time, he's hiding himself.

629
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,400
I think he's a sister.

630
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,800
This person

631
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,360
saved Rong Hua

632
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,680
and healed my wounds.

633
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,600
He's not hostile to us at all.

634
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,280
If that's the case,

635
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,720
why did he hide his real identity?

636
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,800
What about his identity?

637
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,960
I sent my disciples

638
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,320
but they didn't get any news.

639
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,320
It seems that the real Mu Yan

640
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,640
has been exposed.

641
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,240
Something's wrong.

642
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,000
I have to tell my father

643
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,560
to be prepared.

644
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,480
I hope I'm thinking too much.

645
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,360
Usually,

646
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,200
everything is

647
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,560
good and bad.

648
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,720
Bad and good.

649
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,960
Please.

650
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,240
Please open your mouth.

651
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,200
I have something to do.

652
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,560
I'll leave now.

653
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,040
It's strange.

654
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,120
He usually wants to

655
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,440
kidnap you and marry you.

656
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,640
But today,

657
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,080
he left you here

658
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,000
and ran away.

659
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,640
He

660
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,200
is in a hurry

661
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,960
to make friends.

662
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,680
Friends?

663
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,920
What friends do you have here?

664
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,560
Of course, in his heart,

665
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,840
he has a special friend

666
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,560
to him.

667
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,720
Special?

668
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,680
So?

669
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,360
Have you decided to give up?

670
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,480
No.

671
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,760
How ridiculous!

672
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:10,760
Lu Yi Zhou,

673
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,880
you came here

674
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,240
just to play tricks on me, right?

675
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,680
Of course not.

676
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,480
I'm born with something in my heart.

677
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,640
I can't be at ease

678
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,800
if I don't ask.

679
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,600
I'm afraid that one day,

680
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,560
I'll feel bad

681
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,560
if I keep it in my heart for too long.

682
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,840
What do you want to ask?

683
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,440
It's a big matter.

684
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,640
I hope Miss Rong can tell the truth.

685
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,120
Just ask.

686
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,040
What are you pretending?

687
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,040
Get on the car.

688
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,360
Just tell me the truth.

689
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,200
Don't hide it.

690
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,560
The disciples in the city

691
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,640
found Mu Yan's body.

692
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,200
After the investigation of the sick child,

693
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,880
he died for at least three days.

694
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,480
How is that possible?

695
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,280
Rong Hua said that

696
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,120
he was afraid of a cold.

697
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,200
Mu Yan was also there.

698
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,000
Xuan Ye also thinks that something is wrong.

699
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,600
Please go to him.

700
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,760
Miss Ning,

701
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,520
I haven't finished yet.

702
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:02,880
Mr. Lu,

703
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,760
you have something to do.

704
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,040
Please be careful.

705
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,960
You go ahead.

706
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:10,920
I'll be right back.

707
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,120
Yes.

708
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,800
What do you want to ask?

709
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,320
It's not your usual way

710
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,000
to do things.

711
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,240
May I ask if Miss Rong

712
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,480
knows a girl?

713
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,280
She is beautiful,

714
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,240
and she is smart.

715
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,320
She even has a innocent smile on her face.

716
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,760
I'll go to her.

717
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,600
Lin Jing told me

718
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,560
that this girl is pretending to be Mu Yan

719
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,240
and the second Miss Rong who saved Han Ji

720
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,200
from the cold.

721
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,640
Later, I met her on the street.

722
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,420
In the

723
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,800
I accidentally found out that

724
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,680
she is very familiar with you.

725
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,160
What else did she say to you?

726
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,480
You...

727
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,280
You are afraid.

728
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,000
Don't worry.

729
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,960
What do you mean?

730
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,480
I just want to care about you.

731
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,720
But if you have any difficulties,

732
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,200
I won't ask anymore.

733
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,680
You go.

734
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,760
Are you okay?

735
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,880
I don't care what you hear.

736
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,440
If you dare to reveal anything,

737
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,640
I'll kill you myself.

738
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,160
Wait.

739
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,600
Miss Rong.

740
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,280
I really want to help you.

741
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,200
No one can help me

742
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,400
in this world.

743
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,120
Longyin City.

744
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,200
Since the founding of the city,

745
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,240
12 Chihua Beads have been sent out.

746
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,240
From the north to the snow forest,

747
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,560
and from the south to the Jiangdong.

748
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,480
Those who accept Chihua Beads

749
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,800
will be protected.

750
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,480
All these years,

751
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,760
Longyin City

752
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,960
has been the leader of the world.

753
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,360
No one has ever provoked

754
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,640
the leader of the world.

755
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,440
No one has ever provoked

756
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,520
the leader of the world.

757
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,680
No one has ever provoked

758
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,920
the leader of the world.

759
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,560
But now,

760
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,040
someone has killed

761
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,680
the leader of the world.

762
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,200
The purpose behind this

763
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,040
is not easy to understand.

764
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,280
This person not only has no feelings for Chihua Beads,

765
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,520
but also knows how to destroy it.

766
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,000
It is

767
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,960
him?

768
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:22,760
Miss Rong.

769
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,240
Do you recognize a maiden

770
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,480
with figures

771
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,080
andiğ conservative supply for you?

772
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,600
Does she look

773
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,840
sosliently innocent withAR?

774
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,520
Why would she be so afraid of that girl who is pretending to be Mu Yan?

775
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,520
With her temperament,

776
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,520
and her martial arts.

777
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,520
What?

778
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,520
No way.

779
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,520
You're not a girl.

780
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,520
You're hiding a dagger under the pillow.

781
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,520
Now Longyin City is in danger.

782
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,520
I don't know what to do.

783
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,520
Why don't you prepare yourself?

784
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,520
You...

785
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,520
What?

786
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,520
You've figured it out and you're going to get married?

787
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,520
You...

788
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,520
Miss Mei is a noble lady.

789
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,520
She's one of the four famous families in Jiangnan.

790
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,520
She's a good match for you.

791
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,520
Besides,

792
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,520
there's no room for her to get married.

793
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,520
Are you done?

794
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,520
Go back with me.

795
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,520
You're so rude.

796
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,520
Brother, come with me.

797
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,520
Where are you going?

798
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,520
It's late at night.

799
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,520
You're still so sneaky.

800
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,520
It's not a good thing.

801
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,520
Are you afraid that I'll do something to you at night?

802
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,520
You're thinking too much.

803
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,520
Go, go, go.

804
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,520
Hurry up.

805
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,520
Here.

806
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,520
Here.

807
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,520
Here.

808
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,520
Found it, found it.

809
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,520
It's this, it's this.

810
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,520
How can you be so sure

811
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,520
that Kong Zitang is a spy?

812
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,520
I've been observing Kong Zitang

813
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,520
for a long time.

814
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,520
This paper

815
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,520
records the names of all the people

816
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,840
bullies, kepters

817
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,400
and even the time that they took.

818
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,820
Why does he need only one person?

819
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,780
About the paperise,

820
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,480
anyone who dies

821
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,160
isn't your senior one.

822
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,020
I don't think

823
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:13,000
there is a big story behind this.

824
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,280
Lin Qing.

825
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,760
Is there anything

826
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,920
that is hiding me a secret?

827
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,520
Go, go, go.

828
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,520
Rong Hua?

829
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,520
Why would she come here at night?

830
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,520
It's her.

831
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,520
My little rabbit is really smart.

832
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,520
He's going with me.

833
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,520
Rong Hua.

834
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,520
Rong Hua.

835
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,520
Lin Jian!

836
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,520
Be careful!

837
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,520
Don't change your ways.

838
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,520
Everyone, kneel.

839
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,520
Are you okay?

840
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,520
How could you risk your life

841
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,520
to disguise as the little master and show yourself as the murderer?

842
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,520
I'm fine.

843
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,520
Go back quickly.

844
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,520
Why didn't you let me in?

845
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,520
This is the City Leader's order.

846
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,520
I can't explain it.

847
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,520
Rong Su, why don't you wait outside?

848
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,520
But Lin Jian and Rong Hua broke into the Confucius Hall at night

849
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,520
and didn't get any punishment.

850
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,520
The rules of Longyin City are so strict.

851
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,520
I've done everything I could.

852
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,520
Why did you have to go in there and ask the City Leader?

853
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,520
Rong Su,

854
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,520
I won't repeat what you said.

855
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,520
If you go one more step,

856
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,520
don't blame me for not showing my love.

857
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,520
Love?

858
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,520
I knew it from the very beginning.

859
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,520
Even my aunt was partial to Rong Hua.

860
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,520
What else is there in Longyin City

861
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,520
that I don't deserve to know?

862
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,520
Master, don't act impulsively.

863
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,520
Maybe the City Leader has made a decision about yesterday.

864
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,520
Let's wait a little longer

865
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,520
in case we bump into the City Leader.

866
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,520
I will always remember the deep love.

867
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,520
I will always remember the deep love.

868
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,520
If love is not a dream,

869
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,520
then what is a promise?

870
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:42,520
I will love you until I die.

871
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,520
I will keep you in my heart after time has passed.

872
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,520
I will never forget you.

873
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,520
I will never forget you.

874
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:59,520
Love is not a dream
