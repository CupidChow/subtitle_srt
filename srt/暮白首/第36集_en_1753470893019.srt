00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 1

3
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
City Leader.

4
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Don't be so reserved.

5
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Come up.

6
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Come to my side.

7
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Su Er.

8
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
City Leader summoned Rong Su to come.

9
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Did you have any orders?

10
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's been ten years since the last time.

11
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Longyin City is bustling.

12
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
People come and go.

13
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I see.

14
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
People come and go around me.

15
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But I didn't expect

16
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I only have you as my family.

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Only you, my daughter,

18
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
are willing to be with me.

19
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Don't worry, City Leader.

20
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
No matter what,

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I will guard Longyin City with you.

22
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Okay.

23
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Come on.

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Sit down and try it.

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I dare not.

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
City Leader is so kind.

27
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Why not?

28
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
In the past,

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
you were the bravest

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
in Longyin City.

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But...

32
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So why not?

33
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Just do what I tell you to do.

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Go.

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Come on.

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Sit down and try it.

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Okay.

38
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
How is it?

39
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Time is unbearable.

40
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I know my father's health.

41
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's getting worse.

42
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I've figured it out now.

43
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
In the future,

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
the whole Longyin City

45
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
and the whole Long family

46
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
will need you to take the throne.

47
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So you will take the throne

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and take the throne in the future.

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Thank you for your kindness.

50
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You're welcome.

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But you're too young now.

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's too early to take the throne.

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You don't have to worry.

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I will do my best

55
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
to guard Longyin City

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
and stay by your side.

57
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What's wrong?

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You don't want the throne?

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I do.

60
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But I don't want to take the throne.

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You've already made up your mind.

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Only the winner can be the next City Leader.

63
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So you have to get the recognition

64
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
from City Leader

65
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
with your own ability.

66
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Please understand.

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I have never had any desire

68
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
or desire to

69
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
take the throne

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
for you and Longyin City.

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Okay.

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm really happy

73
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
that you can think like that.

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Remember.

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
If one day

76
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
you really take the throne,

77
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
then you need to protect

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
not only your own life

79
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
but also yours.

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You will find that

81
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
all the disciples

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
in this huge Longyin City

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
and even their families

84
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
will become your burden

85
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
and become the responsibility

86
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
that you can't push off.

87
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
By then,

88
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
many decisions

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
will be unfulfilled.

90
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Many decisions

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
will be in the way.

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You're in a hurry.

93
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You will slowly realize

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
that you're no longer a free man.

95
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Su.

96
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Can you understand

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
what I'm trying to tell you today?

98
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I understand.

99
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Thank you for your teaching.

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Hold on.

101
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Sir, I'm sorry.

102
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Sir, I'm here to protect you

103
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
under the order of Master Long.

104
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Come.

105
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Xueyin.

106
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What are you doing here?

107
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Master Bai.

108
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm here to protect you

109
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
under the order of Master Long.

110
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I just got up

111
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and took a step.

112
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What do you know?

113
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
How can a seriously injured person

114
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
move easily?

115
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Master, lie down.

116
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It hurts.

117
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Lie down.

118
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Master, just lie down

119
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
and rest.

120
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
There's a big problem.

121
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Let's talk about it later.

122
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Listen to me.

123
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Lie down.

124
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Wait.

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Stop being so stubborn.

126
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Stop being so stubborn.

127
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You can't control your mind

128
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
before you fully recover.

129
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You're really...

130
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Why are you still standing here?

131
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Leave.

132
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yes.

133
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'll stay outside

134
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
to protect you.

135
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Master Bai,

136
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
as long as you're treated well...

137
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Enough. Get out.

138
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Master Bai.

139
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Take the medicine.

140
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Take the medicine.

141
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Take the medicine.

142
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Take the medicine.

143
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Take the medicine.

144
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Take the medicine.

145
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Master.

146
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
What's wrong with you?

147
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I made the medicine for you.

148
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It can only work if you take it for more than half a month.

149
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Now I'm...

150
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Master Bai.

151
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm sorry.

152
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Maybe you're not used to Longyin City.

153
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So you're worried and anxious.

154
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Maybe

155
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Master Bai will change a quieter place

156
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
for you to rest.

157
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You may recover faster.

158
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Master Xuan.

159
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Are you hiding something from me?

160
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I dare not.

161
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I just want you

162
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
to think about it.

163
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Wait.

164
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Wait.

165
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I bought some fresh vegetables.

166
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Let's eat together.

167
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Let the servants do the work

168
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
of picking up the firewood.

169
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You just got out of the house.

170
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You're not suitable to work so hard.

171
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Besides,

172
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
all the people outside

173
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
are looking for Brother Nalan.

174
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You're not suitable to work so hard.

175
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I know.

176
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I know what I should do.

177
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
What do you want for lunch?

178
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'll cook for you.

179
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
No need.

180
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I have something urgent to do.

181
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
No.

182
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Xue Man.

183
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Let's talk about it after we eat.

184
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You may not know

185
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
that my parents' death anniversary is coming up.

186
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm going out to eat.

187
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You don't believe me?

188
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
At least I want to tell them

189
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
that I'm not going to work.

190
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I was careless.

191
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Don't worry.

192
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I took care of you

193
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
just to

194
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
not let Brother Nalan blame himself.

195
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Huan.

196
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Why didn't you tell me

197
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
that you were going to buy something?

198
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'll get it for you.

199
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Let's go.

200
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Let's go back.

201
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Xue Man.

202
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
What's wrong with Xue Man?

203
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's been so long.

204
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Why can't you see the mud?

205
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What mud?

206
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You're so stupid.

207
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Why do you say I'm stupid?

208
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's time to resolve her knot.

209
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What knot?

210
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What do you mean?

211
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I just got back.

212
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Sister invited me to come.

213
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Now you've done most of the rewards.

214
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Just say it.

215
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I cooked some snow pear bird's nest

216
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
today.

217
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Let's try it together.

218
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Xue Man.

219
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'll tell you the truth.

220
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I've been

221
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
holding the land of Mei's Mansion.

222
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'll return it to you

223
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
after it's done.

224
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You've earned the money

225
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
and the silver.

226
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's a great achievement.

227
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Even if I want to take it back,

228
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
it's not worth it.

229
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I won't allow it

230
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
if my parents are alive.

231
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I still have

232
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
this courage.

233
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You've done a lot for it.

234
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You can't take it back.

235
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I didn't spend

236
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
a penny

237
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
when I bought the mansion.

238
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
What?

239
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
The land and money

240
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
of the mansion

241
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
were all from Master Bo

242
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
with my face covered.

243
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I've never thought

244
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
you would be so cheeky.

245
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
So the mansion

246
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
is yours.

247
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'll return it to you.

248
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You don't have to

249
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
treat me coldly in the future.

250
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
By the way,

251
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I have one more thing

252
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
to tell you.

253
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Your brother

254
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
is still alive.

255
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
What?

256
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Your brother is so handsome

257
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
that he changed his identity.

258
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
After his men were killed,

259
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
he ran away from Longyin City.

260
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Although I broke up with him,

261
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
he is

262
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
the only brother of our family.

263
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Now that I know he is still alive,

264
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I won't be worried

265
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
about my parents' soul.

266
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Thank you for telling me

267
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
about Xue Man.

268
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I've known him since we met.

269
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Don't say that.

270
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Actually, in Longyin City,

271
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I did think about killing your brother.

272
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
After all,

273
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
he killed my aunt

274
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
and got Yu involved.

275
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I really can't forgive him.

276
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I finally know

277
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
why Brother Nalan is so loyal to his sister.

278
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
He is clear-headed

279
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
and does things right.

280
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Xue Man,

281
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
no matter how beautiful you are,

282
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
you are not the only one

283
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
who loves Yue.

284
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I am also your family.

285
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I see.

286
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Sister-in-law.

287
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Miss Liuli,

288
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Master has sent you

289
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
a message.

290
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Okay.

291
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Why are you in a hurry

292
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
to leave so soon?

293
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Please come in.

294
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Please come in.

295
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Is it not Miss Rong

296
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
who came to me this time?

297
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It's you, Young Master Nalan?

298
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Then the person who sent me the message

299
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
and asked me to investigate Longyin City

300
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
is also you?

301
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Xue Man doesn't do business that is not in the book.

302
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Since it's not Miss Rong's order,

303
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I don't care if I don't listen.

304
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
What are you doing?

305
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Okay.

306
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Don't scare her.

307
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Miss Rong?

308
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Liuli,

309
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
we just want to test your loyalty.

310
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Don't worry.

311
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
The person who sent the order

312
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
has always been Miss Rong.

313
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
We never got involved.

314
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I don't know.

315
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Liuli,

316
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
what's going on in Longyin City?

317
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Rong Jinfeng is slightly injured.

318
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
But the injury is not serious.

319
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
But Senior Bai Su's injury is quite serious.

320
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
He is still resting in bed.

321
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Then,

322
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
what about Rong Su?

323
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Don't worry.

324
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Rong Su

325
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
is the most important person

326
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
in Longyin City.

327
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
He is the most popular person.

328
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
No one can compete with him.

329
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Then,

330
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
what about Mo Huan?

331
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
How is Mo Huan?

332
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Master is far away in the North.

333
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
How can Liuli know about him?

334
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Besides,

335
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
if there is news about Master,

336
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
he will be the leader.

337
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Liuli won't know.

338
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Don't be nervous.

339
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I don't mean to ask.

340
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
People in the martial arts world

341
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
are often in a tight spot.

342
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
We all understand

343
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
that you are working for your master.

344
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
But sometimes,

345
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
you have to learn to make choices.

346
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Only if you protect yourself,

347
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
you can live for a long time.

348
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I understand what you are teaching me.

349
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Liuli,

350
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I have a favor to ask you.

351
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Go ahead.

352
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's been half a month.

353
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Why is there no improvement?

354
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I made the medicine myself.

355
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
No problem.

356
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Bai Su's injury is getting better.

357
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's getting worse.

358
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I found out in secret

359
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
that he needs more time to sleep

360
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
and wake up every day.

361
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
In this case, I'm afraid...

362
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Why didn't you send him

363
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
to Longyin City

364
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
as I told you?

365
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Master has been blocking him.

366
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
He said that Senior Bai was seriously injured.

367
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
He shouldn't be startled.

368
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Moreover,

369
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
he was injured in Longyin City.

370
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
He should stay in the city.

371
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Master Bai took good care of him

372
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
by keeping him in the Hall of Life.

373
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Bai Weizhi didn't even

374
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
see the evidence.

375
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I've already told him

376
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
to come back in secret.

377
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
But he only

378
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
cares about saving Bai Su.

379
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
He didn't pay attention to me.

380
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You're so stupid.

381
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
If this goes on,

382
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Bai Su will die.

383
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm afraid he'll be in a fight

384
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
with City Leader

385
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
if we send him out of the city.

386
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Moreover,

387
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
the relationship between City Leader and Master

388
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
has just been broken.

389
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Who's there?

390
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Yun, a disciple of Bingsi Hall.

391
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I have something to report to Master Rong.

392
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Bingsi Hall?

393
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Yun?

394
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Master,

395
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
why don't you let him in

396
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
and see what he says?

397
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Come in.

398
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Greetings, Master Rong.

399
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
There are many goods

400
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
in Jingfeng Town.

401
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
When I was going to buy them,

402
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I saw a new item.

403
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I thought you must like it.

404
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
So I bought it

405
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
and sent it to you.

406
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
How dare you!

407
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Where did you learn the rules?

408
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
How dare you make decisions without permission

409
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
and come to the Palace of Emotionless.

410
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's okay.

411
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Come up

412
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
and show me the item.

413
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,500
Yes.

414
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Come on.

415
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Let's go.

416
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It seems that

417
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
the items you sell

418
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
are not that good.

419
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You just don't know the goods.

420
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I wonder if Miss Rong

421
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
has any favorite items

422
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
except for me.

423
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Why are you so happy?

424
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I'm just a little sad.

425
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm just a little sad.

426
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm just a little sad.

427
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I'm just a little sad.

428
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I'm just a little sad.

429
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I'm just a little sad.

430
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Why did you turn back

431
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
and play tricks on me?

432
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I've told you

433
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
not to show yourself in Longying City.

434
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
To be honest,

435
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I'm really happy

436
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
to see you today.

437
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Stop talking nonsense.

438
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
To be honest,

439
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
why did you bother

440
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
to bring me to see you in the Palace of Emotionless?

441
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Here's the thing.

442
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Mr. Bai has been in Longying City

443
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
for half a month.

444
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
But he hasn't woken up yet.

445
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
There must be something wrong

446
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
with him.

447
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
We've contacted

448
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
the Wang family of Black Stone Mountain

449
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
to pick him up.

450
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
They'll try to

451
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
get Mr. Bai out of the city.

452
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
At that time,

453
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I hope Miss Rong can help us

454
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
and help us delay for a few days

455
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
to ensure that

456
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Mr. Bai's life is safe in the city.

457
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
How can you be sure

458
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
that I'll fight against my father

459
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
for an unrelated outsider?

460
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Before I left,

461
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
my Young Madam

462
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
asked me to tell you something.

463
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
What is it?

464
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
The more you get, the more you lose.

465
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Longying City

466
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
is no longer the original Longying City.

467
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
These years,

468
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I think you gradually understand

469
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
what kind of foundation

470
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Longying City has established

471
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
in the world over the years.

472
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Your father did so much for Chihua Zhu

473
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
and her status in the world

474
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
that she suffered a lot

475
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
for the blood of her father.

476
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
She also got a lot of blood from him.

477
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Rong Su,

478
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
is this the Longying City

479
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
that you want?

480
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Is this the Longying City

481
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
that you risked your life

482
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
to get?

483
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
If you can control it,

484
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
what kind of foundation

485
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
can it be better?

486
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Actually,

487
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
you don't have to go to Longying City

488
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
without Brother Lu.

489
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Just go to someone else.

490
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
You're so worried about Lu Yizhou.

491
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Actually, she wants to go to Longying City.

492
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
If you don't let her go,

493
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I'm afraid she can't even sleep.

494
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
That's true.

495
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Is Sister Rong still in Longying City?

496
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I don't know.

497
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Don't think too much.

498
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Now your master

499
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
is protected by Bai.

500
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And Lu Yizhou and Rong Su

501
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
are in a foreign land with you.

502
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And Liuli has gone to Black Stone Mountain

503
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
to inform the Wang family.

504
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I think

505
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
you don't have to worry about it.

506
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I don't know

507
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
what's going on in Longying City.

508
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
If something bad happens to my father,

509
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I won't just sit and watch.

510
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I'll go.

511
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Yue,

512
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I'm from Longying City.

513
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
After I decided to be with you,

514
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I left Longying City

515
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
and my family.

516
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I have nothing

517
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
to say to my father.

518
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I understand you.

519
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
But please understand me.

520
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
He's my father after all.

521
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I really can't

522
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
watch him die.

523
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Hua,

524
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I know all of this.

525
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Miss Mei.

526
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Brother Cang Qi,

527
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
why are you here?

528
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I'm worried that you'll leave the mansion alone.

529
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
So...

530
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Thank you, Brother Cang Qi.

531
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
No need.

532
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I'm sorry

533
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
for what you did.

534
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I can do it

535
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
on my own.

536
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
In the heart of the bloodline,

537
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
there's a person

538
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
who's never going to die.

539
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Naturally,

540
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I can understand

541
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
how you feel.

542
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
But

543
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
a love letter in this world

544
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
is easy to let go

545
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
and to talk about.

546
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Miss Mei is well-behaved

547
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
in Cang Qi.

548
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
She won't make Young Master worried.

549
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Come on.

550
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Don't worry.

551
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
You can treat me like a normal person.

552
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Just treat me

553
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
as a person who can chat with me.

554
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Yue.

555
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Run!

556
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Hurry up.

557
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Young Master.

558
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Yue.

559
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Yue.

560
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Brother Lan.

561
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Young Mistress.

562
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Hurry up.

563
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Young Mistress.

564
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
This is strange.

565
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Sister-in-law,

566
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
what about Brother Lan?

567
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
He is fine now.

568
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
He's fine now.

569
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
He's fine now.

570
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Can you tell me

571
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
what happened to him?

572
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
He was killed

573
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
by a knife.

574
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
He was killed

575
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
by a knife.

576
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
He was killed

577
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
by a knife.

578
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
It's strange.

579
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
He just fell asleep.

580
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Young Mistress,

581
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
do you have any way to cure him?

582
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
The acupuncture

583
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
can only relieve his pain temporarily.

584
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
It's not a long-term solution.

585
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Is there no way

586
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
to cure him?

587
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
There is a way.

588
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Sister-in-law.

589
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Go to the spiritual school

590
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
and find the way to get rid of the poison of the illusion.

591
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Go.

592
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Go.

593
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Xue Man.

594
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I have an idea.

595
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
What idea?

596
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Can you cure Brother Lan?

597
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Although it's just

598
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
a way to get rid of the poison,

599
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
if we can use it to get rid of it,

600
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
it might be able to

601
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
get rid of the poison of the illusion in Yue's body.

602
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
But will it be

603
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
able to get rid of it

604
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
and force the poison in his body to re-appear?

605
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
The place of the illusion in Yue's body

606
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
is closely related to the Chihua Bead.

607
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
If we can get the coldness

608
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
into his body,

609
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
it might be able to be cured

610
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
in a short time.

611
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
But if we do this,

612
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
will the coldness in your body

613
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
also re-appear?

614
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
It doesn't matter.

615
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I've been used to it

616
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
since I was a child.

617
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
By the way, Xue Man.

618
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Can you do me a favor?

619
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Go ahead.

620
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Help me make a medicine.

621
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Okay.

622
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
The Chihua Bead

623
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I know you're worried about them.

624
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I've made a vow before Madam died.

625
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I will protect the people of Lingxu Pavilion.

626
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
No matter what happens to Young Mistress and Young Madam,

627
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I will save them with my life.

628
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I'm just worried that

629
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
if Brother Nalan can't wake up,

630
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
what should Sister-in-law, Brother Lu

631
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
and you do?

632
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
But if he wakes up,

633
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
he'll be as stupid as those

634
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
who were in the chaos before.

635
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Sister-in-law can't accept it.

636
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I don't know what to do now.

637
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Is it right

638
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
or wrong for me to help him?

639
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
It's not your responsibility

640
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
to make a mistake.

641
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
In case you take yourself as the priority,

642
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
it's more important to save your life.

643
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I'll protect Young Mistress.

644
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Nothing will happen.

645
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
But you have to leave now.

646
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
This is Mei Mansion.

647
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
It's where I grew up.

648
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Although it's already a mess now,

649
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I won't leave

650
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
no matter what happens.

651
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I want to be with everyone.

652
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I want to be with Brother Nalan.

653
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
He

654
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
is also my family.

655
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Change!

656
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Young Mistress,

657
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Young Mistress used the treatment

658
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
of cold air to relieve the poison in your body.

659
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
This can keep you awake.

660
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
What did you say?

661
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Xue Man,

662
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
what happened?

663
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
It's me.

664
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I changed the medicine for Sister-in-law.

665
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
That's why her body is cold and rejuvenated.

666
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
She said she didn't regret it.

667
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I don't regret it either.

668
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
If anything happens to her,

669
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I won't live alone.

670
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I'll die with her.

671
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
You're really something.

672
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Get out.

673
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I...

674
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Get out!

675
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
You're awake?

676
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Yue,

677
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
as long as you can wake up,

678
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I'll do anything.

679
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
It's very scary.

680
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Wait for me.

681
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
First,

682
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
just fall down.

683
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Second,

684
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
just come over here.

685
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Third,

686
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
will I even make it alive?

687
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Don't be too nervous.

688
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I still have a lot of use

689
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
to economic training to the Αmtrénas agrasçae Where do I have the ability to train both?

690
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,920
Let's bow to His Majesty.

691
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,320
the last level of Xuanbing Talisman.

692
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,840
I can't control

693
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,120
Xuanbing Talisman's counterattack anymore.

694
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,560
And I don't know

695
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,080
when the next counterattack will be.

696
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,120
Only when I break through the last level of attack

697
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,840
can I make a change.

698
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,920
Now everyone of you is by my side.

699
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,600
You're in danger.

700
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,680
I can die for you.

701
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,400
I won't leave.

702
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,360
You were forced by Mohuan

703
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,000
to break through the last level.

704
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,400
But after you've done it,

705
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,720
you're in a worse condition.

706
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:14,960
What should you do?

707
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,880
You don't have to worry about that.

708
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,680
This time,

709
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,720
I'll make a mistake for Mohuan.

710
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,520
Both of you are heroes,

711
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,920
whether you're a martial artist

712
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,320
or a general.

713
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,800
You're all respected.

714
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,680
I wonder what you're doing

715
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,600
in Longyun City today.

716
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,400
My brothers are busy

717
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,640
and rushed to Longyun City.

718
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,360
They're here to thank you.

719
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,680
If it weren't for you,

720
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,040
my master and his family

721
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,720
would have been killed

722
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,120
by that devil.

723
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,320
That's right.

724
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,160
We're here for this.

725
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,120
Mr. Bai Su

726
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,880
is the leader of the people in the world.

727
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,520
He's a noble man.

728
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,240
Now he's in Longyun City

729
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,280
and he's in this situation.

730
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,960
I should do something.

731
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,320
But

732
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,120
Mr. Bai's injury

733
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,800
hasn't improved.

734
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,160
You two came here

735
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,760
to thank me.

736
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,880
It makes me feel more responsible.

737
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,080
It's not a good idea

738
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,600
to keep dragging on

739
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,440
your injury.

740
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,800
Since we're here,

741
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,560
why don't you take me back to Black Stone Mountain

742
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,280
and recuperate?

743
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:45,680
No.

744
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,160
I'm seriously injured.

745
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,280
How can I endure the long journey?

746
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,000
What if I get injured on the way?

747
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:52,920
What should I do?

748
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,000
You can't leave me here

749
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,280
because you're afraid of the world.

750
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,760
But if you insist on taking me away,

751
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,280
it's a dead end.

752
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,560
How can you take responsibility?

753
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,120
You're just afraid of being blamed.

754
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:05,960
Anyway,

755
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,760
I can't leave you here alone.

756
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,240
You...

757
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,320
It's not about responsibility.

758
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,640
It's about your safety.

759
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,160
There's no need to argue.

760
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,240
You two.

761
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,160
You two must calm down.

762
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:23,920
Don't worry.

763
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:24,760
I know

764
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,280
you're worried about Mr. Bai Su.

765
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,160
You're all kind.

766
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,960
But there's a saying,

767
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,480
care is a mess.

768
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,160
You two,

769
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,720
let's sit down and talk.

770
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,120
Don't get hurt for this.

771
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:39,760
Oh, no!

772
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,720
Oh, no!

773
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,520
Oh, no!

774
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,360
What's wrong?

775
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,600
Oh, no!

776
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,880
Master is dying!

777
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,400
What?

778
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:50,880
This...

779
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:07,840
Guys,

780
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,480
Mr. Bai's condition

781
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,440
is not optimistic.

782
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,440
His pulse is weak

783
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,640
and his blood pressure is low.

784
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,120
I'm afraid you

785
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,720
need to be prepared.

786
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,120
Master.

787
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,040
Master.

788
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:22,640
Master.

789
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,480
Master.

790
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,240
How could this happen?

791
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,240
How did you take care of him?

792
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,200
He's in danger.

793
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,640
Why aren't you with him?

794
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,440
Now he's seriously injured.

795
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,480
As the Hall Leader of Lao Zi,

796
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,120
you're not even able to

797
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,880
treat your own master.

798
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,640
Hero.

799
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,840
Allow me to say something.

800
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:45,720
Actually,

801
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,560
Mr. Bai and you are from the same family.

802
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,400
Mr. Bai is his master, too.

803
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,560
Why can't he do his best?

804
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,600
Don't misunderstand him.

805
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,880
Actually,

806
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,720
you should blame him

807
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,720
for being too cruel.

808
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,760
It's not easy for Mr. Bai

809
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,640
to hold on until now.

810
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,160
Master is always in a tough situation.

811
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,160
I didn't expect him to be in such a situation.

812
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,240
He's usually the quietest.

813
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,960
He's usually the quietest.

814
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,560
He's not good at asking about the world.

815
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,320
Anyway,

816
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,720
I want to take Master back to Black Stone Mountain.

817
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,560
I understand

818
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,360
your filial piety.

819
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,280
With the current situation of Mr. Bai,

820
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,040
if you take him back to the mountain,

821
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,640
the journey will be long and bumpy.

822
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,800
His body will be exhausted.

823
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,600
Master is a high-spirited man.

824
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,160
He must be unwilling to die.

825
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,000
So I'll take him back to Black Stone Mountain

826
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:55,120
with my brother's will.

827
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:55,760
Mr. Bai.

828
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,640
I've made up my mind.

829
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,000
Okay.

830
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,920
Since you've decided,

831
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,200
I'll arrange it

832
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,760
and send Mr. Bai out of town.

833
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,320
Thank you.

834
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,040
Master.

835
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:11,760
Master.

836
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,240
Xuan Yi.

837
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,000
Serve tea.

838
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,320
Why are you here?

839
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,920
This is Kongzi Hall.

840
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,920
I should ask you this.

841
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,200
Why are you here?

842
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,400
Didn't the Wang brothers take you to Longyin City

843
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,440
to wander around?

844
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,720
I'm not wandering around.

845
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,480
I'm here

846
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,520
for my own purpose.

847
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,400
Have you achieved your purpose?

848
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,480
Of course.

849
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,040
I've...

850
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,240
I've checked it out.

851
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,040
Mr. Bai's medicine has no problem.

852
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,840
Longyin Palace thought

853
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,760
it was too obvious to use poison.

854
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,240
Mr. Bai's disciples

855
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,440
are not easy to fool.

856
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,840
So the problem

857
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,200
is on the pillow and the quilt.

858
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,960
They all smoked with incense.

859
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,880
The incense has no color and no taste.

860
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,440
But it's different from the medicine

861
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,320
Mr. Bai took a few days ago.

862
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,520
As time goes by,

863
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,240
the disease will not only get better,

864
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,880
but also the people will become unconscious.

865
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,920
Besides, Mr. Bai's injury is too serious.

866
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,240
It's too late.

867
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,480
I'm afraid it's too late.

868
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,720
Today, the City Leader will arrange

869
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,520
Mr. Bai and the Wang brothers

870
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,400
to leave Longyin City.

871
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,240
I think he's ready to do anything.

872
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,560
Once they leave the city,

873
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,120
they'll kill each other.

874
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,520
They won't leave any chance for them.

875
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,840
Mr. Bai has been in the martial arts world for a long time.

876
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,240
How did he offend you?

877
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,280
Why do you have to kill him?

878
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,520
You've been in the martial arts world for so many years.

879
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,480
Haven't you heard that

880
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,400
the more you know, the faster you die?

881
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,000
Look at you, old-fashioned.

882
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,400
Let me ask you.

883
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,520
Are you going to

884
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,880
stay in Longyin City for a lifetime?

885
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,760
In the future, the City Leader of Longyin City

886
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,880
will be the most important person

887
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,120
in the family.

888
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,480
You'll only do it for the City Leader.

889
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,120
You'll fight for others all your life.

890
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,280
What's the point?

891
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:49,960
In the future?

892
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,640
I've never thought about that.

893
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,360
Then let's meet on the day after tomorrow.

894
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,160
You're free today.

895
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,840
Let's think about it.

896
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,480
Besides fighting and killing,

897
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,000
don't you have any other hobbies?

898
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,040
I don't have any other hobbies.

899
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,760
I'm just a little bit busy.

900
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,760
I'm busy with my work.

901
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,160
I'm busy with my work.

902
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,760
I'm busy with my work.

903
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,360
I'm busy with my work.

904
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,960
I'm busy with my work.

905
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,560
I'm busy with my work.

906
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,160
I'm busy with my work.

907
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,760
I'm busy with my work.

908
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,360
I'm busy with my work.

909
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,960
I'm busy with my work.

910
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,760
I'm busy with my work.

911
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,360
I'm busy with my work.

912
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,960
I'm busy with my work.

913
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,560
I'm busy with my work.

914
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,160
I'm busy with my work.

915
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,760
I'm busy with my work.

916
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:40,060
Because I have to do the work I have a serious feeling about tomorrow,

917
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,560
every day I am very serious all day long.

918
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,120
Every time,

919
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:47,960
my tears fall

920
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:53,920
as if they were falling on a sand reminds-me.

921
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,700
White clouds Street,

922
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,360
a ponder is been drawn.

923
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,760
I will be your friend forever.

924
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,760
I will be your friend forever.

925
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,760
I will be your friend forever.

926
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,760
I will be your friend forever.

927
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,760
I will be your friend forever.

928
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,760
I will be your friend forever.

929
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,760
I will be your friend forever.

930
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,760
I will be your friend forever.

931
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,760
I will be your friend forever.

932
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,760
I will be your friend forever.

933
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,760
I will be your friend forever.

934
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,760
I will be your friend forever.

935
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,760
I will be your friend forever.

936
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,760
I will be your friend forever.

937
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,760
I will be your friend forever.
