00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Lin Jing, didn't you say you wanted Chen Qi to practice sword with me?

7
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Let's go.

8
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Hurry up.

9
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
This place is really weird.

10
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What?

11
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Chief, you...

12
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You didn't do enough last night.

13
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You'll be locked in the private room from now on.

Don't you want your daughter

16
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
to see your hands full of blood?

Lin Jing, didn't you say you wanted Chen Qi to practice sword with me?

19
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Why did you come here?

20
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
That's right.

21
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
He broke into our Longyin City's forbidden area.

22
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's also right to be punished now.

23
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You didn't lose your life.

24
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You're lucky.

25
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Breaking into the forbidden area was my fault.

26
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I remember the lesson from the City Chief.

27
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'll take you back first.

28
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Let's go.

29
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm leaving, Chief.

30
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Don't worry, girl.

31
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's fine.

32
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But this sword is quite sharp.

33
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Luckily, it didn't hurt the poison.

34
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Good apprentice.

35
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Go and get some tonics.

36
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Give it to the nurse.

37
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You want to eat something good?

38
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm hungry, too.

39
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Hua, watch her.

40
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Don't run around.

41
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You dare to go anywhere.

42
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Little apprentice.

43
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You went to the forbidden area to find me

44
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
because you missed me, right?

45
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What time is it?

46
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You're still talking about this?

47
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Didn't you say you'd practice sword with me?

48
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I looked all over Longyin City, but I didn't find you.

49
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Then I thought of the forbidden area.

50
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
If I had just...

51
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Wait a minute.

52
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Look.

53
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Can you tell who the person on it is?

54
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I've never seen this handwriting.

55
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I guess it's not from Longyin City.

56
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Since it's not from Longyin City,

57
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
how could she know it's forbidden area?

58
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Since it's forbidden area,

59
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
why didn't anyone guard it?

60
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
When I was sleeping,

61
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I felt a kind of

62
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
very powerful smoke.

63
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
If I guessed it right,

64
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
it's because of this smoke.

65
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's because of this smoke

66
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
that I'll treat the person who came later as you.

67
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Smoke?

68
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's my aunt.

69
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Since it's my aunt,

70
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
it must be my father's name.

71
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
After this incident,

72
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
did you know

73
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Longyin City is not a peaceful place?

74
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I knew what Longyin City looked like a long time ago.

75
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Since you knew it,

76
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
why did you stay here?

77
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Is there a reason

78
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
why you married a girl?

79
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
That girl is very nice.

80
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm just afraid that I'll be late.

81
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
My mother told me

82
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
that girl

83
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
has a good appearance,

84
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
good character,

85
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
and good family history.

86
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
There are many good aspects.

87
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Since she's so nice,

88
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
you should go back and marry her.

89
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Why are you still here?

90
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
No matter how nice she is,

91
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
she's not the one I want to marry in my life.

92
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What's wrong with you?

93
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Help me up to the bed.

94
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Okay.

95
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Don't move.

96
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
If you move,

97
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
my wound will open.

98
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Okay, I won't move.

99
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You must take good care of me these days.

100
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
When I'm recovered,

101
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I won't be here

102
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
and pester you.

103
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Okay, I'll do as you say.

104
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You're really a man of your word.

105
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Do you know that Lin Jing...

106
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Lu Yi Zhou,

107
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
you need to act stupid with me.

108
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Lin Jing broke into the forbidden area of Lu Ying City

109
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
and was captured by the City Leader.

110
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Your goal has been exposed.

111
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Leave now.

112
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Or else,

113
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
you'll lose your life too.

114
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The most precious thing in Lu Ying City

115
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
is the treasure.

116
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You're right.

117
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm not a man of my word.

118
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The most precious thing in Lu Ying City

119
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
is the Chihua Bead.

120
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
But we're not interested in the Chihua Bead.

121
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
We're born human.

122
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
We either live carefree,

123
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
or die in a happy and simple way.

124
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Why bother living a life of dog and dog?

125
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Not everyone in this world

126
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
treats the Chihua Bead as a treasure.

127
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's just that the people in your city

128
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
are too shallow-minded.

129
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You...

130
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
The real reason for Chihua Bead's rescue

131
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
is not the death of City Leader Rong.

132
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Don't you want to see Lin Jing?

133
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Lin Jing broke into the forbidden area

134
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
and is seriously injured.

135
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Miss Rong, do you want to know the white or black?

136
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Lu Yi Zhou.

137
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I need to think about it

138
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
after this game is over.

139
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'll think about other things.

140
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's good to let her suffer

141
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
in Lu Ying City.

142
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
If she doesn't get a shot here,

143
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
she'll get hurt

144
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
several times when she goes back.

145
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's better for Miss Rong to know the white.

146
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Then you'll have a better chance.

147
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I choose the black.

148
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I choose the black.

149
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Aunt.

150
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Rong Su.

151
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I brought you medicine.

152
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Aunt, sit.

153
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's time for you to take medicine.

154
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You're still injured.

155
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You mustn't overwork yourself.

156
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Or you'll get sick.

157
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Let me do it.

158
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Here.

159
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Thank you.

160
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Aunt, don't worry.

161
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Rong Hua and I are different.

162
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You need to worry about her health.

163
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I know you're in a bad mood.

164
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But the City Leader asked you to manage the affairs together

165
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
is to make you more experienced.

166
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Besides, Rong Hua

167
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
hasn't been sick for ten years.

168
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Rong Hua's illness is not a full recovery.

169
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
But the City Leader has found a way

170
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
to suppress it in her body.

171
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
If something big happens in the city,

172
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
she'll get sick.

173
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Then who will decide

174
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
about Lu Ying City?

175
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You can't say that again.

176
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
The City Leader is here now.

177
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
How can you deduce

178
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
the future of Lu Ying City?

179
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
The City Leader did this

180
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
because he has his own plan.

181
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
City Leader.

182
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Greetings, City Leader Zi Yan.

183
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You two can talk.

184
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
City Leader.

185
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
What's this?

186
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Mr. Lu sent someone

187
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
to send it to the city's security.

188
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I admit it.

189
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Miss Rong chose to lose from the beginning.

190
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
She's good at thinking.

191
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
But many times,

192
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
losing is the will of the world.

193
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Next time, I hope Miss Rong will be careful.

194
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I hope Miss Rong can practice chess.

195
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
If you have a chance,

196
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
play chess with me again.

197
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
City Leader.

198
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Are you going to lose her?

199
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm going to lose her.

200
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
No need.

201
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'll win back

202
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
if I lose to her.

203
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm hurt.

204
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm hurt.

205
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It hurts.

206
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It hurts.

207
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You're finally here.

208
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You're back.

209
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
When I was hurt,

210
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
you would think of all ways to look at me.

211
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Look at you now.

212
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You don't care at all.

213
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Are you still my brother?

214
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
No.

215
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Since the moment you ran away from the wedding,

216
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I've already recognized your face.

217
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You...

218
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
If you choose to run away from the wedding,

219
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'll definitely treat you as my brother.

220
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I won't be like you now.

221
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You're cold and heartless.

222
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Look at you.

223
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Do you need my help?

224
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Then, will you help me or not?

225
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I...

226
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
After this,

227
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I might be leaving Longyin City.

228
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
There are some things

229
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
that I haven't figured out yet.

230
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Do you really think I'm just trying to escape from the wedding?

231
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
If I'm just trying to escape from the wedding,

232
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
why would I come to Longyin City?

233
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I would've gone to other places.

234
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
This time,

235
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm afraid

236
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'll have to risk my life.

237
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
If there's a tea house,

238
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
we'll be separated.

239
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
By then,

240
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
no one will bother you anymore.

241
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Stop pretending.

242
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Is the trouble big this time?

243
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
No, it's not big at all.

244
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You can handle it.

245
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
No.

246
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
No.

247
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Do it again.

248
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I taught you this before I came here.

249
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Look carefully.

250
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
This is a defensive move.

251
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm your teacher now.

252
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Can you be more serious?

253
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Since you're training me,

254
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
you should be more careful.

255
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Are you okay?

256
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I'm fine.

257
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
In front of your father,

258
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
you've been trying to seduce me.

259
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I promised to teach you how to practice.

260
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
If you do that,

261
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
we'll never see each other again.

262
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Father,

263
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
why are you here?

264
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm here to hold on.

265
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It seems that

266
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Mr. Lin's injury

267
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
is already healed.

268
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You can teach our son

269
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
to practice martial arts here.

270
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
In that case,

271
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'll be polite.

272
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Longyin City

273
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
doesn't welcome outsiders.

274
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Please leave here by yourself tomorrow.

275
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Father.

276
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Okay.

277
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
This is the rule of Longyin City.

278
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I hope you can understand.

279
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
The order of the City Leader

280
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
is really unkind.

281
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
In that case,

282
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I won't let my grandson

283
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
and his disciple be in trouble.

284
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I'll listen to the City Leader's arrangement.

285
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Yes, Master.

286
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Yes, Master.

287
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Master,

288
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
everything is arranged.

289
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I'll come back to the land

290
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
and get rid of the evil.

291
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
The peace of Longyin City

292
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
is over.

293
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
The City Leader's Residence

294
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I don't know why

295
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I didn't see anyone coming to see me off.

296
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
None of them are really kind.

297
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
The City Leader's Residence

298
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You must do well

299
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
in what the City Leader told you.

300
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Sister, don't worry.

301
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I won't delay it.

302
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
By the way,

303
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I have to go out for a while.

304
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
There are some medicinal materials in the ginseng soup.

305
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I have to fill it up quickly.

306
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
The medicinal materials in the tea can cause a cold.

307
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Once the cold starts,

308
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I can't fight for the City Leader's position.

309
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Let's see who can protect Ronghua.

310
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
The cold hasn't started for many years.

311
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Why is it starting now?

312
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
What does the other party mean?

313
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Is it trying to kill me?

314
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
If I die,

315
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
who can I persuade?

316
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I'm doing it because

317
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
my head is in the water.

318
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
What other party will have that part?

319
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I don't know.

320
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
If you're close to someone

321
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
this mountain has great power.

322
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Of course our inner world

323
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
can become stronger.

324
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,800
Ronghua,

325
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,680
may I hear it bareheart?

326
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,360
Darling,

327
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
don't point the sword from afar.

328
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,020
Don't go too far.

329
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,020
You finally came.

330
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,860
It's only been half a day.

331
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,340
What's wrong with you?

332
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,300
I have a cold.

333
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,740
A cold?

334
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,940
Let me take you to see.

335
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,540
I'll take you to see Dr. Mu.

336
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,540
It's okay.

337
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,340
Just go

338
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,580
Take it for fun

339
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,020
I'll buy you water now

340
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,860
Just wait.

341
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,940
Why are you still here?

342
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,020
Go

343
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,860
Don't be afraid

344
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,040
Go

345
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,620
Go

346
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,820
There's something wrong with the position of the opponent

347
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,380
Will him

348
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,260
The prince's son is peculiar

349
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,700
It won't work if you continue like this

350
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,100
It seems that Miss Rong has set up troubles

351
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,420
These killers are good at martial arts.

352
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,620
They are well-trained in martial arts and formation.

353
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,460
I wonder who offended Longyin City

354
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,140
for such a crime.

355
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:22,860
Miss Rong.

356
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,060
I'm fine.

357
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,180
Don't worry.

358
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,500
Master,

359
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,780
I've checked the body.

360
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,380
But I didn't find the right door.

361
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,940
Who on earth wants to kill my Longyin City?

362
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,740
Yin Jing has left Longyin City.

363
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,020
You have nothing to do with Longyin City.

364
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,460
Please leave here as soon as possible.

365
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,140
Don't stay here.

366
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,540
I got the news

367
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,420
and sent everyone to guard Longyin City.

368
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,900
I didn't expect to meet Miss Rong

369
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,060
before I found Lin Jing.

370
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,420
I never thought it would be such a coincidence.

371
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,820
Mr. Lu happened to be here.

372
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,660
Is it really for Lin Jing?

373
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,980
Or is it all

374
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,300
your trick?

375
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,380
Miss Rong, thank you for your concern.

376
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,740
I came here for one reason.

377
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,900
I came to find Lin Jing and bring her back home.

378
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,460
If it's really as you said,

379
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,820
why did I save her?

380
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,900
I don't know.

381
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,140
After all, Lin Jing and her sister Rong Hua

382
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,340
disappeared together.

383
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,180
Even Longyin City's eyes can be closed.

384
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,260
Who is behind this?

385
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,020
Could it be...

386
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,380
Miss Rong,

387
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,020
I'll leave first.

388
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,220
If there's any news about Miss Rong,

389
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,820
I'll tell you immediately.

390
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,740
Today, I used the Hua Pearl

391
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,540
to break into Master Xue's heart

392
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,780
and keep his life.

393
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,220
From now on,

394
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,260
the Xue family can only listen to my order.

395
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,260
Past Diarlong

396
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:55,760
There hasn't been much

397
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:01,500
roadBIg C πολύ

398
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:05,380
in Longyin City.

399
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,340
That's true.

400
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,140
But in the future,

401
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,060
I'll have to rely on

402
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,300
the Lord of Rong City to continue his life.

403
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,580
If anything happens to Longyin City,

404
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:20,180
I'll be in danger.

405
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,020
What's your plan, Father?

406
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,380
Well,

407
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,100
go and find out

408
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,820
what trouble Longyin City has been in.

409
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,900
If there's anything you need,

410
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,740
Xueises

411
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,740
will also have to do that.

412
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,800
They can eat that imperial food.

413
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,560
Don't put it there.

414
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,080
I will eat that.

415
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,680
Are you okay?

416
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,740
I'm sorry.

417
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,060
Why are you still so cold?

418
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,660
Look at you.

419
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,380
I've been away from you for hours.

420
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,420
What will you do

421
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,900
when I'm not by your side?

422
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,140
Oulu.

423
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:54,980
Fan.

424
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,140
Oulu.

425
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,300
Oulu.

426
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,660
I really owe you in my previous life.

427
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,980
When we were seriously in physical medical school,

428
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,860
he almost beat me to death by talking to me.

429
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,140
But after seeing pain.

430
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:21,660
Here.

431
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:23,540
Hurry up.

432
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:26,100
But you were just seen as a 챱

433
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,340
and gave one day a doctor.

434
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:29,900
I didn't think

435
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,820
you needed the doctor.

436
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,300
The two of us

437
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,460
had an appreciate meeting before.

438
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,480
You just took me to see Doctor Mu without telling him.

439
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,040
Then, you'd treat me.

440
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,780
By the way, you once more sent me back with a doctor.

441
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,880
Why ended up

442
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,060
the way you are now?!

443
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,980
I can't tell anyone.

444
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,940
No way.

445
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,020
There's no one you trust in Longyin City.

446
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,580
What should I do?

447
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,340
I'm not good at medicine.

448
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,260
But I can use acupuncture.

449
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,060
I can use acupuncture.

450
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,660
I can use acupuncture.

451
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,660
I can use acupuncture.

452
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,660
I can use acupuncture.

453
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,540
I can use acupuncture.

454
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,060
I can use acupuncture.

455
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,060
Acupuncture.

456
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,060
Acupuncture.

457
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,660
And acupuncture.

458
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,140
And...

459
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,620
And what?

460
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,060
And...

461
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,020
I can only use acupuncture as a fire-sweeping medicine.

462
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,540
I did this

463
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,540
to cure you.

464
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,060
You can't ask the captain for help.

465
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,540
If you don't say anything,

466
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,780
I'll take it as a yes.

467
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,540
Are you feeling better?

468
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,540
Are you feeling better?

469
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,060
Why are you getting colder?

470
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,060
I'll take you back to Longyin City.

471
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,060
I'll take you back to Longyin City.

472
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,060
You...

473
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,540
Who are you?

474
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:58,860
Sister Ruohua.

475
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,060
Is she a cold-blooded criminal?

476
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:04,660
How about this?

477
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,660
You go to the backyard.

478
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,060
In the last cell,

479
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,460
there's a special medicine for her.

480
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,860
You break it and bring it to me.

481
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:10,860
I'll take care of it.

482
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,860
Why are you standing there?

483
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,860
I know you're Lin Jing.

484
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,260
I heard from my sister

485
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,260
that you were hurt.

486
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,660
She asked me to give you the treatment.

487
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,660
Right?

488
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,180
You're Dr. Mu?

489
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,180
I'm Mu Yan.

490
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,180
You're too young.

491
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,980
You don't understand.

492
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,380
I'm young,

493
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:34,180
but I'm much better at medical skills than you.

494
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,180
Hurry up. Get up.

495
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,180
Don't be late.

496
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,180
Go away. Go away.

497
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,180
You're so good.

498
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,580
Come on.

499
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,980
Take good care of Ruohua.

500
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,380
Go.

501
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,660
Go.

502
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,660
Go.

503
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,660
Go.

504
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,660
Master, what happened?

505
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,180
Master Xue was killed by someone.

506
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:09,180
And the candle was destroyed

507
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,180
and put in the heart.

508
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,180
The heart was broken.

509
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,180
The candle was broken.

510
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,180
The candle was broken.

511
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,700
The heart was broken.

512
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,700
The heart was broken.

513
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,700
The heart was broken.

514
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,700
Don't worry, Xiang Zhi.

515
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,700
Your father was killed in Longyin City.

516
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,700
I will

517
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,700
give you an explanation.

518
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,500
Longyin City is heavily guarded.

519
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,300
It's harder to break in than the Imperial City.

520
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,820
Someone

521
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,820
killed someone in the Imperial City.

522
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,820
It's a bad omen.

523
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,300
Please do something right.

524
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,300
Find the murderer and give my father justice.

525
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,820
Kong Zitang, listen to my order.

526
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,820
Yes.

527
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,820
Arrest Lin Jing.

528
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,820
Whether he's alive or dead,

529
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,820
we must bring him back to Longyin City.

530
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,820
I will take care of it.

531
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,820
Yes.

532
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:10,820
Father.

533
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:13,820
Lin Jing.

534
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,340
Lin Jing.

535
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,340
I want you to pay for it.

536
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,340
It's him.

537
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,340
He's back.

538
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,340
Sister Rong Hua's cold poison has been cured.

539
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,340
It's okay.

540
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,340
But he's sick this time.

541
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,340
He should be killed by someone.

542
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,340
Why do you say that?

543
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,340
He has a sign of being poisoned.

544
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,340
But the person who used the medicine

545
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,340
only reduced the dose.

546
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,340
So he's not in any serious danger.

547
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,340
I'm sure

548
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,340
he must know sister very well.

549
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,340
That's why he knows his condition.

550
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,340
What poison did he get?

551
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,340
Cream powder.

552
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:02,340
This medicine is bitter, bitter, and cold.

553
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,340
It's toxic and hard to get.

554
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,340
So we can rule out it's food poisoning.

555
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:11,340
But this person must have been planning for a long time.

556
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,340
Maybe

557
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,340
he knew who the poison was.

558
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,340
He just didn't say it.

559
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,340
If he has a cold,

560
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,340
he can't practice internal power, can he?

561
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,340
Of course.

562
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:30,340
People with a cold are not good at practicing internal power.

563
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,340
If he's not careful,

564
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,340
he will have a cold

565
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:38,340
and die of sudden death.

566
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,340
He's the second daughter of the Rong family in Longyin City.

567
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,340
He's been carefree since he was a child.

568
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,340
How could he have a cold?

569
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,340
That year,

570
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,340
sister's mother was hunted down

571
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,340
and forced to be born in the cold lake.

572
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,340
So when sister was born,

573
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,340
her body was cold.

574
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,340
Fortunately, her father gave her a lot of gold to ask for medicine.

575
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,340
Otherwise,

576
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,340
she would have gone with her mother.

577
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,340
But

578
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,340
although sister survived,

579
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,340
she was in pain every time

580
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,340
she had a cold.

581
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,340
She suffered a lot since she was a child.

582
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,340
Here.

583
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,340
The doctor will check your pulse.

584
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,340
Is it better?

585
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,340
I don't need to check my pulse.

586
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,340
It's a good sign

587
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,340
that you have a good pulse.

588
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,340
It's not bad.

589
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,340
But remember,

590
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,340
take the medicine on time.

591
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,340
Otherwise, the wound will recur

592
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,340
and you will have a severe fever.

593
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,340
I'll check your pulse.

594
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:54,340
I think your internal power is not ordinary.

595
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,340
But...

596
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,340
It's...

597
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,340
What is it?

598
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,340
It's...

599
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,340
Nothing.

600
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,340
I...

601
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,340
I...

602
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,340
I sometimes make mistakes.

603
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,340
Make mistakes.

604
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,340
No.

605
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,340
Just say what you want to say.

606
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,340
Although

607
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,340
your martial arts

608
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,340
are very high,

609
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,340
I'm afraid that

610
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,340
if you want to improve,

611
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:32,340
you will be in trouble.

612
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,340
Unless

613
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:40,340
you know where you are.

614
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,340
What does it mean?

615
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,340
Don't be so ridiculous.

616
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,340
You are so young.

617
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,340
What are you talking about?

618
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,340
I want to go to the temple.

619
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,340
Is there any sign of fusion?

620
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,340
Master.

621
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,180
What does this mean?

622
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,940
Lingxu Pavilion sent someone to send it.

623
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,860
They will welcome it with good words

624
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,180
and take care of the disciples of Longyin City for us.

625
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:47,380
I think

626
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,860
the disciples we sent to investigate

627
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:49,740
are still alive.

628
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,860
The disciples of the Kongzi Hall will be killed

629
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,300
by the poison teeth of the evil.

630
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,780
Now they can't even die.

631
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,140
It seems that Lingxu Pavilion's means are really fierce.

632
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:04,180
They can't live or die.

633
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:05,980
What?

634
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,300
Master, don't worry.

635
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,020
I think Lingxu Pavilion

636
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,620
can't get any information

637
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,060
before they make such a plan.

638
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:18,820
What should we do next?

639
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,180
People are in the hands of Lingxu Pavilion.

640
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,060
Of course we can't do anything.

641
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,700
Don't reveal it yet.

642
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,740
I let them in Lingxu Pavilion

643
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,860
and didn't plan to let them come back alive.

644
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,940
Now it's more important to be in the city.

645
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,660
I'll go to the whereabouts of Ronghua.

646
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,580
We should investigate the matter of the seniors as soon as possible.

647
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,300
We can't let them escape.

648
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,500
Say it.

649
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,940
If you tell me earlier,

650
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,020
I can spare your life.

651
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,700
As long as you write down what you know,

652
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,420
I'll send someone to send you back to Longyin City.

653
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,340
If I knew it,

654
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,060
I wouldn't have to die.

655
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,260
What's going on?

656
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,020
Madam,

657
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,180
it's the poison god.

658
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,580
Longyin City is really vicious.

659
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,900
He even didn't let his disciples go.

660
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,740
No wonder he didn't make any move.

661
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,820
It turns out that the time of death is coming.

662
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,820
Even if Lingxu Pavilion doesn't make a move,

663
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,620
he will be poisoned and die.

664
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,460
It seems that Longyin City is a dead city.

665
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,300
It's all about death.

666
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,300
Even if there is no poison,

667
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,180
he will never reveal any information.

668
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,540
You go and arrange it.

669
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,540
Let him enter the land.

670
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,660
Everyone has

671
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,500
done nothing wrong.

672
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,380
Do you have any news about Young Master?

673
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:35,780
Master,

674
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:36,900
there is no news yet.

675
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,300
Master,

676
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,180
the doctor said

677
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,580
you can't be sick anymore.

678
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,100
If you want to continue your life,

679
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,580
you can try to eat the flower beads.

680
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:46,820
Now,

681
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,980
Young Master has not returned.

682
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,500
You must take care of yourself.

683
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,980
You have to make a decision as soon as possible.

684
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,260
So what if I get the flower beads?

685
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:57,660
It's just a life-or-death method.

686
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,660
Flower beads

687
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:08,060
are made of a strange flower plant.

688
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,060
The flowers bloom in two seasons.

689
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,380
Once they bloom,

690
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,820
blood is all over the place.

691
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:18,060
Every year, one flower bead can be refined.

692
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:19,940
Once it blooms again,

693
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:21,500
it will be white and white.

694
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,540
It can be used as a antidote.

695
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:27,900
Once the flower bead

696
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,900
is in the patient's body,

697
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,900
it will be used as a host

698
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,660
to survive.

699
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,460
That's why it will

700
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,500
quickly repair the patient's wounds.

701
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,300
At the same time,

702
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:45,740
the good part of the patient's body

703
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,100
will also be swallowed.

704
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,500
Until the end,

705
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,700
the host will be emptied.

706
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,500
The flower bead is so dangerous.

707
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:57,900
Why is it so dangerous

708
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,100
to be killed by the enemy?

709
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:02,140
Someone must have been to Longyin City to beg for mercy.

710
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,400
Come out.

711
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,900
I will be your friend forever.

712
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,900
I will be your friend forever.

713
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,900
I will be your friend forever.

714
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,900
I will be your friend forever.

715
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:09,900
I will be your friend forever.

716
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,900
I will be your friend forever.

717
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:13,900
I will be your friend forever.

718
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:15,900
I will be your friend forever.

719
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,900
I will be your friend forever.

720
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,900
I will be your friend forever.

721
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,900
I will be your friend forever.

722
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,900
I will be your friend forever.

723
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,900
I will be your friend forever.

724
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,900
I will be your friend forever.

725
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,900
I will be your friend forever.
