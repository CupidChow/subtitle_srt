1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,520
Got it.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We are in love

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
A moment of flowers, a moment of spring

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I always come and go, you are not here

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You don't understand

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
How much love

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The most beautiful flower, I have a pair of eyes

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,100
Behind the

9
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,020
murky

10
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:07,700
じゃ

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I fry

12
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:14,100
Hey all

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,120
I am

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,280
I

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,400
I

16
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,400
The Long Ballad

17
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,400
Episode 16

18
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,400
Who are you?

19
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,400
You're a shameless thing.

20
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,400
How dare you show up here?

21
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,400
It's you.

22
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,400
You...

23
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,400
That person...

24
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,400
Get lost!

25
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,400
Get away from me!

26
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,400
In this town,

27
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,400
there are not only people from Longyin City.

28
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,400
My disciples have surrounded this place.

29
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,400
If you dare to act rashly,

30
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,400
I guarantee you will be ill.

31
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,400
You will not be able to come back.

32
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,400
I thought

33
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,400
the Grand Priest of Lingxu Pavilion would be as evil as his enemy.

34
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,400
When you see me,

35
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,400
you will definitely give me a blow.

36
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,400
What?

37
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,400
You won't let me touch the Moon of Nalan?

38
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,400
You don't deserve to die under my knife.

39
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,400
Besides, the pain of the world

40
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,400
is not as easy as death.

41
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,400
You haven't tasted the pain of the world.

42
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,400
How can I let you see the Lord of the Wild?

43
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,400
I'm afraid that before I die,

44
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,400
you young masters won't be able to hold on.

45
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,400
I'm afraid that you won't be able to hold on.

46
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,400
I told you to get lost!

47
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,400
A'Yu!

48
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
How are you?

49
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,400
I can still control the power of the mortal for now.

50
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,400
But now,

51
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,400
I'm afraid that it's more dangerous than outside in the inn.

52
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,400
I have to hurry over.

53
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,400
Don't worry.

54
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
The hidden weapons are there.

55
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,400
There will be no trial.

56
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,400
But you...

57
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,400
Our plan to attack Longyin City has worked.

58
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,400
Rong Jingfeng doesn't dare to step out of Longyin City.

59
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,400
He must be afraid.

60
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,400
I'm afraid that he will be afraid.

61
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,400
We need to think about how to get justice back.

62
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,400
Ming'er, follow me back to the North.

63
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,400
The poison of the Red Flower Bead can't be ignored.

64
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,400
You have to follow me back no matter what.

65
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,400
A'Yu!

66
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,400
A'Yu!

67
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,400
You stopped me from returning the flower.

68
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,400
I don't want him to see me like this.

69
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,400
A'Yu, where are you?

70
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,400
A'Yu!

71
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,400
I promise you.

72
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,400
I'll go back with you.

73
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,400
I'll go back with you.

74
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,400
Don't do anything for fun.

75
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,400
You'll suffer from the pain of being skinned.

76
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
I just want to see my aunt.

77
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,400
There are so many of you.

78
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,400
How can I escape?

79
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,400
Master ordered me to keep an eye on you.

80
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,400
If you insist on resisting,

81
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,400
don't blame me for being rude.

82
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,400
You guys can stop me?

83
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Calm down.

84
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,400
If it weren't for the young master's order,

85
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,400
I would have been killed and avenged for the master.

86
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,400
Anyway, your young master is not here.

87
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,400
If you want to avenge,

88
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,400
just come here.

89
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,400
I'll go.

90
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,400
Get up.

91
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
I want to see Zi Yan.

92
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,400
I didn't expect...

93
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,400
Lin Yin.

94
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,400
Dalan Yue and Rong Hua would be so careless.

95
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,400
No one in this huge room can stand it.

96
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,400
You...

97
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,400
You worked so hard

98
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,400
to get into Longyin City.

99
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,400
You saw Longyin City fall into danger.

100
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,400
You saw it.

101
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
You saw it.

102
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,400
You saw it.

103
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,400
You saw Longyin City fall into danger.

104
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,400
You are involved in the case.

105
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,400
You are involved in the scheme.

106
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,400
What's your plan?

107
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,400
What's my plan?

108
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,400
What's my plan?

109
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,400
My family has been defeated.

110
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
All the bandits in the world

111
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
can ride on my head and make a fool of themselves.

112
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,400
Tell me.

113
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,400
How can I act like this?

114
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,400
No matter what,

115
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,400
I have to take the position of Mei.

116
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,400
But I have nothing now.

117
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,400
So this trap

118
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,400
is to replace Longyin City.

119
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,400
You are despicable.

120
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,400
Despicable?

121
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,400
Why don't I feel it?

122
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,400
You saved my life before.

123
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,400
I could have spared you.

124
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,400
I could have spared you.

125
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,400
But you know too much.

126
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,400
Only the dead

127
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,400
can be quiet forever.

128
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
You...

129
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,400
Senior.

130
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,400
What's going on?

131
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,400
Senior.

132
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,400
Where is Bai?

133
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
You...

134
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,400
What's going on? Senior.

135
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,400
Zi Yan.

136
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,400
Zi Yan.

137
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,400
Move.

138
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,400
What's going on?

139
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,400
Zi Yan.

140
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,400
Zi Yan.

141
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,400
What's going on?

142
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,400
Zi Yan.

143
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,400
Zi Yan.

144
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,400
Zi Yan.

145
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,400
Xiao Yi.

146
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,400
Hold on.

147
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,400
I can't let you die.

148
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,400
Xiao Yi.

149
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,400
Xiao Yi.

150
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,400
The medicine I gave you must be useful.

151
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,400
Hold on.

152
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,400
Xiao Yi.

153
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,400
What's going on?

154
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,400
Xiao Yi.

155
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,400
Xiao Yi.

156
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,400
Zi Yan.

157
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,400
Xiao Yi.

158
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,400
Xiao Yi.

159
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,400
Zi Yan.

160
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,400
Xiao Yi.

161
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
Xiao Yi.

162
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,400
What's going on?

163
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,400
Xiao Yi.

164
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,400
Xiao Yi.

165
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,400
Xiao Yi.

166
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,400
How dare you?

167
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,400
What did you do to Zi Yan?

168
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,400
Zi Yan.

169
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,400
What was our promise?

170
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,400
You've been hatred-ridden in Longyin City.

171
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,400
Not on Zi Yan.

172
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,400
You had no choice but to suffer.

173
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,400
Xiao Yi.

174
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,400
How could you be so heartless?

175
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,400
Yan.

176
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,400
Why am I here?

177
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,400
This must be a misunderstanding.

178
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,400
I just want an explanation.

179
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,400
What did you do to him?

180
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,400
You suspect An Yue?

181
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,400
Answer me!

182
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,400
Answer me!

183
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,400
Na Lan Yue!

184
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,400
Answer me!

185
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,400
Answer me!

186
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,400
Master said

187
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,400
Xiao Yi was saved by internal force

188
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,400
because of the needle in his heart.

189
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,400
The person who did it didn't give him a single tear.

190
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,400
Why would it be like this?

191
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,400
Now Master is in great pain.

192
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,400
How can I persuade him to not listen?

193
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,400
Master.

194
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,400
Master.

195
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,400
Master.

196
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,400
Master.

197
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,400
What happened?

198
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,400
I don't know.

199
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,400
I just want to ask you.

200
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,400
What happened in the inn?

201
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,400
You and I

202
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,400
went through all the ups and downs.

203
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,400
How much did we sacrifice

204
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,400
for each other?

205
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,400
How much did we pay?

206
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,400
Did you think it through?

207
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,400
If you ask the exit,

208
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,400
the trust between us

209
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,400
will be broken.

210
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,400
I don't want to see the truth either.

211
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,400
As long as you deny it,

212
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,400
I will choose to believe

213
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,400
and not be suspicious.

214
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,400
Choose to believe?

215
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
All the people in the world said

216
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,400
I killed the sect leaders.

217
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,400
You didn't have a chance to prove it.

218
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,400
When I killed the sect leaders,

219
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,400
you stood on my side.

220
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,400
But this time you doubted me.

221
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,400
If you knew I did it,

222
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,400
what's the point of what I said?

223
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,400
I always believed you.

224
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,400
But during the Flower Sea,

225
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,400
you didn't kill the sect leaders.

226
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,400
But my aunt was different.

227
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,400
My aunt was different?

228
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,400
She went to Lingxu Pavilion.

229
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,400
You treated her...

230
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,400
Your aunt was different.

231
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,400
I have a grudge against her.

232
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,400
I have the motive to kill her.

233
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,400
What do you want to say?

234
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,400
Before,

235
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,400
all the people in the world

236
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,400
were surrounded by Longyin City

237
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,400
and forced to eat the flower beads.

238
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,400
I accompanied you back to the city.

239
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,400
Did I have any doubts

240
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,400
when I faced Rong Jinfang?

241
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,400
Lingxu Pavilion was destroyed.

242
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,400
You were caught by the people in Longyin City.

243
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,400
I saved you regardless of everything.

244
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,400
Did I hesitate at all?

245
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,400
And my mother's death.

246
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,400
In order to save you,

247
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,400
my mother was killed

248
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,400
with the flower beads.

249
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,400
I asked myself several times.

250
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,400
If this happened again,

251
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,400
what would I do?

252
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,400
But the answer in my heart

253
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,400
is always you.

254
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,400
No matter how many times I choose,

255
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,400
I will choose to save you.

256
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,400
My love for you

257
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,400
will never change

258
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,400
in my whole life.

259
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,400
But you?

260
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,400
I'm sorry.

261
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,400
I'm sorry.

262
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,400
I know

263
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,400
no matter how I feel guilty,

264
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,400
I can't change

265
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,400
the fact of Lingxu Pavilion.

266
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,400
But now I only hope

267
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,400
you are safe.

268
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,400
As long as you are safe,

269
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,400
your mother will be safe.

270
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,400
There will be less killing in the martial arts world

271
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,400
and less hatred.

272
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,400
Hatred?

273
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
The way to get rid of hatred

274
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,400
is not only you, me and you.

275
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,400
You are right.

276
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,400
There are many ways

277
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,400
to get rid of hatred and get justice.

278
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,400
But now you

279
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,400
have doubts about me.

280
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,400
If not,

281
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,400
you wouldn't have asked me

282
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,400
and asked me to deny.

283
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,400
But

284
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,400
I'm not the kind of person

285
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,400
who only wants revenge.

286
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,400
I only want justice

287
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,400
and justice.

288
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,400
Are you satisfied with

289
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,400
this answer?

290
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,400
Yue,

291
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,400
I always believe you.

292
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,400
But I'm afraid

293
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,400
you are not the same person you used to be.

294
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,400
Cang Qi,

295
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,400
prepare a good coffin

296
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,400
and take some disciples with me

297
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,400
to send Zi Yan's body

298
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,400
to Longyin City.

299
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,400
Yes.

300
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,400
Na Laoyue, stop!

301
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,400
Stop pretending!

302
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,400
I will send Zi Yan back to Longyin City.

303
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,400
I can't let anyone use him again.

304
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,400
What are you doing?

305
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,400
Let go of me!

306
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,400
Bastard!

307
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,400
Have you arranged everything?

308
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,400
Everything is according to your arrangement.

309
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,400
Everything is according to your arrangement.

310
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,400
Everything is arranged.

311
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,400
Okay.

312
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,400
Yue,

313
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,400
take this.

314
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,400
I promised you

315
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,400
I would take Zi Yan to this place

316
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,400
and treat him.

317
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,400
Now we are in this situation,

318
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,400
I can't explain to the City Leader.

319
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,400
It's better if you kill me now.

320
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,400
Take good care of him.

321
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,400
The dog raised in Longyin City

322
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
should be taught by its master

323
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,400
in person.

324
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,400
Master.

325
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,400
What a big man!

326
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,400
I always thought he was a decent man.

327
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,400
Who knew he was a despicable man?

328
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,400
What right does he have

329
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,400
to send Zi Yan back?

330
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,400
I will kill him sooner or later!

331
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,400
You are a man of your word!

332
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,400
You are a man of your word!

333
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,400
You are a man of your word!

334
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,400
You are a man of your word!

335
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,400
You are a man of your word!

336
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,400
I will kill him sooner or later!

337
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,400
Master,

338
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,400
calm down.

339
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,400
Now Brother Lu cares about my reputation,

340
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,400
he won't make things difficult for us.

341
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,400
But don't talk nonsense anymore.

342
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,400
I have something very important

343
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,400
to do now.

344
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,400
Please help me.

345
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,400
I'm talking nonsense?

346
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,400
You mean I can't kill him?

347
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,400
Before we find out the truth,

348
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,400
let's not talk nonsense.

349
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,400
What do you mean?

350
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,400
Did you find out something?

351
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,400
I went to Yi's room.

352
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,400
There was no sign of a fight.

353
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,400
If Yue really wants to kill Yi,

354
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,400
there is no sign of a fight.

355
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,400
It's just a sneak attack.

356
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,400
But why did Yi

357
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,400
try to escape from that room?

358
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,400
That's right.

359
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,400
Since Zi Yan escaped from the inn,

360
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,400
it means that

361
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,400
there must have been a fight.

362
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,400
He escaped from the inn

363
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,400
and that means

364
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,400
he must have been injured.

365
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,400
This is very strange.

366
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,400
We must find out the truth

367
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,400
and explain it to Yi.

368
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,400
In your opinion,

369
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,400
the truth you suspect

370
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,400
is not like what we think.

371
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,400
Or

372
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,400
you just want to

373
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,400
clear up the suspicion for Nalan Yue?

374
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,400
Master,

375
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,400
how can you say that?

376
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,400
Yi has loved me so much since he was a child.

377
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,400
He is like a mother.

378
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,400
Besides,

379
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,400
he and Yue are both

380
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,400
very important to me.

381
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,400
For the sake of them,

382
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,400
I have to find the real murderer.

383
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,400
It seems that your aunt

384
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,400
loves you for nothing.

385
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,400
By the way,

386
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,400
you just said

387
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,400
you wanted me to help you.

388
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,400
What's the matter?

389
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,400
I want to go back to Longyin City.

390
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,400
You go back to Longyin City?

391
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,400
Then your father...

392
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,400
I will find a way

393
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,400
to help my father.

394
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,400
I was too impulsive.

395
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,400
I suspected Yue.

396
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,400
He must be very upset.

397
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,400
I don't know

398
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,400
what he is thinking.

399
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,400
He must be very upset.

400
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,400
I have to find evidence

401
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,400
to prove his innocence.

402
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,400
This matter

403
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,400
can only be solved in Longyin City.

404
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,400
Now only

405
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,400
Master can help me.

406
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,400
What's your plan?

407
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
The priority

408
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,400
is to get Sister A out first.

409
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,400
Girl, have you thought it over?

410
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,400
Your father treats you differently.

411
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,400
Now that Ziyan has left,

412
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,400
no one is supporting him in the city.

413
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,400
I'm afraid

414
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,400
the future will be more difficult.

415
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,400
Don't worry, Master.

416
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,400
I know what I'm doing.

417
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,400
I understand

418
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,400
how precious your death is.

419
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,400
Now Longyin City is in danger.

420
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,400
I don't want anyone

421
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,400
to be hurt again.

422
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,400
No matter how dangerous it is,

423
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,400
I must go back.

424
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,400
Good.

425
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,400
Girl,

426
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,400
since you've made up your mind,

427
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,400
I'll go back with you.

428
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,400
Now that it's come to this,

429
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,400
do you still believe in God?

430
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,400
Your mistress,

431
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,400
my aunt,

432
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,400
they are not evil.

433
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,400
They are all evil.

434
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,400
But they are all ungrateful.

435
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,400
I don't know if I don't know you well

436
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,400
or I misjudged you.

437
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,400
You are not heartless.

438
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,400
How could you do this for Ziyan?

439
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,400
He treats me

440
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,400
as if he doesn't care about Rong Hua.

441
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,400
But he cares about me.

442
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,400
I just want to ask him.

443
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,400
I want to be with Rong Hua.

444
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,400
I don't understand.

445
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,400
I can understand

446
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,400
what Nalan Yue did.

447
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,400
It's up to the sky

448
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,400
to decide.

449
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,400
What happened today

450
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,400
is not what you see.

451
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,400
I just don't want to explain.

452
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,400
If it was the old Nalan Yue,

453
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,400
he wouldn't kill anyone.

454
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,400
But if he was turned into a demon

455
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,400
by the Reversal Division,

456
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,400
it wouldn't be so.

457
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,400
Don't be afraid.

458
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,400
Everyone is different.

459
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,400
Even if he goes to hell,

460
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,400
you are still a human.

461
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,400
But Rong Jingfeng is different.

462
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,400
He is the demon.

463
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,400
He is a completely heartless demon.

464
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,400
Brother Lu.

465
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,400
I brought Master here

466
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,400
to heal my sister.

467
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,400
If he doesn't cure her,

468
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,400
she will be gone.

469
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,400
Young Madam has spoken.

470
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,400
I will follow her.

471
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,400
Please.

472
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,400
I will wait at the door.

473
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,400
If you need anything,

474
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,400
just tell me.

475
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,400
Thank you, Master.

476
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,400
Bear with it.

477
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,400
It hurts.

478
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,400
Sister.

479
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,400
Master and I saved you.

480
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,400
Have you thought about joining us?

481
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,400
What do you mean?

482
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,400
I want to go back to Longyin City.

483
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,400
We will leave Meiyin together.

484
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,400
This time,

485
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,400
I will go back to Master.

486
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,400
The Reversal Division will go back to me.

487
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,400
Sister is still the leader of the Reversal Division.

488
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,400
I don't want to

489
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,400
fall into the hands of others.

490
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,400
Why did you do that?

491
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,400
If you help me escape,

492
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,400
it means you betrayed Nalan Yue.

493
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,400
Nalan Yue is no longer the Lin Jing.

494
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,400
Now,

495
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,400
the girl is alone.

496
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,400
Even if you

497
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,400
let you go back to the city,

498
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,400
you can't fight against Meiyin

499
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,400
with your own strength.

500
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,400
No matter what,

501
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,400
Longyin City is also known as Rong.

502
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,400
Now,

503
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,400
it's time for you two

504
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,400
to fight against each other.

505
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,400
Meiyin is so cunning.

506
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,400
Father has been blinded by her.

507
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,400
We can't let her go.

508
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,400
I didn't expect

509
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,400
you and my sister

510
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,400
would have a joint operation.

511
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,400
Go.

512
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,400
You are really brave.

513
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,400
You brought so few people

514
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,400
to break into my Longyin City.

515
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,400
Today,

516
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,400
I don't think you dare to do it easily.

517
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,400
I am the head of Longyin City.

518
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,400
Why should I dare not?

519
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,400
It's just an act of falsehood.

520
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,400
Now,

521
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,400
I have the body of Zi Yan.

522
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,400
If you want to

523
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,400
make the disciples in the city

524
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,400
turn against the law,

525
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,400
he can start the war.

526
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,400
OK.

527
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,400
What do you want?

528
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,400
The dead are the greatest.

529
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,400
Next time,

530
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,400
I will personally prepare

531
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,400
an empty coffin for the City Leader.

532
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,400
Go.

533
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,400
No one is guarding outside.

534
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,400
Hua'er and I

535
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,400
will leave on our own.

536
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,400
Be careful on the road.

537
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,400
See you in Longyin City.

538
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,400
OK.

539
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,400
I will go.

540
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,400
OK.

541
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,400
I will go.

542
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,400
OK.

543
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,400
I will go.

544
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,400
OK.

545
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,400
I will go.

546
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,400
OK.

547
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,400
I will go.

548
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,400
See you in Longyin City.

549
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,400
Stop!

550
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,400
What are you doing?

551
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,400
Catch him!

552
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,400
Oh no!

553
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,400
Don't run!

554
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,400
Stop!

555
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,400
How did you get here?

556
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,400
I was on the road.

557
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,400
I was waiting for you.

558
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,400
I was waiting for you.

559
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,400
I was waiting for you.

560
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,400
I was waiting for you.

561
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,400
I was waiting for you.

562
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,400
I was waiting for you.

563
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,400
Let's go!

564
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,400
I was waiting for you.

565
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,400
It seems that you have decided

566
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,400
to marry me.

567
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,400
Your behavior is like playing chess.

568
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,400
You are blind and self-confident.

569
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,400
Do you think

570
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,400
no one is guarding you?

571
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,400
I will not.

572
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,400
You should guard it.

573
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,400
Not just me.

574
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,860
Go back and premier

575
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,880
She can't go ÜFF

576
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:41,800
Dad

577
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,480
by us.

578
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,440
Stop.

579
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:45,800
Just listen.

580
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,560
All of you,

581
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,680
listen.

582
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,400
You still choose your know-how

583
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,480
about Longyin Sub caramel, right?

584
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,520
Parents, listen to me

585
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,440
24K people dungeon is guard up front.

586
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,120
No one can get out

587
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,360
before sunset.

588
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,880
carrying the

589
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:24,120
honor of a

590
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,560
confidant

591
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,680
From the end

592
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,180
my Zhonghai action

593
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,200
oxide of Lin family

594
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,560
Yue,

595
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,880
you never want to explain to me.

596
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,720
I'm sure you've made up your mind.

597
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,560
You won't come back.

598
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,480
You let her misunderstand on purpose

599
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,160
and force her to leave.

600
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,400
You'd rather hurt her than explain.

601
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,240
Are you doing this for her

602
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,160
or for yourself?

603
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,840
If it were you,

604
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,480
what would you do?

605
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,760
It's time to go back to the Lin Clan.

606
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,280
I don't know

607
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,720
how long I can last.

608
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,160
But you're doing this.

609
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,480
Don't you regret it?

610
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,880
I'm not here anymore.

611
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,160
No matter how much I've done,

612
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,560
I can't get it back.

613
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,560
Are you really worth it

614
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,600
for insisting on this?

615
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:45,960
I used to

616
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,320
think that I had no other choice

617
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,520
but to hate.

618
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,640
I even tried to persuade my mother

619
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,120
to give up revenge.

620
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,600
But what did I get in return?

621
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,480
We have nothing now.

622
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,640
Instead of letting Rong Hua

623
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,000
worry about me every day,

624
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,400
I'd rather

625
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,440
break this love earlier.

626
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,600
After all,

627
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,080
we still have

628
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,600
so many lives left.

629
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,160
We can't just let it

630
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,280
go like nothing happened.

631
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,280
I'm sorry to trouble you.

632
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,720
Aren't you the same?

633
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,760
You broke that love long ago, didn't you?

634
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,400
Peters are the best.

635
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:38,960
Yes.

636
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,320
Should they

637
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,200
come back to Longyin City now?

638
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,200
Don't say that.

639
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,320
You knew that he asked Xuan Ye

640
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:54,920
to pick you up

641
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,360
and to drag you here.

642
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,720
Why didn't you

643
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,600
let him go

644
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,000
and let the Sir Guan

645
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,160
play the show with you?

646
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,160
I don't think so.

647
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,160
I don't think so.

648
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,160
If I don't do this,

649
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,160
how can I let her give up?

650
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,160
I didn't expect

651
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,160
she would think about it.

652
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,760
The arrangement is quite thorough.

653
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,160
I'm afraid she's already prepared.

654
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,160
I'm afraid she's not ready yet.

655
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,160
I'm afraid she's not ready yet.

656
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,160
I'm afraid

657
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,160
the future is more uncertain.

658
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,160
Who knows

659
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,160
what will happen

660
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,160
when the time comes?

661
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,160
There's a long way to go.

662
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,160
Let's go.

663
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,160
Go.

664
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,160
Su'er,

665
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,160
I'm sorry for what you've done.

666
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,160
Let's go.

667
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,160
Let's go home.

668
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,160
Go.

669
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,160
Go.

670
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,160
Go.

671
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,160
Go.

672
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,160
Go.

673
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,160
Go.

674
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,160
Go.

675
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,160
Go.

676
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,160
Go.

677
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,160
Go.

678
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,160
Go.

679
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,160
Go.

680
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,160
Let's go home.

681
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,160
Thank you, City Leader.

682
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,160
Rong Jingfeng,

683
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,160
you're so stupid.

684
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,160
She's your daughter.

685
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,160
If this traitor dares to take another step forward,

686
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,160
you'll be killed.

687
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,160
City Leader, don't.

688
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,160
From now on,

689
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,160
you're the only daughter I have.

690
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,160
And my Hua'er is dead.

691
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,160
Hua'er.

692
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,160
Father,

693
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,160
you can complete the task.

694
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,160
But what about my aunt?

695
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,160
Who's responsible for her death?

696
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,160
You still have the face to mention your aunt?

697
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,160
You should know

698
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,160
that your aunt is not a woman.

699
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,160
She was killed by this Na Lanyue.

700
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,160
And you...

701
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,160
I'm back this time

702
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,160
to find out the truth

703
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,160
and find the murderer.

704
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,160
City Leader,

705
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,160
in order to save me,

706
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,160
you and Na Lanyue are separated.

707
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,160
My aunt's revenge

708
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,160
will be avenged by us.

709
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,160
So,

710
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,160
for my aunt's sake,

711
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,160
let her go into the city first.

712
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,160
Yes.

713
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,160
Hua'er,

714
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,160
have you thought it through?

715
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,160
It's not that easy

716
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,160
to turn back

717
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,160
after you're in the gate.

718
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,160
How can I turn back?

719
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,160
I have to go.

720
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,160
I will go.

721
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,160
Luckily, you're here

722
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,160
so I can get the funeral done.

723
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,160
If I were you,

724
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,160
I wouldn't be so complicit.

725
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,160
and take care of the city.

726
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,000
I'm in charge of the martial arts world.

727
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,920
I manage the city with my aunt.

728
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,080
Although we are sisters,

729
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,720
we are not close.

730
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,920
We are always together.

731
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,480
We grew up in different places.

732
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,360
We have different thoughts.

733
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,040
We have different paths.

734
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,680
The longer we stay together,

735
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,520
the farther we grow apart.

736
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,160
No matter what,

737
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,320
aunt has raised us.

738
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,760
She is like our birth mother.

739
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,680
Longying City

740
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,040
is our family after all.

741
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,480
naszych

742
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,360
Who are you?

743
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,400
It'sMusi cation website.

744
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,760
Unrushed.

745
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,800
I've been shelling you!

746
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,160
You don't know me?

747
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,160
I'm willing to give up my life for you

748
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:33,160
If love is not a dream, a smile, and a promise

749
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:37,160
A night of love, a knife in my hand

750
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,160
Let the years pass by

751
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:45,160
I don't care if I die or not

752
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:48,160
I'll always be with you

753
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,160
