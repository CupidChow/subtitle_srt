00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The King Of Blaze

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The King Of Blaze

4
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Episode 16

5
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So that's how it is.

6
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But in the past years,

7
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
the time to release the antidote was different.

8
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But this time, it's released in unison.

9
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So some people

10
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
take the antidote early.

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's okay.

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The poison of the Chihua Pearl.

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
No matter when you take it,

14
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
it will only be released in the cold.

15
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
As long as you take this medicine before the cold,

16
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
it's okay.

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You don't care about the early days.

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Why do you have so many problems today?

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm just thinking,

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
if you can't get the antidote,

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
it will be a big trouble.

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The time to release the poison is tonight.

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yes.

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
There's no way.

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The rest of the lives

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and the lives of the people

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
are all in the hands of the King Of Blaze.

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You...

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You...

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You...

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You...

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You're not talking to me, are you?

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's none of my business.

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You're the only one who said it.

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
If the King Of Blaze wants to investigate it,

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
you should take all the responsibility.

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I...

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I didn't say anything.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
No, no, no.

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Wait for me.

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Something's wrong.

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
There's an ambush around.

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The closer to Longyin City, the more dangerous it is.

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It seems that someone is trying to stop us from entering the city.

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So you let Xuan Ye take the headmaster first.

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Then we'll be in the light.

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
They'll be in the dark.

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We won't miss the time he entered Longyin City.

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The day of release of the poison has come.

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The headmaster must get the antidote tonight.

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's all because my wounds are too big.

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I can only do what I can.

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
In this case, Miss Rong owes me again.

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We're too close together.

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Let's split up and distract the enemy.

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,620
Then we'll kill the

57
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,000
Miss Rong, you're really a strong-minded person.

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You're really good at it.

59
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
We're both injured.

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
If we delay each other,

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
we'll only make the odds smaller.

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
We'll meet outside the main temple and never see each other again.

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Xuan Ye,

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
you're here.

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm here.

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm here.

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Headmaster, hang in there.

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Chief Rong arranged this

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
to distract the enemy.

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I didn't expect to be ambushed.

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Headmaster,

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
the poison of the Chihua Bead in the cold winter

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
has started to spread.

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Now there are chase soldiers.

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
We can't send you back to Longyin City.

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What should I do?

77
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I... I don't want to die.

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You're from Longyin City.

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You have to send the antidote back.

80
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Don't worry, headmaster.

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Chief Rong has arranged it.

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
If we can't send you back to Longyin City on time,

83
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
someone will send the antidote back.

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
When we were surrounded,

85
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I sent the letter out.

86
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Someone will pick us up later.

87
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Chief Rong is so thoughtful.

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Headmaster, let's go.

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Go.

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Come on.

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Rong Su is so unreliable.

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
He can't even do such a small thing.

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Chief Rong,

94
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
the city chief

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
hasn't left the city yet.

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
How could this happen?

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Now,

98
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
the leaders of the cities haven't left.

99
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
They are busy with their own affairs.

100
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Who will send the antidote back?

101
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The safety of the city is important.

102
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's not allowed to send the antidote back.

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We can't let anyone else do it.

104
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You guys guard Longyin City.

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'll go there myself.

106
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
We will protect the safety of the city.

107
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
But this time,

108
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
it's too dangerous.

109
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So you should be careful.

110
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I don't agree.

111
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Why?

112
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Anyone can go there.

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You can't go there.

114
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's so bad outside.

115
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The weather is bad.

116
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
How dare you go there?

117
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Besides,

118
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
no one knows what's going on there.

119
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Even Rong Su can't solve it.

120
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
How can you go there?

121
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I don't agree.

122
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I don't agree.

123
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Then,

124
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
who can take the responsibility?

125
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
She?

126
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Let her go.

127
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
She's young and strong.

128
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
She's skilled.

129
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
She can handle the trouble.

130
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Listen,

131
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
if you lose the antidote this time,

132
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
you'll have to pay for it with your life.

133
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You're my good apprentice.

134
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You never think about good things.

135
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You always come to me for bad things.

136
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Come here.

137
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm always in front of the victim.

138
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I have to be careful.

139
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You're skilled.

140
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You'll be fine.

141
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Go.

142
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Just take it as your last chance.

143
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'll be your apprentice.

144
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
No.

145
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Okay.

146
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Come here.

147
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You say it.

148
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Come here.

149
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
In this case,

150
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,580
I'm the owner of the

151
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,580
Holy Grail Hall.

152
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'll give you the antidote.

153
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'll get ready now.

154
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Get out of the city and get the horse ready.

155
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Don't worry.

156
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You led me here.

157
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I guess you're not going to take my life.

158
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You stole the Chihua Bead

159
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
under the order of Master Tang.

160
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Should I treat you as my enemy or my friend?

161
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The enemy's enemy is someone.

162
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Otherwise, you wouldn't have

163
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
to worry about my family.

164
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I wonder how I cooperated

165
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
with you in that game.

166
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
If I'm not wrong,

167
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
you're the Miss of Longyin City,

168
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Rong Su.

169
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm Shi Jin.

170
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
How did you know my identity?

171
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
As you know,

172
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Master Rong has called all the masters

173
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
to Longyin City to get the antidote.

174
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But Master Xiao didn't come in

175
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
and trusted you.

176
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So you

177
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
should be careful.

178
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Miss Rong must be

179
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
the one in Longyin City.

180
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
In Longyin City,

181
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
there's no one else

182
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
but Miss Rong.

183
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Master Mei came to Longyin City

184
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
to get the Chihua Bead.

185
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
But he didn't even enter the gate

186
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
and was humiliated.

187
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Master Mei

188
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
was not like this.

189
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Don't you hate Longyin City?

190
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I hate Longyin City.

191
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
But I know that

192
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
there's no reason

193
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
to deny the antidote.

194
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The one who killed my father

195
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
is my real enemy.

196
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
The traitor colluded with Tang's family

197
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
and is now the leader.

198
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
But my family

199
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
was so defeated by him.

200
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
But he was in a state of panic.

201
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Now,

202
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
he's the leader of the Longyin City.

203
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Now,

204
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
although my father has died,

205
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I never forget

206
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
this grudge.

207
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I was humiliated by the Mei family.

208
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I didn't know who he was.

209
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I was lucky to get the help of Miss Rong.

210
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So I had a chance to take revenge.

211
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'll remember

212
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
this gratitude.

213
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I don't need to be so kind.

214
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I can take revenge.

215
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's not easy.

216
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'll help you get what you want.

217
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
But the consequence,

218
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
have you thought it over?

219
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
As long as I can take revenge,

220
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'll do whatever I want.

221
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I don't need you to die.

222
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Just remember,

223
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
the order of the second leader of the Mei family,

224
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Mr. Xiao,

225
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
was taken by you.

226
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Don't come back.

227
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
learn

228
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
learn Are you here, master?

229
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Master

230
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,280
Why are you here, Young Master?

231
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,640
Why can't I be here?

232
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,200
Second Master's...

233
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,440
No.

234
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,640
I should call you Master Xiao.

235
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,160
All these years,

236
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,040
you've been climbing up step by step

237
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,600
and getting into a mess.

238
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,160
I didn't expect

239
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,480
you ended up

240
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,880
going to Rongjiaqiu to get the Chihua Bead.

241
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,600
Do you think this is a kind of retribution?

242
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,320
No.

243
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,720
Young Master, you've misunderstood.

244
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,320
It was all planned by Tang Sect.

245
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,920
I was forced to do it.

246
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,520
I'll remember Master Mei's kindness forever.

247
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,120
Shut up!

248
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,720
You despicable scoundrel.

249
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,560
You're still turning the tables on me.

250
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,480
Go to the hell

251
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,360
and explain it to my father.

252
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,640
See if he'll forgive you.

253
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,840
Do you remember this dagger?

254
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,920
This is the gift you gave me on my birthday.

255
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,480
This dagger is as sharp as a knife.

256
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,160
If someone bullies me,

257
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,480
I can use it to protect the Mei family.

258
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,040
What are you doing?

259
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,640
All these years,

260
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,640
I've been thinking about this day.

261
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,760
I want you to take revenge.

262
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,120
If you keep acting like this,

263
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,680
I won't need any of them.

264
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,360
You must take the antidote

265
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,880
and send it to the little bear.

266
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:42,960
Yes.

267
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,840
No matter who you are,

268
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,120
you're here to stop me

269
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,720
for the antidote.

270
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,960
If you dare to shoot me again,

271
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,720
I'll destroy the antidote.

272
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,800
Tang Zhu, what should we do?

273
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,040
It's hard to kill a human.

274
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,600
We'll die together next year.

275
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,240
I don't want to lose.

276
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,560
I'll kill you.

277
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,280
I'll kill you.

278
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,640
I'll kill you.

279
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,000
I'll kill you.

280
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,440
I'll kill you.

281
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,440
I'll kill you.

282
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,440
I'll kill you.

283
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,440
I'll kill you.

284
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,440
I'll kill you.

285
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,440
I'll kill you.

286
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,440
I'll kill you.

287
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,760
Do you want me to go to the wall?

288
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,360
Anyway, tonight,

289
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,040
no one will leave alive.

290
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:51,920
Tang Zhu,

291
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,400
it's too late to say no more.

292
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,160
You've gone through many hardships.

293
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,560
I'll go to solve them.

294
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,640
You go to the wall.

295
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,240
Yes.

296
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,360
He showed up

297
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,360
yesterday alone.

298
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,480
Isn't that something?

299
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,560
Maybe he's always in here.

300
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,480
Tang Zhu.

301
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,560
Didn't I tell you

302
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,200
yesterday alone shouldn't late?

303
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,000
A missing people.

304
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,080
And he's never back.

305
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,680
Didn't I tell you

306
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,920
he went from one person to another?

307
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,360
What's the matter, rocket producing expert?

308
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,400
And he went from one to another?

309
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,240
What do you mean?

310
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,960
You'll fore breed守卫� figured out

311
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,880
My sister would never do something that's for nothing.

312
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,200
She delayed the time to take the antidote from the Sect Leader Xiao.

313
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,200
There must be another reason.

314
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,400
If Rong Su drags the Sect Leader Xiao out

315
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,560
and orders someone to send the antidote out,

316
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,520
is it really to trick him to take the antidote?

317
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,360
He must have set up an ambush on the way.

318
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,600
But why would he take the antidote without Chihua Bead?

319
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,200
But fortunately,

320
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,240
Lin Jing took the antidote.

321
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,320
Otherwise, something big would have happened.

322
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:29,880
Mei Yi!

323
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,360
Mei Yi!

324
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,160
Mei Yi!

325
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,040
Mei Yi!

326
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,920
Mei Yi!

327
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,920
Mei Yi!

328
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,000
Mei Yi!

329
00:16:39,920 --> 00:17:01,960
Mei Yi!

330
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,240
Mei Yi!

331
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,600
Mei Yi!

332
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,040
Let's go.

333
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,740
You did not even dare to kill me.

334
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,260
Youngاطруl.

335
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,820
He's indeed the forthgoing Hangzhou Hall Leader.

336
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,680
I've had my chance.

337
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,960
What happened?

338
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,960
Luckily, you're fine

339
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,960
I was too weak to get up

340
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,960
I was hiding in the dark

341
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,960
until the blood was spilled

342
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,960
I was worried you might be implicated

343
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,960
Now I can rest assured

344
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,960
But, Master Xiao is not alive

345
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,960
He came from the Mei family

346
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,960
Master Xiao died in the hands of Mei Ying

347
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,960
I hope Lin Jing won't be in danger

348
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,960
Luckily, you're fine

349
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,960
I'm fine

350
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,960
It's late

351
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,960
Why are you still so anxious?

352
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,960
No, I have to take care of this

353
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,960
If Mei Ying reveals your true identity

354
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,960
the consequences will be unimaginable

355
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,960
It's too late

356
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,960
When I returned to the city

357
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,960
Mei Ying was taken away by the disciples of the Bingsitang

358
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,960
Bingsitang?

359
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,960
Why didn't you stop her outside the city?

360
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,960
And bring her back?

361
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,960
Master Xiao's matter was planned by Rong Su

362
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,960
His purpose is to take the antidote of the Chihuahua Pig

363
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,960
And Mei Ying

364
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,960
is the only one who can testify for her lover

365
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,960
So I have to take her back to Longyin City

366
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,960
to accept your father and other people's interrogation

367
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,960
But you can't take the risk of your identity

368
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,960
I'm just being selfish this time

369
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,960
If she chooses to betray me

370
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,960
she will die

371
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,960
I don't believe

372
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,960
she dares to be the enemy of our whole Lingxu Pavilion

373
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,960
You're the stupid one

374
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,960
You really don't know how powerful my aunt is

375
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,960
No one can stay in her hands for a day

376
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,960
Then Rong Su can't be held back

377
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,960
You really don't know how serious the problem is

378
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,960
Okay

379
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,960
I'll get the medicine for Lu Yi Zhou first

380
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,960
Let's talk about it later

381
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,960
You

382
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,960
But

383
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,960
Okay, okay, okay

384
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,960
Master, don't worry

385
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,960
Although our plan failed this time

386
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,960
Lin Jing destroyed the antidote without permission

387
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,960
She won't escape the punishment of the City Master

388
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,960
Lin Jing

389
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,960
I was careless

390
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,960
and underestimated her ability

391
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,960
With her

392
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,960
Rong Hua and Sheng Zi Tang will be my confidants in the future

393
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,960
The most dangerous person now is not Lin Jing

394
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,960
But the one who was taken away by the Sickly Group

395
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,960
is the one who is the most dangerous

396
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,960
Mei Ying

397
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,960
Where is Mei Ying now?

398
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,960
Black house

399
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,960
Zi Yan

400
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,960
No one can hold Zi Yan in her hands for a day

401
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,960
I'm afraid Mei Ying can't stand the torture

402
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,960
and betray the City Master

403
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,960
Then we can only think of a way

404
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,960
to make her never open her mouth

405
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,960
I thought the famous Hall Leader of the Sickly Group

406
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,960
could have some smart means

407
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,960
I didn't expect such a cowardly person

408
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,960
You trapped me like this

409
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,960
Wei Mei underestimated my family

410
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,960
Are you out of your mind?

411
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,960
Young Master Mei

412
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,960
Do you know what this is?

413
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,960
If you enter the black house of the Long Ying City

414
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,960
death is the best ending

415
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,960
Mei Ying, I'll give you one last chance

416
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,960
You'd better confess

417
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,960
Who ordered you to assassinate the Hall Leader Xiao?

418
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,960
Killing that traitor

419
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,960
is to clear the door for my Mei family

420
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,960
Don't worry

421
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,960
I'll avenge my father

422
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,960
No need to be instructed

423
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,960
Stop playing tricks

424
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,960
Kill or kill, you'll be happy

425
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,960
Master, you've worked hard just now

426
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,960
I wonder how many hours

427
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,960
can this person last in the black house

428
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,960
The smoke in the black house

429
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,960
is more effective on people with higher martial arts

430
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,960
He dares to fight against the Long Ying City

431
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,960
He doesn't think the consequences

432
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,960
are too simple

433
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,960
Every person who enters the black house

434
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,960
is scared by the illusion caused by the smoke

435
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,960
Let's see if he can survive

436
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,960
Master, you're going to do it yourself

437
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,960
Of course there's no exception

438
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,960
It's just that

439
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,960
this time the Hall of Life and Death has lost the antidote

440
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,960
I don't know how the Hall Leader

441
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,960
will deal with it

442
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,960
The next door is out of town to deliver medicine

443
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,960
Although he was ambushed

444
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,960
he had to destroy the antidote

445
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,960
but he was also a death penalty

446
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,960
and he could not escape

447
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,960
The Hall Leader has his own plans

448
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,960
for how to deal with it

449
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,960
You and the disciples

450
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,960
don't make any more speculations

451
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,960
Yes

452
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,960
Sister

453
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,960
I thought

454
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,960
you were just trying to win the battle

455
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,960
I didn't expect that you would disregard the safety of the Long Ying City

456
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,960
for your own personal gain

457
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,960
Long Ying City has always been a rich and powerful city

458
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,960
with a great reputation

459
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,960
Rong Hua

460
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,960
have you forgotten how to show your respect

461
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,960
to me, your sister?

462
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,960
All disciples of Long Ying City

463
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,960
should show their respect to the Hall Leader

464
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,960
The Second Miss just wants to be on her guard

465
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,960
And you

466
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,960
have been following the Second Miss for a long time

467
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,960
and you're too bold to show your respect?

468
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,960
The one who holds the sword is black

469
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,960
The disciples who follow you

470
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,960
are also being rude and rude

471
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,960
I'm sorry

472
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,960
I'm sorry

473
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,960
I was too rude and rude

474
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,960
Sister, you're right

475
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,960
Greetings, Hall Leader of the Kongzi Hall

476
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,960
The Second Miss

477
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,960
Hurry up and bow

478
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,960
Greetings, Hall Leader

479
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,960
Don't think that you can get the Hall of Life

480
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,960
by relying on a man with unknown background

481
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,960
You have the right to be on my side

482
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,960
and you should have done it earlier

483
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,960
Hall Leader, you're too kind

484
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,960
No matter where I am

485
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,960
everything I do is for the Long Ying City

486
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,960
It's fine if you're the Hall Leader

487
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,960
and the disciples

488
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,960
As long as anyone betrays the Long Ying City

489
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,960
I won't let them off easily

490
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,960
Don't slander us, the Second Miss

491
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,960
You failed to do your duty in the Hall of Life

492
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,960
and ruined the antidote of Chihua City

493
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,960
Why are you still so annoying?

494
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,960
Why are you so anxious to make excuses?

495
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,960
Are you guilty of being a thief?

496
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,960
What do you mean?

497
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,960
Nothing

498
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,960
I'll have a reason to think after I see you

499
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,960
I'm going to see the Hall Leader too

500
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,960
If you destroy the antidote of Chihua City

501
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,960
and you can catch him

502
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,960
the Hall Leader will punish you severely

503
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,960
No one can save him this time

504
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,960
When Mei Ying tells the truth behind the scenes

505
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,960
everything will be revealed

506
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,960
I don't know who will laugh until the end

507
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,960
I can't do it anymore

508
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,960
You

509
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,960
are still the same as before

510
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,960
You can't hold your breath

511
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,960
No matter how serious the Long Ying City is

512
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,960
I can't hold my breath

513
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,960
No matter how serious I am

514
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,960
I can't hold my breath

515
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,960
I just died

516
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,960
Why are you so anxious?

517
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,960
The person behind Mei Ying

518
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,960
is the one who killed the Second Miss

519
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,960
I don't know

520
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,960
I don't know

521
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,960
I don't know

522
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,960
The person behind Mei Ying

523
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,960
will reveal himself soon

524
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,960
I don't believe it

525
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,960
Really?

526
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,960
Then why don't you

527
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,960
make a bet with me?

528
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,960
I

529
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,960
Greetings, City Leader

530
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,960
How is it?

531
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,960
I...

532
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,960
Su Er

533
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,960
you go first

534
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,960
City Leader

535
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,960
I think

536
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,960
we should kill Mei Ying

537
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,960
and make a bet with the people

538
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,960
The Long Ying City

539
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,960
can't tolerate anyone

540
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,960
and any sect's

541
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,960
indifference

542
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,960
Hua Er

543
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,960
what do you think?

544
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,960
It's the opposite

545
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,960
I think we should

546
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,960
release Mei Ying

547
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,960
out of the Dark Palace

548
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,960
and treat her with courtesy

549
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,960
and persuade her to tell the truth

550
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,960
so that

551
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,960
we can prove the truth

552
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,960
Then you

553
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,960
tell me

554
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,960
why you think

555
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,960
you should do this

556
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,960
Hua Er, you go first this time

557
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,960
Yes

558
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,960
I've found out

559
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,960
Master Xiao

560
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,960
is the second master of the Mei family

561
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,960
and is heavily valued by the old master

562
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,960
But he betrayed his trust

563
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,960
and killed the master of the Mei family

564
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,960
Mei Ying did this

565
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,960
to avenge her father

566
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,960
and to show the responsibility

567
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,960
and responsibility of the people

568
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,960
As the leader of the martial arts in the martial arts world

569
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,960
Long Ying City

570
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,960
should be fair to them

571
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,960
You are too naive

572
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,960
How can you believe the murderer?

573
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,960
If he is trying to get a life

574
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,960
and make a mess

575
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,960
then what he knew

576
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,960
would be a mess again

577
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,960
And

578
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,960
no matter what the reason is

579
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,960
Master Xiao is the chief guest of Long Ying City

580
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,960
and one of the masters of the Zhi Hua Zhu

581
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,960
This time he was killed ten miles away from the city

582
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,960
It really humiliated the reputation of Long Ying City

583
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,960
If he didn't kill Mei Ying

584
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,960
then the people in the world

585
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,960
would lose their respect for Long Ying City

586
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,960
Bai

587
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,960
Do you know

588
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,960
if I fall again

589
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,960
you can only give up

590
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,960
Give this chess piece to Zi Yan

591
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,960
No

592
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,960
What does this mean?

593
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,960
Zi Yan will know

594
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,960
how to deal with Mei Ying

595
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,960
when he sees this chess piece

596
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,960
This

597
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,960
Which door is this?

598
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,960
Master, are you really going to let him go?

599
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,600
Black

600
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,960
White

601
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,960
Master said to let him go

602
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,960
so let him go

603
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,960
He has been fascinated by the poisonous smoke for so long

604
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,960
Even if he let him go

605
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,960
he would be a useless person

606
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,960
Open the door

607
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,960
Master, he has no breath

608
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,960
He must have found that the smoke

609
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,960
had a mysterious effect

610
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,960
So in order to keep him awake

611
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,960
he used the method of breathing

612
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,960
to isolate himself

613
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,960
Unfortunately

614
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,960
my poison is not only in one breath

615
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,960
it can enter the bottom of the skin

616
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,960
and enter every part of the body

617
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,960
Xiao Xiao

618
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,960
take him to the Holy Grail Hall

619
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,960
Guards

620
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,960
Take him away

621
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,960
Zi Yan

622
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,960
Mei Ying is not dead

623
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,960
I asked Xiao Xiao to take her to the Holy Grail Hall

624
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,960
You said the City Leader

625
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,960
Why did you let Mei Ying go?

626
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,960
Is it because Rong Su told her in private

627
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,960
that the loss of the first Chihua Bead

628
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,960
has something to do with the Mei family?

629
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,960
If the first Chihua Bead

630
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,960
was really stolen by the Mei family

631
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,960
then why would it be transferred to the Holy Grail Hall?

632
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,960
It seems that

633
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,960
this time the City Leader

634
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,960
wants to find out the fate of the Holy Grail Hall from Mei Ying

635
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,960
This is a token of our Hall Leader's love

636
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,960
I hope you can recover soon

637
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,960
Thank you

638
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,960
Please tell Miss Rong

639
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,960
If there is a chance

640
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,960
I will ask her to help me

641
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,960
Xuan Yue

642
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,960
Take all the things you brought back

643
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,960
Why are you so rude?

644
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,960
I'm rude?

645
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,960
Your hand almost broke

646
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,960
Do you forget who did this?

647
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,960
Xuan Yue

648
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,960
These things

649
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,960
are the real things

650
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,960
that we bought from everywhere

651
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,960
Even the Hall Leader has never seen them

652
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,960
Your Hall

653
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,960
can be used as a favor

654
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,960
Xuan Yue is just following orders

655
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,960
The hidden emotions are not known

656
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,960
If Hall Leader Lin insists on investigating

657
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,960
the Hall will be at your service at any time

658
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,960
Okay

659
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,960
After I've finished the diagnosis of our Holy Grail Hall

660
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,960
I'll find a chance

661
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,960
to find out the truth

662
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,960
Forget it

663
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,960
What kind of person is Rong Su?

664
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,960
You don't know it in your heart

665
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,960
I think you're so obsessed

666
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,960
that you don't even know who you are

667
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,960
You dare to do it to me

668
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,960
I dare to do it to you

669
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,960
You are the Young Hall Leader

670
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,960
But you can't be so unreasonable

671
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,960
and make excuses

672
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,960
It's good to give medicine

673
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,960
You have to pick a thorn from it

674
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,960
and get so angry

675
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,960
I'm not a thorn

676
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,960
I'm not a thorn

677
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,960
I'm not a thorn

678
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,960
You have to pick a thorn from it

679
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,960
and get so angry

680
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,960
You clearly have a prejudice against him

681
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,960
I

682
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,960
You

683
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,960
I won't bother you anymore

684
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,960
If it's Young Master Lu

685
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,960
I will tell him

686
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,960
I'm leaving

687
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,960
I'm leaving

688
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,960
Which play did you sing?

689
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,960
It's just a play

690
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,960
Rong Su really wants to pull you

691
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,960
I have to cooperate with him

692
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,960
Don't you think so?

693
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,960
Come on, hurry up

694
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,960
I made you medicine

695
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,960
Drink it while it's hot

696
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,960
I spent a lot of effort

697
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,960
to make this medicine for you

698
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,960
What's wrong?

699
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,960
Young Master made the medicine himself

700
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,960
How dare I be used as a servant?

701
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,960
What do you mean?

702
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,960
What do you mean?

703
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,960
Servants can't drink medicine

704
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,960
Hurry up

705
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,960
I spent a lot of effort

706
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,960
to make this medicine for you

707
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,960
You are really

708
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,960
So beautiful

709
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,960
You

710
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,960
So bitter

711
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,960
I'm so happy

712
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,960
to be treated by Young Master

713
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,960
You have a tongue

714
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,960
Who did you learn it from?

715
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,960
Who else can it be?

716
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,960
You were not like this

717
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,960
when you were in Linxu Pavilion

718
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,960
I

719
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,960
Did Rong Su teach you a lesson?

720
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,960
Don't worry

721
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,960
I know Rong Su's method

722
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,960
The death of Xiao Zhangmen

723
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,960
has nothing to do with him

724
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,960
But

725
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,960
it's too dangerous for you to let Mei Ying enter the city

726
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,960
If they cooperate

727
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,960
you will die

728
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,960
Think about it

729
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,960
If they really cooperate

730
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,960
why is Rong Su so anxious

731
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,960
to kill Mei Ying?

732
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,960
Everything is fine

733
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,960
All right

734
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,960
You are too nagging

735
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,960
too nagging

736
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,960
Just remember

737
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,960
you can pretend

738
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,960
that you have a bad relationship with me

739
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,960
Do you have any new plans?

740
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,960
Look

741
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,960
This is the antidote

742
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,960
Wait

743
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,960
I'm sorry

744
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,960
I didn't know you were here

745
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,960
You are not a disciple of the Holy-Word Hall

746
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,960
I just transferred to the Holy-Word Hall recently

747
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,960
You haven't seen me much

748
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,960
It's natural to have some eyes

749
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,960
I'm sorry

750
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,960
I'm sorry

751
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,960
I'm sorry

752
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,960
I'm sorry

753
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,960
How can you do this kind of thing

754
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,960
to take care of the soldiers?

755
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,960
You should give it to me

756
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,960
Mei Ying is now a guest in Longyin City

757
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,960
She is seriously injured

758
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,960
You can't treat her like that

759
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,960
You can go now

760
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,960
Put the medicine here

761
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,960
Yes

762
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,960
I'm leaving

763
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,960
I didn't expect that Miss Rong'er

764
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,960
would take such good care of me

765
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,960
She even accompanied me

766
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,960
It seems that you have woken up

767
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,960
Aren't you afraid that the medicine is poisonous?

768
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,960
Didn't you check it for me just now?

769
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,960
Besides

770
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,960
Master has released me from the dark house

771
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,960
Who else in Longyin City

772
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,960
would harm me?

773
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,960
Rong Su

774
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,960
I'm not afraid of you

775
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,960
I'm not afraid of you

776
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,960
I'm not afraid of you

777
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,960
I've been with Miss Rong for a long time

778
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,960
Why does she do this?

779
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,180
But the new Hall Leader of the Life and

780
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,960
I have a pretty interesting relationship

781
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,960
Maybe the City Leader would like to hear

782
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,960
Father has ordered

783
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,960
You should rest in the city

784
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,960
Don't worry about anything else

785
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,960
I'm leaving

786
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,960
Are they really not together?

787
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,960
True or false, it's hard to tell

788
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,960
You want to use this way to confuse the world

789
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,960
Ying Qing

790
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,960
You underestimate me

791
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,960
Why don't you find a chance to get rid of Wei Ying as soon as possible?

792
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,960
Leave her for one more day

793
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,960
The Hall Leader will have more worries

794
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,960
You have to remind me

795
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,960
I've sent people to investigate

796
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,960
But Rong Hua has been keeping it secret

797
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,960
I can't find a chance to be a subordinate

798
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,960
He's watching closely now

799
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,960
I wish I could show some flaws

800
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,960
Mei Ying is a smart person

801
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,960
If she wants to leave Longyin City alive

802
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,960
You have to support her

803
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,960
I don't care about Mei Ying's life

804
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,960
Do you have any news about Xiao Xue Meng?

805
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,960
I have passed on the message many times according to the Hall Leader

806
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,960
I hope it can be extended to 10 days

807
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,960
But Xiao Xue Meng hasn't replied yet

808
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,960
Night is long and dreams are many

809
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,960
I'm afraid that Xiao Xue Meng has already known about our failure

810
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,960
I'm afraid we can't do this business

811
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,960
If it wasn't for that Lin Jing

812
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,960
We would have succeeded

813
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,960
Lin Jing

814
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,960
Replying to the Hall Leader

815
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,960
Master Ming

816
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,960
In this letter, Rong Su

817
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,960
Still hasn't said why he postponed the deal

818
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,960
I still followed your order

819
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,960
Didn't give him any response

820
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,960
He must have failed

821
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,960
Hiding this news

822
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,960
Just want to continue from Xiao Xue Meng

823
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,960
Get the secret of Lingxu Pavilion

824
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,960
Master Ming's speculation

825
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,960
Almost exactly what Xiao Xue Meng heard

826
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,960
Rong Su escorted the Hall Leader back to Longyin City

827
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,960
Unexpectedly, it was delayed on the way

828
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,960
Lin Jing was ordered to send the antidote to the street

829
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,960
But I don't know why

830
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,960
The Hall Leader is dead

831
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,960
The antidote was also destroyed

832
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,960
Rong Su's next letter

833
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,960
Just want to stabilize the line of our Xiao Xue Meng

834
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,960
But now Longyin City is in a stormy state

835
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,960
He is definitely not capable of getting the antidote

836
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,960
The antidote was destroyed

837
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,960
The antidote was destroyed

838
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,960
Yes

839
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,960
Our people saw it with their own eyes

840
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,960
Lin Jing was ambushed and refused to save the criminal

841
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,960
He destroyed the antidote on the spot

842
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,960
The meaning of Master Ming

843
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,960
Is there another potential in this?

844
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,960
If you are Lin Jing

845
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,960
You will destroy a antidote by yourself

846
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,960
Can save your mother's life

847
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,960
Master Ming is wise

848
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,960
This Lin Jing is really cunning

849
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,960
I think I've designed everything

850
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,960
Hiding the truth

851
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,960
Let our people watch Longyin City

852
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:38,960
Next

853
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,960
Lin Jing must be in danger

854
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,960
Must have action

855
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,960
This Chihua Pillar's antidote

856
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,960
I must get it

857
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,960
Yes

858
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,960
What about Rong Su?

859
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,960
Let him shine first

860
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,960
I want to feel his temper

861
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,960
Yes

862
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:07,960
I understand

863
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:12,960
I want to feel his temper

864
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,960
I want to feel his temper

865
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,960
I want to feel his temper

866
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,960
I want to feel his temper

867
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,960
I want to feel his temper

868
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,960
I want to feel his temper

869
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,960
I want to feel his temper

870
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,960
I want to feel his temper

871
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,960
I want to feel his temper

872
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,960
I want to feel his temper

873
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,960
I want to feel his temper

874
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,960
I want to feel his temper

875
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,960
I want to feel his temper

876
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,960
I want to feel his temper

877
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,960
I want to feel his temper

878
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,960
I want to feel his temper

879
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,960
I want to feel his temper

880
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,960
I want to feel his temper

881
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,960
I want to feel his temper

882
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,960
I want to feel his temper

883
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,960
I want to feel his temper

884
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,960
I want to feel his temper

885
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,960
I want to feel his temper

886
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,960
I want to feel his temper

887
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,960
I want to feel his temper

888
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,960
I want to feel his temper

889
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,960
I want to feel his temper

00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,960
I want to feel his temper

891
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,960
I want to feel his temper

892
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,960
I want to feel his temper

893
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,960
