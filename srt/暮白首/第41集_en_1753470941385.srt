00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The King Of Blaze

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Ming Cun.

4
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
If you're not guilty,

5
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
why did you set up a gossiping array outside?

6
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Even if you've got the antidote,

7
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
you won't see anyone.

8
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You said you didn't have any intention.

9
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What gossiping array?

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I didn't set it up.

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Please investigate it.

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Si Dan is your only secret weapon.

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Who else would it be?

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I...

15
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It seems that there's only one possibility.

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
After your sister stole the antidote,

17
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
she didn't come to save you.

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
She wanted to frame you.

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Except for you,

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
only your sister could do it.

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's true.

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
That's my father's handwriting.

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Now we have people from the spirit world.

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Why did he ask us to go there?

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Where did he go during this time?

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Longyin City is under the leadership of the old city owner.

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Now he's caught by the bandits.

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
He won't be reconciled.

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
But he at least has to discuss with us.

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
How can he act without permission?

31
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,480
Your Grace,

32
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,400
I have a request.

33
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,480
Is it about Miss Liuli?

34
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,760
We don't know what the old City Leader is going to do.

35
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,040
We can only act according to the circumstances.

36
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,200
If we follow the old City Leader's personality,

37
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,680
he will definitely confront Mo Huan face to face.

38
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,960
If something goes wrong,

39
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,160
please help me to get rid of Liuli.

40
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,400
I know you've been worried about her safety.

41
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,640
During this time,

42
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,640
you've been trying to get into the city to rescue her.

43
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,160
If I hadn't stopped you,

44
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,640
I'm afraid you wouldn't have killed Mo Huan

45
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,640
even if you were alive.

46
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,000
Don't worry.

47
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,640
I won't stand by and watch.

48
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,080
If I have a chance,

49
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,200
I will help you.

50
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,600
Thank you, City Leader.

51
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,280
No matter what,

52
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,640
I will do my best to protect you.

53
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,600
Get up.

54
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,960
It's true that Father is not dead.

55
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,480
It seems that Yue didn't kill him.

56
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,920
This time, I'm going to Longyin City.

57
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,640
I want to go with you.

58
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,960
Listen up!

59
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,360
I built this Longyin City

60
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,320
with my own hands!

61
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,360
Only me, Rong Jingfeng,

62
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,240
can be the master of Longyin City!

63
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,600
You guys

64
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,440
dare to make a fuss in front of me?

65
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,680
I'm going to tell your master

66
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,520
that no one can steal Longyin City from me!

67
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,880
Longyin City will be rescued soon.

68
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:43,680
You

69
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,320
all have to die in Longyin City!

70
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,040
Stop!

71
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,280
Don't shoot!

72
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,600
Stop!

73
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,320
What happened in the city?

74
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,640
Linv

75
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,680
No, he's a young僧 grump!

76
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,120
I couldn't fight as the field leader.

77
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,000
If he wanted to battle,

78
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,720
a defeated ginger

79
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,240
wouldn't bother to battle yourself.

80
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,560
Guzhuo,

81
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,720
follow Mei Ying.

82
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,720
I must teach Mei Xue Wan a lesson.

83
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,320
Yes.

84
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,120
Please be careful, Master.

85
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,760
Lu Ying Zhang,

86
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,680
elders

87
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,920
don't know

88
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,200
that I'm the one

89
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,120
awaiting them.

90
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,800
This position

91
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,240
no longer belongs to you.

92
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,520
There is no place for you

93
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,120
to be in the martial arts world.

94
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,120
No one else

95
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,920
can take the throne

96
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,320
except me.

97
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,740
I can

98
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,640
leave your MagNothing deterick.

99
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,480
Just leave it.

100
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:34,120
Although I have dates and honor,

101
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,120
I'm not able to

102
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,680
take up masterships.

103
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,600
Chen Yan

104
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,400
is that kind of weapon.

105
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,800
Yes.

106
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,160
Back then,

107
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,840
Border clearance Elsword

108
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,040
easily broke the homepage,

109
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,320
letting you spatial

110
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,680
burst into despair step by step.

111
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,480
That is the cliche.

112
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,800
But I never thought that

113
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,440
if I made a mistake today,

114
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,240
I would end up like this.

115
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,760
Just this one step.

116
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,200
One step?

117
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,920
You didn't just make a mistake.

118
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,000
From the day you betrayed me,

119
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,600
you were destined to be a traitor.

120
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,560
You were destined to be

121
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,600
a traitor.

122
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,640
Even now,

123
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,280
I've never regretted it.

124
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,840
I betrayed you as a teacher

125
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,320
and ran away from the school.

126
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,600
Because

127
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,960
you always treat us as

128
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,600
your pawns who are your disciples.

129
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,880
When you were in the Lianxu Pavilion,

130
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,080
you were willing to do anything

131
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,160
for the sake of the Lianxu Pavilion.

132
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,920
You won't forget

133
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,600
all of this, will you?

134
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,680
The biggest mistake

135
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,800
I've made in my life

136
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,600
is not to destroy the Lianxu Pavilion.

137
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,760
If I hadn't committed this massacre,

138
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,360
I wouldn't have put my son

139
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,800
into such a painful abyss.

140
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,440
Maybe I wouldn't

141
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,800
have come to this point.

142
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,560
All of this

143
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,440
started from the moment you betrayed me

144
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,040
and wanted to kill me.

145
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,040
You're wrong.

146
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,840
The best decision I've ever made

147
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,280
is to leave you.

148
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,880
I will never regret it.

149
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,080
In that case,

150
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,520
today,

151
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,960
you'll pay for

152
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,840
your grudge with my disciple.

153
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,760
Didn't you ask Rong Su to come to pick you up?

154
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,640
Then I'll let you leave the city

155
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,720
and let you and your daughter

156
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,440
meet for the last time.

157
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,520
I didn't expect your power

158
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,760
to grow so fast.

159
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,080
Na Lanyue,

160
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,960
I don't need your help.

161
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,360
I can solve my own problems on my own.

162
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,240
I don't want to owe your family

163
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,320
a cent of gratitude.

164
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,080
Do you think you owe the Nalan family less?

165
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,400
It's already come to this.

166
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,920
Don't you understand?

167
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,560
Those rights and ambitions are all false.

168
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,400
In order to achieve your goal,

169
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,000
you don't want your daughter to die.

170
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,520
Now, Longyin City

171
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,320
is no longer the same as before.

172
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,240
Is it worth it for your false hope?

173
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,400
You don't understand.

174
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,280
The position of the City Leader

175
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,440
is the symbol of the status of the underworld.

176
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,120
No one can take it away from me.

177
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,720
It's mine!

178
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,720
Longyin City is mine.

179
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,240
I want to take it back!

180
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,760
Very good.

181
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,320
Today,

182
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,280
everyone is here.

183
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,840
I don't know what happened.

184
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,320
Could it be that

185
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,000
my father has...

186
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Your father has built this Longyin City.

187
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,800
He is familiar with the terrain better than anyone else.

188
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,400
It's not easy to catch him.

189
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,320
My father has sent a letter to Jing.

190
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,720
He said that we have prepared for the death of Yu Si.

191
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,120
It seems that the Lin family is in a bad situation.

192
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,320
They are waiting for us.

193
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,120
We can't just let them go.

194
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,320
We have to do something.

195
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,520
We have to do something.

196
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,600
It's hard to save my father

197
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,840
with the ability of the four of us.

198
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,920
Listen to my order.

199
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,240
Today,

200
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,840
we will kill everyone in Longyin City.

201
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,640
I want to put them all in the city.

202
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,080
I want them to see

203
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,640
how I will live with them.

204
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,120
Those who betray me

205
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,840
will be punished.

206
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,640
Even if it's the Nalan family,

207
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,640
it's not an exception.

208
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,640
Yes.

209
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:38,680
baked

210
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,040
Don't worry.

211
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,680
Look.

212
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,200
The top of the city is moving.

213
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,200
Al 줏

214
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,520
and our own safety.

215
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,200
Don't worry, Master.

216
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,640
Once we save the person,

217
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,760
we'll leave the city immediately.

218
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,000
Today, even if I'm alone,

219
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,800
I'll go to the Longyin City.

220
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,800
Young Madam, are you all right?

221
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,600
We got the news and rushed here immediately.

222
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,560
Yue has planned it himself.

223
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,960
You all hid it from me.

224
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,760
It's not the time to be worried.

225
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,040
I want to ask you clearly.

226
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,200
After everything is over,

227
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,200
you can ask Yue yourself.

228
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,560
Protect Young Madam.

229
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,240
Yes.

230
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,240
I'm sorry.

231
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:11,960
I'm sorry.

232
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,640
I'm sorry.

233
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,440
I'm sorry.

234
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,200
I'm sorry.

235
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,040
I'm sorry.

236
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,960
I'm sorry.

237
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,960
I'm sorry.

238
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,960
I'm sorry.

239
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,960
I'm sorry.

240
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,960
I'm sorry.

241
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,960
I'm sorry.

242
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,960
I'm sorry.

243
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,960
I'm sorry.

244
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,960
I'm sorry.

245
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,960
I'm sorry.

246
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,960
I'm sorry.

247
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,960
I'm sorry.

248
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,960
I'm sorry.

249
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,960
I'm sorry.

250
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,960
I'm sorry.

251
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,960
I'm sorry.

252
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,960
I'm sorry.

253
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,960
I'm sorry.

254
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,960
I'm sorry.

255
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,960
I'm sorry.

256
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,960
I'm sorry.

257
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,960
I'm sorry.

258
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,960
I'm sorry.

259
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,960
I'm sorry.

260
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,400
Father!

261
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,400
Father!

262
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,400
Father!

263
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,400
Father!

264
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,400
Chief!

265
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,760
I've been fighting for my life

266
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,760
for the sake of the Dragon Seal.

267
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,280
I didn't expect

268
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,280
I'd end up like this.

269
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,280
I've been working hard to control the Dragon Seal,

270
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,280
but I've been ruined.

271
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,280
I've been doing this for a long time.

272
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,280
If I had a future,

273
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,280
I'd rather not have all of this,

274
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,280
but only be with my wife and children.

275
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,280
Father!

276
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,280
Father!

277
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,280
Father, I'm back.

278
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,280
You've finally grown up.

279
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,280
Father!

280
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,280
I'm back.

281
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,280
You're married?

282
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,280
No.

283
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,280
Father!

284
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,280
No.

285
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,280
Father.

286
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,600
Su Er.

287
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,600
Father.

288
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,600
I...

289
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,600
Father.

290
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,600
Father!

291
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,600
Father!

292
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,600
Father!

293
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,600
Father!

294
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,600
Father!

295
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,600
Father!

296
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,600
No!

297
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,600
Father!

298
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,600
Father!

299
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,600
Father!

300
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,600
Father!

301
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,600
Father!

302
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,600
Father, go!

303
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,600
I know what you're thinking.

304
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,600
It must be hard to deal with your sister.

305
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,600
You should know that

306
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,600
Lord Ming has never been patient.

307
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,600
If you still don't have

308
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,600
your sister's news in a few days,

309
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,600
you'll die anyway.

310
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,600
If you don't want to die in pain,

311
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,600
I might as well give you a painful death now.

312
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,600
I'm not that stupid.

313
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,600
I'm different from Rong Jingfeng.

314
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,600
Rong Jingfeng is a loser.

315
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,280
I believe that

316
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,800
as long as I'm alive,

317
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,800
everything is possible.

318
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,800
You're a villain.

319
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,800
If you hadn't betrayed Lingxu Pavilion,

320
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,800
my sister wouldn't have died.

321
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,800
How can you talk about life and death here?

322
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,800
As long as you order me,

323
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,800
I'll marry you right now.

324
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,800
I won't delay it.

325
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,800
I have to think of a way as soon as possible.

326
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,800
If I really meet Xue Man,

327
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,800
how can I avoid

328
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,800
her falling into Mo Huan's hands?

329
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,800
I'm sorry.

330
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,800
I'm sorry.

331
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,800
I'm sorry.

332
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,800
I'm sorry.

333
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,800
I'm sorry.

334
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,800
I'm sorry.

335
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,800
I'm sorry.

336
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,800
I'm sorry.

337
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,800
I'm sorry.

338
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,800
I'm sorry.

339
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,800
I'm sorry.

340
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,800
I'm sorry.

341
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,800
I'm sorry.

342
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,800
I'm sorry.

343
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,800
I'm sorry.

344
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,800
I'm sorry.

345
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,800
I'm sorry.

346
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,800
I'm sorry.

347
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,800
I'm sorry.

348
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,800
I'm sorry.

349
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,800
I'm sorry.

350
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,800
I'm sorry.

351
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,800
I'm sorry.

352
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,800
I'm sorry.

353
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,800
I'm sorry.

354
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,320
I'm sorry.

355
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,320
I'm sorry.

356
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,320
A Yue,

357
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,320
I'll go back to the spiritual world

358
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,320
to make the test.

359
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,320
Longying City is not far from here.

360
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,640
I'm sorry.

361
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,080
At this time,

362
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,520
I can't

363
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,680
share a piece of the secret.

364
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,800
I hope you can understand.

365
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,240
You're always so careful.

366
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,480
You're more thoughtful than me.

367
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,160
This time...

368
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,080
This time,

369
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,680
I thought

370
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,720
leaving you

371
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,040
was protecting you.

372
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,520
I didn't expect

373
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,960
you to go through all this.

374
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,040
When we were in the Northern Territories,

375
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,320
you didn't do anything.

376
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,160
You even asked my sister

377
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,240
to bring my father back.

378
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,800
I know all you did

379
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,960
was for me.

380
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,840
If it weren't for you,

381
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,440
the situation would have been worse.

382
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,240
I thought my father was dead.

383
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,800
I thought

384
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,240
Zhen Yu

385
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,120
could join in the bank

386
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,480
if he could.

387
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,040
Do you want to know

388
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:44,600
about this murder?

389
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,080
I was shocked.

390
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,280
I accepted it

391
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,800
and refused to take it.

392
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,040
I didn't know

393
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,560
it was a murder.

394
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,320
But I held on fire

395
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,040
to see him live.

396
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:58,960
Yue,

397
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,680
I know you hate me.

398
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,880
You didn't go in.

399
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,800
I don't blame you.

400
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,800
I can't think for her.

401
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,720
I still remember

402
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,000
everything she did.

403
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,920
I can't forgive her.

404
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,280
After all, she's hurt

405
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,920
and has infected too many people of the Nalan family.

406
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,280
From the moment I left the Lin family,

407
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,800
I realized one thing.

408
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,760
We were

409
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,280
in a relationship from the beginning.

410
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,320
The moment I fell in love with the Nalan family,

411
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,240
it was destined to happen today.

412
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,440
Before,

413
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,000
I thought we could overcome any difficulties

414
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,720
as long as we were together.

415
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,000
Because we believed in each other.

416
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,960
But now,

417
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,240
so many things have happened.

418
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,720
The harmony between us is getting worse.

419
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,600
Hua,

420
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,680
you're too tired.

421
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,920
Go back and have a rest.

422
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,760
Let's talk about it another day.

423
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,240
Yes.

424
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,800
I'm too tired.

425
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,120
I'll go in first.

426
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,760
Okay.

427
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,440
Brother Naaman,

428
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,440
as expected,

429
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,960
my elder brother sent me to get lost in Longyin City by myself.

430
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,600
Now the tray is issue by Mohuan,

431
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,640
only he fibers me to escape from it safely.

432
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,240
Looks like Mohuan

433
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,960
is suspicious of Mei Ying some way,

434
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,160
so she schedule us there.

435
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,040
From now on,

436
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,760
if there is any chance that

437
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,960
I get out of Longyin City,

438
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,560
everything will be smooth

439
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,240
and then you will believe me.

440
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,760
I have already suspected Mei Ying.

441
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,560
I want to use you

442
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,200
to threaten Mei Ying.

443
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,240
But once you enter the city,

444
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,560
it won't be easy to escape.

445
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,680
Mei Ying can't even protect herself now.

446
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,080
Let alone you.

447
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,840
We can't rush this matter.

448
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,200
On the one hand, I want Mei Ying to believe you.

449
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,840
On the other hand,

450
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,680
I want to make Mo Huan doubt.

451
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,600
I'm afraid

452
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,520
you're going to suffer.

453
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,680
As long as it works,

454
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,960
I can suffer anything.

455
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,680
Rong Jingfeng's life is in danger.

456
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,880
But now he has come to this conclusion.

457
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,120
Although I don't know how sure I am,

458
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,720
as long as I can imprison my brother,

459
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,280
at least

460
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,760
he can have a last chance.

461
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,920
Family members are different.

462
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,800
I hope Mei Ying

463
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,760
can know

464
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,920
what you've done for her one day.

465
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,200
Why are you here?

466
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,840
I have a favor to ask.

467
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,640
You're both father and friend.

468
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,520
I can't bother you.

469
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,040
I have no other choice.

470
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,480
What's the matter?

471
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,280
Today, the city is in chaos.

472
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,040
I want to take this opportunity

473
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,720
to sneak into Longyin City and save Liuli.

474
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,040
But the spiritual cult is heavily guarded.

475
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,200
I'm afraid if I drag it on,

476
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,760
Liuli may not be able to hold on.

477
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,320
Now only you, Na Lanyue,

478
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,000
can fight against Mo Huan.

479
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,440
I can only ask for help from you.

480
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
No matter what you do,

481
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,560
as long as you can save Liuli,

482
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,640
even if it's a life-or-death situation,

483
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,440
I'm willing to do it.

484
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,760
Don't worry.

485
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,720
I'm thinking

486
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,080
that you two

487
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,080
may be able to solve it together.

488
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,520
But don't make a fuss about it.

489
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,800
Especially for Rong Su and Rong Hua.

490
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,360
Rong Jinfeng's death

491
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,880
is a big blow to them.

492
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:36,960
After that,

493
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,040
just listen to my arrangement.

494
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:42,640
The tone of Duskull Jiangي

495
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,560
I...

496
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,440
Have some water.

497
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,660
Be installed in it all night

498
00:32:50,660 --> 00:33:01,140
力i 기분本身

499
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,680
I just have to tell you

500
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,680
to never disturb me.

501
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,080
Thank you, Gui Her error.

502
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,840
Yan Li.

503
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,720
Master, how are you?

504
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,120
Why did you stop eating tonight?

505
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,080
It's Newie.

506
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,680
Who knew

507
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,720
why he saw his mom's image

508
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,680
and became difference between

509
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,640
Now the power of the palace has increased.

510
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,560
I'm afraid that I'm no longer his opponent.

511
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,440
By the way, Bu Zhu,

512
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,280
send someone to watch every corner of the road.

513
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,000
It's not peaceful yet.

514
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,240
Don't let anyone get into trouble.

515
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,520
Yes.

516
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,560
Master, don't worry.

517
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,880
I've strengthened the defense.

518
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,120
There will be no mistake.

519
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,480
Have you arranged Mei Ying?

520
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,400
I've sent the disciples of the spiritual cult

521
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,880
to guard Mei Ying.

522
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,000
There are also disciples in the city who are on a strict patrol.

523
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,760
She won't cause any trouble.

524
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,400
Okay.

525
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,800
How did you get in?

526
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,560
Xue Man stole the antidote from me.

527
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,040
I know.

528
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,040
She stole the antidote to save you.

529
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,000
I've sent someone to follow her.

530
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,000
I know where she is.

531
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,600
I went to Longyin City

532
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,560
to find her whereabouts.

533
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,800
This is a small matter,

534
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,720
but I can't drag it out for too long.

535
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:56,880
Otherwise,

536
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,200
I can't deal with my people.

537
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,280
Xue Man is not in Longyin City.

538
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:05,760
Besides,

539
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,880
this is the plan of the spiritual cult.

540
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,480
You said

541
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,720
if I shout out,

542
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,920
you can't get in.

543
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,440
If I take you out of Longyin City

544
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,400
without any reason,

545
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,880
what will Yi Mohan think?

546
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,400
Will he think

547
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,040
we've been in the dark for a long time?

548
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,600
I sneaked in

549
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,480
to save you.

550
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,840
If so,

551
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,440
you'll know

552
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,040
you're a villain.

553
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,520
No one will trust you in the martial arts world.

554
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,680
Ma Lanyue.

555
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,800
There are bandits everywhere in the city.

556
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,880
We can't get out.

557
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,840
If no one answers,

558
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,880
he can't get out of the house.

559
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,000
He's so mean.

560
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,640
We must take the lives of people

561
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,720
and guard every exit.

562
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,800
I'll go to the gate.

563
00:36:59,080 --> 00:36:59,960
Hurry up. Follow up.

564
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:10,880
Master.

565
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,360
Master Laolan.

566
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,480
Why are you here?

567
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,880
Xuan Yi asked me to save you.

568
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,640
Now the city is in chaos.

569
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,960
We went out in the meantime.

570
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,000
She is already guarding the camp outside.

571
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,360
But there are so many people outside.

572
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,040
How can we go out?

573
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,560
as highly as me.

574
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,720
Take it.

575
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,560
It can take you Automably

576
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,680
back toOOa when a particular time is a little.

577
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,000
I can't afford to wasteSD Okan-ssi's time.

578
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,400
Give me back the medicine.

579
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,960
and make you a disciple of the Spirit Cult.

580
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,720
Get out of here.

581
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,400
It's so late.

582
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,720
Why hasn't he come back yet?

583
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,440
Did something happen?

584
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,120
Let's keep hiding.

585
00:38:43,760 --> 00:39:02,380
Take the

586
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,720
irrelevant information away

587
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,000
from me.

588
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,680
Mother.

589
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,320
It's my fault.

590
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,840
I failed to protect you.

591
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,640
I'll protect you and love you

592
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,160
from now on.

593
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,640
It's your black燕 predictor.

594
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,340
You won't speak

595
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,960
for yourself, will you?

596
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,560
It's good that you heat it

597
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,280
entirely.

598
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,140
Please come back

599
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,740
and taste it.

600
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,280
No.

601
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,440
It shouldn't be bad.

602
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,880
So desolated.

603
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,200
and the flowers you brought me.

604
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,120
So you've planned it all along.

605
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,600
I didn't plan it for you.

606
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,760
I'm just

607
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,760
doing it for myself.

608
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,760
But before leaving,

609
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,840
I still have one thing to do.

610
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,160
The King's Desire

611
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,160
Episode 15

612
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,640
The City Leader ordered

613
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,840
that we won't meet again.

614
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,480
Where's Miss Rong'er?

615
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,000
I have something to discuss with her.

616
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,120
It's a one-on-one.

617
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,320
Brother Xuanye, please don't make it difficult for us.

618
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,680
You should know

619
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,320
the essence of the City Leader better than anyone else.

620
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,760
I just want to meet with the City Leader again.

621
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,800
I need to make it clear in person.

622
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,360
Please,

623
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,600
make it convenient for me.

624
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,920
We know that

625
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,160
we're not against Brother Xuanye,

626
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,920
but we still obey the City Leader's order.

627
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,320
If you insist on being in the city today,

628
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,160
you have to pass through our bodyguards first.

629
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,120
I'll leave.

630
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,320
Who cares about them?

631
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,360
Fine.

632
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,480
Binhe Hall

633
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,640
Xuanye!

634
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:52,800
Xuanye!

635
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,600
His mother stays here.

636
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,520
He went with you through

637
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,280
the many years and犯 mistakes of QR.

638
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,440
He won't take care of life

639
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,780
and lost his life for you.

640
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,120
Did you just treat him this way?

641
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:18,920
For you,

642
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,920
he wants to break my order many times.

643
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:21,920
I'm sorry.

644
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,920

I'm sorry.

662
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:40,920
I'm sorry.

663
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:41,920
