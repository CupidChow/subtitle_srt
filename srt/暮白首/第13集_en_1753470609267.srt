1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
えっ

2
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:52,500
왜

3
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,320
state Osiyu Autonomous Prefecture keep on fighting.

4
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,980
Do what уп då lue family is doing?

5
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,080
Do you really love our sixty-half hundred men?

6
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,320
Please spare the five maintenant.

7
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,780
The Master waskatilayong cit한ong,

8
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,040
and Betteron died.

9
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,840
You are going to die a感 Tetanum.

10
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,000
But you have to work harder in the future.

11
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,400
Otherwise,

12
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,440
someone will take over your position.

13
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,480
By then,

14
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,400
I'm afraid Longyin City

15
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,600
will be a place for you to live.

16
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,800
Master, why are you saying this?

17
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,320
Is it because Xiao Xiao did something wrong

18
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,000
that made you angry?

19
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,880
Master, your hand.

20
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,680
Didn't the City Leader use his inner power

21
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,160
to force the poison out of your body?

22
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,080
Why is it still like this?

23
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,160
I know my body best.

24
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:17,100
Since the foundation of the

25
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,680
Yinzitang,

26
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,560
no one can live a hundred years.

27
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,840
Even I can't do anything.

28
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,920
Xiao Xiao, you're still young.

29
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,440
I respect your choice.

30
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,040
If you don't want to make this poison,

31
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,200
I can tell the City Leader

32
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,480
to order him to do it.

33
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,000
No, Master.

34
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,160
I'm willing to learn.

35
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,200
I'll do it again.

36
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,200
I'll do it again.

37
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,200
I'll do it again.

38
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,200
I'll do it again.

39
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,200
I'll do it again.

40
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,200
I'll do it again.

41
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,840
No matter how hard it is,

42
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,840
I'm willing to share the burden with you.

43
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,440
Master,

44
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,080
from now on,

45
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,560
I'll be responsible for this poison.

46
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,040
I'll definitely help you

47
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,040
to keep the Yinzitang.

48
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:51,520
Kai

49
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,280
I know you're still awake.

50
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,840
You don't have to open the door.

51
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,600
It's good for me to talk to you like this.

52
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,840
A lot of things in the world are fated.

53
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,840
Maybe I'll be destined to meet you

54
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,840
when we were born.

55
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,840
I'm sorry.

56
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,840
Rong Hua.

57
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,840
I know what you want to say.

58
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,840
Let's talk tomorrow.

59
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,840
If Han Ji breaks the rule,

60
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,840
it'll be a big trouble.

61
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,840
Last time I went to Lin Xu Pavilion,

62
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,840
there was a good chance in the pavilion.

63
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,840
But he let me go.

64
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,840
If you and the master were more cruel,

65
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,840
I wouldn't blame myself

66
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,840
for knowing the truth today.

67
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,840
I wouldn't feel so bad.

68
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,840
I'm sorry.

69
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,840
I'm sorry.

70
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,840
I'm sorry.

71
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,840
I'm sorry.

72
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,840
I'm sorry.

73
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,840
Rong Hua.

74
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,840
Come in.

75
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,840
Come in.

76
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,840
Rong Hua.

77
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,840
Sit down.

78
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,840
Sit down.

79
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,840
Sit down.

80
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,840
When can you listen to me?

81
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,840
Are you feeling better?

82
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,840
Lin Yi Qing.

83
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,840
I'm feeling better.

84
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,840
Even a little bit,

85
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,840
I may break my feelings for you.

86
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,840
Why can't you do it?

87
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,840
What should we do?

88
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,840
Don't think too much.

89
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,840
It's not your fault.

90
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,840
But it's my father's fault.

91
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,840
It's not my fault.

92
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,840
It's Long Yin Cheng's fault.

93
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,840
I can't escape from this fact.

94
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,840
You don't have to choose to escape.

95
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,840
You don't have to bear it alone.

96
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,840
Let's face it together.

97
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,840
When did you know

98
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,840
about the matter of the Elders?

99
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,840
I knew it when I was in the Lotus Pavilion.

100
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,840
I just wanted to find out about it in person.

101
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,840
I didn't want to face it for my mother.

102
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,840
Since you've already known the truth,

103
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,840
what are you going to do next?

104
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,840
I'll tell you.

105
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,840
Actually,

106
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,840
Lu Yi Zhou and Cang Qi

107
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,840
are the orphans of the Nalan family.

108
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,840
They are the children

109
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,840
my mother saved

110
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,840
in that suicide.

111
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,840
I didn't know it before.

112
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,840
But now I finally understand

113
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,840
that in that suicide,

114
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,840
the most important family members were lost.

115
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,840
I can't forgive them at all.

116
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,840
My mother was thinking about revenge.

117
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,840
I told her every time

118
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,840
that revenge can't solve any problems.

119
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,840
But now I finally understand

120
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,840
that it's not my mother

121
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,840
who was hated and brainwashed.

122
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,840
It's in front of me

123
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,840
that she has a cruel truth.

124
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,840
If it were you,

125
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,840
what are you going to do?

126
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
I'll tell you.

127
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,840
Lin Qing,

128
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,840
I'm willing to protect Lin Xu Ge with you.

129
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,840
No matter who bullies Lin Xu Ge in the future,

130
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,840
no matter who he is,

131
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,840
even if he's from Longyin City,

132
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,840
he'll be a good man.

133
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,840
I'm willing to protect him.

134
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,840
I'm willing to protect him.

135
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,840
I'm willing to protect him.

136
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,840
I'm willing to protect him.

137
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,840
I'm willing to protect him.

138
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,840
I'm willing to protect him.

139
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,840
I'm willing to protect him.

140
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,840
I'm willing to protect him.

141
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,840
I'm willing to protect him.

142
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,840
I'm willing to protect him.

143
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,840
I'm willing to protect him.

144
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,840
I'm willing to protect him.

145
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,840
I'm willing to protect him.

146
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,840
I'm willing to protect him.

147
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,840
I'm willing to protect him.

148
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,840
I'm willing to protect him.

149
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,840
I'm willing to protect him.

150
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,840
I'm willing to protect him.

151
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,840
I'm willing to protect him.

152
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,840
I'm willing to protect him.

153
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,840
I'm willing to protect him.

154
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,840
I'm willing to protect him.

155
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,840
I'm willing to protect him.

156
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,840
I'm willing to protect him.

157
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,840
I'm willing to protect him.

158
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,840
I'm willing to protect him.

159
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,840
I'm willing to protect him.

160
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,840
I'm willing to protect him.

161
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,840
I'm willing to protect him.

162
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,840
I'm willing to protect him.

163
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,840
I'm willing to protect him.

164
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,840
I'm willing to protect him.

165
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,840
I'm willing to protect him.

166
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,840
I'm willing to protect him.

167
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,840
I'm willing to protect him.

168
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,840
I must protect him.

169
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,840
I must protect him.

170
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,840
Hurry and go find your mom.

171
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,840
I'm going to send her a message.

172
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,840
The message that you've sent.

173
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,840
My Sh跌...

174
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,960
You can't bet on your love forever.

175
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,560
Mingjing.

176
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,100
They told me this morning

177
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:40,960
that Hua's asthma summer fever

178
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,640
has returned to normal yesterday.

179
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,160
So I proposed them a drink.

180
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,760
I wonder how they are now.

181
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,960
I have one thing

182
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,680
that I hope you can take back.

183
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,600
I'm afraid

184
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,120
we can't stop it.

185
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,320
They're already fighting.

186
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,920
It's not a threat to you.

187
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,840
Why do you still want to kill them?

188
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,440
Now

189
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,560
they can contact the Xiao family

190
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,120
to invade our Longyin City.

191
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,000
That means they can

192
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,560
join any gang

193
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,520
and invade our Longyin City

194
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,320
again.

195
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,720
If they're soft-hearted about it,

196
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,880
it means they left

197
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,640
a great deal of regret for Longyin City.

198
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,040
And at this moment,

199
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,960
Longyin City is in danger.

200
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,400
How can they be convinced in the future?

201
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,720
Maybe

202
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,840
they had no choice

203
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,920
but to make this choice.

204
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,520
If they didn't fight for their lives,

205
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,840
they wouldn't have survived.

206
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,080
Now they're

207
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,160
all innocent

208
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,640
except for these two brothers.

209
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,240
You should think about it.

210
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,080
You don't have to

211
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,080
worry about it.

212
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,000
I'll decide it myself.

213
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,440
I'll go check on Hua'er.

214
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,280
She suddenly fell ill yesterday.

215
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,440
She's resting in my room.

216
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,600
I've been looking after her all night.

217
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,200
Her body is under control now.

218
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,360
So you don't have to worry about it.

219
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,960
Hua'er is in your room?

220
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,760
Hua'er.

221
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,040
Come on. Let me help you.

222
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,000
Come on.

223
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,080
Put it down.

224
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,800
Step back.

225
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,560
Dad.

226
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,240
Tell me.

227
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,920
What's the matter?

228
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,240
Drink the medicine.

229
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,120
I'll send you back to your room after you finish it.

230
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,120
I've been suffering from cold since I was a kid.

231
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,040
Every winter,

232
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,560
I made the medicine myself.

233
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,880
I'm afraid I won't have the chance

234
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,760
to make the medicine myself again.

235
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,000
Yeah.

236
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,440
If you can stay in your room

237
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,040
and don't run around,

238
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,560
you won't suffer from cold.

239
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,800
You've been well-bred.

240
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,880
I don't have to make the medicine for you every year.

241
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,640
I'll remember your concern.

242
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,480
I'll take good care of myself.

243
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,400
Lin Jing and I have been married for life.

244
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,960
In a few days,

245
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,800
the Lin family will get married.

246
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,120
Please help us, dad.

247
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,880
You're so ridiculous.

248
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,240
How can you

249
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,560
make such a big deal out of marriage?

250
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,120
Actually, the whole Longyin City

251
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,720
knows about me and Lin Jing.

252
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,480
In a few days,

253
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,960
the news will spread.

254
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,120
This time,

255
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,840
I must go back with him.

256
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,600
Hua.

257
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,320
I didn't do a good job.

258
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,800
I should have asked the City Leader to do it earlier.

259
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,280
It's all because of Longyin City.

260
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,640
It's my fault.

261
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,600
Lin Jing.

262
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,640
I need to eat some hot food

263
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,920
for the wedding.

264
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,040
Okay.

265
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,080
I'll go get some for you in the kitchen.

266
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,080
Dad.

267
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,320
All right.

268
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,480
Sit down.

269
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,800
Here.

270
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,360
Drink the medicine first.

271
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,000
Wait a minute.

272
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,720
I'll add some sugar for you.

273
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,320
You're such a silly girl.

274
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,720
You're so silly.

275
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,920
How can a girl

276
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,880
tell her own story

277
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,600
about marriage?

278
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,600
Dad.

279
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,640
You know me best.

280
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,760
I've been a sick girl since I was a child.

281
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,120
I don't know how long I can live.

282
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,840
I just want to be with the one I love

283
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,280
and be with him.

284
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,200
If you don't agree,

285
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,520
I'll be alone for my whole life

286
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,320
and never mention it again.

287
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,120
What do you mean by that?

288
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,360
Are you threatening me?

289
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,240
Actually,

290
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,440
I know

291
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,960
what you're saying.

292
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,040
You're still worried that I'll do harm to Lin Jing, right?

293
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,040
Will you do that, Dad?

294
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,560
Yes.

295
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,200
Lin Jing was born and died for Longyin City.

296
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,880
In my father's eyes,

297
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,920
you think he should do that.

298
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,640
But in my heart,

299
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,440
I don't want to let him down.

300
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,200
If someone does harm to him in the future,

301
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,560
no matter who he is,

302
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,320
I won't let him go.

303
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,160
Have you tried it?

304
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,160
Cheng Mei's Erik Rose B-talk is a popular sheen for children and jazz dancers.

305
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,480
How many children do you have?

306
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,680
As many as 13 children.

307
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,200
So many,

308
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,800
Liuying City!

309
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,760
Great!

310
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,480
Liuying City!

311
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,960
You should go back to Longyin City today.

312
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,160
The Great Elder of Tang Gate sent me a message.

313
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,280
But the other elder wasn't captured.

314
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,120
Liuying City is in danger.

315
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,280
I have to stay here for a while.

316
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,880
I didn't expect that they would sneak into the Sky City

317
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,920
and set a trap for Longyin City.

318
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,480
If I can't finish it as soon as possible,

319
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,120
I, Kong Zitang, will be responsible for my failure.

320
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,160
I can't explain it.

321
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,480
I found that

322
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,480
you are quite similar to Lin Jing in some places.

323
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,040
If he makes a mistake,

324
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,720
he will find a way to make up for it.

325
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,680
Otherwise, he will be like you,

326
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,680
and feel uneasy.

327
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,320
Don't compare me to Lin Jing.

328
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,720
He is not like me.

329
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,960
Today, Longyin City sent me a message

330
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,880
that he will marry Rong Hua for self-protection.

331
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,200
I don't do things without any reason.

332
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,960
How dare you use a woman as a bait?

333
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,720
You are really not afraid of being laughed at.

334
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,800
That's because you don't know Lin Jing at all.

335
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,320
That's why you misunderstood him.

336
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,240
He will risk his life to save Rong Hua.

337
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,360
Naturally, he won't make fun of his life.

338
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,320
Moreover, he protects Chihua and goes to the Palace.

339
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,440
There is no need for that.

340
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,600
They are in love.

341
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:54,840
Do you believe it?

342
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:55,800
Boring.

343
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,880
What are you doing?

344
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,000
Going back to Longyin City.

345
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,320
There is a disciple of Kongzitang guarding here.

346
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,200
There won't be any mistake in the meantime.

347
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,320
You only have this one sister.

348
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,600
You should go back and send her your blessings.

349
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,680
You two sisters

350
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,480
should go back to the front line.

351
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,560
Will you go back with them?

352
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,720
Do I have a reason to stay?

353
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,080
Little thing.

354
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:33,880
Little thing.

355
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,040
Little thing.

356
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,000
Such a fierce temperament.

357
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,560
I don't think

358
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,160
we will be suitable for each other.

359
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,480
There are many people in the roadside.

360
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,480
We will go around.

361
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,480
Take someone to take care of them.

362
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,160
Cut the board.

363
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,240
I'm really sorry.

364
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,080
I'm really sorry.

365
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,240
I didn't mean to delay your trip.

366
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,440
It's just that

367
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,880
I'm not in a hurry.

368
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,720
I'm sorry.

369
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,480
I'm sorry.

370
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,320
I'm sorry.

371
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,320
I'm sorry.

372
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,240
I'm sorry.

373
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,040
I'm sorry.

374
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,040
I'm sorry.

375
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,760
It's just that

376
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,360
I just smelled a familiar smell.

377
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,680
Excuse me to ask

378
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,680
if there is a bath in the sedan chair?

379
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,600
It's hard to find a bath.

380
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,880
It's harder to distinguish its taste.

381
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,120
You can taste its taste.

382
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,840
It seems that you are definitely an expert.

383
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,960
Expert can't talk.

384
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,600
I just like to eat.

385
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,160
I'm quite good at food.

386
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,560
I often eat a good bite

387
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,200
and go to different places to find good food.

388
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,800
Many years ago,

389
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,000
I was lucky to taste a bath.

390
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,120
I remember that

391
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,240
it was born in the cold.

392
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,480
It's very tender.

393
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,280
Very fresh.

394
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,360
It can be remembered for a lifetime.

395
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,400
It's hard to find a good friend.

396
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,600
Give these baths to this expert.

397
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,560
I...

398
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,640
I...

399
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,800
I'm really not good at it.

400
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,520
Wait a minute.

401
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,840
The bath is very valuable.

402
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,040
I wanted to compare it with something.

403
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,800
But I just found it

404
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,960
and it's just a broken book.

405
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,760
But the book

406
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,360
is full of food and drinks from different places.

407
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:50,960
I think it's...

408
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,880
I think it's a gift

409
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,120
from me.

410
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,040
No need.

411
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,040
You really like food.

412
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,680
This book is more valuable

413
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,280
than the book I have.

414
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,240
We are just acquaintances.

415
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,280
If you feel guilty,

416
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,480
you can take it as a debt.

417
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,360
If we meet again,

418
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,320
I will ask you for it.

419
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,640
Well...

420
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,040
I'm sorry.

421
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,080
It's settled.

422
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,640
Let's go.

423
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,120
Go.

424
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,520
Be careful.

425
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,360
Be careful.

426
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,640
Be careful.

427
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,320
Take care.

428
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,400
Be careful.

429
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,520
The bath is very beautiful.

430
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,880
When I get back to Longyin City,

431
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,600
I will make a bowl of

432
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,960
delicious soup for Zi Yan.

433
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,680
No.

434
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,400
I haven't even seen her face.

435
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,000
How can I pay her back?

436
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,280
Go.

437
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,480
Hurry up.

438
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,280
The procedures are ready.

439
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:01,960
We can go now.

440
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:08,840
My fatheromination

441
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,600
for your pinch voice

442
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,320
is highly appreciated.

443
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,120
You have made such a big contribution.

444
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,040
The winter is over.

445
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,320
Everything

446
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,760
will start over.

447
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,960
When the spring comes,

448
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,480
we will leave Longyin City.

449
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,840
Before I leave,

450
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,400
I will destroy this garden

451
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,900
He's a fool!

452
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,560
I can't stand this.

453
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,560
Don't call me your master anymore.

454
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,560
Master.

455
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,560
Sister left the Ling Sect

456
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,560
because of something.

457
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,560
Don't make it hard for her.

458
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,560
It's not easy for her

459
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,560
to be alone after so many years.

460
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,560
Since she's in a hurry,

461
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,560
why don't you forgive her?

462
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,560
What?

463
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,560
What?

464
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,560
You care about people.

465
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,560
You want to blame the good people.

466
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,560
Master.

467
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,560
Sister has learned

468
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,560
the lesson from what happened that year.

469
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,560
Now we need to remember

470
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,560
the power of Lingxu Pavilion.

471
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,560
Let the past grudges

472
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,560
pass.

473
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,560
Your sister has a wish for us now.

474
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,560
A wish?

475
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,560
She should have a wish.

476
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,560
She should bow her head

477
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,560
and step on the past grudges

478
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,560
to be a beggar.

479
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,560
Master.

480
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,560
Sister is here.

481
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,560
Your sister knows better

482
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:14,560
what is evil in people.

483
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,560
Master is right.

484
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,560
Since Ruohan chose to turn back,

485
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,560
I'll let you do it.

486
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,560
I appreciate your intention

487
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,560
to protect me.

488
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,560
I didn't expect that

489
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,560
your style hasn't changed for so many years.

490
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,560
You still fall into

491
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,560
something that others can't notice.

492
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,560
Rong Jingfeng and Rong Su

493
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,560
are like the sea

494
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,560
when they are together.

495
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,560
If the Pavilion fails,

496
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,560
they will come here again.

497
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,560
This time, we set up a trap

498
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,560
is the best chance.

499
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,560
Now,

500
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,560
when our people get involved,

501
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,560
no one will know.

502
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,560
You are still thinking about it.

503
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,560
No matter how I plan to think about it,

504
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,560
I can't be compared to

505
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,560
the biggest lurker in Longyin City.

506
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,560
He is the key this time.

507
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,560
Wuzhuo.

508
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,560
How is the situation

509
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,560
of the elders of Tang's clan?

510
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,560
Everything is under control.

511
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,560
I should feed him medicine.

512
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,560
Good.

513
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,560
If the two sides are united,

514
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,560
it will be a good time.

515
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,560
I can't see him anymore.

516
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,560
The two sides are united.

517
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,560
They are in love.

518
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,560
Love in this world

519
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,560
is really vulgar.

520
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,560
It seems that Miss Rong

521
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,560
doesn't know what love is.

522
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,560
The two sides of love are united.

523
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,560
Once the love is in the middle,

524
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,560
they will live and die together.

525
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,560
The most vulgar love in the world

526
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,560
is just old age.

527
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,560
But it's the most difficult thing in the world.

528
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,560
If one day...

529
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,560
No matter we are united or not,

530
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,560
remember,

531
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,560
don't say goodbye to me.

532
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,560
Don't say goodbye to me.

533
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,560
For me,

534
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,560
meeting and separation

535
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,560
are just a blink of an eye.

536
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,560
It's not worth a day.

537
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,560
You don't want to wait for Hua'er?

538
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,560
This kid.

539
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,560
He has a gentle personality since he was a kid.

540
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,560
But in fact,

541
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,560
he is more stubborn than any of us.

542
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,560
He is not stubborn.

543
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,560
Once he decides something,

544
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,560
he can't even pull the bull by the head.

545
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,560
But this Lin Jing

546
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,560
really worries me.

547
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,560
You want to get rid of him?

548
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,560
Don't worry.

549
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,560
It's not easy for your father to kill me.

550
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,560
I will be honest

551
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,560
and take you away from Longyin City.

552
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,560
The beauty is late.

553
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,560
Who wants to be the first?

554
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,560
Lin Jing

555
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,560
finally became the leader.

556
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,560
Can he really give up the life?

557
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,560
Maybe

558
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,560
he is not a stable person.

559
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,560
He didn't come for the sake of

560
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,560
the leader of the Hall of Life and Death.

561
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,560
This Lin Jing is not easy.

562
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,560
Even if we really want to get rid of him,

563
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,560
I'm afraid it can only be an accident.

564
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,560
We can't let outsiders

565
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,560
notice any clues.

566
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,560
But now,

567
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,560
we have a bigger problem.

568
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,560
The two elders of the Hall of Life and Death are still in danger.

569
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,560
We can't leave any hidden trouble.

570
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,560
I have seen the Hall Leader.

571
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,560
There are no outsiders here.

572
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,560
You don't have to be so polite.

573
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,560
I don't know when Madam left the Hall of Life and Death.

574
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,560
Why did she suddenly come here?

575
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,560
I have heard about their relationship.

576
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,560
Don't be nervous.

577
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,560
I don't object to it.

578
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,560
Could it be that Madam

579
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,560
came for the Hall Leader?

580
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,560
Go and get ready.

581
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,560
I'm going to the Dragon City to propose a marriage.

582
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,560
That's great.

583
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,560
No matter what kind of person Rong Jingfeng is,

584
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,560
the others are always innocent.

585
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,560
In this way,

586
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,560
we can still have a good marriage.

587
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,560
If the Hall Leader knows Madam's mind,

588
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,560
he will be very touched.

589
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,560
You have prepared the wedding gift for me.

590
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,560
But,

591
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,560
do me a favor.

592
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,560
Old Bai has sent people to send the message back.

593
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,560
They have already

594
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,560
gone to the Hall of Life and Death.

595
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,560
It seems that the Tang and Xiao

596
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,560
are working together to deal with the Dragon City.

597
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,560
They have made a complete preparation in advance.

598
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,560
I have asked the disciples to check the sky-seal

599
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,560
and nothing is wrong.

600
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,560
I will go and check the sky-seal.

601
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,560
Lin Jing.

602
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,560
You take a team of people

603
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,560
to pick up Old Bai.

604
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,560
They are on their way back to the city.

605
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,560
If the Tang family fails this time,

606
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,560
I'm afraid they will kill Old Bai

607
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,560
in the first place.

608
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,560
City Leader.

609
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,560
The medicine of the Hall of Life and Death is used to cure people.

610
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,560
It's better to use the Hall of Empty and Dead to treat the old man.

611
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,560
Su'er.

612
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,560
You are still injured.

613
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,560
You don't have to worry about this.

614
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,560
Lin Jing.

615
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,560
You go and pick up Old Bai.

616
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,560
Okay.

617
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,560
Lin Jing.

618
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,560
Don't worry.

619
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,560
When an apprentice is in trouble,

620
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,560
I, as a master,

621
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,560
should go.

622
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,560
City Leader.

623
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,560
I'm going now.

624
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,560
Okay.

625
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,560
Su'er.

626
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,560
Liu Bu.

627
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,560
Little Aunt.

628
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,560
Little Aunt rarely comes to me

629
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,560
in the usual days.

630
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,560
I wonder what's the matter today.

631
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,560
I have a favor to ask.

632
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,560
I'm afraid I can only make you do it

633
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,560
after thinking about it.

634
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,560
I'm afraid I can only make you do it.

635
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,560
You have already got the medicine.

636
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,560
I'm afraid you can't get the medicine.

637
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,560
You can't get the medicine.

638
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,560
I can't get the medicine.

639
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,560
I can't get the medicine.

640
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,560
This is related to the happiness of the painting.

641
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,560
What exactly do you want to say?

642
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,560
I want you to help Lin Jing.

643
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,560
I have already asked the City Leader

644
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,560
to make the first move.

645
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,560
But the City Leader has ordered

646
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,560
Lin Jing to do this.

647
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,560
If I do it now,

648
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,560
I will ask for it.

649
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,560
I'm making it difficult for myself.

650
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,560
Actually,

651
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,560
Old Bai was not ambushed

652
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,560
on the way back to the city.

653
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,560
Your father sent Lin Jing to pick you up

654
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,560
because he wanted to get rid of him.

655
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,560
I'm sorry.

656
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,560
I'm sorry.

657
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,560
Since it's the City Leader's plan,

658
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,560
I won't make the first move.

659
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,560
Su Er,

660
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,560
I see your efforts

661
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,560
in the Longyin City.

662
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,560
As long as you let Hua Er

663
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,560
get married into the Lin family

664
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,560
and leave here,

665
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,560
you will take over the Longyin City.

666
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,560
You are actually helping yourself

667
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,560
by helping Lin Jing.

668
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,560
I'm sorry.

669
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,560
City Leader.

670
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,560
This matter is important.

671
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,560
There can't be any mistake.

672
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,560
Zi Yan

673
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,560
is the City Leader of the Ghost Hall.

674
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,560
I will take care of it.

675
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,560
Go.

676
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,560
Go.

677
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,560
Go.

678
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,560
Go.

679
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,560
Go.

680
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,480
Give him the mask!

681
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,160
Rong Jin Feng,

682
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,000
you're still a

683
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,920
connoisseur.

684
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,240
Luckily, the Little Sui has a master.

685
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,240
Tang Wen is a master of martial arts.

686
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,280
Eating a mask soaked in antidote

687
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,200
may not be 100% effective against poison.

688
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,320
But it can also solve the problem of the moment.

689
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,600
Is it Tang Wen

690
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,760
or Rong Jin Feng's teeth?

691
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,440
You'll understand soon.

692
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,400
Who is it?

693
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,800
I'm here on the order of the leader of Lingxu Pavilion

694
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,320
to give the order to the Rong family.

695
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,800
Please go and tell them

696
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,720
that the Young Leader of Lingxu Pavilion

697
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,520
will marry the Second Miss of Longyin City.

698
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,720
Lingxu Pavilion?

699
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,680
Xie Pin Lin!

700
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,240
What are you doing here?

701
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,120
reach out to the danger

702
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,440
and escape from us

703
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,960
Even living in trouble

704
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,440
will guide us through abandonment

705
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,280
Come out

706
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,220
since you did it

707
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,120
If I didn't

708
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:12,020
you would be in trouble

709
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,020
Remember it later.

710
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,340
As long as you leave Luoyang with Rong Hua,

711
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,140
it's the best way to meet each other.

712
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,740
Leave here alive first.

713
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,660
We should be able to solve it in an hour.

714
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,420
We two together,

715
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,900
half an hour is enough.

716
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,220
Lin Jing is the Young Master of Lingxu Pavilion.

717
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,380
When did you know?

718
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,540
I knew it when I entered Lingxu Pavilion.

719
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,980
How could you help an outsider to trick your father?

720
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,340
You even let this outsider

721
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,140
become the Hall Leader of Longyin City.

722
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,940
What are you going to do?

723
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,060
Let me ask you.

724
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:59,020
Was the thing you were chased

725
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,620
planned by him

726
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,220
to get close to you?

727
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:03,220
I...

728
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,140
Of course not.

729
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,740
Lingxu Pavilion has its own power

730
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,060
in the north and south of Longyin City.

731
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,860
That's because we have our own abilities.

732
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,020
We were originally both in the north and south,

733
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:16,860
but we didn't interfere.

734
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,260
But the only mistake of our Hall Leader

735
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,460
was that the Young Master of Lingxu Pavilion

736
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,820
entered your City in order to escape from the wedding.

737
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,300
But this time,

738
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,980
Young Master and Miss Rong

739
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,580
are in love and marriage.

740
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:28,860
They are a perfect match.

741
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,780
That's why the Hall Leader sent me

742
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,060
to give the Second Miss a betrothal gift.

743
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,420
I hope you can help her

744
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,420
and help her.

745
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,340
Who do you think you are?

746
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:40,980
You stand here

747
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,660
and talk nonsense

748
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,420
with your lips.

749
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,340
I will marry my precious daughter

750
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,980
to your Hall Leader.

751
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,740
What did you eat?

752
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,500
You made such a big dream.

753
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:54,660
Shouldn't you ask them

754
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,300
if they are going to marry or not?

755
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,060
Why didn't you see Lin Jing today?

756
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,900
I hope you can ask her to come out and meet him.

757
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:10,140
If there is anything wrong with the Young Master,

758
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,060
I'm afraid

759
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,260
you will not give up

760
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,580
even if you take over the whole Longyin City.

761
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,380
Kid,

762
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,380
are you threatening me with your words?

763
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,220
I'm telling you,

764
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,660
the people of Longyin City are not good people.

765
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,700
You brought so many bad guys

766
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,700
to my Longyin City today.

767
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,460
Can you get out of here alive

768
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,940
or is it still in my mind?

769
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,980
Now, outside your Longyin City,

770
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,900
there are already many disciples of our Lingxu Pavilion.

771
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,500
If we can't take the Young Master out of the city safely today,

772
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,620
I'm afraid the smoke in Longyin City

773
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,220
will be re-ignited.

774
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,140
Does City Leader Rong really think

775
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,900
we are not prepared

776
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,500
to come here?

777
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,380
All right.

778
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,380
Then you just wait.

779
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:55,700
If Lin Jing

780
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,620
can really go back to the city...

781
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,300
It turns out that it was my brother who set up a trap

782
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,860
to let Lin Jing go out of the city.

783
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,060
I don't agree to Ronghua's marriage.

784
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,420
And

785
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,940
she married into such a remote place.

786
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,620
I didn't expect that my brother was deceived by Lin Jing for so long.

787
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:24,260
This brat is so despicable.

788
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,420
Master,

789
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:26,700
you're back.

790
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:27,740
Where is Lin Jing?

791
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,420
You...

792
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:33,620
She's not here.

793
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:35,900
Father,

794
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,180
are you...

795
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,580
Are you all right?

796
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,500
I'm sorry.

797
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,500
I'm sorry.

798
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,500
I'm sorry.

799
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,500
I'm sorry.

800
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,500
I'm sorry.

801
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,500
I'm sorry.

802
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,500
I'm sorry.

803
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,500
I'm sorry.

804
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,500
I'm sorry.

805
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,500
I'm sorry.

806
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:50,500
I'm sorry.

807
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,500
I'm sorry.

808
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,500
I'm sorry.

809
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,500
I'm sorry.

810
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,500
I'm sorry.

811
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,500
I'm sorry.

812
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,500
I'm sorry.

813
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,500
I'm sorry.

814
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,500
I'm sorry.

815
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,500
I'm sorry.

816
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,500
I'm sorry.

817
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,500
I'm sorry.

818
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,500
I'm sorry.

819
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,500
I'm sorry.

820
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,500
I'm sorry.

821
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,500
I'm sorry.

822
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,500
I'm sorry.

823
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,500
I'm sorry.

824
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,500
I'm sorry.

825
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,500
I'm sorry.

826
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,500
I'm sorry.

827
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,500
I'm sorry.

828
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,500
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

834

I'm sorry.

835
