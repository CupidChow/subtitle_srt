1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The King Of Blaze

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 1

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The King Of Blaze

4
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You want me to do this.

5
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Why do you have to use these lanterns?

6
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I only lit these lanterns

7
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
to save you from the bloodshed.

8
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Now it looks like

9
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
it's a joke.

10
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I was wrong.

11
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Sometimes, lanterns are used as a wedding gift.

12
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It seems that the past I told you last time

13
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
is useful.

14
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Just a simple word

15
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
will make the King of Blaze

16
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
have doubts about me and Mohan.

17
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Do you feel happy

18
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
if I do this?

19
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What about you?

20
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Or you have already decided

21
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
to be the King of Blaze?

22
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And I, Lu Yizhou,

23
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
am just a passer-by for you?

24
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I don't know.

25
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I've only killed people in my life,

26
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
but I've never saved people.

27
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Maybe from the beginning,

28
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I took the life of a savior

29
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
and became the King of Blaze.

30
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
But in the past ten years,

31
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I've been too desperate.

32
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I can only look for hope.

33
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I can only look for hope.

34
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The only exception is you.

35
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
If you want to blame me,

36
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
blame yourself for being wrong.

37
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I know.

38
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You've been following me for days.

39
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But you're not good at

40
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
apologizing.

41
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
But I'm not a magnanimous person.

42
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Today,

43
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I just want to tell you

44
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
that no matter how sad you are,

45
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
it has nothing to do with me.

46
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
We're the same.

47
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
We're the same.

48
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Hypocrite.

49
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Hypocrite is better

50
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
than deceiving yourself.

51
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm afraid someone has lost too much.

52
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I can't even find

53
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
the person I love.

54
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The Meihua Town that broke the coal fire this time

55
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
was burned down by the coal forest in your mansion.

56
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Sooner or later,

57
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'll personally ask the coal fire master for a favor.

58
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
If you didn't concentrate on the business,

59
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
we couldn't avoid the guard at the front door.

60
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
But I really opened my eyes this time.

61
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The people of Lingxu Pavilion

62
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
are really extraordinary.

63
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm afraid

64
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
that the people of Lingxu Pavilion

65
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
will be in danger.

66
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm afraid that

67
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
the people of Lingxu Pavilion

68
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
will be in danger.

69
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Madam asked Miss Mei to go to Lingxu Pavilion.

70
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
She shouldn't have taken the risk.

71
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But only in this way,

72
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
the people of Mei Pavilion won't

73
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
fight with Lingxu Pavilion in public.

74
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I hope Miss Mei will understand.

75
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It doesn't matter.

76
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
If you didn't think carefully,

77
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
we would have been caught by my brother.

78
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Hurry up and go to the city.

79
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You must go back to Lingxu Pavilion today.

80
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yes.

81
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Go.

82
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Madam,

83
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
the information about Lingxu Pavilion has been sent.

84
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I believe that Mingzun

85
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
will receive the news soon.

86
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Madam, you are beautiful.

87
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's really hard

88
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
to investigate the Lingxu Pavilion

89
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
these days.

90
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm doing this for Mingzun.

91
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's nothing.

92
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
But after the investigation,

93
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
the situation of Lingxu Pavilion is very tight.

94
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm afraid that

95
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
the people of Lingxu Pavilion

96
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
are very cautious.

97
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Although the Mei Pavilion has been in decline for a long time,

98
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
it's not easy to take it down.

99
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Do you know

100
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
where the first lost Chihua Pearl is?

101
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
According to Madam,

102
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
the Chihua Pearl is in the hands of the Mei Pavilion.

103
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Did the Hall Leader kill her

104
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
because of the Mei Pavilion?

105
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Yes.

106
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The Mei Pavilion wanted to use the Chihua Pearl

107
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
to make a marriage with Lingxu Pavilion.

108
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It seems that

109
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
someone in Lingxu Pavilion

110
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
is in danger.

111
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And this person's position in Lingxu Pavilion

112
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
is very suspicious.

113
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Since you have the news,

114
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
who should be the most suitable person

115
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
to enter the Lingxu Pavilion?

116
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Lingzun is your master.

117
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You still don't understand his mind.

118
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
How can I not understand?

119
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It seems that

120
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
he will take action in person.

121
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Thanks to Madam's help,

122
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
no one in the world

123
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
is more intelligent than Xue Wen.

124
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Lingxu Pavilion will never let Long Yun City be the target.

125
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
In the form of Lingxu Pavilion,

126
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
it will definitely be punished by Rong Jingfeng.

127
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
As long as Rong Jingfeng has a little brain,

128
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I should be able to find Lingxu Pavilion soon.

129
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
If it weren't for you being the master of the Pavilion,

130
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
you come here every day

131
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
to look at the Chihua Pearl so carefully,

132
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
people will think

133
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
you are playing Chihua Book.

134
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
The Snow Lotus hasn't withered yet.

135
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It will bloom soon.

136
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So far,

137
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I have only one problem

138
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
that I can't figure out.

139
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
What kind of problem

140
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
can make me such a smart master?

141
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Before,

142
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Mohua had to come here

143
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
to collect the Poisonous Worms for a week.

144
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
But this place

145
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
has only one way to Long Yun City.

146
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
There are guards.

147
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
The rest of the place is dead.

148
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I asked the guards.

149
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
They didn't notice anything.

150
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Then what kind of method

151
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
did Mohua use

152
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
to hide from so many eyes

153
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and sneak in?

154
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Mohua is very mysterious.

155
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
When she pretended to be a wooden salt,

156
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
you didn't see Duan Ning

157
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
when you were dealing with her.

158
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
What's more, these disciples...

159
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
This matter

160
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
must be investigated as soon as possible.

161
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Otherwise,

162
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
no matter how many disciples we have,

163
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
it's useless.

164
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's the first time

165
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I've seen you become so serious.

166
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Am I supposed to be like you?

167
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I eat and drink every day.

168
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Look at you now.

169
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You're almost a pig.

170
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Look at your face and your belly.

171
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm not kidding.

172
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Your father

173
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
actually gave this matter

174
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
to the Holy Weapon Hall.

175
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I can't mess it up.

176
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Actually, the people who took the Chihua Bead

177
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
were all for the sake of continuing their lives.

178
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
The Chihua Bead was already poisonous.

179
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
At the same time,

180
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
they had to endure the pain of their heart.

181
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The secret of Longyin City is not the Chihua Bead,

182
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
but its antidote.

183
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Everyone is afraid of death.

184
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
They asked for the Chihua Bead

185
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
just to live.

186
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So no one

187
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
dared to offend Longyin City.

188
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
But if this matter

189
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
involves Mohua,

190
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
it won't be easy.

191
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
If the Chihua Bead

192
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
is stolen again when it's over,

193
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
then Longyin City

194
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
will not be able to

195
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
stand in the martial arts world.

196
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Do you have any idea?

197
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Longyin City's disciples

198
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
can only deal with ordinary people.

199
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
If they deal with Mohua,

200
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
don't mention the feeling.

201
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Even if they feel it,

202
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
it's hard to deal with.

203
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So,

204
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
we have to come up with a good idea.

205
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
When the Chihua Bead is over,

206
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
will there be any change?

207
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
When the Chihua Bead is over,

208
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
it was in the time of winter.

209
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I rarely went out

210
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
because of the cold.

211
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I don't know

212
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
what it was like when it was over.

213
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
After the snow,

214
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
winter has passed,

215
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
snow is still here.

216
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's like the plum fragrance of the Mei family.

217
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
What do you think?

218
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
To deal with Mohua,

219
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
we have to line up the troops

220
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
and set up the formation.

221
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Longyin City

222
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
is too boring.

223
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's boring to go around

224
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
without much effort.

225
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's said that Longyin City

226
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
is always as good as the clouds.

227
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Why didn't anyone

228
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
stop me?

229
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
What?

230
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
After being the City Leader for years,

231
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
you don't even know your master.

232
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
What's wrong?

233
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
How could it be, Master?

234
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
After so many years,

235
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
you still look good.

236
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But under the weather,

237
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
who can stop you?

238
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You came to Longyin City

239
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
from far away.

240
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

241
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So I could have prepared

242
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
and welcomed you.

243
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You are really different.

244
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You are more polite

245
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
when you talk and act

246
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
as the City Leader.

247
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
But

248
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
it's a pity.

249
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I thought you would live a good life

250
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
after betraying the Ling family.

251
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I didn't expect you to grow up

252
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
so fast these years.

253
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm really worried about you.

254
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
What do you want to do

255
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
in Longyin City today?

256
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Is it just to

257
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
disturb the old?

258
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You used to

259
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
be fearless.

260
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Why are you more nervous

261
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
now that you have power and power?

262
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
All right.

263
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
For the sake

264
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
of our Martialereducherت,

265
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
today I'm calling you Master.

266
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
But if you

267
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
touch my Startlingヒrm again,

268
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
my effort

269
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
will not close your other wishes.

270
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I don't like

271
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
the word death

272
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
at this time.

273
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
What exactly do you want?

274
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,760
If so,

275
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,840
you should ask what you have done.

276
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,040
Back then,

277
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,120
you betrayed the Spiritual Cult

278
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,400
and stole the Chihua Bead, the treasure of the Spiritual Cult.

279
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,880
The Chihua Bead is for saving people.

280
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,520
It should be returned to its original owner,

281
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,040
not used by you.

282
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,600
By the way,

283
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,200
I'm here to tell you

284
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,080
that I've found

285
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,840
the whereabouts of the first Chihua Bead.

286
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,720
What?

287
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,760
You mean

288
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,680
you're willing to tell me about it?

289
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,200
Shouldn't you know

290
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,360
that I never

291
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,400
follow the rules?

292
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,200
The Chihua Bead

293
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,440
is in Lingxu Pavilion now.

294
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,360
I want to compete with you

295
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,000
to see who can

296
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,440
take it back first.

297
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,080
Lingxu Pavilion's power

298
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,760
is not inferior to that of Longyin City.

299
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,480
Lingxu Pavilion will never

300
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,680
let you be the consort.

301
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,600
If you really have the power,

302
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,080
you can take it down yourself.

303
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,880
Why bother to come here

304
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,280
and tell me?

305
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,880
I'm not interested in Longyin City.

306
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,200
It's more interesting to compete with you.

307
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,080
Do you think

308
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,760
I should go to Lingxu Pavilion first

309
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,000
or take care of the other schools

310
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,600
that have Chihua Beads?

311
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,840
Good idea.

312
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,520
I wonder how much power

313
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,280
Master has regained

314
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,040
since he left the Pass.

315
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,120
Ten years later

316
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,320
It's been so many years.

317
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,960
Why haven't you improved?

318
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,600
The past will not end here.

319
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:43,600
Longyan City's current status is all up to me.

320
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:50,600
I will never allow anyone to ruin my efforts.

321
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,600
Come.

322
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,600
Your father's wound is very small, but it is the meridians.

323
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,600
If we don't use this method,

324
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,600
we will destroy the skin first, and then we will re-suck the meridians.

325
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,600
I'm afraid we won't be able to eat blood.

326
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,600
This wound is bleeding like a pig.

327
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,600
It's very likely to be ignored.

328
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,600
If there is too much blood, there is a risk of life.

329
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,600
I saw this wound on the medical books of the Life and Death Hall.

330
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,600
I can only be bold.

331
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,600
I didn't expect Mo Huan's martial arts skills to be so high.

332
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
How is the situation of the City Leader?

333
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,600
Such a big thing.

334
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,600
You... you actually stopped me.

335
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,600
You don't let me get away.

336
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,600
Am I an outsider?

337
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,600
This is the matter of the Life and Death Hall.

338
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,600
You don't interfere with the old life hall, okay?

339
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
You...

340
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,600
Lin Qing.

341
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,600
Take someone to Lingxu Pavilion immediately.

342
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,600
You must stop Mo Huan and take back the Chihua Bead.

343
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,600
Chihua Bead is in Lingxu Pavilion?

344
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,600
Is it because of my mother's illness that it has deteriorated?

345
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,600
Why is the Chihua Bead in Lingxu Pavilion?

346
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,600
What are you thinking?

347
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,600
The news of Lingxu Pavilion is not disclosed.

348
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,600
Rumors in the underworld say that the intruders have gone and never returned.

349
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,600
Are we really going there?

350
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,600
It's good to have gone and never returned.

351
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,600
But I don't want to go.

352
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,600
I don't want to go.

353
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,600
It's good to have gone and never returned.

354
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,600
Rong Hua will be a hindrance to stay in Longyin City.

355
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,600
Now Lin Jing and Mo Huan are fighting for the Chihua Bead.

356
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,600
Plus a Lingxu Pavilion.

357
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,600
It saves us a lot of energy.

358
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,600
The City Master is seriously injured.

359
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,600
Once Lin Jing leaves,

360
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,600
the City Master's power will naturally return to the City Master.

361
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,600
Take care.

362
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,600
Be careful on the road.

363
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,600
You and Rong Su are not compatible.

364
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,600
I can't rest assured that you will stay in Longyin City alone.

365
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,600
Do you want to go to Lingxu Pavilion with me?

366
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,600
Rong Hua will definitely go with Lin Jing.

367
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,600
This is a dangerous trip.

368
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,600
How can Rong Hua rest assured?

369
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,600
In this case,

370
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,600
you can show your skills and perform well.

371
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,600
The City Master is seriously injured.

372
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,600
You ordered the Kongzi Hall to protect the Chihua Bead.

373
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,600
His purpose is to take this opportunity

374
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,600
to infiltrate the forces of Longyin City into various gangs.

375
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,600
Then he will monitor and control us.

376
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,600
I won't let him down.

377
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,600
But why did he ask Lin Jing to do this?

378
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,600
What is his plan?

379
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,600
What are you thinking about?

380
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,600
To deal with Mo Huan,

381
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,600
and to face Lingxu Pavilion.

382
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,600
They are good at martial arts and are powerful.

383
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,600
How can we not go?

384
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,600
Don't think too much about it.

385
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,600
I am here with you.

386
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,600
Let's go.

387
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,600
Greetings, Madam.

388
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,600
This is a token of my gratitude.

389
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,600
Please accept it.

390
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,600
I made the decision to go to the Mei family without permission.

391
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,600
I took the Chihua Bead with Miss Mei.

392
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,600
Please punish me.

393
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,600
Who gave you the guts to go to the Mei family for the assassination?

394
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,600
Don't be angry, Madam.

395
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,600
I did this out of fear of Brother Cang Qi.

396
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,600
I don't blame him.

397
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,600
It's a pity that

398
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,600
I will have to give you

399
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,600
the marriage with the Mei family.

400
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,600
Don't be embarrassed, Madam.

401
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,600
If Young Master has someone in mind,

402
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,600
I will bless him.

403
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,600
This Chihua Bead is just a gift from me to you.

404
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,600
You don't have to refuse it if you need it.

405
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,600
It's my luck that Yun'er is not like this.

406
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,600
Brother Cang Qi, please help Madam to rest.

407
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,600
Madam.

408
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,600
Greetings, Chief.

409
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,600
Madam.

410
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,600
Young Master asked me to bring the medicine back.

411
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,600
Maybe it will help Madam's illness.

412
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,600
Madam, she...

413
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,600
What's wrong?

414
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,600
What happened?

415
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,600
I don't know if Young Master's medicine can be used.

416
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,600
I...

417
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,600
I think this is the reason why I am not like this.

418
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,600
I almost succeeded.

419
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,600
What should I do?

420
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,600
Madam.

421
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,600
Madam, it's okay.

422
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,600
We succeeded.

423
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,600
Xue Man.

424
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,600
It's good that you are here.

425
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
I am here to report that

426
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,600
I failed to bring Young Master back to the Hall.

427
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,600
But

428
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,600
Young Master has something to tell you.

429
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,600
What does he have to say?

430
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,600
You haven't finished your task.

431
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,600
Does he know that I won't punish you?

432
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,600
It's true that I failed to do my duty.

433
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,600
I will follow your order.

434
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,600
It's been a long time.

435
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,600
Where is this?

436
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,600
You are finally back.

437
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,600
I've been waiting for you.

438
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,600
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

439
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,600
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

440
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,600
Where are you?

441
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,600
I'm here.

442
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,600
I'm here.

443
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,600
I'm here.

444
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,600
I'm here.

445
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,600
I'm here.

446
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,600
I'm here.

447
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,600
I'm here.

448
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,600
You are finally back.

449
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,600
Lin Jing.

450
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,600
Who are you?

451
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,600
Lin Jing?

452
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,600
Who are you?

453
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,600
It's okay if you don't know me.

454
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,600
As long as I know who you are, it's enough.

455
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,600
I won't hurt you.

456
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,600
I just hope you can help me a little.

457
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,600
I

458
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,600
I'm a man of the Western Regions.

459
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,600
Don't come over.

460
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,600
Interesting.

461
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,600
It turns out to be a good match.

462
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,600
I didn't expect that the Meis

463
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,600
of the four major families in Jiangnan

464
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,600
would fall into this situation.

465
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,600
The Meis' young master

466
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,600
actually hit a girl.

467
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,600
My sister is kind.

468
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,600
But I'm not easy to bully.

469
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,600
I'm going to get back at you for this battle.

470
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,600
I don't believe this is the way to deal with a girl.

471
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,600
But for my sister,

472
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,600
that's the only way.

473
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,600
I'm sorry.

474
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,600
I'm sorry.

475
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,600
I'm sorry.

476
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,600
I'm sorry.

477
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,600
I'm sorry.

478
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,600
I'm sorry.

479
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,600
I'm sorry.

480
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,600
I'm sorry.

481
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,600
I'm sorry.

482
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,600
I'm sorry.

483
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,600
I'm sorry.

484
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,600
That's the only way.

485
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,600
Put down the sword.

486
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,600
Lin Jing, don't fall into his trap.

487
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,600
Mei Ying, if you hurt her,

488
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,600
I'll kill you.

489
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,600
You call her

490
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,600
Lin Jing.

491
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,600
Lin Jing.

492
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,600
It seems that you are also a person who is in charge of the party.

493
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,600
You?

494
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,600
I won't be bullied by you.

495
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,600
The Meis' family is also a famous and righteous family in the martial arts world.

496
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,600
You and I are such a dangerous couple.

497
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,600
Aren't you afraid of being laughed at?

498
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,600
Does that girl know that?

499
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,600
Lin Jing.

500
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,600
Liuli.

501
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,600
Snow.

502
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,600
You're quite knowledgeable.

503
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,600
The mountain forest has entered the territory of Snow.

504
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,600
The middle of the world is full of snow.

505
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,600
The snow is so big.

506
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,600
The snow is so big.

507
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,600
The snow is so big.

508
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,600
The snow is so big.

509
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,600
The snow is so big.

510
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,600
The snow is so big.

511
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,600
The snow is so big.

512
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,680
I've heard stories before.

513
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,680
Everyone in terre is aware unclearly.

514
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,680
It's a place for business.

515
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:02,680
And business is all about harmony and wealth.

516
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,580
No matter who

517
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:08,680
dare to move to the 제대로 territory of Snow,

518
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,640
You have to ask my Liuli ball first.

519
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,640
Do you agree?

520
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,440
This is nothing.

521
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:25,600
Mr.arms.

522
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,760
Hand over your weapon.

523
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,000
Where is your meat.

524
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,000
I won't give up.

525
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,280
I'll find justice for the girl in your house.

526
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:46,920
Go.

527
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,160
It's just for the silver

528
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,240
300 taels

529
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,240
You two know each other?

530
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,640
Dad mentioned before

531
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,600
There is no news that Xue Meng can't find out

532
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,520
So I arranged it in advance

533
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,320
By the way

534
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,760
Xue Meng can find out the news of Lingxu Pavilion

535
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,760
This news is priceless

536
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,400
Liuli can't be the master

537
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,440
But

538
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,920
I can take you to Xue Meng in person

539
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,400
You can ask the chief

540
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:26,800
Ok

541
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,360
Rong Hua

542
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,720
I have to confess something to you

543
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,480
You two

544
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,520
The chief wants to see you

545
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,240
Chief

546
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,640
He has arrived

547
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,680
Liuli, go to the tea-making

548
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:21,920
Yes

549
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,320
Please sit down

550
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,280
I know what Miss Rong wants to buy

551
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,760
But I don't know if you can afford it

552
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,200
I don't know

553
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,080
Xue Meng can open the price

554
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,960
I will give you the price you want

555
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,800
Miss Rong is kind and kind

556
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,160
She has the style of Master Rong

557
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,840
But this time

558
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,840
The price Xue Meng wants

559
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,640
It's not as simple as real gold and silver

560
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,160
That's

561
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,800
The antidote for Chihuazhu

562
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,360
Assistant Manager Zhang

563
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,280
Thank you

564
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,480
The same

565
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,600
Thank you

566
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,680
I didn't expect a fine lady like you

567
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,600
Can cook such good soup

568
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,740
My skills are not as good as my mother's

569
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,220
and continue the glory of our family.

570
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,900
From now on,

571
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,860
you can only take good care of your son.

572
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,740
You are a good girl.

573
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,580
My son betrayed you.

574
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,140
When he comes back,

575
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,980
I will teach him a good lesson.

576
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,300
Don't be harsh on him.

577
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,980
In my heart,

578
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:10,020
he is the best man in the world.

579
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:13,060
I am willing to wait for him here.

580
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,580
I will wait for him.

581
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:17,900
Don't worry.

582
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,300
We are quite close.

583
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,740
And I have taken the Chihua Bead.

584
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,900
You are my future daughter-in-law.

585
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,620
No one can change this marriage.

586
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,540
Thank you, Madam.

587
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:31,220
Madam.

588
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,500
Come in.

589
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,900
Just say it.

590
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,860
Miss Xu Man is not an outsider.

591
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,020
Every young master and maid

592
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,380
broke into Lingxu Pavilion.

593
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,380
Cang Qi has sent someone to stop them.

594
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,620
Finally.

595
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,740
Although I can't break the master's formation,

596
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,580
I've learned the skills of the Lingxu Pavilion disciples.

597
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,300
That's all.

598
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,180
Young Master didn't ask you to come.

599
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,260
If you dare to break into Lingxu Pavilion again,

600
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,980
don't blame me for being rude.

601
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,780
I can bet

602
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,540
that Young Master is not in the Pavilion.

603
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,260
Brother.

604
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,140
Brother.

605
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:30,740
Xu Man.

606
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,020
Did they bully you?

607
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,660
If you tell me,

608
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,540
I will help you.

609
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,220
Cang Qi.

610
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,740
The Meis and Lingxu Pavilion are a couple.

611
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,860
Miss Mei is a guest in the Pavilion.

612
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,220
It's common for Mr. Mei to visit.

613
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,340
Why do you have to do this?

614
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,340
I'm under the order of the Pavilion Master to guard Lingxu Pavilion.

615
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,980
I won't let outsiders break into the Pavilion.

616
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,860
Even if you're the Grand Priest,

617
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:51,740
you can't order me.

618
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:52,860
That's what the Pavilion Master means.

619
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,220
Brother.

620
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,340
I did all these on purpose.

621
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,100
I'm willing to go back with you

622
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,460
and accept all the punishment.

623
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:05,980
But I beg you

624
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,380
not to blame Lingxu Pavilion and Madam,

625
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,300
okay?

626
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,340
Silly girl.

627
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:13,580
Do you know that

628
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,980
your devoted fiance

629
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,540
has already had someone he loves?

630
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:33,900
Miss Rong.

631
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,620
Are you stupid?

632
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,260
How can you refuse

633
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,860
the offer from our Pavilion Master?

634
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,700
Didn't Miss Li say

635
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,420
that business is about harmony and wealth.

636
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,500
You can treat me to a meal.

637
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,900
The price of your Pavilion is too high.

638
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:48,900
I can't afford it.

639
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,780
I'll have to check it myself.

640
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,460
I'm afraid

641
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,780
someone is having fun now.

642
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,700
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

643
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,940
You will regret it in the future.

644
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,300
Thank you for your reminder, Miss Li.

645
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:05,860
All right.

646
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,100
I won't see you off.

647
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:08,980
Come back when you're done.

648
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,780
Just go to the mountain gate.

649
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,100
What's wrong?

650
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,220
Why are you suddenly unhappy?

651
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,180
Such a good opportunity.

652
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,460
I let it go.

653
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,780
What a pity.

654
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,060
I was very hesitant

655
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,260
when I was inside.

656
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,500
Why didn't you agree?

657
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,900
You need to have a bottom line.

658
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,540
The Chihua Bead is the bottom line of our Longyin City.

659
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,300
How can you give it to others?

660
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,700
What are you going to do next?

661
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,900
Don't underestimate me.

662
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,580
I have a clue.

663
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,340
I remember that Master Xue said

664
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,820
that he was attacked

665
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:56,820
when he was in the Suilin Valley.

666
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,260
Maybe

667
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,940
the entrance to the Pavilion is there.

668
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:02,940
Otherwise,

669
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,780
how dare they hurt others?

670
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:09,700
Go.

671
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,660
Why are you still standing?

672
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:12,980
I think

673
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,380
you're not stupid.

674
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:15,620
You're smart.

675
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:17,180
Just like me.

676
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,060
I'm smart.

677
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:32,900
I've checked it.

678
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,540
The mountain road to the Suilin Valley is less than half a day's journey.

679
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,460
Let's rest here today.

680
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,900
We'll check it tomorrow morning.

681
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,060
What if you don't get anything tomorrow?

682
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,460
What are you going to do?

683
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,300
I'm not an immortal.

684
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,900
How can I know everything?

685
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,540
I'll share it with others tomorrow.

686
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,620
It's useless to worry about so much now.

687
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,860
You're so casual.

688
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,500
You're not suitable to enter the martial arts world.

689
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,300
I know that.

690
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:58,940
I'm here.

691
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,300
What's the problem?

692
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:01,860
By the way,

693
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,340
what are you going to tell me

694
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,420
in the Snowy Alliance?

695
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,980
Serve the dishes.

696
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,620
Did you serve the wrong dishes?

697
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,900
I didn't order the dishes.

698
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:15,940
You didn't.

699
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,340
These are all delivered by the guests in the inner courtyard.

700
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,740
You don't need to spend money.

701
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,060
You can enjoy it.

702
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,500
Guests in the inner courtyard?

703
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,660
What's the name of the guest?

704
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:26,660
What does he look like?

705
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,460
Well...

706
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,140
I can't tell you.

707
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,580
If you can't tell me,

708
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,100
we'll go there ourselves.

709
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,260
Miss, you can't eat.

710
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,100
Since our trip

711
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,020
is so concerned about our food,

712
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,860
I'll see

713
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,420
who this friend is.

714
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,540
Miss. Miss.

715
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:48,420
Miss.

716
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:03,820
I guessed right.

717
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,020
He's really our old friend.

718
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,860
When I saw the table of dishes,

719
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,500
I guessed that the guest in the inner courtyard

720
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,700
must be you.

721
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:12,700
In this world,

722
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,860
except for my mother,

723
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,460
you're the only one who knows me the best.

724
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,500
What's wrong with you today?

725
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,380
You've been so absent-minded

726
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,420
every time you saw me.

727
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:33,820
Why are you so quiet today?

728
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:35,420
No.

729
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,620
What's wrong with you?

730
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,380
Actually, it's not me.

731
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,020
It's not you.

732
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:02,420
I'm sorry.

733
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:03,420
I'm sorry.

734
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,420
I'm sorry.

735
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:05,420
I'm sorry.

736
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,420
I'm sorry.

737
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:07,420
I'm sorry.

738
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,420
I'm sorry.

739
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,420
I'm sorry.

740
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:10,420
I'm sorry.

741
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,420
I'm sorry.

742
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,420
I'm sorry.

743
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,420
I'm sorry.

744
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,420
I'm sorry.

745
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:15,420
I'm sorry.

746
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,420
I'm sorry.

747
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,420
I'm sorry.

748
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,420
I'm sorry.

749
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,420
I'm sorry.

750
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:20,420
I'm sorry.

751
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:21,420
I'm sorry.
