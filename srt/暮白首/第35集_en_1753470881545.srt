1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We are in love

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
A moment of flowers, a moment of spring

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I always come and go, you are not here

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You don't understand

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
How much love

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The most beautiful flower, I have a pair of eyes

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Use yourissa lick my eyes

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,080
Really

9
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,240
Are not ramen

10
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,000
Sacrifice

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,240
As long as the rose下去

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Don't touch

13
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,600
Refreshing

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The Long Ballad

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Episode 16

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yuan, leave now.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
My father won't kill me.

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Your father has convinced them.

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
They want to kill me to avenge.

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
They won't be lenient.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Rumor has it that the Spirit-Blood Pavilion and the Demon Sect

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
are connected.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It seems that it's not a lie.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
No wonder that Nalan Yue is so brave.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
He dared to open a big murder in Longyin City.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Today, we all unite

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
to fight these two demons

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
to eliminate the evil for the people.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
There are rules in the martial arts world.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Today, we all unite

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
to fight these demons.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But we are not the only ones

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
who are avenged by the masters.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It has nothing to do with the Spirit-Blood Pavilion.

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Do you want to stop this?

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
A dog in a lost family doesn't need to be bullied.

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Today, I'm just a spectator.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Nalan Yue, today is your death day.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
A'Yu!

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
No!

41
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Go!

42
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The place of illusion

43
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
has finally come to an end.

44
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
A'Yu.

45
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's me.

46
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's me.

47
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's me.

48
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's me, Lu Yizhou.

49
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
A'Yu, wake up.

50
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
A'Yu.

51
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
A'Yu.

52
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
A'Yu.

53
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
He is Yizhou.

54
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
A'Yu.

55
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
A'Yu.

56
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm here.

57
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm here.

58
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm here.

59
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm here.

60
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Please forgive me.

61
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I have found it.

62
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Master!

63
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Don't panic!

64
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Master!

65
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Are you okay, master?

66
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,520
Senior Bai.

67
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,440
What's going on?

68
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,840
Who hurt

69
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,320
Senior Bai's inner strength?

70
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,840
Cheng'er.

71
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,320
Senior Bai.

72
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,720
You're injured so badly for Rong Yicheng.

73
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,880
I, Rong Jingfeng, will never forget it.

74
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,920
Don't worry.

75
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,680
I will catch Nalan Yue

76
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,440
and avenge Senior Bai.

77
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,440
Nalan Yue is so brave.

78
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,080
Don't worry.

79
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,120
Senior Bai.

80
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,040
Senior Bai.

81
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040
Senior Bai.

82
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
Senior Bai.

83
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,040
Senior Bai.

84
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,040
Senior Bai.

85
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,040
Senior Bai.

86
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,040
Senior Bai.

87
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,040
Senior Bai.

88
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,040
Retreat.

89
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,520
Retreat.

90
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,600
I wanted to

91
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,000
reveal the reason why the?

92
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,440
So everyone can see

93
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,720
Rong Jingfeng's true identity.

94
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,120
I didn't expect

95
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,360
things to turn out like this.

96
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,480
Rong Yicheng is no longer

97
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,480
my childhood friend.

98
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,440
I can't forgive

99
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,640
what my father has done.

100
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,160
Yue.

101
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,920
What happened to you?

102
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,400
What martial arts did you practice?

103
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,320
Hua.

104
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,640
I'm fine.

105
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,280
After you recover,

106
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,840
I'll tell you

107
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,200
everything.

108
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,480
Now,

109
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,160
we have our own child.

110
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,800
No matter what difficulties we face,

111
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,240
we can overcome them.

112
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,960
Hua, what's wrong?

113
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,280
I'm fine.

114
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,280
I'm fine.

115
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,280
I'm fine.

116
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,280
I'm fine.

117
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,280
I'm fine.

118
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,280
I'm fine.

119
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,280
I'm fine.

120
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,280
I'm fine.

121
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,280
I'm fine.

122
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,280
I'm fine.

123
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,280
I'm fine.

124
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,280
I'm fine.

125
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,280
I'm fine.

126
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,280
I'm fine.

127
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,280
I'm fine.

128
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,280
I'm fine.

129
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,280
I'm fine.

130
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,280
I'm fine.

131
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,280
I'm fine.

132
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,280
I'm fine.

133
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,280
I'm fine.

134
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,280
I'm fine.

135
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,280
I'm fine.

136
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,280
I'm fine.

137
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,280
I'm fine.

138
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,280
I'm fine.

139
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,280
I'm fine.

140
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,280
I'm fine.

141
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,280
I'm fine.

142
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,280
I'm fine.

143
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,760
I'm fine.

144
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,200
Who is it?

145
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,320
Why you?

146
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,360
Where are the rest of the disciples of the sect?

147
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,560
They know

148
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,760
that the Spirit Cult of Mingxu Pavilion attacked the anti-specialty weapons.

149
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,680
Why don't you stay here

150
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,760
with them?

151
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,040
I won't stay here.

152
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,040
I just want to say goodbye to you

153
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,640
in person.

154
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,440
That day,

155
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,280
I begged you to let me see my aunt for the last time.

156
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,480
But you didn't allow me.

157
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,760
I thought you would have already

158
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,080
forgotten about the past

159
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,080
when you helped Mohuan.

160
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,160
If I don't forget,

161
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,240
how can I face it?

162
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,840
In that case,

163
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,160
there's no need for us to say goodbye.

164
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:43,840
You may leave.

165
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:51,800
Your Highness,

166
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,080
take care.

167
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,000
Wait.

168
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,800
audience why

169
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,080
Why

170
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,160
Sorry

171
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,680
Can I

172
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,120
show you my scrape?

173
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,040
After all,

174
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,680
you look like Ye with this plaid

175
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,200
It's good for me.

176
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,200
It doesn't make sense to me anymore.

177
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,480
It's okay for you.

178
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,040
It recommendations.

179
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,080
But now it's over.

180
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,040
I can't afford to give up.

181
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,320
You don't have to

182
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,560
be upset about the past.

183
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,280
Rong Su.

184
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,920
I asked you before.

185
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,160
If everything could be changed,

186
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,680
would you let go of everything and leave with me?

187
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,680
Now,

188
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,720
I want you to tell me the answer yourself.

189
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,320
Now,

190
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,000
is this answer important?

191
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,720
Yes.

192
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,120
It's very important to me.

193
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,520
But it's not important to me anymore.

194
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,920
If I insisted on leaving with you,

195
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,680
maybe there wouldn't be any after-effects

196
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,800
and so many people would die.

197
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,760
But I didn't see it coming.

198
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,560
Now,

199
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,720
things can't be changed.

200
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,160
Haven't you ever

201
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,960
felt anything?

202
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,320
Can you pretend nothing happened?

203
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,880
There are hundreds of people in Lingxu Pavilion.

204
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,320
And the life of your master.

205
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,800
Can you pretend nothing happened?

206
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,920
Lu Yicheng.

207
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,440
You hate me.

208
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,720
Why do you have to say that?

209
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,800
Even if what you and I think is the same,

210
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,040
this relationship

211
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,200
will never end.

212
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,120
The night of the bitter night

213
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,520
Yicheng,

214
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,880
if God gives me another chance,

215
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,680
I'm willing to leave with you.

216
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,400
I don't care about my status,

217
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,280
my grudges or my hatred.

218
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,240
I'll go wherever you go

219
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,240
in the world.

220
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,040
This is the answer in my heart.

221
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,520
But all of this

222
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,280
will never happen.

223
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,520
It's removes

224
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:28,740
the

225
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,480
sadness.

226
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,240
The earheeves

227
00:14:38,040 --> 00:15:03,820
Don't

228
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,040
It's hard to escape

229
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,040
The wind is red

230
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,040
When will it stop

231
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:18,040
The moon is alone

232
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,040
When you see through all the love and hatred

233
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,040
Maybe for you

234
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,040
Sleeping is better than waking up

235
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,040
Waking up will make people more painful

236
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,040
What are you doing?

237
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,040
What did you do to Young Mistress' medicine?

238
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,040
What do you think Xue Man will do?

239
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,040
Are you crazy?

240
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,040
Don't be nervous

241
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,040
It's just honey

242
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,040
I'm afraid she can't take the medicine

243
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,040
It's not poison

244
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,040
I'm sorry

245
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,040
I didn't mean anything else

246
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,040
It's just that recently...

247
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,040
You're worried about the Mei family

248
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,040
You're worried about the Mei family

249
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,040
You're worried about the Mei family

250
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,040
You're worried about the Mei family

251
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,040
You're worried about the Mei family

252
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,040
It's just that recently...

253
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,040
You're afraid that I'll have a grudge against you

254
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,040
You're afraid that I'll have a grudge against you

255
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,040
You're afraid that I'll have a grudge against you

256
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,040
So you're being wary

257
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,040
Miss Mei

258
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,040
Miss Mei

259
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,040
I'm too nervous

260
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,040
I hope you don't take it to heart

261
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,040
Actually, I've always wanted to tell you something

262
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,040
What do you want to say?

263
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,040
Young Mistress

264
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,040
Young Mistress

265
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,040
Young Mistress

266
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,040
Young Mistress

267
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,040
Young Mistress

268
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,040
Young Mistress

269
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,040
If Young Mistress can't run around

270
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,040
If Young Mistress can't run around

271
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,040
I'll find her

272
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,040
If you can't stay safe

273
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,040
If you can't stay safe

274
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,040
Brother Nalan is the only one who is implicated

275
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,040
You'd better go back

276
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,040
What happened to him?

277
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,040
You talk

278
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,040
Where's Yue?

279
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,040
I'm going to see him

280
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,040
Hua

281
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,040
Where did you go?

282
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,040
I've been making medicine for you just now

283
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,040
I've been making medicine for you just now

284
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,040
But the medicine is gone

285
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,040
I took the medicine back

286
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,040
I'll take it back

287
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,040
I'll take it back

288
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,040
I'll take it back

289
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,040
I'll take it back

290
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,040
I'll take it back

291
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,040
I'll take it back

292
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,040
There's only Young Mistress in my heart

293
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,240
I'm sure you understand.

294
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,280
But it's not destined to happen.

295
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,520
I don't want you to keep doing this.

296
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,800
I often don't understand

297
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,520
what others can understand.

298
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,880
But

299
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,200
it's all my wishful thinking.

300
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,920
You should have let go of it earlier.

301
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,600
It's good for you and others.

302
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,200
Why are you telling me this?

303
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,800
You think I'll hurt your Young Master and Madam,

304
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,760
right?

305
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,000
I don't want to see you sad and hurt.

306
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,440
I feel the same way in your heart.

307
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,480
But you'll never feel it.

308
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:54,800
You...

309
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,640
What did you say?

310
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,000
I'm really a man of my word.

311
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,280
I've offended you.

312
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,480
Miss Ruomei,

313
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,560
I think what I said today is a burden to you.

314
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,280
Don't forget it.

315
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,000
But

316
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,840
as for the flowers of Nalan,

317
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,400
I know it's an unreachable goal.

318
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,680
But I still can't let go of it.

319
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,800
I've taken the medicine.

320
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,120
I'll listen to you and get well.

321
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,880
But tell me,

322
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,880
what happened on the way?

323
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,000
How is our child?

324
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,240
Hua,

325
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,520
your task now

326
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,400
is to get well.

327
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,120
We still have a chance.

328
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,480
We have a lifetime.

329
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,440
I'll be with you.

330
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,640
It seems that he has left.

331
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,480
At that time,

332
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,120
I took you out of Longyin City.

333
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,420
I thought I could get you out of the

334
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,240
Demon Realm of Rong Jinfeng.

335
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,280
But I didn't expect

336
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,440
you would suddenly die on the way.

337
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,360
No matter how I try to protect you,

338
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,640
it's not working.

339
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,400
In order to avoid the ears of Mo Hua and Longyin City,

340
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,840
I had to take you back to Mei's Mansion.

341
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,960
How could I tell you?

342
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,840
What's happened?

343
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,320
anymore.

344
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,520
Bo Rong.

345
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:55,860
Maybe

346
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:57,720
we're who we are

347
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,880
decided that

348
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,400
if I don't change,

349
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,960
I won't lose.

350
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,760
I've been concerned about myself.

351
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,200
I want to see your wound.

352
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,200
I'm fine.

353
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,840
I'm fine.

354
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,800
All you have

355
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,440
to do

356
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:22,920
is to take care of yourself.

357
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,200
Give yourself a good rest.

358
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:23,720
Give yourself a good rest.

359
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,080
Give yourself a good rest.

360
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,120
You are fine.

361
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,120
What is this?

362
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,120
Even though I'm still so weak,

363
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,120
I still have you.

364
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,120
As long as you're here,

365
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,120
I feel very relieved.

366
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:02,120
But it's still that eternity.

367
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,120
Greetings, Master.

368
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,120
You made a big mistake

369
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,120
in Longying City.

370
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,120
According to Liuli Sword,

371
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,120
now is the right time

372
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,120
to finish Rong Jingfeng.

373
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,120
If you manage to get it,

374
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,120
it's not impossible

375
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,120
to get rid of Longying City.

376
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,120
I'm willing to

377
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,120
help you with the fire.

378
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,120
I wonder

379
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,120
if there's anything

380
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,120
I can do for you.

381
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,120
Shut up!

382
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,120
It's your turn

383
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,120
to decide what to do.

384
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,120
Please calm down.

385
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,120
Liuli is young and immature.

386
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,120
Don't talk nonsense.

387
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,120
Don't get involved with her.

388
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,120
I don't know

389
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,120
what I did wrong.

390
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,120
Please give me some advice.

391
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,120
I thought you were in charge

392
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,120
of the Snow League for years.

393
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,120
But you're a smart girl.

394
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,120
I didn't expect you to be

395
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,120
fooled by Zhu You.

396
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,120
How dare you

397
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,120
lie to me?

398
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,120
Do you still

399
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,120
take me as your master?

400
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,120
Please calm down.

401
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,120
It's not like that.

402
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,120
The General Hall of the Lin Clan is located in the north.

403
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,120
It's a long way to go.

404
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,120
Rong Hua

405
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,120
was a spy

406
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,120
to spread the news.

407
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,120
She suddenly had a problem

408
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,120
and was sent to the prison for a day.

409
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,120
I was also heartless.

410
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,120
I didn't have time to report to you.

411
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,120
To take care of the situation,

412
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,120
I had to calm her down.

413
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,120
But the Snow League

414
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,120
just pretended to be in cahoots with her.

415
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,120
It's up to you

416
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,120
to decide the details.

417
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,120
Yes, Master.

418
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,120
The request of the chief

419
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,120
to print Rong Hua

420
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,120
is just a matter of right and wrong.

421
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,120
The Snow League will never betray you.

422
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,120
Please investigate it.

423
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,120
Don't be nervous.

424
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,120
I won't do anything to you.

425
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,120
You don't care about my love for you.

426
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,120
You are his wife.

427
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,120
How can you betray me?

428
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,120
Now the Xuanbing Talisman

429
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,120
that Nalan Yue is practicing

430
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,120
is about to be completed.

431
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,120
He was captured by Rong Hua.

432
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,120
When the couple was attacked,

433
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,120
the hatred in their hearts

434
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,120
had completely burst.

435
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,120
The Chihua Pearl

436
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,120
was about to be broken into pieces.

437
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,120
The most difficult part has been over.

438
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,120
You two have great achievements.

439
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,120
I always reward and punish you.

440
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,120
How can you wrong me

441
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,120
and give me credit?

442
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,120
You are wise.

443
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,120
We are just helping each other.

444
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,120
Everything is your fault.

445
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,120
But

446
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,120
since Nalan Yue left Longyin City,

447
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,120
he has been quiet.

448
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,120
I have ordered him

449
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,120
to find out his whereabouts as soon as possible.

450
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,120
It doesn't matter.

451
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,120
Xuanbing Talisman is about to be completed.

452
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,120
Nalan Yue will return to the Ling Sect sooner or later.

453
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,120
After this battle,

454
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,120
he should know better than anyone else

455
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,120
that he has to be strong.

456
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,120
Only then can he achieve his dream.

457
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,120
He won't let me down.

458
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,120
I'm sorry.

459
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,120
Chief, everything is ready.

460
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,120
Let's go.

461
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,120
Yes.

462
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,120
Liuli.

463
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,120
Why are you here?

464
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,120
Chief,

465
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,120
Longyin City is under attack by the Ling Sect.

466
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,120
The City's head is not able to leave.

467
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,120
This time, the City Chief didn't treat me well.

468
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,120
He sent me here to send a letter.

469
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,120
Please be patient.

470
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,120
The City Chief said

471
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,120
he would like to see the Longyin City

472
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,120
in contact with the Xiao Xue Sect.

473
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,120
He will personally treat you next time.

474
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,120
I have heard about Longyin City.

475
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,120
Please tell the City Chief

476
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,120
that the relationship between the Xiao Xue Sect and Longyin City

477
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,120
is not a big deal.

478
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,120
Please rest assured.

479
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,120
But I don't know

480
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,120
how the City Chief is doing now.

481
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,120
Thank you for your concern.

482
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,120
The City Chief is fine now.

483
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,120
But he didn't expect

484
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,120
that Nalan Yue would be so sick

485
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,120
in such a short time.

486
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,120
He has placed many explosives in the city.

487
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,120
This time, it's a big deal.

488
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,120
Senior Bai was seriously injured.

489
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,120
Fortunately, the City Chief has ordered

490
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,120
to treat Senior Bai as well as possible.

491
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,120
Senior Bai.

492
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,120
I didn't expect it to be like this.

493
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,120
Since there are many things in the city,

494
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,120
we won't bother you.

495
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,120
Please go back, Young Hero Xuan Ye.

496
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,120
We have a long way to go.

497
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,120
Please send Xuan Ye away.

498
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,120
Let's go.

499
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,120
Let's go.

500
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,120
Let's go.

501
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,120
Let's go.

502
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,120
Let's go.

503
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,120
Divine Doctor Lu.

504
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,120
You come to treat me every day.

505
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,120
What's wrong with you?

506
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,120
It's not the time.

507
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,120
You still want to joke with me?

508
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,120
Do you know your condition now?

509
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,120
You have been trained

510
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,120
to the last level of Xuan Bing Talisman.

511
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,120
Your body is in great danger now.

512
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,120
Do you know it's too serious?

513
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,120
Of course I know

514
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,120
what the situation is.

515
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,120
But no matter what I do,

516
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,120
I can't change it.

517
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,120
Don't you think so?

518
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,120
Anyway, I can't beat you.

519
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,120
You know better

520
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,120
about your current condition than I do.

521
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,120
When you were forced to the dead end

522
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,120
in Longyin City that day,

523
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,120
your power increased.

524
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,120
It's really a sign of being possessed by the devil.

525
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,120
At that time,

526
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,120
you were in a terrible state.

527
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,120
It was extremely abnormal.

528
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,120
Do you know if you keep going like this,

529
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,120
I'm afraid I can't help it.

530
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,120
I know what you're worried about.

531
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,120
I can't control

532
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,120
the reaction of Xuan Bing Talisman anymore.

533
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,120
If it goes on like this,

534
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,120
everyone around me will be in danger,

535
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,120
including Rong Hua.

536
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,120
It's such an important thing.

537
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,120
Why are you saying it now?

538
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,120
Yue.

539
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,120
Hua, I don't know about this.

540
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,120
Don't say it out.

541
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,120
I'm sorry.

542
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,120
You haven't recovered yet.

543
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,120
Why are you here?

544
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,120
Go back and have a good rest.

545
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,120
I'm fine.

546
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,120
You asked me to stay in the room

547
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,120
and do nothing.

548
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,120
I feel worse.

549
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,120
Come on, sit down.

550
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,120
Come on.

551
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,120
This is my new dish,

552
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,120
braised pear with bird's nest.

553
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,120
Try it.

554
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,120
Take it.

555
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,120
This braised pear with bird's nest is very important.

556
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,120
If you want to peel the pear,

557
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,120
put it in the flesh

558
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,120
and braise it with bird's nest,

559
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,120
I put a lot of effort into it.

560
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,120
You have to try it.

561
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,120
Try it.

562
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,120
How is it?

563
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,120
It's delicious.

564
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,120
Yue,

565
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,120
try my new dish.

566
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,120
Hua, can you stop doing this?

567
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,120
If you're unhappy,

568
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,120
just say it out.

569
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,120
You can cry.

570
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,120
Don't do this to yourself.

571
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,120
I'm fine.

572
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,120
You're thinking too much.

573
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,120
You

574
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,120
have arranged your time

575
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,120
in a good way.

576
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,120
You can fool others,

577
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,120
but you can't fool me.

578
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,120
You have something to do during the day.

579
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,120
What about at night?

580
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,120
You cry alone

581
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,120
in the yard every night.

582
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,120
You said you didn't want me to worry.

583
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,120
But you pretend to be fine every day

584
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,120
and force yourself.

585
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,120
How can I not worry?

586
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,120
It seems you know it.

587
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,120
I can't accept this reality.

588
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,120
I feel so guilty.

589
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,120
How can a person

590
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,120
solve so many problems

591
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,120
by himself?

592
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,120
It's a matter of life and death.

593
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,120
What I've experienced

594
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,120
is nothing

595
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,120
compared to you.

596
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,120
What I can do now

597
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,120
is to face it with my own eyes.

598
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,120
I can't do it alone.

599
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,120
Do you really think so?

600
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,120
Don't worry.

601
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,120
I'm really fine.

602
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,120
Sometimes I feel empty

603
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,120
when I'm alone.

604
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,120
When time passes,

605
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,120
I'll forget it slowly.

606
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,120
Hua,

607
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,120
in the future,

608
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,120
no matter what happens,

609
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,120
we'll experience it together

610
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,120
and face it together.

611
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,120
I'll be with you forever.

612
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,120
Let's eat.

613
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,120
The dishes are cold.

614
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,120
If I'm not wrong,

615
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,120
it must be the change

616
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,120
of the flower-eating pig in his body.

617
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,120
The most important thing now

618
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,120
is to find a solution as soon as possible.

619
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,120
I wonder

620
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,120
how this girl is doing.

621
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,120
She finally got married

622
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,120
and is pregnant.

623
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,120
She even has to

624
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,120
guard against her father

625
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,120
and go through all these hardships.

626
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,120
This girl is really suffering.

627
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,120
How is Senior Bai's injury?

628
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,120
Is there any hope of recovery?

629
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,120
Are you really concerned

630
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,120
or are you here to find out

631
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,120
if my master is still alive?

632
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,120
I came here for Longyin City.

633
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,120
If something happens here,

634
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,120
I'm afraid you can't

635
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,120
talk to everyone in the world.

636
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,120
I'm afraid you can't

637
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,120
talk to everyone in the world.

638
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,120
I'm afraid you can't

639
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,120
talk to everyone in the world.

640
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,120
I'm afraid you can't

641
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,120
talk to everyone in the world.

642
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,120
Do you know

643
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,120
what you're talking about?

644
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,120
Master was born in the year of the ox.

645
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,120
Now he is seriously injured and unconscious.

646
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,120
He needs to be carefully treated from now on.

647
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,120
I left Master for many years

648
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,120
and never saw him.

649
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,120
I will take care of him myself.

650
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,120
Without my permission,

651
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,120
no one is allowed to disturb.

652
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,120
Senior Bai is highly respected

653
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,120
and has a high position in the world.

654
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,120
It is the duty of Longyin City

655
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,120
to help him.

656
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,120
It's not your business.

657
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,120
This time the secret path was destroyed

658
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,120
because of the evil.

659
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,120
If Senior Bai's martial arts are not strong,

660
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,120
the consequences will be unimaginable.

661
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,120
I didn't hear anything

662
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,120
from you about the girl in this matter.

663
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,120
She is pregnant now.

664
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,120
After this battle,

665
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,120
I don't know what will happen.

666
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,120
No matter what,

667
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,120
she is your biological daughter.

668
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,120
Are you so cruel

669
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,120
to her?

670
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,120
Shut up.

671
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,120
If it wasn't for this matter,

672
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,120
you all hid it from me.

673
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,120
How could she stay here?

674
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,120
I...

675
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,120
I tell you,

676
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,120
Hua'er wouldn't end up like this.

677
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,120
As her master,

678
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,120
you only know to pamper her

679
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,120
and let her do whatever she wants.

680
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,120
Otherwise,

681
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,120
Hua'er wouldn't end up like this.

682
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,120
It's all because of you.

683
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,120
Why did you and the Nalan family

684
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,120
involve Hua'er in this?

685
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,120
Listen to me.

686
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,120
No matter what you want to do,

687
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,120
I did everything

688
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,120
for the whole Longyin City.

689
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,120
I didn't let Hua'er be with her.

690
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,120
It's for Hua'er's good.

691
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,120
You stay here and take care of her.

692
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,120
Take care of your master.

693
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,120
I don't need you to take care of the rest.

694
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,120
I know what I should do.

695
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,120
Senior Bai,

696
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,120
why are you here?

697
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,120
I'm here.

698
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,120
Senior Bai,

699
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,120
why are you here?

700
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,120
I'm here for Hua'er.

701
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,120
I'm here for Hua'er.

702
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,120
I'm here for Hua'er.

703
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,120
You are here for Hua'er?

704
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,120
You...

705
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,120
You are here for Hua'er?

706
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,360
If I know it hell or heaven,

707
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,680
I will never forgive myself.

708
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,760
I am the horse which always heads towards afternoons.

709
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:50,840
Xiaoxiang,

710
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:51,760
I beg you.

711
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,240
Please punish those元一 260 few whiskeyck overflow guards.

712
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:54,760
Sorry.

713
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,160
Mr. Bai.

714
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,240
For Longyin City,

715
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,680
this is what I needed to do.

716
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,560
to visit Mr. Bai.

717
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,120
I wanted to report to you

718
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,600
about the city affairs after you came out.

719
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,880
But you didn't come out for a long time.

720
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,360
I was worried

721
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,840
something happened to you.

722
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,640
So I...

723
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,920
What can happen to Mr. Bai and me?

724
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,520
Come on.

725
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,920
Don't bother him. Have a rest.

726
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,200
Have you found out

727
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,360
what I told you to investigate?

728
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,360
I've found out

729
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,640
that the gunpowder that destroyed the underground tunnel

730
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,280
in the back hill

731
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:46,960
belongs to Longyin City.

732
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,840
But there is no record of gunpowder

733
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,360
in the warehouse in the city for a year.

734
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,720
I think

735
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,800
it's hard to investigate it.

736
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,840
In Longyin City,

737
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,720
except for the City Leader,

738
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,320
who can enter the warehouse easily

739
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,440
and steal a large amount of gunpowder

740
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,840
without anyone knowing?

741
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,440
You're suspecting...

742
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,240
I'm not.

743
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,200
I'm not suspecting.

744
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,120
I'm sure.

745
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,480
I'm afraid the previous masters' deaths

746
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,520
have nothing to do with the City Leader.

747
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,760
What will you do

748
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,600
after that?

749
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,760
I don't know.

750
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,080
But I'll listen to you all night.

751
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,560
I won't go back on my word.

752
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,520
You go and remind the City Leader

753
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,000
to keep the lives of the senior Bai Su safe.

754
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,840
In the underground tunnel,

755
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,680
the senior must have known something.

756
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,640
But you can't

757
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,840
easily find out what's going on.

758
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,920
The relationship between the City Leader and the City Leader

759
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,240
is already very close.

760
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,400
If you're not careful,

761
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,240
Longyin City will be in trouble.

762
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,080
Yes.

763
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,240
Wait.

764
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,280
The Liuli that you and Xue Meng have been together

765
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,480
are related to what?

766
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,880
If you need it,

767
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,960
I can go to Xue Meng and propose marriage for you personally.

768
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,080
City Leader.

769
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,240
The relationship between Xuanye and Liuli

770
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,280
is not that simple.

771
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,440
Say it.

772
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,760
The relationship between Xuanye and Liuli

773
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,880
is not as...

774
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,200
The relationship between Xuanye and Liuli

775
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,720
is not as you imagined.

776
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,240
Forget it.

777
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,320
Whether I'm wrong or not,

778
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,560
the line between Xue Meng and me is useful.

779
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,280
You need to keep it for me.

780
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,000
After the handover is done,

781
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,800
you can give it to the Liuli.

782
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,480
I'll send a letter to Liuli.

783
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,000
Please help me investigate

784
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,560
Rong Hua and Nan Lanyue.

785
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,280
Yes.

786
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,520
Report!

787
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,080
Report, City Leader.

788
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:46,960
City Leader ordered

789
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,200
you to go to the hall right away

790
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,160
to discuss something important.

791
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,280
Did City Leader say anything?

792
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,080
I don't know.

793
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,120
City Leader only ordered

794
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,720
you to go and meet him.

795
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,320
City Leader.

796
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,280
I'm willing to go with you.

797
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,000
City Leader ordered me

798
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,320
to ask you alone.

799
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:15,920
