1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We are bound by fate

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
A moment of flowers, a moment of love

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I never know you are not here

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
How much love is there in my heart

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The most beautiful flower in my eyes

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You will find you own Rong Jin

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's a acted love

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's a made up love

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
juicy juicy

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I hope love can be 한� Jason

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,400
Abi, don't cry.

12
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,960
I won't let you cry.

13
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,600
I also promise

14
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,640
to make you cry with me.

15
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,800
But whenever I cry,

16
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,440
please don't cry.

17
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,600
I won't let you cry.

18
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,960
You're so cute.

19
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,760
Are you all right today,

20
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,520
That is.

21
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,320
Be careful.

22
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,560
I only have you in my heart.

23
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,360
Maybe you've already seen it.

24
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,160
It's just that you don't want to face it.

25
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,560
But today,

26
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,160
since I said shut up,

27
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,360
I've already put you outside the new door.

28
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,960
But if, if,

29
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,560
one day, one day,

30
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,560
Rong Jingfeng is not good to you anymore,

31
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,360
you, you, you just tell me.

32
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,360
I will immediately put you back in my heart.

33
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,360
It's me who doesn't understand and accept your heart.

34
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,160
You, you, you, look at you.

35
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,960
How come you're so well, you're so well-behaved.

36
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,360
You, you, you, this is a good thing.

37
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,760
From now on, I won't go to the hospital to bother you anymore,

38
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,760
isn't it?

39
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,360
Fire shooting star, fire shooting star.

40
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,360
After the wind blows, when will it stop?

41
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,760
The moon is alone in the moon.

42
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,760
When you see through all the love and hate, it's clear.

43
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,760
I just asked Lin Jing, and he knew you were here.

44
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,760
Today is the day that Lin Jing took Rong Hua back to the city.

45
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,360
As a person in the Lingxu Pavilion,

46
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,360
why don't you go back with your young master?

47
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,160
We were supposed to go back together,

48
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,760
but we haven't been able to find you.

49
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,760
So I asked them to leave first.

50
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,360
Why are you looking for me?

51
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,360
I'm looking for you to find Rong Hua.

52
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,360
I'm looking for you to find Rong Hua.

53
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,360
I'm looking for you to find Rong Hua.

54
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,360
I'm looking for you to find Rong Hua.

55
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,560
Why are you looking for me?

56
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,760
Are your wounds better?

57
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,960
I don't need your fake inferiority complex.

58
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,760
Rong Su,

59
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,160
can we only be like this?

60
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,760
How dare you! What are you doing?

61
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,160
I just want you to forgive me.

62
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,760
Since you don't believe me,

63
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,360
I can only do this.

64
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,560
If one day, you're willing to leave Longyin City,

65
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,160
I'll go to the ends of the world with you.

66
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,760
Don't be so stubborn, Your Highness.

67
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,560
Longyin City will be destroyed.

68
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,960
Rong Su will leave.

69
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,560
I don't want Rong Hua to

70
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,960
give up everything for the sake of the Su family.

71
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,960
Rong Su,

72
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,960
whether it's Jiangnan,

73
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,360
Beihua,

74
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,960
or Diannan,

75
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,760
if we're together one day,

76
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,760
as long as you like it,

77
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,760
I'll stay there with you for a long time.

78
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,960
Don't reject me again.

79
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,960
I'll wait for you in Lingxu Pavilion.

80
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:23,360
I'll wait for you in Lingxu Pavilion.

81
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:30,360
I hope love will never come.

82
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,360
I hope love will never come.

83
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,360
How can the world

84
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,760
be so stubborn?

85
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,760
How can the world be so stubborn?

86
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,960
The night is like a storm.

87
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,760
I'm so happy.

88
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,560
I don't have any love in this life.

89
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,760
When I went to Lingxu Pavilion last time,

90
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,760
I didn't see

91
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,360
the same bright stars

92
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,760
as Longyin City.

93
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,760
The shadow of the night is falling.

94
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,360
I want you to hold my white hand

95
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,960
and give me your life.

96
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,560
I'll wait for you in Lingxu Pavilion.

97
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:39,560
I hope love will never come.

98
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,360
I hope love will never come.

99
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:53,160
I promise to love you.

100
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:07,960
Master,

101
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,160
how about I take someone

102
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,960
to the northern desert this time?

103
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,560
The disciples of Lingqiao are missing for no reason.

104
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,160
Someone must be behind them.

105
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,360
As a person of Lingqiao,

106
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,560
I have nothing to do with it.

107
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,360
Don't bother me.

108
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,560
I left Master for many years.

109
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,760
I've never done anything for Lingqiao.

110
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,560
This is a good opportunity to pay tribute to him.

111
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,160
Lingqiao's disciples suddenly disappeared.

112
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,760
It's not easy.

113
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,960
But if you can trust Ruohan,

114
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,360
I'm willing to take the trouble

115
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,160
to go to the northern desert to investigate.

116
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,560
Look at how good she speaks.

117
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,760
Bu Zhu,

118
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,160
you and I have been together for the longest time.

119
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,760
But why can't you learn it?

120
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,160
Silly.

121
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,560
Master is right.

122
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,760
Lingqiao.

123
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,360
You're right.

124
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,360
It's tough on me.

125
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,960
I'll go to the northern desert to investigate it thoroughly.

126
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,960
Don't worry.

127
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,560
I won't let you down.

128
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,360
I'll go to the northern desert to investigate it thoroughly.

129
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:12,960
Don't worry.

130
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,360
I'll go to the northern desert to investigate it thoroughly.

131
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:14,960
Don't worry.

132
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,560
I'll go to the northern desert to investigate it thoroughly.

133
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,160
Don't worry.

134
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,760
I'll go to the northern desert to investigate it thoroughly.

135
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,360
Don't worry.

136
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,960
I'll go to the northern desert to investigate it thoroughly.

137
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,760
Don't worry.

138
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,360
I'll go to the northern desert to investigate it thoroughly.

139
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,160
Don't worry.

140
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,560
I'll go to the northern desert to investigate it thoroughly.

141
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,360
Don't worry.

142
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,960
I'll go to the northern desert to investigate it thoroughly.

143
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,960
Don't worry.

144
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,360
I'll go to the northern desert to investigate it thoroughly.

145
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,160
Don't worry.

146
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,760
I'll go to the northern desert to investigate it thoroughly.

147
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,760
Don't worry.

148
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,360
I'll go to the northern desert to investigate it thoroughly.

149
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,360
Don't worry.

150
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,160
But you scale on it and never stop.

151
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:42,860
So,

152
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,160
dont' you start yelling at me.

153
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,160
I don't want to think about anyone教不 Rei Chao Rain�나

154
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,360
You're really an้r playing dumb prayer.

155
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,560
Rogue bye bye

156
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,160
Who are you reading this for?

157
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,560
My heart is burning

158
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,360
What?

159
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,360
Stop it.

160
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,600
Why are you the one who is important to Lingxun Pavilion?

161
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,480
Who is it?

162
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,400
Master, it's me.

163
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,280
Come in.

164
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:27,680
Master.

165
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,840
Since we left Longyuan City,

166
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,600
no one has been able to take over the Shengzi Hall.

167
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,520
If we continue to stay here,

168
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,240
the Shengzi Hall will surely be taken over by City Leader.

169
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,560
Has City Leader made any movements recently?

170
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,120
It's strange to say.

171
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,360
City Leader has been acting strange lately.

172
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,520
Since Lady Yuzhan left,

173
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,120
she hasn't asked City Leader anything.

174
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,640
But that's good.

175
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,040
From now on,

176
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,480
City Leader will pay more attention to the Shengzi Hall

177
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,960
so that she can regain her power.

178
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,600
Don't be too anxious.

179
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,720
The Shengzi Hall is in a hurry.

180
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,080
It was a bit of a mess before.

181
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,000
If we're too anxious,

182
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,600
we'll definitely get into trouble.

183
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,840
Since we're safe now,

184
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,160
why should we worry?

185
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,720
If we need the Shengzi Hall in the future,

186
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,400
we can help.

187
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,880
City Leader doesn't plan to take over the Shengzi Hall?

188
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,360
The days will come.

189
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,840
In the future, the four halls of Longyin City will be a family.

190
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,880
We won't be separated.

191
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,520
Lin Jing and Rong Hua have left.

192
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,440
Longyin City will be our home.

193
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,400
Where is the Star of Everything?

194
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,120
I'm not sure.

195
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,160
I don't know.

196
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,200
I understand.

197
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,160
It doesn't matter who the leader of the Shengzi Hall is.

198
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,600
Lady Yuzhan will be the only heir in Longyin City.

199
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,720
By the way,

200
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,480
you just said that City Leader is not in a stable state.

201
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,520
Do you have any new findings?

202
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,040
There is something strange.

203
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,360
I wonder if it has something to do with City Leader.

204
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,520
Go on.

205
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,960
I found that the disciples who guarded Flower Sea

206
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,520
didn't allow anyone to enter the city.

207
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,760
There is no explanation for this matter.

208
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,400
I and the disciples

209
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,600
dare not ask.

210
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,360
How could this happen?

211
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,440
Chihua wisdom orb was kilned.

212
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,120
How could City Leader not mention this kind of thing?

213
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,880
My Lord.

214
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,760
Let's get back to the city.

215
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,360
We need the ingredients.

216
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,720
We just left for a short time.

217
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,200
I'll let you know if it will need some So-Water Tea.

218
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,280
I don't know just now.

219
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,520
My Lord?!

220
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,800
You didn't mention it on the day of the incident.

221
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,320
It was all

222
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,640
Mo Huan's doing.

223
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:12,960
Master.

224
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,120
Master.

225
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,000
You mean...

226
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,120
Su Er.

227
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,840
Don't panic.

228
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,240
I'm not here to teach you a lesson.

229
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,920
I wanted to hide

230
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,000
the fact that Huahai was destroyed.

231
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,000
The more people know,

232
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,280
the more unfavorable it is to Longyin City.

233
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,920
But I know that

234
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,400
even if I hide it from everyone,

235
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,200
I can't hide it from you.

236
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,400
You'll find out sooner or later.

237
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,400
What...

238
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,760
What's going on?

239
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,160
It's meaningless

240
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,280
to investigate it now.

241
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,720
It's all in vain.

242
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,680
There's no excuse to find it.

243
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,400
This Huahai

244
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,960
was once my life's hard work.

245
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,600
But now,

246
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,880
it's my shame.

247
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,680
The battle is over.

248
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,920
I'm sorry.

249
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,520
Did you

250
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,120
send a signal to lead the City Master to go to Lingjiao

251
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,200
that night?

252
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,120
He was in front of you

253
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,880
and destroyed the Chihua Bead.

254
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,320
He's trying to shake Longyin City.

255
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,840
Mohan came prepared.

256
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,560
I knew he would come back

257
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,160
to avenge me.

258
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,480
But I didn't expect

259
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,000
he would use this trick.

260
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,240
What's your plan?

261
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,000
Huahai was destroyed,

262
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,800
but Longyin City is still here.

263
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,920
It's not over yet.

264
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,040
Although the Chihua Bead is priceless

265
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,160
to Longyin City,

266
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,320
we can plant and cure the Chihua Bead.

267
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,880
If the people are alive

268
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,360
and they lose their faith,

269
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,600
nothing will be left.

270
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,080
Don't worry, City Master.

271
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,320
It's no small matter.

272
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,840
I'll keep my word

273
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,800
before the Chihua Bead is re-established.

274
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,200
I won't let anything go wrong.

275
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,560
Not only that,

276
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,880
the Chihua Bead is a problem.

277
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,960
Huahai is destroyed.

278
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,920
Even if we plant it right away,

279
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,560
we can't make the cure

280
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,640
before the Chihua Bead is poisoned.

281
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,120
If Longyin City

282
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,240
can't make the cure,

283
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,200
the people will

284
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,560
fight for it.

285
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,760
Even if Mohan doesn't come,

286
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,840
Longyin City will be destroyed.

287
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,480
Maybe there's another way

288
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,120
to ease the Chihua Bead.

289
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,760
What's the way, Su'er?

290
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,840
Do you remember

291
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,160
the Chihua Bead

292
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,360
that Mei Ying took away

293
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,440
ended up in the hands of the Chief of Lingxu Pavilion?

294
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,440
He used the Chihua Bead, too.

295
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,240
But no one from Lingxu Pavilion

296
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,480
went to ask for the antidote.

297
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,040
What method did he use

298
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,760
to resist the Chihua Bead?

299
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,560
Good.

300
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,840
In that case,

301
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,040
I'll send you

302
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
to investigate it.

303
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,440
But remember,

304
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,560
don't let anyone find your trace.

305
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,120
Yes.

306
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,000
Young Master Mei, wait.

307
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,040
Since you're leaving,

308
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,840
why didn't you say goodbye?

309
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,440
I've already been grateful

310
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,040
for the escort

311
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,440
from Longyin City.

312
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,400
How dare you

313
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,840
ask Miss Rong to escort you in person?

314
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,080
Now I'm on the same boat

315
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,240
with you.

316
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,440
As long as I'm still the Chief of Kongzi Hall,

317
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,440
Longyin City

318
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,840
should be called by the Mei family.

319
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,040
The Mei family will be reborn in the martial arts world

320
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,040
in a few days.

321
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,840
I'm sure

322
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,840
the Mei family will be reborn in the martial arts world

323
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,840
in a few days.

324
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,840
I'm sure

325
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,640
the martial arts world will be reborn in a few days.

326
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,440
I'll thank you

327
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,040
for your help.

328
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,440
If I have a chance,

329
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,040
I'll do my best to help you.

330
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,040
I'll go to Jiangnan

331
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,040
in a few days.

332
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,640
Please

333
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,640
take care of me.

334
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,840
Although the Mei family has lost its power,

335
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,040
I'm not sure

336
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,040
about Jiangnan.

337
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,040
I'm just a little confused.

338
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,440
If you need anything,

339
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,440
just tell me.

340
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,440
I'll see you in Jiangnan.

341
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,040
By the way,

342
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,840
Young Master Mei and Lin Jing

343
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,840
were very close.

344
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,040
It doesn't look like an accident.

345
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,240
Besides, the Chihuazhu that Young Master Mei took

346
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,640
was taken by the Chief of Lingxu Pavilion.

347
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,240
Does Young Master Mei

348
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,040
really know nothing about Lingxu Pavilion?

349
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,240
The Mei family is now

350
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,640
trying to survive in the gap.

351
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,040
If we don't talk about it,

352
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,440
we'll be in trouble.

353
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,240
It's the family's responsibility

354
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,640
to take over Mei Ying.

355
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,640
We must protect ourselves

356
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,640
and protect the Zhu Tower.

357
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,640
If so,

358
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,040
I don't have to ask.

359
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,440
Young Master Mei,

360
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:14,840
take care.

361
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,640
Come.

362
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,240
Let's go.

363
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,920
You were trying to trick us in the letter.

364
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,960
Mo Huan was suspicious of this place

365
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,640
and made a mistake.

366
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,800
After so many years,

367
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,080
we finally found the old court of the Ling Sect.

368
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,880
But we didn't expect

369
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,680
there were only a few disciples

370
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,080
in this huge place.

371
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,960
Where are the others?

372
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,000
Then,

373
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,080
how should we deal with them?

374
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,800
It's enough to have them.

375
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,040
Use every means

376
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,040
to get the truth out of them.

377
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,040
Yes.

378
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,840
They are loyal to Mo Huan.

379
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,120
Miss Long, you are not allowed to go home.

380
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,800
Miss Long.

381
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,080
You wet yourself.

382
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,040
Didn't you think you were in the wrong?

383
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,360
It's not like this.

384
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,360
I win you over.

385
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,160
Do you like it?

386
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,280
What are you doing?

387
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,680
Caicai,

388
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,920
this is our maid, Xiao Cai.

389
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,240
She's been

390
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,640
I need to find someone who is considerate

391
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,760
to take care of Miss Rong.

392
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,800
I hope Miss Rong can live happily

393
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,600
in Lingxu Pavilion.

394
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,160
Thank you, Brother Lu.

395
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,160
I've met you, Young Master.

396
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,160
I've met Miss Rong.

397
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,920
From now on, Miss Rong's wedding

398
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,280
will be taken care of by me.

399
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,480
Thank you.

400
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,480
I wonder if...

401
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,800
Are you satisfied, Young Master?

402
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,480
Young Master, don't worry.

403
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,880
I've done everything you asked.

404
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,840
After receiving your letter,

405
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,920
I've prepared a new wish for Miss Rong.

406
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,920
If Miss Rong needs anything,

407
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,440
just tell me.

408
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,280
Xiaocai,

409
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,520
take Miss Rong to her room.

410
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,520
Yes.

411
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,840
This way, Miss Rong.

412
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,440
Nangua Jun.

413
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,960
Miss Rong is blessed

414
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,840
to have Young Master's love.

415
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,320
The courtyard is designed by Young Master

416
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,680
in every corner.

417
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,320
The words on the plaque

418
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,440
are also his idea.

419
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,680
Young Master sent back

420
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,200
more than 30 letters of letter.

421
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,360
He took care of everything without any details.

422
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,080
It shows that Young Master

423
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,800
is very considerate to Miss Rong.

424
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,320
Thank you, Miss Xiaocai.

425
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,440
Miss Rong is too serious.

426
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,760
Just call me Xiaocai.

427
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,720
I'm fine with that.

428
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,520
I should do these things.

429
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,080
Miss Rong, go in and have a look.

430
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,360
See if you're satisfied.

431
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,360
Okay.

432
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,520
If you need anything more,

433
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,400
just tell me.

434
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,360
I'll do it right away.

435
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,280
Young Master told me

436
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,120
to make Miss Rong feel comfortable.

437
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,880
Just like in her own home.

438
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,400
I'll go and have a look.

439
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,600
Why is it like this?

440
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,600
Come here.

441
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,280
I'll let you go

442
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,280
about what happened just now.

443
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,360
Lingxu and Lingjiao are in a joint.

444
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,560
My mother is working for Mohuan.

445
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,760
Why didn't you tell me?

446
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,000
Don't worry.

447
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,840
Come on, sit.

448
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,240
Who has the mood to sit?

449
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,080
I'm not.

450
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:30,800
I'm not.

451
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,480
I'm not.

452
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,240
I'm not.

453
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:32,920
I'm not.

454
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,480
It's because of the emergency.

455
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,000
I didn't have time to report to you.

456
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,040
Besides,

457
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,800
Madam chose to go out

458
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,680
because you didn't want to

459
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,960
have too much contact with Mohuan.

460
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,560
Since childhood,

461
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,560
you know

462
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,760
Madam's personality.

463
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,760
No one can stop her.

464
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,360
After all, she's your mother.

465
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,600
The most worried and worried person

466
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,480
in her heart is you, Young Master.

467
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,040
She wants to avenge

468
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,120
and think about your safety.

469
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,240
Now,

470
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,880
it's the best ending.

471
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,560
Isn't it?

472
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,520
Besides,

473
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
it's Mohuan's idea.

474
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,040
I think

475
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,920
she came up with it in a moment.

476
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,120
So she doesn't have time to explain it to us.

477
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,040
So,

478
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,120
you should thank her

479
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,400
for your kindness.

480
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,240
Thank you.

481
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,560
Madam didn't want you and Miss Rong

482
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,640
to be involved

483
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,960
because she knew

484
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,000
Mohuan wanted to do these things.

485
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,200
So she asked me to propose to her

486
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,160
in the name of Lingxu Pavilion.

487
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,920
Otherwise,

488
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,320
you wouldn't have been able to hold the beauty.

489
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,840
Madam

490
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,240
is a tough woman.

491
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,080
She's a cold-blooded woman.

492
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,440
She's strict,

493
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,280
but she's already agreed

494
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,080
your relationship with Miss Rong.

495
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,080
Otherwise,

496
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,040
she wouldn't have let go

497
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,480
of the past with Long Yicheng.

498
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,400
Why are you so nagging?

499
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,520
You can't change the problem, right?

500
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,440
But

501
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,000
I didn't expect

502
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,480
Madam would join Mohuan.

503
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,000
I was surprised.

504
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,680
Mohuan is my mother's only choice.

505
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,880
I owed my mother too much.

506
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,120
So this time,

507
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,520
I can't let Mohuan hurt my mother.

508
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,640
It's not a matter of a moment.

509
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,800
It needs to be remembered.

510
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,160
It's not a matter of a moment

511
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,920
to bring down the devil.

512
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,440
Of course.

513
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,680
Rong Jinfeng

514
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,880
hit on Mohuan

515
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,120
because he didn't have a good chance

516
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,680
and left the Cui Ming Talisman.

517
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,240
So this time,

518
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,000
we have to take the initiative.

519
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,400
Take the initiative.

520
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,080
We can't make the mistake

521
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,800
Rong Jinfeng made before.

522
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,240
Enough.

523
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,800
If you're angry again,

524
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,680
Bai Ling will naturally apologize.

525
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,480
This is a threat, you know?

526
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,080
You still have the mood to joke?

527
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,720
Are you going to make me cry?

528
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,280
I have to find out

529
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,400
this matter clearly.

530
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,400
Go.

531
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,240
Where are you taking me?

532
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,120
I don't care who is behind this.

533
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,560
I have to find this person.

534
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,800
You just arrived at Linxun Pavilion.

535
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,280
This kind of thing happened on the first day.

536
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,200
Obviously, someone is touched

537
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,280
and doesn't dare to say it.

538
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,760
Did you deliberately blackout behind it?

539
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,040
I want everyone in Linxun Pavilion

540
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,680
to know

541
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,640
that I brought you back.

542
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,200
You are my future wife.

543
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,160
You are the future lady of Linxun Pavilion.

544
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:10,960
Why are you laughing?

545
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,800
I'm wrong.

546
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:12,800
Yes.

547
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,120
That's why I nodded.

548
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,520
Besides,

549
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,920
who are you so anxious to punish?

550
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,760
Is it Xiao Cai

551
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,480
or other innocent maids?

552
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,680
You brought me back as an outsider.

553
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,840
You are so kind.

554
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,240
It's uncomfortable to be an outsider.

555
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,640
But the more you protect me,

556
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,280
the more they think I'm useless

557
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,920
and don't deserve you.

558
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,720
How is that possible?

559
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,720
Who dares to think you are useless?

560
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,160
Who dares to think you don't deserve me?

561
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,520
Today is the day.

562
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,080
This...

563
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,520
Then, according to your opinion,

564
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,440
what do you think should be the end?

565
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,520
I think

566
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,960
forget it.

567
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,520
Forget it?

568
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,120
How can I forget it?

569
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,680
Just let you be wronged for nothing?

570
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,920
Don't worry.

571
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,120
I have my own way

572
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,480
to let them know my power.

573
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,680
I will let them

574
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,040
accept me with confidence.

575
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,240
This kind of thing

576
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,160
will never happen again.

577
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,200
But

578
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,840
I was indeed

579
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,160
frightened today.

580
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,400
I was indeed

581
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,600
frightened today.

582
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,400
This matter

583
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,520
must be counted on you.

584
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,680
Then what do you want to do?

585
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,280
Let me think about it.

586
00:28:40,280 --> 00:29:06,400
Want to take down the

587
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,800
him from today

588
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,240
if you try.

589
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:11,640
I mean it.

590
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:38,620
Do you have any Configuration

591
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,840
I haven't seen enough.

592
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,960
You may pray to God,

593
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,600
but in reasons different fromax,

594
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,280
while during your time in Dragon Max,

595
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,140
you spent the night

596
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,200
and had theанию.

597
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,880
I'm

598
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,240
a wise constable.

599
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,580
I'm much wise

600
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,440
than you are.

601
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,160
Constable?

602
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,920
You are a constable.

603
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,120
You'll live a great life.

604
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,920
Don't I wonder

605
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,920
I'm not a thief.

606
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,920
I'm just a little thief.

607
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,920
You've been touching it for so long

608
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,920
but you haven't touched the key point.

609
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,920
Could it be

610
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,920
that you have other treasures in your room?

611
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,920
Master, do you have

612
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,920
a treasure in front of you?

613
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,920
You?

614
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,920
No.

615
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,920
Why are you laughing?

616
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,920
Nothing.

617
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,920
I'm just a little thief.

618
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,920
I'm just a little thief.

619
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,920
Nothing.

620
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,920
It's fine.

621
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,920
You have a problem with me?

622
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,920
You haven't become the Young Master's wife yet

623
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,920
and you're already making fun of me.

624
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,920
You can't even get married.

625
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,920
No one dares to object

626
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,920
that I'm the Young Master's wife.

627
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,920
Someone has to help you, right?

628
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,920
I'll just have to do it.

629
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,920
You want to help me, right?

630
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,920
Give Yin a chance.

631
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,920
You want to help me?

632
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,920
First, you have to

633
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,920
clean this place.

634
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,920
What is this?

635
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,920
These are the treasures I kept in my childhood.

636
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,920
I secretly hid them behind my mother's back.

637
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,920
When I was little, my mother

638
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,920
was strict with my discipline.

639
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,920
She didn't allow me to play with them.

640
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,920
But playing with them is the nature of children.

641
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,920
So,

642
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,920
in order to hide these treasures,

643
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,920
I learned to make these secret boxes

644
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,920
when I was eight years old.

645
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,920
Your wife is so strict with her discipline.

646
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,920
Where did you get these things?

647
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,920
From her house.

648
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,920
Although I'm not as good as others,

649
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,920
I've been better at martial arts than others.

650
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,920
Look at these treasures.

651
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,920
I got them from

652
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,920
Yizhou.

653
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,920
So, you bullied her since you were little.

654
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,920
What are you talking about?

655
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,920
I didn't bully her.

656
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,920
She has been following me since I was little.

657
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,920
I don't follow anyone else.

658
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,920
I'm telling you.

659
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,920
I'll keep these treasures

660
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,920
well.

661
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,920
When I'm old, I'll play with our children.

662
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,920
I'll also tell our children

663
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,920
about the great things

664
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,920
that happened to me.

665
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,920
What are you talking about?

666
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,920
Hua.

667
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,920
I'm not talking nonsense.

668
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,920
I'm serious.

669
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,920
Think about it.

670
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,920
Lu Yizhou will get married in the future.

671
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,920
She'll have her own child when she gets married.

672
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,920
Her child will definitely play with our child.

673
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,920
But I can assure you that

674
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,920
our child is definitely better than their child.

675
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,920
By then,

676
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,920
our child will put all the treasures

677
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,920
she won

678
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,920
into the secret box

679
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,920
made by her father.

680
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,920
It will be a very meaningful thing.

681
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,920
Thank you.

682
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,920
What is it?

683
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,920
Are you shy?

684
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,920
No.

685
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,920
I just think

686
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,920
there are not enough songs.

687
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,920
I'll make more.

688
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,920
I get it.

689
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,920
You have a good taste.

690
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,920
You can make as many songs

691
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,920
as you want.

692
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,920
At worst,

693
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,920
Don't let anyone hear it.

694
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,920
So what?

695
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,920
We just want to make more songs.

696
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,920
Don't.

697
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,920
We'll make five.

698
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,920
We'll make five.

699
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,920
Hua, how do you think we can make more?

700
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,920
Tell me.

701
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,920
What's going on?

702
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,920
The Great Fourth Master will arrange the ceremony

703
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,920
and leave it to Xiao Cai.

704
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,920
No matter who is responsible for this,

705
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,920
it's Xiao Cai's fault.

706
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,920
If you want to punish me,

707
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,920
I can do it alone.

708
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,920
It has nothing to do with others.

709
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,920
You are responsible for Miss Rong's wedding.

710
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,920
Of course it's not your fault.

711
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,920
I believe you

712
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,920
have no reason to blame me.

713
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,920
But

714
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,920
this matter must be investigated.

715
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,920
I hope everyone understands

716
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,920
Miss Rong

717
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,920
is the person in the eyes of the Young Master.

718
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,920
She has been in the Palace of the Deceased

719
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,920
and she has been in the Lingxu Pavilion.

720
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,920
She is the person in the Lingxu Pavilion.

721
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,920
In the eyes of the Young Master,

722
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,920
she can't tolerate any rebellion.

723
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,920
But she is obviously from Longyin City.

724
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,920
The Young Master shouldn't have leaked this fact.

725
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,920
Yes.

726
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,920
Last time she came to the Young Master.

727
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,920
I saw it with my own eyes.

728
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,920
She stabbed the Young Master with a dagger.

729
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,920
You all shut up.

730
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,920
This is the Young Master's decision.

731
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,920
When will you talk?

732
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,920
Stop talking.

733
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,920
Don't worry, Great Master.

734
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,920
I promise you

735
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,920
I will take care of Miss Rong in the future.

736
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,920
This kind of situation will never happen again.

737
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,920
We will find out

738
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,920
who is behind this.

739
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,920
Remember.

740
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,920
This matter

741
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,920
must not leak again.

742
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,920
Yes.

743
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,920
Take a rest here.

744
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,920
Stop.

745
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,920
Take a rest.

746
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,920
The journey has passed.

747
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,920
There is still no sign of the spring.

748
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,920
The spring is here.

749
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,920
The journey has passed.

750
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,920
There is still no sign of the spring.

751
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,920
The north wind is blowing the white grass.

752
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,920
Only the north desert is like this.

753
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,920
The north desert is not desolate.

754
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,920
It's just that you haven't seen the beauty of the north desert.

755
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,920
Madam.

756
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,920
We have been driving all the way.

757
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,920
We haven't stopped.

758
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,920
Plus, the weather in the north desert is not good.

759
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,920
You should take a good rest.

760
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,920
This is the north desert.

761
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,920
I met my husband here

762
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,920
for the first time.

763
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,920
I also asked him about this.

764
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,920
But now...

765
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,920
Forget it.

766
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,920
It's all in the past.

767
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,920
I don't know why Madam

768
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,920
took the initiative to welcome us.

769
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,920
I just wanted to let Madam

770
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,920
investigate the people

771
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,920
who disappeared from the spiritual leader's sect.

772
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,920
But I was too careless.

773
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,920
I'm afraid this trip is not that simple.

774
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,920
The spiritual leader sent these disciples

775
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,920
to protect us

776
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,920
is actually a cover-up.

777
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,920
And the north desert journey

778
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,920
is a warning

779
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,920
for Lingxu Pavilion.

780
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,920
So I had to come.

781
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,920
Master.

782
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,920
The message from the spiritual leader's disciples

783
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,920
before

784
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,920
is here.

785
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,920
Maybe we can find some clues.

786
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,920
Okay.

787
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,920
Search carefully.

788
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,920
Report to me if you find anything.

789
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,920
Yes.

790
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,920
You. You. Go.

791
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,920
It's about time

792
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,920
that Yu'er and Ronghua

793
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,920
should be in Lingxu Pavilion.

794
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,920
Don't worry, Madam.

795
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,920
The spiritual leader

796
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,920
has the Great Fourth Master by his side.

797
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,920
He will be fine.

798
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,920
Go.

799
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,920
Madam.

800
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,920
Lingxiao Pavilion's disciples are here.

801
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,920
Go up and have a look.

802
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,920
Go.

803
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,920
Go.

804
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,920
Madam.

805
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,920
There is a small room in the west.

806
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,920
We didn't find

807
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,920
the missing disciples on our way here.

808
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,920
And we didn't find any clues.

809
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,920
Maybe the murderer has been transferred.

810
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,920
Maybe.

811
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,920
But we can't find them.

812
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,920
We can't find them.

813
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,920
We can't find them.

814
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,920
We can't find them.

815
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,920
We can't find them.

816
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,920
We can't find them.

817
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,920
Madam.

818
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,920
Behind the woods.

819
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,920
There seems to be a place to hide.

820
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,920
The missing person is here.

821
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,920
Hurry up.

822
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,920
Hurry up.

823
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,920
Hide the weapons.

824
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,920
Madam, you have died for a long time.

825
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,920
You should go back.

826
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,920
Since you set up a trap

827
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,920
to lure us here,

828
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,920
I will let you go.

829
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,920
Lingxiao Pavilion.

830
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,920
Today I let you come and go.

831
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,920
You still don't show up.

832
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,920
I have been waiting for a long time.

833
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,920
Today,

834
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,920
I finally got a chance.

835
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,920
I won't leave any of the people of Lingxiao Pavilion.

836
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,920
Who are you?

837
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,920
Why do you want to kill the disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion?

838
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,920
What is your grudge against Lingxiao Pavilion?

839
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,920
I can't explain it clearly

840
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,920
to the three words and two words of Lingxiao Pavilion.

841
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,920
You are the devil of Lingxiao Pavilion.

842
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,920
Don't mess with me.

843
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,920
Just because you want to kill Lingxiao Pavilion,

844
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,920
even if you join hands,

845
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,920
you can't do anything to me.

846
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,920
So you are the default?

847
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,920
You are the devil of Lingxiao Pavilion?

848
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,920
Today,

849
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,920
I will kill you.

850
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,920
To get justice.

851
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,920
Stop.

852
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,920
Stop.

853
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,920
Who are you?

854
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,920
Why do you want to kill Lingxiao Pavilion?

855
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,920
If you confess,

856
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,920
I can spare your life.

857
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,920
Don't be a good man.

858
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,920
Kill people like a horse.

859
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,920
I'm afraid that

860
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,920
there are many people in the world who want to kill him.

861
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,920
I can't die today.

862
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,920
But in the future,

863
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,920
there will be more people

864
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,920
to avenge him.

865
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,920
You don't have to say anything.

866
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,920
Kill or hang,

867
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,920
as you wish.

868
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,920
Cang Qi.

869
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,920
Take me to see Uncle Jin Ye.

870
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,920
How do you know my mother's name?

871
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,920
I don't know.

872
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:49,920
I'm here.

873
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:50,920
I'm here.

874
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:51,920
I'm here.

875
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:52,920
I'm here.

876
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:53,920
I'm here.

877
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,920
I'm here.

878
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:55,920
I'm here.

879
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:56,920
I'm here.

880
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:57,920
I'm here.

881
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,920
I'm here.

882
00:43:58,920 --> 00:43:59,920
I'm here.

883
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:00,920
I'm here.

884
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:01,920
I'm here.

885
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,920
I'm here.

886
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,920
I'm here.

887
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,920
I'm here.

888
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:05,920
I'm here.

889
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:06,920
I'm here.

890
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,920
I'm here.

891
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:08,920
I'm here.

892
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:09,920
I'm here.

893
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,920
I'm here.

894
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:11,920
I'm here.

895
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:12,920
I'm here.

896
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,920
I'm here.

897
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:14,920
I'm here.

898
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:15,920
I'm here.

899
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,920
I'm here.

900
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:17,920
I'm here.

901
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:18,920
I'm here.

902
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:19,920
I'm here.

903
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:20,920
I'm here.

904
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:21,920
I'm here.

905
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,920
I'm here.

906
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:23,920
I'm here.

907
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,920
I'm here.

908
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:25,920
I'm here.

909
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:26,920
I'm here.

910
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:27,920
I'm here.

911
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:28,920
I'm here.

912
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:29,920
I'm here.

913
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:30,920
I'm here.

914
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:31,920
I'm here.

915
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,920

917
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,920
I'm here.

918
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:35,920

I'm here.

927
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,920
I'm here.

928
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,920
I'm here.

929
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,920
I'm here.

930
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,920
I'm here.
