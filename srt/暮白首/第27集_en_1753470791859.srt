00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,600
Good girl.

3
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,600
I understand your mind.

4
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,360
Come on, get up.

5
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:39,840
Get up.

6
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,240
Get up.

7
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:40,560
I...

8
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm determined.

9
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,800
Translate the dialogue.

10
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,280
Ma Lanyue is here.

11
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,800
I'll go downstairs.

12
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,040
Master.

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,440
Didn't you sleep well last night?

14
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,640
Why do you look so sleepy?

15
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,480
The specialties of this place are very delicious.

16
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,400
There are still some shops that don't close at night.

17
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,400
I smelled it

18
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,440
when I was riding at night.

19
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,120
Then I followed the scent

20
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,240
and went to find it.

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,960
I had a late night snack.

22
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,680
I ate too much at once.

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,360
I didn't sleep well last night.

24
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,400
Right.

25
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,200
Why didn't I think of this?

26
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,840
Maybe this is the reason

27
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,880
why you're in danger.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,520
No, no.

29
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,680
What are you talking about?

30
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,200
I don't understand anything.

31
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,360
It's okay, Master.

32
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,960
It's just my speculation.

33
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:39,920
No.

34
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,680
What's your speculation?

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,080
Tell me. Tell me.

36
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,280
Do you think

37
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,520
I can share my experience?

38
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,600
But

39
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,640
you can't go with me.

40
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,280
I have to go and check it myself.

41
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,800
Why can't I go?

42
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,520
What if you make Master unhappy?

43
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,080
Anyway,

44
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,200
you'd better not go.

45
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,760
I won't go.

46
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,880
I'll make up for it.

47
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,880
The night and the folk song

48
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,920
looks just like an old man's sleep.

49
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,320
No matter how strong it is,

50
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,600
I can do it without the daydreaming.

51
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:58,560
I originally wat became Lu's

52
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,060
linha cat and

53
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,160
Linzhu she is

54
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,960
the boss

55
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,880
you are not

56
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,700
so late

57
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,720
Give them a little privacy.

58
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,400
It can't be.

59
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,800
Awesome.

60
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,040
Grand Leaduchess.

61
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,280
Who knew

62
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,960
the rotorral school of Supreme Immortal

63
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,080
has such a lovely face.

64
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,800
She wouldn't expect

65
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,200
her stomach

66
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,040
to be killed by Mu Youzhong.

67
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,240
Grand Leaduchess is too old

68
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,440
I ate so many leaves of leaves every day.

69
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,520
Of course I'm not hungry.

70
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,880
Judging from the situation,

71
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,840
I must be hungry.

72
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,120
But

73
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,320
when Master ate something,

74
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,960
he was really like Master.

75
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,400
He's really a master.

76
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,380
When Master ate I can't recognize him.

77
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,500
It's been twenty years since he disappeared.

78
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,380
I hope to tell Master

79
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,720
that he's still alive.

80
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,200
His weakness

81
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,360
is his lack of behavior and no sooner he started to be an Lord's subordinate,

82
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,220
the stronger his internal fifteen,

83
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,160
the내

84
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,720
Master,

86
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,960
it's me.

87
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,200
It's you, girl.

88
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,360
Why are you in my room

89
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,760
in the middle of the night?

90
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,200
There's a bandit.

91
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,720
This...

92
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,080
This...

93
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,000
This is impossible.

94
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,480
You can't blame Master.

95
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,400
Master will be in danger

96
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,600
only when he gets the sleepwalking syndrome

97
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,960
and the food and drink.

98
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,120
Don't worry, Master.

99
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,160
I won't tell anyone.

100
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,880
The End

101
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,000
I've found the cause of Master's illness.

102
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,920
As long as we get the medicine,

103
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,120
he'll be cured.

104
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,120
Master's pulse was not good before.

105
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,240
Why is she diagnosed so soon?

106
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,240
What's the disease?

107
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,040
Do you know medical skills?

108
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,360
We don't.

109
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,320
Since you don't know,

110
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,520
you're still making a big deal out of it.

111
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,120
You're shameless.

112
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,160
Yes, Master.

113
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,840
Master, I'll take care of it.

114
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,440
I'll go get it.

115
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,560
But what's the cause of your illness?

116
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,280
The disease is very strange.

117
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,440
I have to catch it myself.

118
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,840
Ordinary people can't catch it.

119
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,280
This...

120
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,800
How is that possible?

121
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,760
Your medical skills are taught by me.

122
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,280
Ordinary people...

123
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,160
Get up.

124
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,200
Ah.

125
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,920
Master, I know my mistake.

126
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,080
Who's your master?

127
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,080
I don't have a disciple like you.

128
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,320
Master,

129
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,080
I'm wondering

130
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,000
why

131
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,000
it's been so many years

132
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,120
and you still won't forgive me.

133
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,280
You're a traitor.

134
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,880
In the Black Stone Mountain,

135
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,200
there's only one person named Bai Weizhi.

136
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,520
It's him.

137
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,400
It's a turtle.

138
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,080
Back then,

139
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,000
my junior brother was young and ignorant.

140
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,400
He was a talkative man.

141
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,480
One day,

142
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,800
he stewed my turtle

143
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,600
and made a dish.

144
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,280
My master loved turtles so much

145
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,880
that he drove it out of the Black Stone Mountain.

146
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,080
Master,

147
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,320
you ate a turtle?

148
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,880
What?

149
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,960
Back then,

150
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,800
when I was growing up,

151
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,560
I followed your master every day.

152
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,520
I didn't let him eat or drink.

153
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,400
I was so hungry.

154
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,240
I was so...

155
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,400
Master,

156
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,680
it's been so many years.

157
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,520
Please forgive me.

158
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,280
Besides,

159
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,880
you're already a new born.

160
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,440
No.

161
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,160
Please forgive me.

162
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:32,880
Shut up.

163
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,160
Master,

164
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,520
we're not saints.

165
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,800
How can we be innocent?

166
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,680
Besides,

167
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,880
some people...

168
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,200
Master,

169
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,440
don't be angry.

170
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,880
Master,

171
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,440
I haven't finished.

172
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,600
Master,

173
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,280
since little disciples are talking,

174
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,120
on his basis,

175
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,480
I'll spare you this time.

176
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,320
Great.

177
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,200
But no over-re drink.

178
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,760
You will go to the back yard

179
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,040
and plant JSAC salad.

180
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,600
See if you can secure it.

181
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,600
Thank you, master.

182
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,720
I'll plant it right now.

183
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,360
Master, you're so generous.

184
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,680
You'll live a long life.

185
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,320
That's right.

186
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,480
It's late.

187
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,000
I wonder if you can give me a ride?

188
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,200
It's not that we don't want to.

189
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,920
We don't need to give you a ride in the daytime.

190
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,040
What's wrong with giving a ride?

191
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,320
She's a girl.

192
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,760
Yes.

193
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,080
Take care, Master.

194
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,840
Miss, please wait.

195
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,960
Miss Long, what do you mean?

196
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,280
Are you trying to

197
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,920
take revenge for this brat

198
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,920
so that we bow to him?

199
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,360
And you want us to send you off?

200
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,880
I have something to ask you.

201
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,720
You know the cause of Master's illness.

202
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,560
Why didn't you tell us?

203
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,480
Tell us.

204
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,440
We don't know what you're talking about.

205
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,240
You really don't know?

206
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,360
Or you're pretending?

207
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,040
Master's stomachache

208
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,520
was caused by the food.

209
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,560
He doesn't eat much.

210
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,240
But you didn't tell him

211
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,560
that he had sleepwalking.

212
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,640
He would go down the mountain every night to the inn

213
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,440
to steal food and drink.

214
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,200
He changed his stomachache for a long time.

215
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,640
I found a lot of food under his bed.

216
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,720
No outsiders would come here.

217
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,160
I guess Master prepared

218
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,680
all these food.

219
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,600
What do you want to say?

220
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,680
What do you want to say?

221
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,280
Miss,

222
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,760
you must keep this a secret for us.

223
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,320
Master is the most respectful person.

224
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,240
You must not know about this.

225
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,440
We...

226
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,440
We have our difficulties.

227
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,960
Yes.

228
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,400
It's related to Master's health.

229
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,320
You don't have any difficulties.

230
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,200
You don't know.

231
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,960
We found out

232
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,360
when we were discussing with Master.

233
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,080
But we don't know

234
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,520
how to tell him.

235
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,160
We're afraid...

236
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,000
We're afraid that he will be embarrassed.

237
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,440
And

238
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,400
he doesn't eat much.

239
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,960
He was so obsessed with food

240
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,600
that he didn't know the truth.

241
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,840
He didn't think about it.

242
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,920
But he made Master feel anxious.

243
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,400
Yes.

244
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,280
We were discussing about this

245
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,480
a few days ago.

246
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,320
We wanted to tell Master about this.

247
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,640
But we have to find a perfect word.

248
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,680
Master...

249
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,720
You know his personality.

250
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,000
Luckily, Miss Rong showed up.

251
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,680
Yes.

252
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,040
Now,

253
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,920
we just need to pretend to be ignorant.

254
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,120
Master has to sell you some flour.

255
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,040
As long as you can cure Master's stomach disease,

256
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,640
it's good.

257
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,920
You two are bad guys.

258
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,080
You always teach me a trick.

259
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,240
I didn't expect you

260
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,080
to be so respectful to Master.

261
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,840
In fact,

262
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,120
you don't care about his health at all.

263
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,360
I have to

264
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,360
tell you about this.

265
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,200
Otherwise,

266
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,200
I can't stand it.

267
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,200
I can't stand it.

268
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,680
What are you doing?

269
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,440
I can't stand it.

270
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,360
I can't stand it.

271
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,280
Master.

272
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,400
Xuan Ye and I chased Black Stone Mountain.

273
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,360
Master Bai tried to run away from the door.

274
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,080
But as his senior said,

275
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,360
he was kicked out.

276
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,080
But Master Bai

277
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,480
still didn't go back to Longyin City.

278
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,680
Now,

279
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,280
he has given the old man's order

280
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,440
to give up Master's will.

281
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,520
Bai Wei Zhi

282
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,680
is getting old.

283
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,520
If Longyin City didn't take him in,

284
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,240
he would still be wandering

285
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,360
in the world.

286
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,040
But now,

287
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,440
Longyin City is in his hands.

288
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,600
Good.

289
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,880
If he doesn't want to go back to Longyin City,

290
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,640
from now on,

291
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,440
Longyin City will no longer welcome him.

292
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,400
Now,

293
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,280
it's time for Longyin City to use people.

294
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,280
The Old Man's Hall

295
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,400
can't be left empty-handed.

296
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,640
Su Er.

297
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,360
Give the token to Young Master Mei.

298
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,160
Before I decide

299
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,640
who will be the next Hall Leader,

300
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,400
the Old Man's Hall

301
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,520
will be taken over by Young Master Mei.

302
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,200
This position

303
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
is yours.

304
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:46,920
City Leader.

305
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,200
Even if it's temporary,

306
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,360
we should be cautious.

307
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,400
Young Master Mei...

308
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,120
This time, he attacked Lingxu Pavilion.

309
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,160
Young Master Mei has used his actions

310
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,280
to prove his loyalty.

311
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,120
Since he's the substitute,

312
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,240
I'll consider it.

313
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,040
But...

314
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,120
Don't worry about it.

315
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,440
I'll lie to you and Nigeria.

316
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,520
There's definitely a chance

317
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,080
Mei Ying will leave 보여주� QUESTION

318
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,720
and 별로 take the loose end away.

319
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,200
I'm sure

320
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,520
Mei Ying will talk to Black Ops club

321
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,240
and advance to the main capital.

322
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,340
Well,

323
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,280
I'm rather anxious to admit it to you.

324
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,680
The Second Prince

325
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,960
must have 뭐� 1963

326
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,320
to adjudge of the decision.

327
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:34,680
I shouldn't be mostfs

328
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,560
I don't believe

329
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,120
Mei Ying will discuss it with you alone.

330
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,760
Let's speak for Master.

331
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,020
I now rely on you.

332
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,960
Don't worry, Master Rong.

333
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,260
I will생ull suspicious parts of the operation7.

334
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,920
Master, you said

335
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,720
I should serve him wouldly,

336
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,360
I will definitely win.

337
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,120
Master Mei is in charge of the imperial court.

338
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,720
Li Ying is busy with the affairs in the city.

339
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,520
Why does he keep following me?

340
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,800
There is only one way.

341
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,360
I will go to Laozi Hall.

342
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,720
I will definitely go through this place.

343
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,320
We are just on the same path.

344
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,720
You are really good at it.

345
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,520
I just left for a few days.

346
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,800
I can trust you so much.

347
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,400
It seems that you have not been idle these days.

348
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,120
I just did some minor things.

349
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,760
I just did some things for you.

350
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,000
It's not worth mentioning.

351
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,120
Mei Ying, I warn you.

352
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,560
Don't be too proud.

353
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,720
Remember.

354
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,200
Longyin City is after all named after Rong.

355
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,920
It's not your turn to be a fool here.

356
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,040
Greetings, Master Mei.

357
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,520
Do you know the rules?

358
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,200
You are just a little disciple.

359
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,400
Do you still have a big miss Longyin City in your eyes?

360
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,080
I know my mistake.

361
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,640
Please forgive me.

362
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,720
I don't know anything.

363
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,720
It's all my fault.

364
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:24,960
Well,

365
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,160
I apologize to Miss Rong on behalf of Laozi Hall.

366
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,000
You are so mean.

367
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,440
Deputy Chief.

368
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,280
Deputy Chief.

369
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,880
For some days

370
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,520
Mei Ying has started acting.

371
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,240
Ugh is out of place.

372
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,680
Actually, Mei Ying never said anything before

373
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,600
and she persuaded Chief

374
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,720
toρούate the sect like a wolf

375
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,520
and came to pray.

376
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,760
And she claimed that

377
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,160
Hai Na Baichuan

378
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,720
haduchen purpose and only found money with talent.

379
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,440
These are all new disciples' lists.

380
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,920
It's ridiculous.

381
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,840
What are they talking about?

382
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,700
When did my choke position par excellence

383
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,880
said that outsiders can come in?

384
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,520
Meiyin has tried so hard

385
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,000
to buy the hearts of people

386
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,320
anddispute away his own power.

387
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,540
City Commandery Chief has lost his mind now.

388
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:29,880
That's why he's

389
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,880
wet the skin with deactivated blood.

390
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,240
Leave now!

391
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,080
Yes, sir.

392
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,640
Longyin City is in a bad shape.

393
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,400
We should be more careful.

394
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,920
Finally Rong Hua is gone.

395
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,920
And Mei Ying is here.

396
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,080
I don't know what you're thinking.

397
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,680
But I don't know

398
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,720
if she still has me.

399
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,240
How can I replace her?

400
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,240
Lingxu Pavilion is in a battle.

401
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,480
We've used up too much manpower.

402
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,440
Longyin City is in need of people.

403
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,480
Anyway, you're not here.

404
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,360
You're the City Master's own child.

405
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,680
You're the only bloodline.

406
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,760
You don't need to be so strict with Mei Ying.

407
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,680
She just knew it.

408
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,400
If you're really confused,

409
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,160
why did you give her a temporary position?

410
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,360
As long as you can hold it in,

411
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,440
and get the City Master's position,

412
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,400
you'll take care of Mei Ying's future.

413
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,160
You reminded me.

414
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,720
Now the Holy Weapon Hall and the Old Lord of the Hall are in her hands.

415
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,000
She's eager to make achievements.

416
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,640
There must be a gap.

417
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,280
When the time comes,

418
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,560
she can take a chance.

419
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,960
She's not afraid of anything.

420
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,240
She's just a little girl.

421
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,440
She's not afraid of anything.

422
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,680
She's just a little girl.

423
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,680
She's just a little girl.

424
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,680
She's just a little girl.

425
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,680
She's just a little girl.

426
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,680
She's just a little girl.

427
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,680
She's just a little girl.

428
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,680
She's just a little girl.

429
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,680
She's just a little girl.

430
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,680
She's just a little girl.

431
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,680
She's just a little girl.

432
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,680
She's just a little girl.

433
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,680
She's just a little girl.

434
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,680
She's just a little girl.

435
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,680
She's just a little girl.

436
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,680
She's just a little girl.

437
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,680
She's just a little girl.

438
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,680
She's just a little girl.

439
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,680
She's just a little girl.

440
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,680
She's just a little girl.

441
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,680
She's just a little girl.

442
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,680
She's just a little girl.

443
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,600
The

444
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,000
You're finally here.

445
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,120
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

446
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,120
Why did the Chihua Bead attract me to come here?

447
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,120
What's going on?

448
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,880
This Chihua Bead

449
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,920
belongs to you.

450
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,920
But you

451
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,720
belong to me.

452
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,120
Since you came, it means

453
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,120
that your heart

454
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,120
has already chosen

455
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,120
to cultivate the Xuanbing Manor.

456
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,120
Only by cultivating the Xuanbing Manor

457
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,120
can you survive.

458
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,120
Only by cultivating this palace

459
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,320
can you deal with the Jingfu.

460
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,920
Who are they?

461
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,120
What's going on?

462
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,520
Don't worry.

463
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,720
They are fine.

464
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,720
And in the future,

465
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,320
they will be

466
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,920
your best weapon.

467
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,320
You can't force yourself to do everything,

468
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,720
especially the cultivation.

469
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,320
If you don't want to cultivate,

470
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,120
I won't force you.

471
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,520
Isn't it all

472
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,920
your own choice?

473
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,320
If you want to give up,

474
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,120
you can leave the Ling family now.

475
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,520
No one will stop you.

476
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,520
I don't care what you say or do now.

477
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,520
I just want to ask you one question.

478
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,920
When will you start to cultivate?

479
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,120
You are indeed Ruohan's good son.

480
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,720
You don't think I care about you that much.

481
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,920
It seems that Ruohan's death

482
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,920
is inevitable.

483
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,120
Aren't you afraid

484
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,920
that after I cultivate,

485
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,720
I will kill you

486
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,520
and bury you with my mother?

487
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,520
If you really have the ability,

488
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,720
my life is here.

489
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,720
You can kill me anytime.

490
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,720
All right.

491
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:17,920
I will now

492
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,720
pass on the testimony of the Xuanbing Manor to you.

493
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,920
But I want to remind you

494
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,120
that it will be very uncomfortable to practice this skill.

495
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,120
Every time you practice,

496
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,120
the pain will increase three times.

497
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,120
This is something that ordinary people can't bear.

498
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,920
Once you start,

499
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,520
it will be hard to turn back.

500
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,120
Since I decided to come to the Ling family,

501
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,520
I didn't think about turning back.

502
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,520
If you can walk out of this deep pond safely,

503
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,120
come to me and talk about revenge.

504
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,720
Brother Nalan.

505
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,920
Brother Nalan.

506
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,320
Brother Nalan.

507
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,920
In the Ling family,

508
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,320
how can you make a mess?

509
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,320
Do you want to die?

510
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,520
These days,

511
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,920
all of you in the Ling family don't care about us.

512
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,920
Why did Brother Nalan disappear for no reason today?

513
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,320
You just appeared right away

514
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,320
and stopped me from looking for him.

515
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,320
Did you do something

516
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,520
that is unbearable

517
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,320
and you were afraid that we would find out?

518
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,120
How dare you!

519
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,320
Without your order,

520
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,920
who dares to act rashly?

521
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,320
Brother Cang Qi,

522
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,920
do you have news about Brother Nalan?

523
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,320
The leader has given a new order.

524
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,920
You can't leave the place without permission.

525
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,320
If you find out,

526
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,320
you will be killed.

527
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,320
You...

528
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,320
We are not trying to act rashly.

529
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,320
We just want to find someone.

530
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,320
I dare to ask you,

531
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,120
where is our young master now?

532
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,720
You can just take care of yourself.

533
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,120
If you are still bothering us,

534
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,720
don't blame us for being rude.

535
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,520
Shut up.

536
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,120
Watch your step.

537
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,920
They are all guests of the Lord.

538
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,720
Guests?

539
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,320
When will you make the decision?

540
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,520
I dare not.

541
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:19,720
Leave.

542
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,320
Yes.

543
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,720
Elder,

544
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,520
if you have news about Brother Nalan,

545
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,920
please tell us the truth.

546
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,320
You should go back to your room first.

547
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,720
I can guarantee

548
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,520
that Nalan Yue is safe for now.

549
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,320
He is safe.

550
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,720
You don't have to worry.

551
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,520
As for where he is now,

552
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,520
I can't tell you the exact location.

553
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,720
Anyway,

554
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,120
you can go back and wait.

555
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,720
I will do my best to keep him safe.

556
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,720
Thank you, Elder.

557
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,320
Brother.

558
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,520
Miss Mei,

559
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,720
let's go back to our room first.

560
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,720
We will make a plan later.

561
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,120
This time, the cultivation is very dangerous.

562
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,720
I don't know if Nalan Yue

563
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,720
can survive.

564
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,720
Brother.

565
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:47,720
Brother.

566
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,720
Brother.

567
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,520
Brother.

568
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,120
Brother.

569
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:50,920
Brother.

570
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,720
Brother.

571
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,520
Brother.

572
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,320
Brother.

573
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,120
Brother.

574
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,920
Brother.

575
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,720
Brother.

576
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,520
Brother.

577
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,320
Brother.

578
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,120
Brother.

579
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:58,920
Brother.

580
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,720
Brother.

581
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,520
Brother.

582
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,320
Brother.

583
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,120
Brother.

584
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:02,920
Brother.

585
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,720
Brother.

586
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,520
Brother.

587
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,520
Brother.

588
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,520
Brother.

589
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,520
Brother.

590
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,520
Brother.

591
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,520
Brother.

592
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,520
Brother.

593
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,520
Brother.

594
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,520
Brother.

595
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,520
Brother.

596
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,520
Brother.

597
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,920
How could this be?

598
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,320
I can't

599
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,320
gather my inner strength.

600
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,320
I didn't expect that after the death of Lingxu Pavilion,

601
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,320
the great Nalan Young Master

602
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,120
would fall into such a terrible state.

603
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,120
It seems that you are already a useless person.

604
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,320
Since I am already a useless person,

605
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,920
wouldn't it be easier for you to kill me?

606
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:42,920
Come on.

607
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,320
Okay.

608
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,720
I will fulfill your wish.

609
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,720
You will die.

610
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,320
Useless.

611
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,520
I told you

612
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,320
that I would give you only three chances.

613
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,320
Get lost.

614
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,320
I...

615
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,520
Why can't I gather

616
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,120
my inner strength?

617
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,320
What on earth is the Xuanbing Talisman?

618
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,920
Do you think it's so easy

619
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,720
to cultivate the Xuanbing Talisman?

620
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,920
The Chihua Bead is in your skin.

621
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,920
This poisonous insect

622
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,520
will use you as its host.

623
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,320
Once you start cultivating the Xuanbing Talisman,

624
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,920
you will lose all your inner strength.

625
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,520
Okay.

626
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,920
Only by abandoning everything in the past

627
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,520
can you gain a stronger heart.

628
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,520
Just like the Phoenix's Nirvana.

629
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,920
If you want to give up now,

630
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,320
your rest of your life

631
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,520
will be a waste.

632
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,120
You can't even defeat

633
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,520
a mere second-in-law of the Tang family.

634
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,720
How can you fight against Rong Jingfeng?

635
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,120
How can you

636
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,120
avenge your mother

637
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,320
and the Lingxu Pavilion?

638
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,120
If you want to take revenge,

639
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,520
there is only one way

640
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,520
to take it.

641
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,320
You have to think about it.

642
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,120
In the future,

643
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,120
it will be even more painful.

644
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,320
I must seek justice

645
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,120
for everything that happened this time.

646
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,120
I want the whole Jianghu

647
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,520
to be punished

648
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,520
for the crime of adultery and adultery.

649
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,920
Brother Lan Lan.

650
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,320
No wonder Mohua asked me to prepare these.

651
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,520
If you can't get over the fever tonight,

652
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,120
you will definitely have a bad illness and have endless trouble.

653
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,720
Brother Lan Lan.

654
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,520
After you left that day,

655
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,120
Sister Rong Hua was very worried about you.

656
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,120
After the wedding,

657
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,520
Sister Rong Hua still couldn't help but let Xiao Cai

658
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,920
find out about you.

659
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,120
She also gave me

660
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,720
the treasure of the Shuru Zhen Bao.

661
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,720
She said that if there is an accident,

662
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,120
she would be very worried.

663
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,520
She said that if there is an accident,

664
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,320
she would still remember it.

665
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,120
Since we reunited,

666
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,720
I have never found a suitable opportunity

667
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,520
to give you this hairpin.

668
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,520
It was left by my mother.

669
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,320
Brother Lan Lan.

670
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,520
No matter what happens in the future,

671
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,720
I firmly believe

672
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,520
that in Sister Rong Hua's heart,

673
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,720
you are her only love.

674
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:14,920
So,

675
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,120
even for her,

676
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,720
I hope

677
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,320
you can get over it.

678
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,120
The Shuru Zhen Bao

679
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,720
Your clothes

680
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,120
are so casual.

681
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,320
If it weren't for me today,

682
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,920
it would be the others outside the sedan chair

683
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,520
who are secretly going to get it.

684
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,920
How can someone outside the sedan chair

685
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,920
have the ability like Master Ming?

686
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,320
Since I have entered the Ling sedan chair,

687
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,320
whether the knife is in my hand

688
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,520
is all fearless.

689
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,320
The Shuru Zhen Bao

690
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,320
You are really a god.

691
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,720
Compared to that Lan Yue,

692
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,120
you are much more calm.

693
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,920
The suffering I have suffered

694
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,520
is not only due to A Yue's actions,

695
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,120
but also due to the fact that I have the right to be hurt.

696
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,120
The Shuru Zhen Bao

697
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:43,720
Madam.

698
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,720
I always thought

699
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,920
that Ruo Han is the most likeable disciple of mine.

700
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,120
But I never thought

701
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,920
that the one who looks most like me

702
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,120
is Rong Jing Feng.

703
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,920
Ruo Han is very thoughtful

704
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,320
and generous.

705
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:21,980
The cold and

706
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,320
coldness he has been pretending since he was a child

707
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,120
is just because he didn't meet the right person.

708
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,720
But the appearance of Na Lan Xi

709
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,920
has completely changed everything.

710
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,520
You should know that

711
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,120
the Chiyan Lotus

712
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,520
is related to the life and death of Na Lan Yue.

713
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,520
So you will

714
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,920
protect her at all costs,

715
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,120
right?

716
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,320
Otherwise,

717
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,120
Ruo Han is in a dilemma

718
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,720
and it's hard to make peace.

719
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,720
I heard that Longyin City has been recruiting soldiers to buy horses recently.

720
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,520
Have you done

721
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,320
what A Yue told you?

722
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,920
The people I arranged have entered the Bingsi Hall.

723
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,920
The news said that

724
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,320
Rong Su and Mei Ying have been fighting in secret.

725
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,520
And the Bingsi Hall has been taken over.

726
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,920
Have you taken care of those people?

727
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,320
I left a message.

728
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,720
The rest have been killed.

729
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,520
I should send back the message in ten days.

730
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,320
OK.

731
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,120
The revenge of our Lingxu Pavilion

732
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,520
has taken the first step.

733
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,120
The eight disciples who sneaked into the North Desert

734
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,520
were killed in one night.

735
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,320
The wounds on their bodies are very strange.

736
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,920
How strange?

737
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,720
There are traces of Chihua Pearl on their hearts.

738
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,720
And they have been bitten by the poisonous bugs.

739
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,520
Their wounds are extremely delicate.

740
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,280
The

741
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,920
wounds on their hearts are so severe.

742
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,520
Chihua Pearl.

743
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,520
Poisonous bugs.

744
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,520
Who did this?

745
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,720
The only disciple who escaped from death

746
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,520
is now unconscious.

747
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,720
He keeps repeating the same sentence.

748
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,720
This is the retribution of the Nalan family.

749
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,720
The Nalan family.

750
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,120
Your poison has entered the heart.

751
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,720
If you keep taking medicine like this,

752
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,120
the situation will not change.

753
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,720
The poison will get closer to your body.

754
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,920
It will only be more and more beautiful.

755
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,920
If you want to be completely cured,

756
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,520
I'm afraid you have to find the white-tailed fox.

757
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,720
I'm afraid you have to find the white-tailed fox.

758
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,320
I'm afraid you have to find the white-tailed fox.

759
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,320
I'm afraid you have to find the white-tailed fox.

760
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,720
I'm afraid you have to find the white-tailed fox.

761
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,520
White-tailed fox only has a strange thought.

762
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,720
Why do you have to force him to go back to the city?

763
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,920
We both know

764
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,720
that people who are addicted to poison will have this day sooner or later.

765
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,920
Even if he comes back,

766
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,520
he can keep me for a few more days.

767
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,720
As you wish.

768
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,920
Have you heard from Hua'er these days?

769
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,720
I don't have such a daughter.

770
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,320
Don't ask me again.

771
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,720
I'm sorry.

772
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,720
There is only one wish before the ceremony.

773
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,520
Please keep it up.

774
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:23,920
Tell me.

775
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,920
Yinzi Hall

776
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,920
will never fall into Mei Ying's hands.

777
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,120
These are all medicinal herbs for detoxification.

778
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,720
I didn't expect you to use these.

779
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:35,720
Yun'er,

780
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,120
be careful.

781
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,720
You are the first time in Longying City.

782
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,920
You should talk less and do more things.

783
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,720
Remember to be careful and be careful.

784
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,520
Yes.

785
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,720
I will remember your teaching.

786
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,120
I saw that these herbs

787
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,520
were all very rare.

788
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,320
It reminds me of the past.

789
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,120
Before my family was still in the past,

790
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,520
I often went to the North Desert with my father to pick herbs.

791
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,920
I met a group of people at that time.

792
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,520
They were all special.

793
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,520
But the herbs they sold were all of the highest quality.

794
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,920
Like ice crystal.

795
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,120
Where did you pick herbs before?

796
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,120
Greetings, Miss.

797
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,520
Miss,

798
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,120
we often picked herbs in the North Desert.

799
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,520
Those who sell ice crystal are well-known.

800
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,520
Do they have any special items?

801
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,920
They never revealed their names.

802
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,720
They don't have any recognizable items.

803
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,320
Although my father and I are curious,

804
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,520
we dare not ask.

805
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,920
Those who sell herbs,

806
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,720
didn't they say anything else?

807
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,720
I really can't remember.

808
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,920
But I only remember that

809
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,520
the people who were in charge said that

810
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,920
ice crystal is rare and can be used to make everything.

811
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,120
They used to use this to cultivate a kind of aloe.

812
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,320
Greetings, City Leader.

813
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,520
Greetings, City Leader Zhiyan.

814
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,320
You go to the pharmacy and practice medicine.

815
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,720
Yes.

816
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,320
Go.

817
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,720
Okay, Su'er.

818
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,120
Tell me the situation.

819
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,320
Yes.

820
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,120
I received the news early in the morning.

821
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,520
I also sent out disciples of Kongzi Hall to the North Desert to investigate.

822
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,320
But they all suffered from murder

823
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,720
and died in different clothes.

824
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,720
It seems that

825
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,720
the Nalan family has been working in secret.

826
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,520
I'm afraid they have been planning for many years.

827
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,320
I ask you to go to the North Desert to investigate this matter.

828
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,920
It just so happens that the spiritual church is also there.

829
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,120
We can check it out.

830
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,120
After the Lingxu Pavilion was destroyed,

831
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,320
Mo Huan and the spiritual church had no contact.

832
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,320
Didn't the City Leader doubt it?

833
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,520
La Xiang, Su'er.

834
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,720
Leave this matter to you.

835
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:56,920
But remember.

836
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,120
You must be careful.

837
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,320
Don't alert the enemy.

838
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,120
Yes.

839
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,520
But the Nalan family...

840
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,320
They almost all...

841
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,520
The Nalan family has always been tough.

842
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,920
They can enter the Lingxu Pavilion again many years ago.

843
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,920
There must be people who escaped this time.

844
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,320
Those disciples of Kongzi Hall who were killed

845
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,720
all have the mark of Chihua Bead at their hearts.

846
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,520
This must be the trigger for the Nalan family's hatred of Longyin City.

847
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,320
Moreover,

848
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,120
Lin Ruohan is Mo Huan's favorite disciple.

849
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,320
Maybe he is in the spiritual church

850
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,120
waiting for the earth to come back at any time.

851
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,720
Su'er.

852
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,520
You can handle this matter.

853
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,920
I'll arrange it now.

854
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,320
I'll leave tomorrow.

855
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,320
The Nalan family has been in the Lingxu Pavilion for a long time.

856
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,520
They are all here.

857
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,720
They are all here.

858
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:32,920
They are all here.

859
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,120
They are all here.

860
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,320
They are all here.

861
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,520
They are all here.

862
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,720
They are all here.

863
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,920
They are all here.

864
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,120
They are all here.

865
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,320
They are all here.

866
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,520
They are all here.

867
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,720
They are all here.

868
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,920
They are all here.

869
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,120
They are all here.

870
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,320
They are all here.

871
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,520
They are all here.

872
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,720
They are all here.

873
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:50,920
They are all here.

874
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,120
They are all here.

875
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,320
They are all here.

876
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,520
They are all here.

877
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,720
They are all here.

878
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:56,720
They are all here.

879
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:57,920
They are all here.

880
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,120
They are all here.

881
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,320
They are all here.

882
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:01,520
They are all here.

883
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,720
They are all here.

884
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,920
They are all here.

885
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,120
They are all here.

886
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,320
They are all here.

887
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,520
They are all here.

888
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,720
They are all here.

889
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:09,920
They are all here.

890
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,120
They are all here.

891
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,320
They are all here.

892
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,520
They are all here.

893
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,720
They are all here.

894
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:15,920
They are all here.

895
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,120
They are all here.

896
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,320
They are all here.

897
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,520
They are all here.

898
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,720
They are all here.

899
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:21,920
They are all here.

900
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,120
They are all here.

901
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,320
They are all here.

They are all here.

They are all here.

00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:38,720
They are all here.

914
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:39,920
They are all here.

915
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,120
They are all here.

916
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,320
They are all here.

They are all here.

946
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,120
