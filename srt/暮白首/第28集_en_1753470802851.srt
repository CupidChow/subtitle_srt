1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of death

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of death

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of death

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of death

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of death

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of death

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of death

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of death

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of death

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of death

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of death

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of death

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of death

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of death

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not afraid of death

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of death

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of death

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of death

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of death

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of death

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of death

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of death

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of death

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of death

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of death

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of death

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of death

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of death

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Wish it can be RT

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Episode 16

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Unbelievable.

32
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,200
In the business entrusted by the Xiao選盟

33
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,000
for half a month,

34
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,720
we haven't even completed eight of them.

35
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,400
Since the establishment of the Xiao選盟,

36
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,800
we've never had such a thing.

37
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,680
It's really unusual.

38
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,000
Now,

39
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,640
I can't even get a hold of

40
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,000
the news of Longyin City.

41
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,800
I'm afraid someone has blocked

42
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,000
our source of information.

43
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,360
Let's go to the集合找那人

44
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,240
and have a good chat.

45
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,200
Let's see what he wants.

46
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,440
I'm afraid Mingzun

47
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,920
doesn't have much patience.

48
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,920
If the Xiao選盟 doesn't do anything,

49
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,000
our lives and the whole Xiao選盟

50
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,520
will be in danger.

51
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,200
Where should we go to find this person?

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,880
Where do we get most of the information?

53
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,600
We'll go there first.

54
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,400
We'll count the number of people in the Tian family

55
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,400
and the amount of money we have.

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,200
And the amount of money

57
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,200
we have in the various ways.

58
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,000
The Xiao選盟

59
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,000
still needs to pay me twice the amount of money.

60
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,600
Even so,

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,200
my business is just starting.

62
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,400
This is also because of you,

63
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm letting go.

64
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,400
The Xiao選盟 has paid you

65
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,600
a lot of money these years.

66
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,400
That's why you have the money to do more business.

67
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,200
Why don't you even say thank you?

68
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,400
You don't even say thank you,

69
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,200
but you're starting to take the initiative.

70
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,800
Businessmen always talk about power, not about will.

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,400
What's the point of the leader's actions?

72
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,600
Now that someone has a higher price,

73
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,200
I'm naturally transferring the news to him.

74
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,400
Senior Wang,

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,600
you've always been cautious.

76
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,800
How come you're so abnormal now?

77
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,800
Did someone force you?

78
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,200
I didn't expect that in this world,

79
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,600
someone would dare to steal business from the Xiao選盟.

80
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,200
Who is this person?

81
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,800
You've known each other for a long time.

82
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,400
Why do you ask me?

83
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,400
Could it be him?

84
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,400
I didn't expect you to come here so soon.

85
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,800
Bai Wei is just your teacher,

86
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,600
and Wang Zhiyuan's junior.

87
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,400
And Liuli even helped you

88
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,000
to inform Wang's Double Threads.

89
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,800
I can still count

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,400
the connections between them.

91
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,200
I've been so poor,

92
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,800
but I've still got nothing.

93
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,800
Tell me,

94
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,200
why is that?

95
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,800
Miss Rong, do you want to

96
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,400
steal the money from my Xiao選盟?

97
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,200
I'm not going to steal it.

98
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,800
I'm just going to give it to you.

99
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,400
Miss Rong, what do you want to know from my Xiao選盟?

100
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,600
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

101
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,000
I didn't say anything.

102
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,800
Why are you so anxious?

103
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
How could I help you

104
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,800
to inform Wang's Double Threads?

105
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,800
Now you're against me.

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
That was when Miss Liuli was in a low-key state.

107
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,200
Since I want to steal the business from the Xiao選盟,

108
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,800
it's the fastest way.

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,800
You...

110
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,000
Since I've cut off most of your information,

111
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,600
will there be any place

112
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
for you in the future?

113
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,000
Miss Rong, you can be straightforward.

114
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,800
What do you want?

115
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,600
What I want

116
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,400
is the same as before.

117
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,000
Lingxu Pavilion?

118
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,400
I'm not leaving.

119
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,200
I asked you before

120
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,600
what you wanted.

121
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
This time,

122
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm going to steal it.

123
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,200
If the Xiao選盟 wants to continue

124
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,000
doing business in the Jianghu,

125
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,400
tell me the truth.

126
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,400
I want the answer to the question.

127
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
In this case,

128
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
the Xiao選盟 can continue

129
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,800
to dominate the business in the Jianghu.

130
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,400
Why don't you

131
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,800
think it over

132
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,800
and give me your answer?

133
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,600
Tomorrow at this time,

134
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,800
I'll be in the capital.

135
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,600
Tomorrow at this time,

136
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,800
I'll still be here.

137
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,200
Even without the Xiao選盟,

138
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,200
I can still get

139
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,600
the information I want.

140
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,800
Princess,

141
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
we don't have time

142
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
to ask Master Ming.

143
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,800
What should we do?

144
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,000
This...

145
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,000
This is a way.

146
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,800
But, girl,

147
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,000
if the Xiao選盟 is sincere,

148
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
how can you prove it?

149
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,800
I won't give you the answer.

150
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,800
Even if I give it,

151
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,000
it's still not clear.

152
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,600
In that case,

153
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,400
why do you want the answer?

154
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,800
Because I want to know the truth.

155
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,800
Princess,

156
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,400
why do you want the answer?

157
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,000
They can't give the answer.

158
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And they want the information from Master Ming.

159
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,800
There is only one way to go.

160
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,600
Which way?

161
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,800
Co-operate with me.

162
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,800
In the future, the information in the Jianghu,

163
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,400
they must share with me.

164
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,000
Although I can't conquer the Xiao選盟,

165
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,800
I can use Master Ming's hands

166
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,200
to make him my servant.

167
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
In this case,

168
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,600
they won't dare to stop me.

169
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,000
I've found out the information about Lin Xu Pavilion in Jianghu.

170
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
It makes sense.

171
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,200
It makes sense.

172
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,200
Your Second Uncle

173
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,400
is just a little money

174
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,400
from his mouth.

175
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,600
What can he do?

176
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,400
These real estate and land

177
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,600
are all earned by me

178
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,600
and your Uncle.

179
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,200
Master,

180
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,400
if you're bored living here,

181
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,800
you can go anywhere you want.

182
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,000
I won't go anywhere.

183
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,800
I just hope you two

184
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,400
can come less in the future.

185
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,800
So that your money

186
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,400
can't ruin my quiet place.

187
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,600
I...

188
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,400
What you said is right.

189
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,000
What?

190
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
We mean

191
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,200
you're really good.

192
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,200
You're good.

193
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,400
I didn't expect

194
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,400
there's the land of Mei's Mansion.

195
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,800
When did Mei Ying sell the land

196
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,600
to you?

197
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,800
The loser Mei Ying

198
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
is very proud.

199
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,200
Although she doesn't have much money,

200
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,200
she raised a lot of disciples and servants

201
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,200
to be her servants in the past few years.

202
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,000
Over time,

203
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,600
she has been sitting in the mountain and the air

204
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
and has been working hard.

205
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,800
At that time,

206
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
if it weren't for me, your Uncle,

207
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,400
no one would buy

208
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,600
that ruined old house.

209
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,800
It seems that Mei Ying

210
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,000
gave up the land

211
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,400
to complete her big plan.

212
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,000
Now the Mei's Mansion

213
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,200
is a ruins.

214
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,600
After some time,

215
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,800
I have to find a way

216
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,000
to sell this house.

217
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,000
Uncle,

218
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,800
look.

219
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,000
This land

220
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,400
can't sell much money.

221
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,600
Or

222
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,800
you can give it to me.

223
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,000
You're a junior.

224
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,600
How can you say that to Uncle?

225
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
If you want to turn the mountain,

226
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,600
you can learn from your Uncle.

227
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,800
You can make a living.

228
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,400
You...

229
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,400
What's wrong with giving it to him?

230
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,600
That's right.

231
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,600
What's wrong with giving it to him?

232
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,600
This small land

233
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
is worth it for your Uncle.

234
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,200
Thank you, Uncle.

235
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,400
Look, this...

236
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,000
This...

237
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,800
Forget it.

238
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,200
I don't want this.

239
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,800
Uncle, can you lend me some money?

240
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,000
Money...

241
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,200
Lend me some money.

242
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:58,600
Lend me some money?

243
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,200
How much?

244
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,200
No.

245
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,200
You're right.

246
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,000
No.

247
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,800
No.

248
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,800
Give it to him.

249
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,200
Give...

250
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,400
Give...

251
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,600
A man's word

252
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
is hard to follow.

253
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,800
You...

254
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,800
You...

255
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,000
Thank you, Uncle.

256
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,800
Mo Hua.

257
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:47,400
I want to use this

258
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,400
It seems that

259
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,000
you can use the Black Ice Talisman

260
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,800
to drive away the evil spirit.

261
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
This will make the Red Eye Company

262
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
become more powerful.

263
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,000
But I have to remind you.

264
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,000
You can't be happy

265
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,800
with the Black Ice Talisman.

266
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,400
You've just

267
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,000
completed the first stage.

268
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,800
It will take some time.

269
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,800
After the poisonous insects in your body

270
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,400
adapt to the environment,

271
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,000
you can continue to practice the second stage.

272
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,400
But I'm curious.

273
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,200
This Red Eye Bead,

274
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,600
who are you going to use it for?

275
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,800
Of course, it's for the one who should use it.

276
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,600
If you want to use it,

277
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,800
just take it.

278
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,800
But I have to remind you.

279
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,600
Before you get a counterattack,

280
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,400
you have to come back here.

281
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,800
So I don't have to spend my time

282
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,200
looking for you everywhere.

283
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,400
I heard that Longyin City sent Rong Su to the north.

284
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,200
Last time, I helped him get out of here.

285
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,800
But this time,

286
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,800
I have to stop him.

287
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,800
Please approve it.

288
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,800
I'll guard the entrance of the spiritual school.

289
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,600
Since you've planned everything,

290
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,800
then go and sit down.

291
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,800
Who is it?

292
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,000
Jean tomorrow getscards.

293
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,200
Even if Rong interest isn't all that milliseconds,

294
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,380
He must have been so angry with me.

295
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,080
This Chihua Bead

296
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,560
is the only Chihua Bead

297
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,080
in the world

298
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,840
except the one in my body.

299
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,840
And I'm the only one

300
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,760
who can use this antidote.

301
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,760
It's a good opportunity to kill Nan Feng.

302
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,200
We need to make the best use of it.

303
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,720
I think Rong Jingfeng has figured out Duan Ni.

304
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,120
Otherwise,

305
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,360
he wouldn't have sent Rong Su to come here in person.

306
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,840
I'm sure he can't help it.

307
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,880
It seems

308
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,760
we can't avoid a fierce battle.

309
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,720
Why don't you go with me?

310
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,840
You have to stay alone

311
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,200
to deal with Rong Su.

312
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,840
You can't take the responsibility

313
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,400
of revenge for Lingxu Pavilion.

314
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,840
If I can't even pass this level,

315
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,680
how can I move to Longyin City

316
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,640
without Resisting All Demons?

317
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,600
Chief,

318
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,280
he's too arrogant.

319
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,680
We agreed to wait here for an hour yesterday.

320
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,400
Why hasn't he come yet?

321
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,400
When he went to the Snow Tower that day,

322
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,680
Master Ming was so polite to press him.

323
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,320
This debt,

324
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,680
he will take it back from you and me today.

325
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,320
You're quite arrogant.

326
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,680
You made us wait for so long.

327
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,280
I'm afraid we have to let him go today.

328
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,000
Miss Rong, you're disappointed.

329
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,480
The only answer you want is Master Ming's advice.

330
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,080
But now Master Ming is far away.

331
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,040
Even if he agrees to this,

332
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,720
this news will be out for months

333
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,400
after it's been a while.

334
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,520
In that case,

335
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,160
why don't we make a deal?

336
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,160
Miss Rong, what do you mean?

337
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,960
I want you to appear on my behalf

338
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,360
and buy Mei's Mansion as the buyer.

339
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,920
And repair the house as before.

340
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,720
If you want the news from Wang's Mansion,

341
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,480
you can exchange the other secret names

342
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,040
with the Mei's Mansion.

343
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,600
Please make a deal as soon as possible.

344
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,320
After all, we can wait.

345
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,880
The business of the Snow Tower can't wait.

346
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,160
Why did you do that, Miss Rong?

347
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,800
Mei Ying made a lot of efforts to destroy the Lingxu Pavilion.

348
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,520
She even sold her own family business.

349
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,200
I have to repair Mei's Mansion for her.

350
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,800
Otherwise,

351
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,360
how could she have the face

352
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,200
to meet her ancestors underground?

353
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,840
As long as you follow my plan,

354
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,120
you can get the news you want.

355
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,080
The business of the Snow Tower

356
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,240
is as good as ever in the world.

357
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,360
Sir,

358
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,160
we've lost one scout,

359
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,080
so look for the one who Von trace us.

360
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,880
Immediately.

361
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,680
Who are they?

362
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,640
Here we are.

363
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,520
and escape.

364
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,520
Who are they?

365
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,160
They're too fast.

366
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,520
I'm not sure.

367
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,320
But their moves

368
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,040
should be from the Spiritual Cult.

369
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,240
You still lead the disciples

370
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,640
to follow the original plan.

371
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,000
I'll go to the Spiritual Cult alone later.

372
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,160
If I don't come back in two hours,

373
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,800
you should know what to do.

374
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,760
Master Tang, don't do that.

375
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,680
It's too dangerous to go into the Spiritual Cult alone.

376
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,400
What if...

377
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,720
If we don't pass the Spiritual Cult,

378
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,840
it'll be hard to find Nalan's family.

379
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,440
And it'll be hard to find out

380
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,240
the real cause of death of the disciples.

381
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,520
I have to go to the Spiritual Cult to meet Mo Huan.

382
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,080
Otherwise,

383
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,120
even if I can't come back to Longyin City,

384
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,960
I'm destined to be

385
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,920
cornered by Mei Ying.

386
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,880
The Food was burnt,

387
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,980
the

388
00:17:52,980 --> 00:18:03,460
remind Plum Moral

389
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:09,580
was backed up by an pruebed murderer,

390
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:09,800
who made manyics on it.

391
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,640
who made manyics on it.

392
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,480
The pl gravit of bands wasrust

393
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,840
to global image.

394
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,200
It was a patrons' notice.

395
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,000
I'veيم deceived you.

396
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:48,520
Go.

397
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,080
I was here during your last rescue.

398
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,160
Lu Yuzhe.

399
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,480
I knew it.

400
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,600
I won't break into the spiritual world again.

401
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,960
So I'm here

402
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,760
waiting for your fight.

403
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,920
You're here

404
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,920
to kill me

405
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,960
to get justice for Lingxu Pavilion?

406
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,280
It's not that simple

407
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,480
to kill you.

408
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,480
That's not all

409
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,800
what Lingxu Pavilion wants.

410
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,840
Rong Su went to the North Desert

411
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,240
while Mei Ying chose to go to Lingxu Pavilion.

412
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,720
I guess she heard the sound of Mei's master's re-establishment

413
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,120
and wanted to know the truth.

414
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,400
Miss Rong.

415
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,080
Miss Rong.

416
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,680
I'll wait for her

417
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,720
near Lingxu Pavilion.

418
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,120
Rong Su.

419
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,480
Rong Su.

420
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,000
Xue Man.

421
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,240
Xue Man.

422
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,720
Xue Man.

423
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,560
Xue Man.

424
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,360
Xue Man.

425
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,080
Xue Man.

426
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,880
Xue Man.

427
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,720
Xue Man.

428
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,560
Xue Man.

429
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,560
Xue Man.

430
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,560
It's so nice to see you.

431
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,440
I was lucky enough to get help from Senior Bai.

432
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,560
I was lucky enough to avoid their pursuit.

433
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,360
Actually...

434
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,600
Miss Rong.

435
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,400
Since you're determined to re-establish the Mei Mansion,

436
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,400
we sent Miss Mei to help you.

437
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
It can save you a lot of energy.

438
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,120
Thank you.

439
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,520
Sister Rong.

440
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,800
I heard you were going to Lingxu Pavilion.

441
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:16,960
Then...

442
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,720
You must bring enough people along the way

443
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,880
to complete the mission.

444
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,800
If Mei Ying and I are eliminated...

445
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,720
She will take care of herself.

446
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,800
You don't have to be so kind.

447
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,760
Don't worry, Sister.

448
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,520
The Mei Family will help you.

449
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,480
Thank you, Xue Man.

450
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,520
I'll go now.

451
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,400
Go.

452
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,600
I didn't expect

453
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,800
you would send Nalan Yue here.

454
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,760
When we went to the letter, we only said

455
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,160
we wanted a draft of the Mei Mansion.

456
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,080
About Sister Rong,

457
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,960
Brother Nalan will do his best to help.

458
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,760
That's why I sent her here.

459
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,720
Besides,

460
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,680
she doesn't want me to see my brother's end.

461
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,360
Lingxu Pavilion has been abandoned for a long time.

462
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,640
It's deserted.

463
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,960
I wonder what Mo Huan will do next.

464
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,080
Although we were once

465
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,520
the brothers of the South and North,

466
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,640
we ended up like the Mei Family.

467
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,280
We disappeared in the world.

468
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,200
Do you think

469
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,600
the people who survived in Lingxu Pavilion

470
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,400
were still hiding in the dark?

471
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,360
If not,

472
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,960
why would a mysterious person

473
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,440
suddenly buy the Mei Mansion

474
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,120
and do the embroidery?

475
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,080
Go away.

476
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,200
Go to the forest to see if there are any suspicious people.

477
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,240
Yes.

478
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,360
The Mei Mansion

479
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,520
Young Master,

480
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,160
we have all solved the problem.

481
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,840
If it weren't for her...

482
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,040
Killing her is too easy for her.

483
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,320
This kind of punishment is best for her.

484
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,480
Even so,

485
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,880
what she has suffered is far worse than what she has done.

486
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,640
I'd like to see

487
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,200
what she can do

488
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,240
to solve the problem.

489
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,600
Mei Ying should be near Lingxu Pavilion.

490
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,640
But she would never have thought

491
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,080
that the poison powder she took from the Pavilion

492
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,640
had been replaced with poisonless powder.

493
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,040
I hope Young Master

494
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,600
can get justice for us soon.

495
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,640
Mei Ying's Mansion

496
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,840
They are all students of the Holy Heir of the Holy Heir.

497
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,280
But they didn't find Mei Ying's trace.

498
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,680
I wonder what happened just now.

499
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,920
Are you nearby?

500
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,080
With Master and Master,

501
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,600
Mei Ying must be nowhere to be found.

502
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,240
Master,

503
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,600
I need to go somewhere.

504
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,600
Okay.

505
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,280
I'll go with you.

506
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,800
I want to go alone.

507
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,720
Okay.

508
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,040
Be careful.

509
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,640
I'll wait for you here.

510
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,120
Don't worry, Master.

511
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,480
Mother,

512
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,800
I'm an unfilial son.

513
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,560
I've come to pay my respects.

514
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,800
Don't worry.

515
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,240
I will align a Hat fora

516
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,960
on Lingxu Pavilion.

517
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,640
I will wipe off

518
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,440
the western..."blood and Star tämä hidden by vermilion in the massacre."

519
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,880
I'll take these steps as well.

520
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,840
Master,

521
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,840
to make peace.

522
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,240
One day,

523
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,040
I'll tell the world

524
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,040
about Rong Jingfeng's evil deeds

525
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,200
and give the world justice.

526
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,840
I'm back this time

527
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,840
to celebrate Mei Ying.

528
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,640
I want her to pay for what she did.

529
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,840
Go.

530
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,440
Yu.

531
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,240
Is that you?

532
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,240
Yu.

533
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,840
I knew you were still alive.

534
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,640
I knew I could find you.

535
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,840
Yu.

536
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,040
Come out.

537
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,240
Come out.

538
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,640
Come out.

539
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,640
Yu.

540
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,240
I'm your wife.

541
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,640
The world is a desert,

542
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,040
and I'm lost in the dust.

543
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,440
I'm a painting.

544
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,240
Why won't you

545
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,640
meet me?

546
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,640
Yu.

547
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,040
Yu.

548
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,240
Yu.

549
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,440
Yu.

550
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,040
Yu.

551
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,240
I'm a laughing stock,

552
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,240
and I'm full of laughter.

553
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,040
Even if we're far apart,

554
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,240
we can't miss each other.

555
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,840
The shadow is just

556
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,040
a shadow of the past.

557
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,040
Do you really not want me?

558
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,240
Do you really not want me?

559
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,240
No.

560
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,840
I'm your little grandson.

561
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,840
I'm a painting.

562
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,240
I'm a painting.

563
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,240
I...

564
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,240
Don't want me anymore.

565
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,240
Don't want me anymore.

566
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,240
I'm tired too.

567
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,040
I'm really tired.

568
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,240
I'm a laughing stock,

569
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,240
and I'm full of laughter.

570
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,240
Since you don't want me anymore,

571
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,240
I don't have any meaning to live on.

572
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,240
Even if we're far apart,

573
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,240
we can't miss each other.

574
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,240
Goodbye.

575
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,240
Yu.

576
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,240
The shadow is just

577
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,240
a shadow of the past.

578
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,240
I'm a laughing stock,

579
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,240
and I'm full of laughter.

580
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,240
Since you don't want me anymore,

581
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,240
I don't have any meaning to live on.

582
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,240
I'm a painting.

583
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,240
I'm a painting.

584
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,240
I'm a painting.

585
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,240
I'm a painting.

586
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,240
I'm a painting.

587
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,240
I'm a painting.

588
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,240
I'm a painting.

589
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,240
I'm a painting.

590
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,240
There's a promise

591
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,240
to love you until the end of the night.

592
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,240
Let time wait for us to meet again.

593
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,240
I'm a laughing stock,

594
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,240
and I'm full of laughter.

595
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,240
Since you don't want me anymore,

596
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,240
I don't have any meaning to live on.

597
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,240
Since you don't want me anymore,

598
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,240
I don't have any meaning to live on.

599
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,240
I won't let you go again.

600
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,240
Since you don't want me anymore,

601
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,240
I won't let you go again.

602
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,240
I won't let you go again.

603
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,240
I know what you're thinking.

604
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,240
I know what you're thinking.

605
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,240
Since I'm treated like a normal person by you,

606
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,240
I haven't thought about running away.

607
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,240
Walk in front of me.

608
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,240
Why do I have to walk in front of you?

609
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,240
I'm afraid that when I turn around,

610
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,240
you'll disappear again.

611
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,240
I'm afraid that when I turn around,

612
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,240
you'll disappear again.

613
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,240
I'm afraid that when I turn around,

614
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,240
you'll disappear again.

615
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,240
You disappear again.

616
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,240
Walk in front of me.

617
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,240
Let me watch you.

618
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,240
Hold on tight.

619
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,240
If you let go,

620
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,240
and you can't find me,

621
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,240
don't cry.

622
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,240
Hold on tight.

623
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,240
Don't think about letting me go again.

624
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,240
Hua'er,

625
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,240
do you have a lot of things to ask me?

626
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,240
It doesn't matter.

627
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,240
It's more important that you can come back safely.

628
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,240
I don't care about anything else.

629
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,240
Do you want to ask

630
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,240
why I didn't want to see you

631
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,240
since I'm alive?

632
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,240
You must have your own difficulties.

633
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,240
It doesn't matter.

634
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,240
You don't want to say it,

635
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,240
so you don't have to say it now.

636
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,240
I'm not going to say it.

637
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,240
I'm going to tell you.

638
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,240
I'm going to tell you!

639
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,240
What is it?

640
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,240
Nan Lanyuan,

641
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,240
what's wrong?

642
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,240
I could not believe that everything was true.

643
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,240
I dreamed of the scenes

644
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,760
But after you woke up,

645
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,760
you disappeared.

646
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,120
I wish you were always by my side.

647
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,680
I wish you could stay with me for a while.

648
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,480
Don't leave so soon.

649
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,000
MAMA

650
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,200
I feel so good now.

651
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,160
You're back.

652
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,160
Confectionery Building

653
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,720
How come it isn't so bustling

654
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,680
since they are keeping us close to the university?

655
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,400
Even if my condition

656
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,240
goes to a dropped love,

657
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,600
I would get old

658
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,080
without seeing the response.

659
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,720
After so long,

660
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,920
you're finally back.

661
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,360
So everything was your doing.

662
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,880
You tried so hard to take over Lingxu Pavilion

663
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,000
and took the people of Lingxu Pavilion here.

664
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,720
What's your purpose?

665
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,640
People in Longyin City

666
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,480
have no one in mind.

667
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,040
Even my spiritual cult dares to break in.

668
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,080
How can they be afraid of my purpose?

669
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,320
You're willing to give up

670
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,040
for the sake of Tao Rongjing.

671
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,400
Have you ever thought

672
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,000
what would happen

673
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,600
if you fell into my hands?

674
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,800
Since I fell into your hands,

675
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,520
I didn't think of going back alive.

676
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,920
I'll kill you.

677
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,280
As you wish.

678
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,840
You've lived in Longyin City for so many years.

679
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,680
You haven't changed at all.

680
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,840
You're still so impulsive.

681
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,840
To be honest,

682
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,280
I can't stand to see you fight and kill.

683
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,520
Besides,

684
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,440
death is just a moment.

685
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,760
Only living people have the value to be used.

686
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,080
I have to spare your life

687
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,480
and accompany you.

688
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,640
Otherwise, I would be so boring.

689
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,800
What do you want?

690
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,920
If you want to be the enemy of Longyin City,

691
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,360
you can give me a pain now.

692
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,080
Why would your father

693
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,920
love your disheveled sister?

694
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,760
How can you be so stubborn

695
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,320
to win her heart?

696
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,080
No matter how much you do,

697
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,200
no matter how much you sacrifice,

698
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,920
you'll never get her attention.

699
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,520
For so many years,

700
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,240
I've been regretting my past experience.

701
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,440
No matter how hard I try,

702
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,120
you've always been on my side.

703
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,600
Mo Huan,

704
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,840
it's all your fault.

705
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,880
Even if you don't fight back,

706
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,120
I'll avenge my past.

707
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,760
You're so selfless.

708
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,000
Mo Huan,

709
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,520
don't try to get me any closer.

710
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,920
You've improved a lot

711
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
since you came back to Rong Jingfeng.

712
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:53,120
I've been taking care of you.

713
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,160
It seems that

714
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,120
it's a waste to keep you.

715
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,120
Why don't you just leave it here?

716
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,920
In case it gets out,

717
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,360
you'll lose my face.

718
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,480
No.

719
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,200
You'd better kill me yourself.

720
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,280
If you trust me,

721
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,640
I'll stay.

722
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,280
But you're a stubborn person.

723
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,600
You're the one who's been doing everything.

724
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:28,720
No.

725
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,960
You have enough strength to handle her,

726
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,040
no matter what happens.

727
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,400
Additionally,

728
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,040
you've seduced Zhi A While ago,

729
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,400
so you've been waiting for her.

730
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,440
If you're worried,

731
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,840
you shouldn't be with her.

732
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,920
You knew she was in the holy spread,

733
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:58,920
Besides,

734
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,960
Lord Ming wouldn't kill him.

735
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,720
He just used him to deal with Longyin City.

736
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,600
You don't know Lord Ming well enough.

737
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,200
That's right.

738
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,400
Rong Su wouldn't die.

739
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,960
But he would be worse than dead.

740
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,720
He asked for it.

741
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,120
I think you asked for it.

742
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,960
You're so insincere.

743
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,320
I just got a report

744
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,600
that Xuan Ye is taking the disciples of Longyin City

745
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,000
to attack our spiritual school.

746
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,520
He's wandering at the entrance.

747
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,440
I'm trying to tell you about it.

748
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,520
I have something else to deal with.

749
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,280
Please tell me.

750
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,680
Why did he torture me like this?

751
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,160
If he wants to destroy my martial arts,

752
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,600
he might as well kill me with one sword.

753
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,440
You want to be a simple person,

754
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,560
but I won't let you do as you wish.

755
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,080
When you become a real useless person,

756
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,920
I'll send someone to send you back to Longyin City.

757
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,520
By the way,

758
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,640
don't you always want to be valued by your father?

759
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,680
I think that's the only way

760
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,240
to let him let go of his guard against you.

761
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,480
Despicable!

762
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,280
Despicable?

763
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,760
Compared to your father's skills,

764
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,240
I'm not even three times as capable as him.

765
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,480
But I really want to see

766
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,160
how you will behave

767
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,760
when you return to Longyin City.

768
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,440
How will you

769
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,600
show your unwavering dignity?

770
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:27,760
I'm scared.

771
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,800
I will love you till the end of my life

772
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,200
I will love you till the end of my life

773
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:09,600
I will keep you in my heart for the rest of my life

774
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:13,000
I will live my life to the fullest

775
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,800
I will live my life to the fullest

776
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Love is a magical thing
