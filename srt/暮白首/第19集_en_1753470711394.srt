Episode 1

3
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Recently, the news of the loss of Longyin City

4
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
has been spreading in the Jianghu.

5
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Many sects are

6
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
investigating the truth.

7
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The disciples are a little worried.

8
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But if Longyin City knows

9
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
that the news was spread by our Xiao Xue Alliance,

10
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
they will take revenge on us.

11
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Since I dare to release the news,

12
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm ready to do anything.

13
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'll let you disciples do it.

14
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You just need to do it.

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's good for you to ask so many questions.

16
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yes.

17
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Is there really a problem with the Chihua Pearl of the Rong family?

18
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
How did Miss Liuli know about this?

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Are you not bored with living?

20
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I dare not.

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But the leader is not here.

22
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Xiao Xue Alliance also spread the news of the loss of the land.

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm afraid the leader will blame us.

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's because you disciples have no knowledge.

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So you still don't know

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
the status of the Jianghu.

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yes.

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I dare not compare with Miss Liuli.

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
But the night of the Longyin City

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
has been waiting at the gate for several days.

31
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
She's standing there with a face.

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It really affects our business.

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Night of the Longyin City?

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Buji.

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Let her wait.

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yes.

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Miss Rong left.

38
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
She took the heart of our granduncle.

39
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Listen to me.

40
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's a big deal.

41
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
No matter what happens,

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
you must be careful.

43
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yes.

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'll be careful.

45
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'll be careful.

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'll be careful.

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'll be careful.

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'll be careful.

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'll be careful.

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'll be careful.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
No matter what happens,

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'll be with you.

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I made a deal with her that day.

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
We'll go back together.

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
She left without saying goodbye today.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
There must be something she's been through.

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Since you've made a deal,

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
as her brother,

59
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'll bless you with my heart.

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I just want to ask you.

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I just don't understand.

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Why do you like

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
such a vicious woman?

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Of course.

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
In front of love,

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
nothing is clear.

67
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Right?

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I've been watching these days.

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Your relationship with Miss Rong

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
is getting better and better.

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Why are you so emotional?

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Is your relationship with her getting better?

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I mean,

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
are you not used to

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
being nice to others?

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Not used to being kind to others?

77
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Not used to being happy?

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You're really...

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You're so sour.

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
How old are you?

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You're still so childish.

82
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You're really like you to my father

83
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
when you're sad.

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm childish?

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You're saying I'm childish?

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Do you know who's childish?

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You're really childish.

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Smile.

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Why are you so sad?

90
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Smile.

91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Young Master.

92
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Young Master, you can't go in.

93
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Young Master.

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Young Master, you can't go in.

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You can't go in.

96
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
How did you get in?

97
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Miss Liuli.

98
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
We really can't stop her.

99
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Are you scared of the bear?

100
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
How dare you act like a fool in my Xiaoxue Alliance?

101
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So heavy.

102
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
This is the deposit.

103
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,980
After the

104
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
This is not a fortune.

105
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The rule of the Xiaoxue Alliance

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
is not to do the second business with the same customer.

107
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Moreover,

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Longyin City was the first to realize it.

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Your money,

110
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
we can't take it anymore.

111
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You can stay in our Xiaoxue Alliance for as long as you want.

112
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
But this business,

113
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
we can't do it.

114
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You,

115
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
take good care of this guest for me.

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yes.

117
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Young Master, let's go outside.

118
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Young Master, please.

119
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's not easy to find a place to grow up.

120
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You have to grow up quickly.

121
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Do you hear me?

122
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You are the same as me.

123
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You all came here from Longyin City.

124
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I didn't get used to it at first.

125
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I can't sleep well.

126
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But I got used to it slowly.

127
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So,

128
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
you have to face this kind of life slowly.

129
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And then,

130
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
grow up fast and well.

131
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You have to be more powerful than before.

132
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Do you hear me?

133
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Be good.

134
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Are you talking to them?

135
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What's wrong?

136
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Can't I?

137
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Yes.

138
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Of course.

139
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I've never heard anyone

140
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
talking to the flowers and grass that they planted for themselves.

141
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
They are not humans or little dogs or cats.

142
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
How can they hear you?

143
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Be quiet.

144
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Don't let them hear you.

145
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Don't let them hear you.

146
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Everything has a soul.

147
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
How can you tell that they can't hear you?

148
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Besides,

149
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
this is my secret recipe.

150
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
As long as you talk to them every day

151
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
and treat them like family,

152
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
you will grow up fast and well.

153
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
What are you looking at?

154
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I have something dirty on my face.

155
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Nothing.

156
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I just think

157
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
you look pretty good.

158
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You look good recently.

159
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You've changed a lot of food.

160
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Your face is much more round.

161
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Really?

162
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I really gained weight?

163
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You're such a big man.

164
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You lied to me.

165
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Okay, okay, okay.

166
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
No, no, no.

167
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm here to ask you

168
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
if you have any research

169
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
on the inner power of this wall.

170
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Of course.

171
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
These inner power methods

172
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
are very suitable for people with low physical quality.

173
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And with your guidance,

174
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I think I've improved a lot recently.

175
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Since you're praising yourself,

176
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
let's compete with your master.

177
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Let him see if you've improved.

178
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Let's compete.

179
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
That's all you've got?

180
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Looks like you need to practice more

181
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
after you get better.

182
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Your inner power

183
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
is totally different from before.

184
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Really?

185
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Mother, what's going on?

186
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Your body's energy

187
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
is being drained

188
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
because of the cold air in your body.

189
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So you can't

190
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
use your inner power for so many years.

191
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
But after practicing in the cave,

192
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
the several major energy in your body

193
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
have been connected.

194
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Really?

195
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Your palm

196
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
has been cold for ten years.

197
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
If it weren't for your luck,

198
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
you wouldn't be so mature.

199
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm afraid Yue'er

200
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
is already injured and bedridden.

201
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Let Madam see

202
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
if there's any internal injury left.

203
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I can't leave any internal injuries.

204
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm fine.

205
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
As long as you can move the gold,

206
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
even if it's just one palm,

207
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I can accept it.

208
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Don't talk nonsense.

209
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I don't want to hurt you.

210
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm not talking nonsense.

211
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Don't worry.

212
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm in good health.

213
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's okay.

214
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You can hurt me.

215
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Rong Hua,

216
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
go back and have a good rest.

217
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Keep practicing according to the new method.

218
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You'll definitely improve your inner power.

219
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Yes, thank you, Madam.

220
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm leaving.

221
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Yue'er, wait.

222
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'll show you the market.

223
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Mother, I'm fine.

224
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm worried that you'll leave a secret message.

225
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm leaving.

226
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Hua, I'll go find you later.

227
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Mother,

228
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
do you have anything to say to me?

229
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Yue'er,

230
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I hope you can make peace with Jingyuan.

231
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You and her are the blood of the Nalan family.

232
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I don't want to see

233
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
any grudge between you.

234
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm sorry.

235
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm sorry.

236
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm sorry.

237
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm sorry.

238
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm sorry.

239
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm sorry.

240
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Mother,

241
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'll be honest with you.

242
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
This time,

243
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Jingyuan wants to kill Rong Hua first.

244
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Unless Jingyuan

245
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
gives up on you,

246
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
otherwise,

247
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
it's impossible.

248
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Yue'er,

249
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
don't you understand your mother's painstaking effort?

250
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
That day,

251
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I risked the danger of Mo Huan to protect them.

252
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Why?

253
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Of course I understand your mother's painstaking effort.

254
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You did this

255
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
to protect the Nalan family,

256
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
and to form an alliance with them

257
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
to fight against the devil and the spirit cult.

258
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
If we can't work together,

259
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
it'll be more troublesome

260
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
and more troublesome.

261
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's good that you understand.

262
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So,

263
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
you must pull the trigger to subdue Jingyuan.

264
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I understand.

265
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You must pull the trigger to subdue Jingyuan.

266
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Don't forget that

267
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
the Nalan family

268
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
is not only our ally,

269
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
but also your blood relative.

270
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Alright.

271
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'll say yes.

272
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
When Jingyuan calms down,

273
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'll find a chance

274
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
to talk to her in person.

275
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Go.

276
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Greetings, spuns.

277
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Miss Yuan, what are you looking at?

278
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Did you see a shadow lighter fly just then?

279
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
A shadow litter?

280
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You must be wrong, Miss Yuan.

281
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,960
If there're birds flying

282
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,960
to Lingshu Pavilion Japanese Om sturgeon,

283
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,480
Miss Cheng just saw those flying pheasants, right?

284
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,080
I was wrong.

285
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,440
Goodbye.

286
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,600
I saw a person.

287
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,400
How could it be a flying bird?

288
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,440
Who are you?

289
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,520
This Lingxu Pavilion

290
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,800
is a bit of a lively scene.

291
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,280
The room is very warm.

292
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,800
Right, Rong Hua?

293
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,840
This person seems to be very familiar.

294
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,360
Why are you in my room?

295
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,080
I've always been in and out of Lingxu Pavilion.

296
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,880
I just got up and walked around.

297
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,720
Can't I?

298
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,560
So you're the new maid.

299
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,280
What's your name?

300
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,880
You're really

301
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,400
interesting.

302
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:26,960
What did you say?

303
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,120
Searching Villages

304
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,600
Remember these three Gr lyrics first.

305
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:35,720
The

306
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,640
Noble Consort.

307
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,360
I just realized

308
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,640
You little girl.

309
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,080
You should practice these three moves first

310
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,080
and use them in your own martial arts.

311
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,000
If you're smart and you can do it,

312
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,600
I can teach you a few more moves in the future.

313
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,680
Please wait.

314
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,720
Thank you for your advice.

315
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,880
How about having a cup of tea?

316
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,280
I just apologized to Li.

317
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,000
I wanted to ask you what you want to know.

318
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,920
I want to know all your Sugar Plum Puppiesaltson's family's opinions

319
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,360
and how you want to deal with her.

320
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,800
The Sun Bond is skinny.

321
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:37,220
Moonlight acupoints are

322
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,320
The dollar ordered.

323
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:40,960
Mr. Sun He Unit.

324
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,840
I was just talking about him by my own name.

325
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,840
I'll go to the basement.

326
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,840
You go back first.

327
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,040
Stay with Rong Hua.

328
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,640
I'll go with Rong Hua.

329
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,840
Why did you deliberately

330
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,840
fire her?

331
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,840
Don't you want her

332
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,840
to pay her respects

333
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,840
to you earlier?

334
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,840
Master.

335
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,840
Moreover,

336
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,840
your Lingxu Pavilion

337
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,840
will be under my command

338
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,840
sooner or later.

339
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,840
Master, you are here.

340
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,840
I didn't prepare in advance.

341
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,840
I'm sorry.

342
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,840
I didn't prepare in advance.

343
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,840
I was worried that Yue'er was not sensible

344
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,840
and disturbed Master's mood.

345
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,840
Actually,

346
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,840
you don't have to worry too much.

347
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,840
I came here

348
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,840
for nothing.

349
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,840
I just came to have a walk.

350
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,840
I saw Rong Hua just now.

351
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,840
That little girl

352
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,840
is much more interesting

353
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,840
than her elder sister.

354
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,840
Lingxu Pavilion doesn't have a young person.

355
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,840
If you are right,

356
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,840
someone must have entered the Lingxu Pavilion.

357
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,840
What's the characteristic of this person?

358
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,840
He really looks like a girl.

359
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,840
His martial arts is very good.

360
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,840
Tan Duwei is very old-fashioned.

361
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,840
But his appearance is not inferior to that of a princess.

362
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,840
What you described

363
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,840
is exactly the same as the person who pretended to be Mu Yan.

364
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,840
Could it be that the Mo Huan is here?

365
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,840
If it's really Mo Huan,

366
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,840
Lingxu Pavilion will be in big trouble.

367
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,840
You go and check it out.

368
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,840
Maybe he's still in the Pavilion.

369
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,840
I'm going now.

370
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,840
Brother, you came just in time.

371
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,840
I have something urgent to see my mother.

372
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,840
You take care of Hua'er for me.

373
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,840
Don't let anything happen to her.

374
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,840
What happened?

375
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,840
I don't have time to explain it to you.

376
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,840
I'll tell you later.

377
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,840
I have something to discuss with you.

378
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,840
What's the matter?

379
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,840
Hua'er is already a person of her own.

380
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,840
Say it.

381
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,840
I received news.

382
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,840
The leaders of the Jianghu are in a fight.

383
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,840
They are going to Longyin City to find Rong Jingfeng to discuss.

384
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,840
They found out that the flowers had been destroyed.

385
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,840
This matter is going on in the Jianghu.

386
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,840
I'm afraid it's not good for Longyin City.

387
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,840
I'm afraid it's hard to deal with Longyin City this time.

388
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,840
This matter spread so quickly.

389
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,840
The Chuhua Pillar is in a hurry.

390
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,840
It seems that Longyin City is in big trouble.

391
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,840
Hua'er, don't worry.

392
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,840
I will find out this matter.

393
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,840
Now, Lingxu Pavilion will be in big trouble.

394
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,840
And this big trouble

395
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,840
is likely to be bad for you.

396
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,840
I'll go and solve this first.

397
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,840
You go quickly.

398
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,840
Don't worry.

399
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,840
I'll go.

400
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,840
Brother Lu,

401
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,840
what news did you find?

402
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,840
When will the elders leave?

403
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,840
Will it be hard for Longyin City?

404
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,840
I don't know if Su'er left in a hurry

405
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,840
because of this.

406
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,840
Actually, Brother Lu knows it clearly.

407
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,840
Sister left this time

408
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,840
for Longyin City.

409
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,840
You...

410
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,840
No matter what the reason is,

411
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,840
she made a choice.

412
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,840
Since she has made up her mind,

413
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,840
let's stop here.

414
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,840
Actually, Sister and Brother Lu are the same.

415
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,840
You will stand up for Lingxu Pavilion.

416
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,840
Sister just can't let Longyin City go.

417
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,840
Since we are both concerned about each other,

418
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,840
how can we force each other?

419
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,840
By the way, Brother Lu,

420
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,840
did you bring the things you brought for me last time?

421
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,840
I will do my best

422
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,840
when you ask me to do.

423
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,840
Thank you, Brother Lu.

424
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,840
Thank you for going to the cave with me.

425
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,840
Let's go.

426
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,840
Yue'er.

427
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,840
Don't be rude.

428
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,840
Mohua, you broke into my Lingxu Pavilion

429
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,840
several times.

430
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,840
What do you mean?

431
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,840
When will you decide

432
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,840
about this Lingxu Pavilion?

433
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,840
It's not a place for you to come and go.

434
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,840
Master.

435
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,840
Forget it.

436
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,840
I will go.

437
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,840
I will go.

438
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,840
I will go.

439
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,840
I will go.

440
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,840
Just take it as I was

441
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,840
fighting with my disciple Sun.

442
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,840
Don't mind it.

443
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,840
We had fought before.

444
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,840
I didn't expect that in a few days,

445
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,840
your martial arts have improved.

446
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,840
Master.

447
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,840
I don't know your identity.

448
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,840
I'm rude.

449
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,840
Please don't mind it.

450
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,840
Today, you suddenly visited me.

451
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,840
If you haven't prepared in advance,

452
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,840
I will order someone to prepare some dishes

453
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,840
and have a drink with you.

454
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,840
In Longyin City,

455
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,840
I didn't know your identity

456
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,840
and mistook you for a few brothers.

457
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,840
I didn't mean to take advantage of you.

458
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,840
If you want to blame me

459
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,840
and make trouble for my mother,

460
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,840
you can just blame me.

461
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,840
I will do what I have to do.

462
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,840
A person who doesn't know is not guilty.

463
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,840
It's also my fault

464
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,840
for hiding my identity well in advance.

465
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,840
How can I blame my disciple Sun?

466
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,840
Right?

467
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,840
Actually,

468
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,840
I'm not here

469
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,840
for any important thing.

470
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,840
I just want to

471
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,840
see Rong Hua.

472
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,840
The wedding of the young master of Lingxu Pavilion

473
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,840
will be held in a lively way.

474
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,840
But there are always

475
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,840
happy and sad events.

476
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,840
I'm afraid Longyin City

477
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,840
will be in a bad shape.

478
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,840
Maybe at that time,

479
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,840
the wedding and the wedding ceremony

480
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,840
will be held together.

481
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,840
I think the master

482
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,840
likes to have fun.

483
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,840
Longyin City is in trouble.

484
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,840
The lucky one

485
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,840
may not be me.

486
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,840
I'm sorry for you.

487
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,840
You just got married.

488
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,840
You will go back to Longyin City

489
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,840
with Rong Hua

490
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,840
in a few days.

491
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,840
I don't know

492
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,840
how sad she will be.

493
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,840
In that case,

494
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,840
I'll ask my mother

495
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,840
to write a letter

496
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,840
to let Rong Hua

497
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,840
give up all her family properties.

498
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,840
I'm sorry.

499
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,840
I'm sorry.

500
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,840
I'm sorry.

501
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,840
I'm sorry.

502
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,840
Please take a rest

503
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,840
in the room.

504
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,840
The master is here too.

505
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,840
You haven't been together for so long.

506
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,840
It's wonderful

507
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,840
to get married

508
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,840
to the master.

509
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,840
Then,

510
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,840
anyone who gets angry

511
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,840
is your disciple.

512
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,840
You will not

513
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,840
ignore it.

514
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,840
Am I right, old man?

515
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,840
Your mother adores you.

516
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,640
She is willing to let you do whatever you want.

517
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,640
But as your teacher,

518
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,840
I must be strict with you.

519
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,720
You will know in the future

520
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,480
that you will have to pay double the price

521
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,120
if you keep talking about it.

522
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,680
If you want to be happy for the rest of your life,

523
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,440
you must hold on to the weapon in your hand.

524
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,520
If you don't even have the ability to protect yourself,

525
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,080
you can't even be a good teacher.

526
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,680
You don't even have the ability to protect yourself.

527
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,480
Why are you talking about protecting others?

528
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,160
As your teacher,

529
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,080
I must be strict with you.

530
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,480
I'm going to Longyin City to have some fun.

531
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,080
By the way,

532
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,640
doesn't Rong Jingfeng know that

533
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,600
the

534
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,320
descendant of the Nalan family is the one who is responsible for the death of the Japs?

535
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,320
I want to think about

536
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,320
who should tell him the truth.

537
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,640
Mohua,

538
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,440
you are threatening me.

539
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,960
Just tell me what you want to do.

540
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,160
It's such a lively thing.

541
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,440
Don't you want to take a look?

542
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,760
Her painting is still 반차 curves.

543
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,360
You should learn about this.

544
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,440
Mother,

545
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,760
what did Mohua want to do?

546
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,240
Neither of us knows

547
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,320
what Mohua has in mind.

548
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,920
We will have to strengthen the defense,

549
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,080
and pay much attention to Ronghua's side.

550
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,240
After all, I have a share in destroying Longyin City.

551
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,840
It's the Chihua Pearl seed.

552
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:44,960
Yes.

553
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,400
The Chihua Pearl is cold.

554
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,480
It couldn't grow in the south.

555
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,640
Yue and I found it by accident.

556
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,680
We wanted to try it.

557
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,880
But it's really sprouted.

558
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,040
So,

559
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,680
even if the Longyin City flowers are buried,

560
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,080
the Chihua Pearl in your body

561
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,240
won't have any effect, right?

562
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,120
The clinging of the Chihua Pearl is very special.

563
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,640
It takes one or two years

564
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,480
for the flowers to bloom.

565
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,960
I'm afraid you're afraid of the seed

566
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,360
to grow.

567
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,880
But I've thought of another way.

568
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,200
Whether it works or not,

569
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,400
I'd better try it first.

570
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,760
Is the ice crystal

571
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,840
you asked me to bring back from the north

572
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,280
from the Young Master?

573
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,440
It's used here?

574
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:31,800
Here.

575
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,920
Miss Long is weak.

576
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,120
Let me take her.

577
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,760
Let me do it.

578
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,040
The Chihua Pearl

579
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,600
In the future,

580
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,880
I have to trouble Brother Lu

581
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,960
to take care of it.

582
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:39,960
If you find any symptoms of a

583
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,160
withered tail,

584
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,080
you should use the ice crystal to nourish it.

585
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,800
Don't slack off.

586
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:46,960
Me?

587
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,920
I don't agree with this.

588
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,560
I have to go back

589
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,840
if something happens to Longyin City.

590
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,640
You can't be here.

591
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,120
Don't worry.

592
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,640
I'll be careful

593
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,760
when I go back this time.

594
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,800
I won't make any trouble.

595
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,800
It's too dangerous for you to go back alone.

596
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,120
I told you.

597
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:10,960
I don't agree.

598
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,560
We can't discuss this.

599
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,120
You just used a lot of energy

600
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,320
to break the ice crystal.

601
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,040
Drink the ginseng tea.

602
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,280
We can enjoy

603
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,560
some things.

604
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,400
With the current situation in Longyin City,

605
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,360
do you know how many dangers

606
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,040
you'll encounter on your way back?

607
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,400
Even if you happen to go back to Longyin City,

608
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,240
how many disputes and dangers

609
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,480
are waiting for you

610
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:34,960
in Longyin City?

611
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,960
Do you know that?

612
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,760
I know.

613
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,160
No matter how hard it is to go back to the city,

614
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,840
I must go back.

615
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,960
Longyin City is in danger.

616
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,800
My family is there.

617
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,960
I can't just stand by

618
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,960
and watch them in danger

619
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,960
and let them go.

620
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,960
I can't do it

621
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,160
if I'm not careful enough.

622
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,280
Rong Hua.

623
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,240
I'm not asking you to go back.

624
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,560
I just hope you can give me more time.

625
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,960
I'll think of a better way.

626
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,960
I'll accompany you

627
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,960
to Longyin City

628
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,960
after I'm done.

629
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,960
But it's a long journey.

630
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,560
I...

631
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,960
Just trust me.

632
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,560
I'll think of a way

633
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,960
to make it happen.

634
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,160
I trust you.

635
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,960
I'm afraid that Mohan

636
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,960
will tell my father about your true identity.

637
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,360
I'm afraid that Longyin City

638
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,560
won't let you go.

639
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,960
I don't want to see you in danger.

640
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,360
I don't want Longyin City

641
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,360
and Lingxu Pavilion to be in danger.

642
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,960
Rong Hua.

643
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,360
Longyin City was surrounded

644
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,560
by various sects.

645
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,360
Someone manipulated it.

646
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,760
Even if you go back,

647
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,160
you can't change anything.

648
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,360
I'm not not worried about Longyin City's life and death.

649
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,160
But it's a big deal.

650
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,360
I have to discuss with my mother

651
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,760
a solution.

652
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:52,760
But...

653
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,560
Enough.

654
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,560
No matter what you say or do now,

655
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,160
I won't allow you to go back to Longyin City alone.

656
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,960
If I show up now,

657
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,760
she'll guess that I'll leave without permission.

658
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,560
I won't be able to leave again.

659
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,360
Forget it.

660
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,960
When I've solved Longyin City,

661
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,160
I'll come back to apologize to you.

662
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,560
vont- tipping

663
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,560
Haier.

664
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,360
Do I really mean it to you?

665
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,160
I told you not to organisation and leave without permission!

666
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:30,620
Mother of

667
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,680
drive

668
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:35,360
play

669
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,520
southern

670
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,960
I had to choose to leave without a notice.

671
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,960
It's not his fault.

672
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,560
Mother,

673
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,200
you also think it's my fault?

674
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,520
The reason I got angry

675
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,320
is because he didn't know

676
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,680
how capable he was.

677
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,920
He was so eager

678
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,640
to go back.

679
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,800
What's wrong with Rongyin City?

680
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,560
They're not taking care of the family.

681
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,440
If he goes back,

682
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,520
what else can he do except to die?

683
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,240
You're both right.

684
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,960
It's because they care about each other.

685
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,960
They forget about themselves.

686
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,600
Yu'er,

687
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,800
I understand

688
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,960
what you're thinking.

689
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,800
Lingxu Pavilion will continue to arrange a wedding for you.

690
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,200
When he comes back,

691
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,920
I'll make the decision for you.

692
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,640
I don't know

693
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,880
what will happen on the way.

694
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,440
I think he

695
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,200
will fall into Rongyin City safely.

696
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,960
What...

697
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,360
You're

698
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,280
just a stubborn person.

699
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,600
If so,

700
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,040
why did you send so many people

701
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,160
to follow you secretly?

702
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,600
Mother,

703
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,600
you know it all.

704
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,320
Don't worry.

705
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,720
I've arranged the people in the Pavilion.

706
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,840
I won't make it difficult for him.

707
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,400
Ronghua knows

708
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,600
that he can't not go back

709
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,040
to Rongyin City.

710
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,640
No one can stop him.

711
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,400
Yu'er,

712
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,960
if you want to cherish someone,

713
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,400
you should do it instead of stopping him.

714
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,600
You

715
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,080
just need to protect each other.

716
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,400
I understand, mother.

717
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,080
Mother,

718
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:37,840
I...

719
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,640
Mother,

720
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,440
are you worried

721
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,480
about what Mohuan said?

722
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,720
Mohuan is not that simple.

723
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,320
He didn't tell the world about it.

724
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,320
Does he really want

725
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,600
all the sects to surround Rongyin City?

726
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,440
I still don't understand.

727
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,080
It won't be that simple.

728
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,400
We need to be more careful.

729
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,680
I understand.

730
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,000
Mother,

731
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,840
you must take care of yourself.

732
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,320
Don't worry too much.

733
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,520
Yu'er,

734
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,320
you're the one I'm most worried about.

735
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,160
Who is it?

736
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,600
Who is it?

737
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,840
Who is there?

738
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,360
Come out.

739
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,720
I'm not afraid of you.

740
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,400
You're not that capable

741
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,880
but you're quite bold.

742
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,120
You actually ran away from home.

743
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,160
If my mother didn't

744
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:58,680
how could you

745
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,160
get out of the gate so easily?

746
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,880
I'm out now.

747
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,080
Don't worry about me.

748
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,960
Go back.

749
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,080
I'm going back?

750
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,920
What about you?

751
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,240
I'm going back to Rongyin City.

752
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,920
I'll be back before the wedding.

753
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,200
Think about it.

754
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,560
Since I'm here,

755
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,840
why don't we go together

756
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,160
or go back together?

757
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,240
You...

758
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,680
Don't be like this.

759
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,160
Think about it.

760
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,400
Forget it.

761
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,240
Just take it as you're here to enjoy the moon.

762
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,000
Go back.

763
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:31,960
What's wrong?

764
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:33,960
Didn't you say I'd decide

765
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,000
whether to go back or go back?

766
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,080
I've already figured out

767
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,560
what you're thinking.

768
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,720
Just take it as a practice.

769
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:41,840
But

770
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,160
let's make it clear in advance.

771
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,680
You have to protect my safety.

772
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,000
If anything happens,

773
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,160
you have to be in my way.

774
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,360
What about me?

775
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,680
All the way,

776
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,480
I'll just follow you.

777
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,840
All right.

778
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,280
I'll protect your safety.

779
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,360
But you have to be good.

780
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,360
If Mohan tells my father

781
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,880
about your true identity,

782
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,320
I won't protect you.

783
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,400
Don't worry.

784
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,960
I won't let Mohan succeed.

785
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,520
Rongyin City is your home.

786
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,600
How can I ignore it?

787
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,640
My mother secretly sent

788
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,200
a disciple of Lin Xiuge to pick me up this time.

789
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,720
Let's be careful.

790
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,120
Once we solve the crisis in Rongyin City,

791
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,440
we'll be back.

792
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,440
We'll be back soon.

793
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,440
Okay. Let's go.

794
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,440
Let's go.

795
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,440
You'd better walk in front of me.

796
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,440
A gentleman's words are hard to follow.

797
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,440
Hard to follow.

798
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,440
Welcome, City Leader.

799
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,440
Please rise.

800
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,440
Please take a seat.

801
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,440
Bai, let's go.

802
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,440
Okay.

803
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,440
We're here to give you a good lesson.

804
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,440
We don't have to make it hard for you.

805
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,440
But no matter what,

806
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,440
today,

807
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,440
you must give us eight leaders

808
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,440
a satisfactory answer.

809
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,440
Only then can we feel at ease.

810
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,440
Yes.

811
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,440
Since we got the Chihua Bead,

812
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,440
we've been working for Longyin City.

813
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,440
If the rumor is true,

814
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,440
we'll have no antidote

815
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,440
for this year's poisonous attack.

816
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,440
I hope you can tell us

817
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,440
if the flower sea is safe.

818
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,440
Leaders,

819
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,440
you should know that

820
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,440
this is just a rumor.

821
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,440
The Chihua Bead

822
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,440
is the only person who can kill Longyin City.

823
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,440
There must be some people

824
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,440
who are very thoughtful

825
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,440
to spread such false news.

826
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,440
Maybe they're using this opportunity

827
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,440
to find out what's going on in our flower sea

828
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,440
and steal our Chihua Bead.

829
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,440
Leaders,

830
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,440
you're all well-educated.

831
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,440
How could you be fooled

832
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,440
by such a big trap?

833
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,440
If it's true,

834
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,440
Longyin City is safe.

835
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,440
Can you arrange

836
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,440
a leader to go to the flower sea?

837
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,440
As for who will go in,

838
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,440
and how,

839
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,440
it's up to you.

840
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,440
After all, the rumors in the world

841
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,440
are making people worried.

842
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,440
In this case,

843
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,440
we can break the rumor

844
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,440
and save Longyin City.

845
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,440
What do you think, City Leader?

846
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,440
You're right.

847
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,440
In this way,

848
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,440
we can be safe

849
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:28,440
and break the rumor.

850
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,240
The

851
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,440
The

852
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,440
The

853
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,440
The

854
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,440
The

855
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,440
The

856
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,440
The

857
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,440
The

858
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,440
The

859
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,440
The

860
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,440
The

861
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,440
The

862
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,440
The

863
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,440
The

864
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,440
The

865
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,440
The

866
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,440
The

867
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,440
The

868
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,440
The

869
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:08,440
The

870
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:14,440
I'm willing to sing and dance, and sing and dance.

871
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,440
Who can tell?

872
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:20,440
I love you with all my heart.

873
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:24,440
I have enough affection for you.

874
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:29,440
I have no hatred for you.

875
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,440
If love is not a dream, then a smile is.

876
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,440
If love is not a dream, then a promise is.

877
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,440
If love is not a dream, then a smile is.

878
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,440
And a promise.

879
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:42,440
I love you with all my heart.

880
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:46,440
I hope time can tell.

881
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:53,440
I will follow you wherever you go.

882
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:59,440
Love, just like that.
