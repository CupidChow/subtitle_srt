1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,800
OK...

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We are in love

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
A moment of flowers, a moment of love

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I've never been without you

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You don't understand

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
How much love I have

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm in love with flowers

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:12,440
Is a shore

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Fortunately the ashes are notable

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,960
Anmai Pond

11
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,880
Master.

12
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,880
and act impulsively.

13
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,880
Maybe the City Leader has made a decision

14
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,880
about yesterday.

15
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,480
Why don't we wait

16
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,880
and see if we can bump into the City Leader?

17
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,880
The disciples of Kong Si Tang who were on patrol last night

18
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,280
were all punished severely.

19
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:02,880
Yes.

20
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,680
I checked the fate book last night

21
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,680
and found that the murderer's order of action

22
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,680
was in the order of moving forward from the back

23
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,880
and killing people at once.

24
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,880
In this way,

25
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,880
the next target of the murderer

26
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,080
is the Xiao Sect.

27
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,880
In a hurry,

28
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,680
I took someone to save him.

29
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,080
I didn't expect that...

30
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,480
I hope you can understand.

31
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:30,880
I

32
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,880
secretly checked the route of the Xiao Sect

33
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,680
and disguised myself as the Xiao Sect.

34
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,880
I want to use this method

35
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,680
to find out the real murderer as soon as possible.

36
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,880
So your purpose

37
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,880
is so simple?

38
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,880
I think Mo Huan

39
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,880
was one of the top masters of the time.

40
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,880
More than ten years ago,

41
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,480
the heroes of our Longyin City

42
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,280
and the heroes of the martial arts world

43
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,680
attacked the chief altar of the spiritual cult together.

44
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,480
How many heroes died at that time

45
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,480
to only defeat Mo Huan severely.

46
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,280
But today,

47
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,280
you, Young Master Lin,

48
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,280
are alone

49
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,680
and can come back from Mo Huan

50
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,680
alive.

51
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,280
I wonder what the origin

52
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,080
of Young Master Lin is.

53
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,880
Dad,

54
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,480
how can you say that?

55
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,080
City Leader,

56
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,680
you think too much.

57
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,880
Lin Jing did that

58
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,680
for the safety of Longyin City.

59
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,280
Dad said that

60
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,680
he was afraid that people would gossip about him

61
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,680
if he was exposed.

62
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,880
Nonsense.

63
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,480
City Leader,

64
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,480
I'm afraid

65
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,080
I'll stay in Longyin City

66
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,880
for a few more days.

67
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,080
Dad.

68
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,080
Stud,

69
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,080
with all my downfall,

70
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,080
I cannot process it.

71
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,080
Don't you know

72
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,880
the unrequited love

73
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,280
and affection

74
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,080
of your parents?

75
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,680
Who's that?

76
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,240
and get rid of the bulls.

77
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,720
None of your business.

78
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,720
I'm done.

79
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,120
You're not going to attack.

80
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,280
You're so mean.

81
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,640
Actually,

82
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,040
Lin Jing didn't mean to break into the Confucius Hall.

83
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,320
He wanted to catch the murderer for Longyin City

84
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,200
to prove his innocence.

85
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,840
You look so sad today.

86
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,440
All right.

87
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,440
You know,

88
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,320
girls always frown.

89
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,560
You don't need to frown.

90
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,720
Just vent out your displeasure.

91
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,520
We just had a fight.

92
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,720
You're not angry anymore.

93
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,000
You look much better now.

94
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,760
I've never been afraid of anyone in Longyin City.

95
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,160
But today,

96
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,120
I've seen how good you are.

97
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,760
You're so good at reciting scriptures.

98
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,360
I'm so happy to see you.

99
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,440
As long as you can smile,

100
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,000
nothing is impossible.

101
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,640
And...

102
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:00,760
Sorry.

103
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,360
I mentioned something I shouldn't have.

104
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,440
I guess you know

105
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,520
the murderer is Mo Huan.

106
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,080
I'm not slandering you.

107
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,200
I'm just a little bit worried.

108
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,640
It's all right.

109
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,640
Actually, I was kidnapped by Mo Huan when I was a kid.

110
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,000
Then he kept me by his side.

111
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,600
Ten years ago,

112
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,680
the military attacked Lin's clan and hurt Mo Huan.

113
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,760
The City Leader knew I was still alive

114
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,000
and took me back to Longyin City.

115
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,160
But as I grew up in Lin's clan,

116
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,920
I was taken by Mo Huan.

117
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,320
So these years,

118
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,800
the City Leader has been very kind to me.

119
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,280
Ziyan is fine.

120
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,840
Bai Weizhi is fine, too.

121
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,680
They're just like you.

122
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,280
They only have Rong Hua in their eyes.

123
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,920
Thank you for your hard work these years.

124
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,360
I didn't expect that the most I wanted to hear

125
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,240
was from someone who was in love with me.

126
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,960
I think you're too sensitive.

127
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,920
After all, blood is thicker than water.

128
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,400
No father loves his daughter.

129
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,240
Maybe he just doesn't know how to express it.

130
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,000
Actually, I...

131
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,320
Since I was a kid,

132
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,640
Mrs. Lin has raised me

133
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,760
and raised me up.

134
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,600
I always think Lin Jing is more spoiled.

135
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,360
But when I grew up,

136
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,760
I realized that Mrs. Lin was strict with me

137
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,600
and helped me grow up.

138
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,360
So,

139
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,200
don't think too much.

140
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,280
My daughter ordinary.

141
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,840
Young and beautiful.

142
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,560
You're a middle-aged gentleman.

143
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,400
Greetings, City Leader.

144
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,760
Greetings, Father.

145
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,720
City Leader.

146
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,520
All of you, get up.

147
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,320
I saw 맙白了,

148
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,480
you're upset andimpressed today.

149
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,080
Call us here to say something.

150
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,280
I, Bai Weizhi...

151
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
You're on the tea.

152
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:01,920
I, Bai Weizhi,

153
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,560
officially...

154
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,480
officially become a master.

155
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,480
Please come to my laozi hall

156
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,760
and teach our disciples.

157
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,080
Is...

158
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,840
Is it...

159
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:20,880
Master,

160
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,600
let's really let this kid

161
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,120
get angry and go to Longyin City.

162
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,640
Didn't you find that the City Leader has agreed?

163
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,400
They must have

164
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,200
passed the test in secret.

165
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,160
This time,

166
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,320
Rong Hua is determined to let Lin Jing

167
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,400
stay in Longyin City.

168
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,760
We should let him go.

169
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,400
Subscribe.

170
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,400
Alright.

171
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,480
High profilewan.

172
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,960
Fire.

173
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,320
Palace Boss.

174
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,160
Why do you think Lin Jing has messed things up here?

175
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,360
What are you thinking?

176
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,320
Have you ever thought

177
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,640
why did Lin Jing body

178
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,480
come to the side

179
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,400
if he is so snug?

180
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,920
I deliberately let her go

181
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,480
so that she could succeed

182
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,360
and let her

183
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,280
reveal everything behind the scenes.

184
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,160
Being able to fight against Mo Huan

185
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,240
is a test for her

186
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,800
in Longyin City.

187
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,560
If she can really survive,

188
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,200
it means

189
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,200
she is capable.

190
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,240
Now the spirit is coming back.

191
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,360
If we can keep her in the city

192
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,520
and use her as we do,

193
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,880
that will be a boost

194
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,640
for Longyin City.

195
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,320
You are well-prepared

196
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,480
and have a good plan.

197
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,240
I admire you.

198
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,240
Come on.

199
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,320
Lin Jing.

200
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,160
Sorry for making you suffer.

201
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,920
But it's really hard for you to keep your wife's order.

202
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,920
Thank you, Hall Leader Rong.

203
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,520
You're welcome.

204
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,240
I'm so glad

205
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,360
that Hall Leader Rong said he owed you.

206
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,040
Now that it's done,

207
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,160
please leave Longyin City as soon as possible.

208
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,560
Of course.

209
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,000
Congratulations, Master. You're finally in the hospital.

210
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,280
Master made a promise to you

211
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,280
that he would arrest Young Master in a month

212
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,440
and then he would be released.

213
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,080
We're really worried about you.

214
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,880
But don't let him go.

215
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,920
Otherwise, he will run away.

216
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,440
You must go back to the palace before the wedding.

217
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,040
Yes.

218
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:18,960
What's that sound?

219
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:19,960
Stop!

220
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,240
Open it.

221
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,680
Why is it you?

222
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,000
How would I know?

223
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,920
I'll be caught if I sleep.

224
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:36,840
What...

225
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,040
What is this place?

226
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,960
Lu Yi Zhou is not stupid.

227
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,640
He will soon find out that he caught the wrong person.

228
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,720
It's all your bad ideas.

229
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,480
My master will take the blame for you.

230
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,560
How is it my bad idea?

231
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,800
It's all Bai's own wish.

232
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,680
It has nothing to do with me.

233
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,240
I don't know if it's right or wrong

234
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,480
to be in the palace.

235
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,760
You don't know that?

236
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,440
Actually, this time

237
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,920
I'm helping Bai.

238
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,640
Every word you say is true.

239
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,240
I don't believe it.

240
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,800
Why is it true?

241
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,320
It's true.

242
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,960
You're finally back.

243
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,000
It hurts.

244
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,520
It hurts.

245
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,080
It hurts.

246
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,640
It hurts.

247
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,240
It hurts.

248
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:36,840
It hurts.

249
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,440
It hurts.

250
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,040
It hurts.

251
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,640
It hurts.

252
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,240
It hurts.

253
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:39,840
It hurts.

254
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,440
It hurts.

255
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,040
It hurts.

256
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,640
It hurts.

257
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,240
It hurts.

258
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,640
You know it hurts?

259
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,640
I think you're the most ignorant.

260
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,840
You're always with some little guys.

261
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,240
And you're so ridiculous to be a teacher.

262
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,640
Well,

263
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,640
I'm a man of humbleness.

264
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,640
I'm wronged.

265
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,640
I'm a teacher.

266
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,360
That's to make him stay in Longyin City

267
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,640
with a clear conscience.

268
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,240
You're a good student.

269
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,440
You're a good student.

270
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,240
As the Hall Leader,

271
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,840
I have to do my duty.

272
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,040
I can't stay with Hua.

273
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,240
So,

274
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,640
I can't be worried

275
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,240
if she's not good enough.

276
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,840
I didn't expect

277
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,040
you're so thoughtful.

278
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:20,840
Well,

279
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,640
of course.

280
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,240
I...

281
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,040
You always underestimate me.

282
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:26,840
Actually,

283
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,640
I'm always like this.

284
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,440
Where are you going?

285
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,840
Lin Jing Shu's bitter meat is really effective.

286
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,240
I'm really not beaten by him.

287
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,440
It's really not worth it.

288
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,240
What's your excuse?

289
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,440
Lin Jing,

290
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,640
what's the excuse?

291
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,440
How can you be so kind to him?

292
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,640
And you even made medicine for him.

293
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,640
If the City Leader knows,

294
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,040
I'll be so mad that I'll lose my life.

295
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,640
Why are you calling my father?

296
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,440
My Lady.

297
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,840
I feel sorry for you.

298
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,240
It's really sweet.

299
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,240
I can't stop eating.

300
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,040
My Lady,

301
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,240
what's so good about Lin Jing?

302
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:36,840
He's good at everything.

303
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,240
He's good at everything.

304
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,840
You must find out

305
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,440
where Lin Jing comes from.

306
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,640
What's his family like?

307
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,840
Where does he live?

308
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,040
Are his parents still around?

309
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,240
Most importantly,

310
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,840
is he sincere to you?

311
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,040
Come on.

312
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,440
What are you talking about?

313
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,240
Master Zi Yan taught me all these.

314
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,640
Come on, help me.

315
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,240
He's afraid you'll suffer.

316
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,640
So he asked me to warn you.

317
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,640
And didn't Lu say

318
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,040
Lin Jing has an engagement in his hometown?

319
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,040
He's here to find him

320
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,840
to pick him up for the wedding.

321
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,640
Hurry up and send the medicine.

322
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,840
Go.

323
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,640
Oh, no.

324
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,640
My Lady is in a deep state.

325
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,840
I can't pull myself out.

326
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,240
Xiao Xiao.

327
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,440
I know.

328
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,240
Yeah.

329
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,240
He has a fiancee waiting for him.

330
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,440
What are you going to do?

331
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,840
I'll tell you the truth.

332
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,840
Aren't you worried at all?

333
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:39,840
My Lady...

334
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,640
Although my mother has been

335
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,840
hiding her illness from me all these years,

336
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,440
I've already figured out

337
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,840
what's going on.

338
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,840
I really didn't expect

339
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,840
it to be so serious.

340
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,840
In that case,

341
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,440
why don't you go back with me?

342
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,040
Are you really going to stay here

343
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,440
with that Miss Rong?

344
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,040
You have to separate

345
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,040
your love life.

346
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,440
So that's what I left in your heart.

347
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,040
Anyway, this marriage

348
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,240
has no room for change.

349
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,640
You don't have to argue with me.

350
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,640
Actually, I came to Longyin City

351
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,440
for two things.

352
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,040
The first thing

353
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,440
you must have known

354
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,840
is for my father.

355
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,840
All these years,

356
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,240
my mother never

357
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,840
mentioned my father to me.

358
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,240
I didn't even know

359
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,440
what my father called me

360
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,840
or what he did before he died.

361
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,240
But one time,

362
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,040
I overheard my mother say

363
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,440
my father had a big relationship

364
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,840
with Longyin City.

365
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,440
So I decided

366
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,040
to come to Longyin City

367
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,040
and find out what happened to my father.

368
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,840
I'm sorry.

369
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,440
I'm sorry.

370
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,840
I'm sorry.

371
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,040
The second thing

372
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,040
is my mother's illness.

373
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,640
If there's another way

374
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,440
to cure my mother,

375
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,440
I'll have to

376
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,840
go to the hospital.

377
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,440
Since ancient times,

378
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,040
heroes are sadder than beauties.

379
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,840
It's a pity that

380
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,440
the Mei family is poor.

381
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,040
It's a pity.

382
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,240
It's a pity.

383
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,040
You little brat.

384
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,840
Take your medicine.

385
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,440
Take it.

386
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,440
You...

387
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,040
When you're practicing,

388
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,040
you can't rush.

389
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,240
Since you're holding it,

390
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,240
you have to take it as part of your body.

391
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,640
Only when you make a move like this

392
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,640
can you flow freely.

393
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,840
You haven't fully recovered yet.

394
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,040
You can't rush.

395
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,240
Give me back my sword.

396
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:51,840
No.

397
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,640
What's wrong?

398
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,240
What's wrong with you?

399
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,440
Who's bothering you?

400
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,440
What's wrong?

401
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,640
Miss Mei.

402
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,240
It seems that Xiao Xiao

403
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,640
has told you everything

404
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,240
about the eavesdropping.

405
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,240
This wedding

406
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,440
was originally arranged by my mother

407
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,440
and the Mei family.

408
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,840
It has nothing to do with me.

409
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,640
Besides,

410
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,040
what's the point of making an arrangement?

411
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,440
In my life,

412
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,440
I will never marry

413
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,440
a woman I don't like.

414
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,640
Even if Miss Mei wants to marry,

415
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,840
the person who marries her

416
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,440
will be a week away.

417
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,640
This is your personal matter.

418
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,440
Why are you telling me, an outsider?

419
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,640
How can you say that?

420
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,440
Xiao Xiao,

421
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,440
you're not a man.

422
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,440
You're a man.

423
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,440
You're a man.

424
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,040
I'm an outsider, Xiao Tu Sun.

425
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,640
What you said is wrong.

426
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,040
There's a saying, how to say it?

427
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,640
A man should be a man for a day,

428
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,640
and a woman for a lifetime.

429
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,240
I'm your master,

430
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,040
Xiao Tu Sun.

431
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,440
Master.

432
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,040
Grandfather Master.

433
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,640
This marriage is what you can return

434
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,040
and change if you want to?

435
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,640
What you said

436
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,240
will ruin your life.

437
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,440
Xiao Tu Sun.

438
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,040
You're wrong again.

439
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,640
If Miss Mei

440
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,640
chooses a woman who doesn't love her

441
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,440
to be with her,

442
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,240
that will really ruin her life.

443
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,440
Besides,

444
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,640
all the grudges

445
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,040
in the world

446
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,240
are caused by this.

447
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,840
I, Lin Jing,

448
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,240
will never be a good man

449
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,240
and be a bad man.

450
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,240
You...

451
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,240
I've been looking for you everywhere.

452
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,240
I was so angry that

453
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,640
you two were chatting here.

454
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,040
Master.

455
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,240
It's too late.

456
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,040
Come with me.

457
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,040
Let's go.

458
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,440
So hurry?

459
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,040
Hurry?

460
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,040
Who told you to kneel?

461
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,040
I...

462
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,040
If you don't realize your mistake,

463
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,040
what's the use of punishing you?

464
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,040
Brother.

465
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,440
I don't understand.

466
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,240
Since the marriage is fixed,

467
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,240
why don't you

468
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,240
give the Chihua Bead to Lingxu?

469
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,440
Xue Man.

470
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,840
The Mei family is already dead.

471
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,040
Now it's empty

472
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,640
for the four families.

473
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,240
There's nothing left in it.

474
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,440
So this time you're marrying Lingxu,

475
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,840
first, for your future happiness.

476
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,240
Second,

477
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,240
for the future of the Mei family.

478
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,640
So this Chihua Bead

479
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,840
is the only thing

480
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,040
I can give to Lingxu.

481
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,240
I can't give it to her

482
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,240
until the last moment.

483
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,040
She

484
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,040
is our only bargaining chip.

485
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,240
Brother.

486
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,640
I understand what you said.

487
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,240
But if it wasn't for her,

488
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,840
the Mei family would have been destroyed.

489
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,640
What's the point of today and the future?

490
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,840
So I think

491
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,640
even if there is no marriage agreement,

492
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,640
we should also give the Chihua Bead

493
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,040
to Lingxu.

494
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,840
Enough.

495
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,440
If you insist on giving it to me,

496
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,040
then wait till I die.

497
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,240
Brother.

498
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,040
Shut up.

499
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,440
You just kneel here

500
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,440
and reflect on the flower picture.

501
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,640
Miss Zhou You,

502
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,640
are you okay?

503
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,440
I'm fine.

504
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,040
Where are you now?

505
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,440
Do you know I've been waiting for you?

506
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,240
I'm here.

507
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,440
Do you know I've been waiting for you?

508
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,040
What's your plan?

509
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,640
You're too nervous.

510
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,040
I didn't mean anything.

511
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,440
Are these lanterns beautiful?

512
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,440
Are you happy

513
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,640
to see such a view?

514
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,640
You asked me to come here

515
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,240
just to see the lanterns.

516
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,240
Why not?

517
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,240
The time is not right.

518
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,440
It's not the right time.

519
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,840
Lin Jian and Rong Hua are the same.

520
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,440
And you are his family.

521
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,640
They must have sent you to find out the news

522
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,840
and see my strength.

523
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,040
But no matter what you want,

524
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,040
I'll take the position of Hall Leader of the Holy Hall.

525
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,240
There are so many

526
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,240
conspiracy in life.

527
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,240
Sometimes you just need to smile

528
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,240
and you'll be able to live a long and happy life.

529
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,840
Thank you.

530
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,640
Actually, you don't need to thank me.

531
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,840
I'm leaving Longyin City tomorrow.

532
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,040
But I'm worried about you.

533
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,040
I've been thinking about it.

534
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,840
I can only do these for you.

535
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,240
I've never done this before.

536
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,440
This is the first time

537
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,840
someone has done this for me.

538
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,640
I'm used to not being indebted to anyone.

539
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,440
Today,

540
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,040
just take it as I owe you a favor.

541
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,840
No matter when,

542
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,440
as long as you say it,

543
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,840
I'll definitely pay you back.

544
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,840
Just give me back the favor.

545
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,840
What do you want me to do for you?

546
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,840
I don't need you to do anything for me.

547
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,040
I just want you to let go of the past

548
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,040
and be a happy person from now on.

549
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,840
It's not your turn to be the one to talk about my business.

550
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,040
I don't mean that.

551
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,040
I just think

552
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,040
you seem to have some suspicion about Rong Hua.

553
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,640
Some words

554
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,240
can be said.

555
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,840
After all, you are the real sisters of Xue Nong and Xue Shui.

556
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,440
Why do you have to be so serious

557
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,240
like this?

558
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,440
You have to be the one to talk about my problem.

559
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,640
Don't think you know me very well.

560
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,640
You won't understand my problem.

561
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,440
No one in this world can understand it.

562
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,240
If you leave again,

563
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,640
I won't be polite to you.

564
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,040
I'm sorry.

565
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,840
I was too self-righteous.

566
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,640
For the past few years,

567
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,640
there must be

568
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,640
someone who is good to you.

569
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,040
There must be someone.

570
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,640
No one in this world will be good to you.

571
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,440
They are just using you.

572
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,440
Kill them.

573
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,440
Kill them.

574
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,240
Kill them.

575
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,840
Kill them.

576
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,040
Kill them.

577
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,440
There must be someone

578
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,440
who is good to you.

579
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,840
There must be someone

580
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,240
who is good to you.

581
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,240
No.

582
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,640
It's not like that.

583
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,040
No.

584
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,240
No.

585
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,440
It's not like that.

586
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,040
It's not like that.

587
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,240
It's not like that.

588
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,240
No.

589
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,640
No.

590
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,640
It's not like that.

591
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,640
Every year,

592
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,040
when autumn and winter are in conflict,

593
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,040
the cold snow falls,

594
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,640
and the red snow is born again.

595
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,040
Here,

596
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,840
a whole piece of red snow

597
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,840
will grow

598
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,040
like blood.

599
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,640
When that time comes,

600
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,640
thousands of poisonous insects

601
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,640
will eat red snow

602
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,640
until they die.

603
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,440
When the poisonous insects

604
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,240
die,

605
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,840
the poisonous insects

606
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,440
will fight each other here.

607
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,840
In the end,

608
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,040
there will only be one poisonous insect.

609
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,040
And this poisonous insect

610
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,440
will eat all the poisonous leaves

611
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,640
that it accompanied.

612
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,040
In the end,

613
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,040
it will be killed by red snow.

614
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,440
Its poisonous leaves

615
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,440
will nourish red snow again.

616
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,040
This is a rotten red snow.

617
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,040
It will be revived and bloom again.

618
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,440
A poisonous insect

619
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,240
will eat red snow and take the wood.

620
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,240
That

621
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,040
is red snow.

622
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,840
Ten thousand poisons,

623
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,240
ten thousand poisons,

624
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,640
everything in the world is alive and dead.

625
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,240
The flowers bloom and die.

626
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,840
Cold snow,

627
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,040
red snow.

628
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,240
This is a poison that kills people.

629
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,840
It's also a antidote

630
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,240
to save people.

631
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,440
You're right.

632
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,240
In this world,

633
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,840
there are many people

634
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,840
who are addicted to the red flowers and pearls in Longyin City.

635
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,240
But

636
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,240
without the permission of me,

637
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,840
no one can take away

638
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,240
the flowers and leaves here.

639
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,640
Even my own family

640
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,240
has to follow the rules.

641
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,440
This flower sea is very important

642
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,840
to Longyin City.

643
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,440
This flower sea is very important

644
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,440
to Longyin City.

645
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,040
From now on,

646
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,240
the safety of this flower sea

647
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,840
and all things related to the flower sea

648
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,040
will be handled by the Holy Heir.

649
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,040
It seems that

650
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,240
the person you are most afraid of

651
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,040
is the most knowledgeable.

652
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,040
He can always take your weakness.

653
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,840
Lin Jiang.

654
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,040
Although you are the master of the Holy Heir,

655
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,440
in the end,

656
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,240
you can't be considered

657
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,440
the person of Longyin City.

658
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,040
I'm willing to hand over

659
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,840
the position of Holy Heir to you

660
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,640
because

661
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,440
I don't want someone to secretly

662
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,240
secretly take away the flowers

663
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,040
and leaves here.

664
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,640
I don't want to

665
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,440
let you take away the flowers

666
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,040
and leaves here.

667
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,640
I've already taken control of Longyin City.

668
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,440
You're right.

669
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,440
Everything is different.

670
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,040
Perhaps

671
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,240
only the Holy Heir

672
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,040
can contain this empty house.

673
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,040
Don't worry, City Leader.

674
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,440
Okay.

675
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,040
Lin Jing.

676
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,640
Do you know why Liang Jiangzi is so popular?

677
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,840
Liang Jiangzi is known to be a red-hot guy.

678
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,240
He is gentle,

679
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,240
and he can cool down the body.

680
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,040
He can wake up and eat.

681
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:30,840
This

682
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,240
is very helpful

683
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,440
to those who drink too much.

684
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,840
Master is always greedy for food and wine.

685
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,040
This is born for him.

686
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,440
Rong Hua.

687
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,640
Liang Jiangzi

688
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,840
is very helpful to your cold.

689
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,240
I didn't expect

690
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,040
you've learned a lot during this time.

691
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,840
Compared with the ability of Zi Yan,

692
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,640
I'm far from being a doctor.

693
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,440
Now,

694
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,240
compared to other three schools,

695
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,040
the Holy Heir is very different.

696
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,240
If the speed of saving people

697
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,640
is not as fast as the speed of killing,

698
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,640
how can the Holy Heir

699
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,640
be in the Longyin City?

700
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,440
Were you

701
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,640
tired just now?

702
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,640
You were weak.

703
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,440
This time,

704
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,840
with the poison of Han Xue Lian,

705
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,640
you must not be too serious.

706
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,240
Zi Yan said

707
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,040
you must take good care of yourself.

708
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,040
So,

709
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,640
go back to your room and lie down.

710
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,040
I'll stew the

711
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,640
Liang Jiangzi for you.

712
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,440
You

713
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,640
have become so rude.

714
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,460
The

715
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,640
Please.

716
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,440
It's time to go.

717
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,840
The plum blossoms are still blooming.

718
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,440
The fragrance of the flowers is clear.

719
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,240
It's cold and snowy.

720
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,240
I'm so lucky

721
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,640
to see this.

722
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,240
The Mei family always loves the Mei.

723
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,640
So the ancestors

724
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,640
have organized a set of ways to manage the plum garden.

725
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,440
It can make the plum blossoms bloom and not wither.

726
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,240
You deserve to be the head of the four families in Jiangnan.

727
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,440
The Mei family is so diligent and elegant.

728
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,640
No one can be more urgent.

729
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,240
The Mei family is not so busy.

730
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,440
They just came here to be bored.

731
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,440
I'm sorry to make you laugh.

732
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,240
Now, the Mei family

733
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,240
has nothing to mention

734
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,040
except these plum blossoms.

735
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,640
How can they compare to Lingxu Pavilion?

736
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,240
You're too modest.

737
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,640
The Mei family is a good person.

738
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,640
They have their own world.

739
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,840
They will be reborn.

740
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,440
I came here today

741
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,040
to take you to talk to the Mei family.

742
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,240
We'll go to the Pavilion.

743
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,440
The Pavilion Master has some skills.

744
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,840
If the Mei family goes,

745
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,640
it may be able to make them more active.

746
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,640
How about you, Mei?

747
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,440
I've been spoiled

748
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,840
by my sister since I was little.

749
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,440
So this matter

750
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,840
has to be decided by her.

751
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,040
But

752
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,640
I should be honest.

753
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,640
It's not right for Madam Ling

754
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,640
to invite the seven brothers here

755
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,440
just like that.

756
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,040
The dead camel is bigger than the horse.

757
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,440
No matter what the Mei family says,

758
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,040
although they are as powerful as before,

759
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,440
they have never lost

760
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,240
the reputation of the four families in Jiangnan.

761
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,440
Although Lingxu Pavilion is the star in the world,

762
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,840
in terms of status,

763
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,640
I think you should understand.

764
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,240
I understand your point.

765
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,240
But compared to the reputation of the Pavilion Master,

766
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,840
the Pavilion Master

767
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,240
is the fear of the people in the world.

768
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,240
I hope you understand.

769
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,440
It's my best chance

770
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,440
to protect the reputation of the Mei family.

771
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,640
She wanted to come to Longyin City.

772
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,240
And she wanted to make it up to Rong Su.

773
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,040
So I'll just

774
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,840
teach her a lesson.

775
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,040
With Rong Su's reputation,

776
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,440
Lu Yizhou is so honest.

777
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,840
How can she live here?

778
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,440
Since you've seen it so clearly,

779
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,440
why do you still want to stay in Longyin City?

780
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,040
You know

781
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,240
Longyin City

782
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,040
is not as simple as you think.

783
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,040
I think

784
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,440
you're right.

785
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,040
Maybe

786
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,240
Lu Yizhou's end

787
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,240
is your future.

788
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,640
If Lu Yizhou

789
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,640
really died in Rong Su's hands,

790
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,240
I would fight to death

791
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,640
and let Rong Su pay a corresponding price.

792
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,640
I didn't expect

793
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,240
you to worry about these things.

794
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,840
But if I were to be an enemy of Rong Su,

795
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,840
I would be an enemy of Longyin City.

796
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,240
I won't have any relationship with you.

797
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,440
You're already the owner of the Holy Grail Hall.

798
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,840
You can't go out of the room anymore.

799
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,840
We can only get stronger

800
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,840
to get rid of the troubles.

801
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,040
Go back and have a rest.

802
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,040
Listen to me.

803
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,240
Have a good rest.

804
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,840
Anyway,

805
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,840
I can always find a way

806
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,440
to cure my mother's illness

807
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,440
and this girl's cold disease.

808
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,640
I will definitely cure you.

809
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,840
Are you Cang Qin?

810
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,640
Yes, I am.

811
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,640
I want to see the gift you brought.

812
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,440
Yes.

813
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,840
These are your new clothes.

814
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,440
Please have a look, Miss Mei.

815
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,440
Wait.

816
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:11,840
Don't be rude.

817
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,240
Okay.

818
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,440
I'll take it as a trip to the Holy Grail Hall.

819
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,640
Okay.

820
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,440
Xue Man,

821
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,040
have you really made up your mind?

822
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,440
Don't worry, Brother.

823
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,840
Madam prepared so many gifts for me.

824
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,840
I will definitely give them to you.

825
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,440
By the way, I remember that Madam is afraid of cold.

826
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,440
The Holy Grail Hall is located in the deep mountains.

827
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,640
Even if it's cold, it's still cool.

828
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,640
I should prepare a gift for you

829
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,240
and bring it back to you.

830
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,440
There is a nice pot of ball in my room.

831
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,640
It's very warm.

832
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,040
I will bring it back from the northern part.

833
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,440
I will take it as a token of my gratitude.

834
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,240
I will go and get the gift.

835
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,240
Please wait for me at the entrance of the Holy Grail Hall

836
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,840
with Brother Cang Qi.

837
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,040
Thank you for waiting, Brother Cang Qi.

838
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,040
Thank you for your support, Madam Cang Qi.

839
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,440
Brother, don't worry.

840
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,640
It's still early.

841
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,440
I will go to the Holy Grail Hall with Brother Cang Qi.

842
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,840
After I arrive,

843
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,640
I will report to my uncle.

844
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,240
Be careful when you go out.

845
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,440
Yes.

846
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,440
I will leave now.

847
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,440
You can't go in.

848
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,040
Young Master, bad news.

849
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,840
The Holy Grail Pearl is missing.

850
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,640
Oh, no.

851
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,640
Brother must have found out that the Holy Grail Pearl is missing.

852
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,640
I accidentally stole the Holy Grail Pearl.

853
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,640
But I never broke through

854
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,240
the formation of the plum tree that Brother set up.

855
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,240
I will send you the letter of divorce

856
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,640
hoping that you can take the Holy Grail Pearl

857
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,840
and send it to the Holy Grail Hall.

858
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,640
Thank you for your kindness, Miss Mei.

859
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,240
You asked Mei Shao to take me to the plum tree.

860
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,840
I didn't expect that you would make an arrangement

861
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,640
to let you have the opportunity to take the Holy Grail Pearl.

862
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,640
I accidentally stole it before.

863
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,040
I was lucky today.

864
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,240
I gave you the pot of ball in a grand way.

865
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,640
Brother didn't take it.

866
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,040
I just wanted to show you.

867
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,440
I will go and get it.

868
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,640
I can't find out what's hidden in the middle.

869
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,440
But it's not easy to break through

870
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,840
the formation of the plum tree before being caught.

871
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,240
We have to break through the formation within the shortest time

872
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,440
and leave the place of the plum tree.

873
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,040
Come on, close your eyes.

874
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,840
Why?

875
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,240
The art of plum tree is easy to explain to the world.

876
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,240
The plum tree sets up the formation of the plum tree here

877
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,640
and then sets up the formation with the special plum incense.

878
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,640
It confuses people and confuses the direction.

879
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,240
How do you know

880
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,840
how to break through my brother's formation?

881
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,240
I passed through the plum tree just now

882
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,840
and deliberately kept a distance from my brother.

883
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,240
I broke through the plum incense here.

884
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,040
As long as I don't get confused by the trees,

885
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,440
I can definitely get out of the plum forest.

886
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,440
I came here because my brother led me.

887
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,440
I don't know where the front gate of the plum family is.

888
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,040
The front gate is located in the northeast.

889
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,440
After the plum family lost the war,

890
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,840
my brother was afraid that the enemy would come to the gate,

891
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,240
so he set up the formation of the plum forest

892
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,240
and used the gate.

893
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,840
But there are always people guarding there.

894
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,040
It's hard to break through.

895
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,640
The young master often said

896
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,640
that as long as the momentum is not easy,

897
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,840
it is necessary to break through the normal rule

898
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,840
to have a chance to survive.

899
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,240
Now there is only the bold thing.

900
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,840
I'm sorry.

901
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,840
Miss Mei, please hold my sleeve.

902
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:08,840
The world is like falling on the sand.

903
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,840
The shadow is like a shadow.

904
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,840
The world is like a shadow.

905
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,840
The shadow is like a shadow.

906
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,840
The shadow is like a shadow.

907
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,840
The shadow is like a shadow.

908
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:33,940
The shadow is like a shadow.

909
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:37,640
The shadowlarry circle the heart and our household besonders.

910
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,440
Saying one word opens noon doctors 3000
