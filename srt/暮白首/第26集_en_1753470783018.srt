1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,040
Oh uh

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We are in love

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
A moment of flowers, a moment of spring

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I've never been here, you don't understand

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
How much love is in my heart

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The most beautiful flower in my eyes

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Come on, I'm kidding

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Then it will be calm

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Come on.

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
When will you win like me

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You check my這樣

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Okay.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,480
You check my

14
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,360
Really

15
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,880
You come near me

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,300
Sword In The intimidated

17
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,980
Episode 04

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,600
you should have prepared some good ingredients.

19
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,440
You must have taken them home

20
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,320
without any preparation.

21
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,640
Boss,

22
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,520
I was wronged.

23
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,040
You dare to say that?

24
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,320
Is the room ready?

25
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,840
Don't worry, sir.

26
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,040
I'll be right there.

27
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,240
Go.

28
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,120
Why are you standing there?

29
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,800
I've been eating water

30
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,760
in the town recently.

31
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,480
I wonder if it's a ghost or a ghost.

32
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,080
What a...

33
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,400
Master.

34
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,920
You're late.

35
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,920
Xuan Ye...

36
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,320
Xuan Ye met some troubles on the way.

37
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,080
Get ready to leave in a few days.

38
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,240
The place where Bai Su lived

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,120
is not far from here.

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,560
Go.

41
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,360
Miss Rong,

42
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,720
you don't have to be so alert with me.

43
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,800
Liuli?

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,520
I helped you secretly that day,

45
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,480
so you got away.

46
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,240
You used a sword to stab me today.

47
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,880
Are you here to ask for mercy?

48
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,960
Of course not.

49
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,600
I'm like you.

50
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,000
He suffered a loss in Longyin City.

51
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,240
He was upset.

52
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,720
So he tried to get back his money.

53
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,200
Is your upset about me?

54
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,680
No.

55
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,640
But Miss Rong,

56
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,640
since your master left Longyin City,

57
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,400
Rong Su and his disciples

58
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,680
appeared here.

59
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,720
I think they want to threaten your master

60
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,160
so that your master can show up.

61
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,320
My master?

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,520
Yes.

63
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,800
No matter what you plan,

64
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,200
don't let them find out your whereabouts.

65
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,200
If they can leave as soon as possible,

66
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,600
it will be better.

67
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,560
I'll have a party

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,200
to cheer myself up

69
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,880
and help you.

70
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,680
Then please

71
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,280
help me spread the news.

72
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,200
Go ahead.

73
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
Longyin City

74
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,960
The people in Longyin City are here.

75
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,480
If we keep fighting,

76
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,920
I'm afraid we'll lose our whereabouts.

77
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,560
Don't forget

78
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,800
that Bai and Xue Man are here.

79
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,800
What's your plan?

80
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,560
His plan

81
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,400
is to make Miss Rong take the initiative.

82
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,080
If it wasn't for the order of Master Ming,

83
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,880
Xue Meng wouldn't have been involved.

84
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,640
Now I, Liu Li,

85
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,920
am a messenger for you.

86
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,120
Now,

87
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,520
all the people in Longyin City are in the inn.

88
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,360
What's your plan?

89
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,800
What's my plan?

90
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,280
It has nothing to do with you.

91
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,640
You just have to do your own business.

92
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,200
If you delay our schedule,

93
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,960
you should know

94
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,520
the consequence very well.

95
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,320
I know it.

96
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,440
After all, he is Xue Meng's confidant.

97
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,840
Master Ming sent him here in person.

98
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,320
Why did you send him here?

99
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,760
Why did you have to make him look bad?

100
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,360
Are you not going to let him go?

101
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,400
Yue,

102
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,680
it's not a good thing for you to let him go.

103
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,640
I admit

104
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,840
I can't let Hua go.

105
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,120
But I've decided to go to the North Kingdom.

106
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,960
I won't regret it.

107
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,880
Send the order

108
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,760
to stop Cang Qi and the others.

109
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,480
Although the revenge is still in support,

110
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,240
we can't act rashly

111
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,680
to avoid causing a disturbance.

112
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,480
I want Rong Jingfeng

113
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,560
to pay off

114
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,760
Lingxu Pavilion's grudge little by little.

115
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,760
You shouldn't give up.

116
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,840
He

117
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,440
has agreed to

118
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,480
magician as an agent.

119
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,280
affected the spirit problem

120
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,440
of тоже heinées

121
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,800
abandoning the old

122
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,520
and renouncing that

123
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,280
Go!

124
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,360
Go!

125
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,000
Go!

126
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,520
Go!

127
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:19,960
Keep walking.

128
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,280
Brother Cang Qi.

129
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,280
Don't show your weakness to the people of Longyin City.

130
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,800
How is Brother You Xu?

131
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,640
Are Brother Yin and the Chief all right?

132
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,720
I have a task for you.

133
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,200
After the task is done,

134
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,200
you can go to the north palace with us.

135
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:34,760
What do you think?

136
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,200
Okay.

137
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,400
Go!

138
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,120
Go!

139
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,800
Go!

140
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,440
Go!

141
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,040
Go!

142
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,640
Go!

143
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,720
Rice cake!

144
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,600
Thank you.

145
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,320
Thank you.

146
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:45,960
Thank you.

147
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,560
Brother.

148
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,520
Please have a look.

149
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,160
Thank you.

150
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:50,880
Take care.

151
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,760
Let's go.

152
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,360
Rice cake!

153
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,480
Rice cake!

154
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,080
Mr. Bai.

155
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:04,840
Miss Mei.

156
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,200
Come on.

157
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,920
Sit down.

158
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,040
How is it?

159
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,400
Have you found out

160
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,200
where my two brothers are?

161
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,560
There are many people

162
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,920
in Longyin City recently.

163
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,520
I suspect that they are coming for you.

164
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,560
And

165
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,240
if we still act together,

166
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,320
it's too easy to be discovered.

167
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,320
I'd better leave first.

168
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,000
Mr. Bai Su's place of rest

169
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,800
is not far from here.

170
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,200
If people in Longyin City can't find you,

171
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,520
I suspect that they will be bad to Mr. Bai Su.

172
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,680
Why don't you go to the Black Stone Mountain first?

173
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,640
How dare you!

174
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,160
If I go to my master's place,

175
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,320
a girl's house is all alone.

176
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,880
What should I do?

177
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,080
Mr. Bai, don't worry.

178
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,320
I've thought it over.

179
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,040
My father's old friends

180
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,040
live nearby.

181
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,400
I'll go to them.

182
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,000
Besides,

183
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,480
I've been dragging you down all the way.

184
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm not embarrassed.

185
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,440
You can only do this now.

186
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,560
Thank you, Mr. Bai.

187
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,360
Why are you thanking me?

188
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,360
Girl,

189
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,000
you must take care of yourself

190
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,520
on your way back.

191
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,760
Thank you for your concern, Mr. Bai.

192
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,880
If there's a chance,

193
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,000
I hope I can meet you again.

194
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,800
That's all.

195
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,160
Take care.

196
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,440
Mr. Bai,

197
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,400
I know that Longyin City is not good for you.

198
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,840
So I told the two of you

199
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,240
to protect yourself.

200
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,880
They've just blocked the assassins

201
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,160
in the woods for you.

202
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,680
Now it's safe outside.

203
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,280
You can rest assured.

204
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,200
I heard that Mr. Bai has a bad luck.

205
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,800
I heard that Mr. Bai has a bad luck.

206
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,960
It's really annoying.

207
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,280
We're senior disciples of wisdom.

208
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,240
We want to get rid of the rest as soon as possible.

209
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,640
So we can make you

210
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,040
rest in peace and recover soon.

211
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,200
Maybe we're wrong.

212
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,360
Mr. Bai may be killed by someone.

213
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,560
Let's burn it down

214
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,840
to save us from being tainted.

215
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,680
We...

216
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,240
We need to pour some fuel on it.

217
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,840
So we can burn it faster.

218
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,080
Otherwise,

219
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,640
the assassins

220
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,600
will be killed soon.

221
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,240
It's useless to make a fuss.

222
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,360
Come in.

223
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,960
An Irreg bracketed battle

224
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,880
Master and Te-Long

225
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,760
are such two different people.

226
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,880
You girl

227
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,200
aren't timid at all.

228
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,480
You.

229
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,480
Only,

230
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,880
taking me.

231
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,000
Only good for me,

232
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,840
it's half an hour already.

233
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,440
Some disciples are still not here yet?

234
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,520
It's담 nothing happened.

235
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,820
only because

236
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,880
November 19th

237
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,420
You can try your best, if you want to kill.

238
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,120
I willheaded you two.

239
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,480
Go to help the Survivor and the disciples.

240
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,780
Kill them,

241
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:33,840
or they will catch my master's

242
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,020
Medallion.

243
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,840
Bai Su's disciples are all experts.

244
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,800
But one is missing.

245
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,920
Bai Wei Zhi has been expelled from the sect.

246
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,040
He is no longer Master's disciple.

247
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,720
Who told you to disturb my master's peace?

248
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,560
Master Bai didn't think about it in Longyin City.

249
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,120
He even escaped from the city.

250
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,240
Master was furious.

251
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,720
He asked me to come

252
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,320
and ask Master Bai to go back with me.

253
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,680
Rong Su.

254
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,920
You should tell Rong Jingfeng

255
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,840
about this.

256
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,040
If he continues to force us,

257
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,320
we will be enemies

258
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,120
when we meet again.

259
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,800
If he withdraws now,

260
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,520
there may be a chance.

261
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:23,920
And

262
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,200
don't make any more troubles

263
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,560
in the future.

264
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,240
It's a pity

265
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
that the disciples in the forest died.

266
00:17:35,840 --> 00:18:03,440
Now said

267
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,640
If you change your mind and return to the city,

268
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,680
the seat of the Hall Leader of Laozi Hall

269
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,080
will still be yours.

270
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,560
If there is anyone

271
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,720
who steps into this place in Longyin City,

272
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,440
I will be the one

273
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,400
who will take action.

274
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,120
Wait.

275
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,160
The disciples in the forest were not killed.

276
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,360
My two brothers

277
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,360
are not as cold as you.

278
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,440
Take him and leave quickly.

279
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,680
Greetings, brothers.

280
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,720
Go with me to see the master.

281
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,760
Go.

282
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,640
Go.

283
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,840
Brother.

284
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,400
Go.

285
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,000
Brother.

286
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,280
Senior Bai,

287
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,400
can I help you to check the pulse?

288
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:24,960
Brother.

289
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:25,760
Brother.

290
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,480
Go.

291
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,440
Listen to the voice.

292
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,360
My two uneducated disciples

293
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,880
will be here soon.

294
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,720
You go and send them away.

295
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,800
In case they are full of the spirit of the world

296
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,760
and destroy my place of rest.

297
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,760
Senior Bai,

298
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,320
have you had lunch?

299
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,360
A person who has no rest

300
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,400
doesn't need to eat too much.

301
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,560
I get up every day

302
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,720
and eat some food

303
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,080
in the back yard

304
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,600
on the night of the morning dew in the bamboo forest.

305
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,360
And on weekends,

306
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,080
I have meals on the 난에.

307
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,440
Do you have any aspects to protectnder the table?

308
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,640
Give a minute.

309
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,320
Please.

310
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,120
You should reflect on yourself.

311
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:10,800
Let me take care of it.

312
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,480
OK?

313
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,080
Senior brothers.

314
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,200
I will go.

315
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,000
Go.

316
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,280
Master.

317
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,560
I was not filial.

318
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,280
I came out to find you.

319
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,360
You...

320
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,040
Why are you here?

321
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:35,480
You...

322
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,440
Who let you in?

323
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,240
I've kicked you out of the school.

324
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,440
And I heard

325
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,880
you've been a teacher

326
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,800
in Longyin City.

327
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,640
Don't come here.

328
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,280
You're his disciple.

329
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,040
I don't welcome you here.

330
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,040
From now on,

331
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,280
you're not allowed to come here.

332
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,640
Otherwise,

333
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,560
I won't be like this.

334
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,960
Please forgive me.

335
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,040
Master.

336
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,440
Master.

337
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,040
I...

338
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,360
I wonder if the flower beads

339
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,120
can guide the emperor.

340
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,600
Don't worry.

341
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,280
I've prepared everything.

342
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,640
I've arranged everything.

343
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,160
Go.

344
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:33,880
Young Master.

345
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,920
Young Madam and Bai Weizhi have met.

346
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,000
Bai Weizhi will take care of Young Madam

347
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,160
and protect her.

348
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,440
OK.

349
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,800
I haven't seen the Master.

350
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,920
Go.

351
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,320
Miss Mei.

352
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,440
Go.

353
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,120
Go.

354
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,560
Over a hundred years,

355
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,500
no girl has ever learned it before.

356
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,360
But Na Lanyue can love it.

357
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,880
What the bell acid

358
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,420
does is so lovely.

359
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,920
I committeeno it.

360
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,360
Teacher,

361
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,920
I think you've been through a lot on this journey.

362
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,200
You probably haven't en000ch.

363
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,560
I'm sorry.

364
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,480
What's wrong?

365
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,320
I... I just feel sorry for you.

366
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,200
You've been through so much

367
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,320
in such a short time.

368
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,240
Since you were a kid,

369
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,680
how could you suffer from this?

370
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,520
It's all my fault.

371
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,840
I shouldn't have married you.

372
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,760
I shouldn't have been like this.

373
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,480
Master, stop it.

374
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,120
I'm here

375
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,600
to eat with you.

376
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,560
Besides,

377
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,680
it's my greatest wish

378
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,200
to live.

379
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,280
I just hope

380
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,280
everyone around me is safe.

381
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,240
Then...

382
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,600
What about Nalan Yue?

383
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,520
Nalan Yue?

384
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,640
I don't know

385
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,800
where she is now.

386
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,640
How is she?

387
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,080
I don't know.

388
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,240
Hundreds of people

389
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,400
in Lingxu Pavilion

390
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,960
have disappeared.

391
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,400
The scene

392
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,160
is always there.

393
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,440
I'll never forget it.

394
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,360
Nalan Yue

395
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,600
is always so stubborn.

396
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,760
But I didn't expect

397
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,680
she's so cold-blooded.

398
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,560
And Rong Su,

399
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,160
she's so arrogant

400
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,160
and she's just like her father.

401
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,640
My father and sister

402
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,480
have given me a lesson.

403
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,000
You can't be soft

404
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,600
when facing the hateful.

405
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,440
Otherwise,

406
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,720
it's the price of blood.

407
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,320
Girl,

408
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,960
your father and Rong Su

409
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,960
are so mean.

410
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,440
You...

411
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,160
You can't be rude.

412
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,160
I'm rude?

413
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,480
Isn't my father rude?

414
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,880
What did Lingxu Pavilion do wrong?

415
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,560
My father treated them like this.

416
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,160
Please come in.

417
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,120
Girl,

418
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,120
what are you doing?

419
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,120
Since I'm alive,

420
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,560
I can't live in vain.

421
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,680
I want to avenge Lingxu Pavilion.

422
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,000
Why do you do this?

423
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,480
I know

424
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,160
who's right and who's wrong.

425
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,520
If I don't do this,

426
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,960
how can I face the dead king?

427
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,760
Good girl,

428
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,360
you...

429
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,200
I understand your mind.

430
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,120
Come on, get up.

431
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:56,760
Get up and talk.

432
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,280
Come on, get up.

433
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:57,800
No.

434
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,520
I've made up my mind.

435
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,920
If you don't agree,

436
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,240
I won't get up.

437
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,000
You're so stubborn.

438
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,880
Why are you like your father?

439
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:13,720
Say it.

440
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,280
How can I help you?

441
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,280
You agreed?

442
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,880
I ran away from Longyin City

443
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,480
to find you.

444
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,400
I have no good food.

445
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,880
You're a girl now.

446
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,000
You've grown up.

447
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,400
Besides,

448
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,840
you're doing the right thing.

449
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,480
I have my reasons for not helping you.

450
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,920
Thank you, master.

451
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,080
Say it.

452
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,920
What's your plan?

453
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,600
I want to use the strength of the teacher's clan

454
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,880
to do something that will be a disaster to the people.

455
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,240
My master's temper...

456
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:51,680
You...

457
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:52,920
You haven't seen it?

458
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,320
He doesn't even recognize me.

459
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,160
You're my apprentice.

460
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,120
You think he...

461
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,080
He's willing to help you?

462
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,000
I've thought of a way to help the teacher's clan.

463
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,880
Now I just hope

464
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,080
you can help me introduce you two to each other.

465
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:11,760
Okay.

466
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,000
I'll do my best to help you.

467
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,600
Come on, let's eat.

468
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,280
Let's eat.

469
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,000
I...

470
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,600
We've been here for days.

471
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,000
Why do we have to collect these dew every day?

472
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,760
Can you get close to that weird old man?

473
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,560
Master is strange.

474
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,560
It's not easy to get his trust.

475
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,680
There are still ways.

476
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,720
We can't rush it.

477
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,000
I'm afraid we can't do it.

478
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,720
Then can we

479
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,400
collect these dew every day

480
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,320
and make it useful?

481
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,720
Jingyuan is a martial artist.

482
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,400
It's a little wrong

483
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,000
to let you stay here with me.

484
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,960
If you're bored,

485
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,240
just go back.

486
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,720
I'll let you know

487
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,520
when I have news.

488
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,240
Masterbowen Ye,

489
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,600
have you seen Her Highness?

490
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,040
As long as it's for Her Ladyship,

491
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,120
we won't be bullied in this kind of thing.

492
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,960
Still,

493
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,080
so much dew we've collected

494
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:30,880
right here.

495
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,840
But there's still no conclusion.

496
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,120
Isn't it sorry that we Brandi's Fortunately-Victorious above all others?

497
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,280
We can only honor his words

498
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:37,800
and listen for God's command.

499
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,400
In fact, those days,

500
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,920
I've heard a lot about this weird old man.

501
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,360
He has countless disciples.

502
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,520
But now,

503
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,720
only Wang's disciples

504
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,360
often interact with him.

505
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,760
They are indeed great.

506
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,160
They are not just any ordinary people.

507
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,840
I heard that

508
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,840
Wang's disciples are both related to the Black and White Army.

509
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,960
Except for the relationship between

510
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,880
this weird old man's disciples,

511
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,200
they are all from different sects.

512
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,080
Wang Qingzheng, the eldest disciple,

513
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,360
has been managing the Escort for many years.

514
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,840
He has his own branch in the south and north.

515
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,760
He is the most respected among his peers.

516
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,240
The second disciple, Wang Zhiyuan,

517
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,520
is the messenger of the Du River.

518
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,400
Although they are different,

519
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,960
every messenger of the Du River

520
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,200
listens to his orders.

521
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,880
There is no doubt that

522
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,800
the information about the Jianghu is leaked.

523
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:22,920
I heard that

524
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,440
the source of the information about the Snow League

525
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,480
is also a secret deal between them.

526
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,400
It seems that my master is not simple.

527
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,480
He has more power than I do.

528
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,920
It's a pity that

529
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,800
he is so temperamental

530
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,040
and ungrateful.

531
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,080
Otherwise, he would have been the leader of the Wu Family.

532
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,080
Everyone has his own way.

533
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,480
My master is old and arrogant.

534
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,400
I'm afraid that these people

535
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,320
can't get into his eyes.

536
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,680
I just don't know

537
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,440
if he is good

538
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,440
or bad

539
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,920
in the Jianghu.

540
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,840
This weird old man has a high level of martial arts.

541
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,640
I'm afraid he is hard to defeat in the Jianghu.

542
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,240
His ability

543
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,840
can lead all the sects in the Jianghu

544
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,640
to the right path.

545
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,480
But he just let it go

546
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,960
and came here to have fun alone.

547
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,360
He has wasted his ability for nothing.

548
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,760
If I were him,

549
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,760
I would have taken revenge

550
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,880
and shocked the Nalan family.

551
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,080
I wouldn't have enjoyed my life here.

552
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,560
Let's not bother ourselves here.

553
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,000
It's getting late.

554
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,480
Master and the others should be here soon.

555
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,080
Other than your master,

556
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,320
there are other people here.

557
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,420
procedure

558
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,840
Greetings to the two masters.

559
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:45,840
Master.

560
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,040
You are too good!

561
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,040
Bai Weizhi, this requested kid

562
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,360
has been kicked out of the family.

563
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,960
He isn't a disciple

564
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,120
so he wouldn't dare

565
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,320
to tell you about your master.

566
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,400
He's just a servant.

567
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,200
Master, so why would you bother?

568
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,640
Aggressive brat!

569
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,120
Master!

570
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,400
What's wrong with your face?

571
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,960
You said it.

572
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,560
You asked me to invite you two brothers.

573
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,520
Well,

574
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,200
look.

575
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,040
My body is out of shape.

576
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,720
You're so heartless.

577
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,440
How could you laugh at me?

578
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,240
I've never seen you like this.

579
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,600
You're so timid.

580
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:28,960
You...

581
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,920
I've been bullied by them since I was a kid.

582
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,200
I didn't expect that

583
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,800
I couldn't escape from them at this age.

584
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,880
You brat.

585
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,920
You asked us to come here

586
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,280
to discuss about Master's health.

587
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,040
We came here

588
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,600
to meet you in private behind Master's back.

589
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,960
It's a risk.

590
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,920
If you're so idle,

591
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,160
let's go, brother.

592
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,120
Masters.

593
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,040
Please wait.

594
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,240
Please have a look.

595
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,680
Open it.

596
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,040
How is it?

597
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,840
It's just a normal dew.

598
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,320
What does it have to do with Master's illness?

599
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,000
These days,

600
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,600
I've been collecting dew

601
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,360
from Black Stone Mountain.

602
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,520
I found nothing wrong.

603
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,800
Usually,

604
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,000
Master's diet is no more than ten liters per square meter.

605
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,440
In this case,

606
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,280
it can be ruled out as a problem of drinking water.

607
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,520
The rest

608
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,560
is the story of Caiyuan.

609
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,560
Caiyuan is Master's personal manager.

610
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,840
What's wrong with that?

611
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,880
The so-called treatment of the disease

612
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,480
can only be solved by finding the cause of the disease.

613
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,680
I have a request.

614
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,400
Please

615
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,400
bring some

616
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,040
melon trees to check

617
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,160
whether Master's illness is related to the diet.

618
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,160
Melon trees?

619
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,640
Come here, you brat.

620
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,440
Come here.

621
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:47,760
Come here.

622
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:49,720
What are you doing?

623
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,440
Senior asked you to come here.

624
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,560
Come here.

625
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,720
Then we have to make a deal.

626
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,080
A gentleman should not touch a man.

627
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,720
Don't touch a man.

628
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,560
Okay.

629
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,440
Come here.

630
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,760
Masters, stop fighting.

631
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,240
Master's illness has not been cured.

632
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,560
Why do you still hit him?

633
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,880
They just want to get rid of the anger.

634
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,920
Stop talking nonsense.

635
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,440
Okay.

636
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,360
For the sake of Master,

637
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,120
I'll give you a chance.

638
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,240
You can come to get the painting book later.

639
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,320
But remember,

640
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,040
you must be careful.

641
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,560
Don't let Master know

642
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,600
that we are helping him secretly.

643
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,000
Don't worry, Master.

644
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,120
Even if Master finds out,

645
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,760
I won't get you into trouble.

646
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,560
Okay.

647
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,760
Junior, let's go.

648
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,640
You brat.

649
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,080
You...

650
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,360
Master,

651
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,640
what did you do

652
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,640
that made you so angry?

653
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,400
It's a long story.

654
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,040
But who doesn't make mistakes when they're young?

655
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,320
Let's not talk about it.

656
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,080
Let's go.

657
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,000
Luckily, it's just some skin wounds.

658
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,400
Xiao Feng has made breakfast for us.

659
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,720
Let's go back now.

660
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,280
You should have told me earlier.

661
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,240
Let's go.

662
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,560
Master.

663
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,040
Young Master, do you want some water?

664
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,480
No.

665
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,840
I didn't expect

666
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,760
I would have the chance

667
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,680
to lie on this land.

668
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,040
This place should be close to the old dynasty.

669
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,280
I think Mohua has already realized it

670
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,880
and is planning to go with us.

671
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,520
What's your plan next?

672
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,240
I have no plan.

673
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,480
I just want to avenge my mother.

674
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,720
Now the whole world

675
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,960
can only be controlled by the Ling family.

676
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,640
We have no choice.

677
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:51,680
Maybe

678
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,040
we can only get what we want

679
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,520
by being tolerant.

680
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,240
No matter what you do,

681
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,560
I will support you.

682
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,000
Yue,

683
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,240
we have a bright future.

684
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,320
But we are always with you.

685
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,560
No matter how difficult it is,

686
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,000
we will be with you.

687
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,200
I only want you to say one thing.

688
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,800
The Lingxu Pavilion has been destroyed.

689
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,240
These gold coins

690
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,800
are our only choice.

691
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,160
No matter what the price is,

692
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,640
I will make the people who hurt the Lingxu Pavilion

693
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,680
pay for it.

694
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,280
Including Mohua.

695
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,640
Be careful. There's someone.

696
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,440
Master Ming has already expected

697
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,640
that you would come today.

698
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,400
He sent us to pick you up.

699
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,040
Then please lead the way.

700
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,280
The Lingxu Pavilion is strict.

701
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,120
You are here to serve as a minister.

702
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,880
You should obey the rules of the Lingxu Pavilion.

703
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,760
No matter who comes from outside,

704
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,080
you should put down your weapons

705
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,160
and three wine cups

706
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,360
to enter the temple

707
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,360
to pay respect to Master Ming.

708
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:53,880
Hurry up and bow.

709
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,080
Is this Mohua's order

710
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,080
or yours?

711
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,120
You are just some stray dogs.

712
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,640
How dare you make a fuss here?

713
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,760
Who do you think you are?

714
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,080
Just do as I say.

715
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:10,560
Yue.

716
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,560
Tell Mohua

717
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,400
that Nan Yue is here

718
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,920
and wants to meet her.

719
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,440
The Lingxu Pavilion

720
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,480
It's only been a few days.

721
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,040
You can't stand it anymore?

722
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,280
Master.

723
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,280
The disciples sent to the camp

724
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,040
have been gone for some hours.

725
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,440
Why haven't they come back yet?

726
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,440
Could it be that they deliberately

727
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,880
make things difficult for Nan Yue?

728
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,200
Do you think that

729
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,640
the young master of the Lingxu Pavilion

730
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,680
who was not a member of the Geng's family

731
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,120
is the same as me?

732
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,120
As long as he doesn't make things difficult for my disciples,

733
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,840
I will thank God and the God.

734
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,840
Master.

735
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,840
One of the disciples sent to take over Nan Yue's camp

736
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,840
was killed.

737
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,560
There was no one in Nan Yue's eyes.

738
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,440
She didn't even care about my spiritual leader.

739
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,320
How should we deal with this?

740
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,760
Please show mercy, Master.

741
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,480
Why did they come here?

742
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,120
There must be some misunderstanding.

743
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:41,840
Zhao Li...

744
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,120
Pass on my order.

745
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,640
If anyone comes to my camp,

746
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,640
no disciple

747
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,240
is allowed to make things difficult for them.

748
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,520
Arrange for them to stay in the camp immediately.

749
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,680
If anyone

750
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,960
dares to say anything,

751
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,240
I will not let them go.

752
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,360
Yes.

753
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,440
stupid

754
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:35,960
Isn't it?

755
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,960
We've been trapped in the Spirit Cult for days.

756
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,400
We're always locked in this dark room.

757
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,760
The disciples who sent the food

758
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:41,640
asked them

759
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,000
and they all acted like idiots.

760
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,320
I don't know if Mo Huan is in the Spirit Cult.

761
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,320
What's on his mind?

762
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,360
He didn't tell us.

763
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,160
Why are you still in the mood for tea?

764
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,760
You should show your attitude.

765
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,960
The tea is bitter and bitter.

766
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,480
Who can drink it?

767
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,760
This is the opposite world.

768
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,840
We're in the opposite world.

769
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,560
You have to take the responsibility.

770
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,560
The more you can't hold your breath,

771
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,400
the easier it is for Mo Huan to get into trouble.

772
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,320
At this time,

773
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,040
you can't stand your temper.

774
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,120
You'll lose.

775
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,320
In this case,

776
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,560
Mo Huan deliberately betrayed us.

777
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,200
He wants us to beg him first.

778
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,040
This is a long battle.

779
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,440
We don't know

780
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,240
what will happen in the future.

781
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,640
What's your plan?

782
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,840
If I'm useless to Mo Huan,

783
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,160
he can't keep me here.

784
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,640
He just wants to wait.

785
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,360
I'll wait with him.

786
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,640
We can't do anything but wait.

787
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,200
But you...

788
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,200
I've never seen anyone

789
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,640
beg like you.

790
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,400
In the future,

791
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,280
you'll have more chances

792
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,640
to see a different Nalan Yue.

793
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,720
Brother, don't scare me.

794
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,160
Yi Zhou.

795
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,520
We've been playing since childhood.

796
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,840
I'll stop playing with you.

797
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,520
If one day

798
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,080
there's an accident,

799
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,560
I can't go back.

800
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,960
Help me take care of Rong Hua.

801
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,760
No way.

802
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,080
You're your wife.

803
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,120
Of course you take care of her.

804
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,320
Do you think I won't get married

805
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,680
for you?

806
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,640
I believe

807
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,920
my future wife

808
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,840
will never refuse my request.

809
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:02,800
Come on.

810
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,200
You'll be fine.

811
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,360
I'm here.

812
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,120
【iterol processed seized boy visited somewhere】

813
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,560
Master, what's wrong?

814
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,080
That's my bad.

815
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,360
Even if I have to struggle to ask someone to serve,

816
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,920
I still can't meet a standard challenge.

817
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,640
How is it?

818
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,680
Have you gotten a result?

819
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,640
I checked the menu

820
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,240
and there was nothing wrong.

821
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,420
That means the все primeval stomach en ed

822
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,640
is from the ingredient.

He Public Services is course like food.

824
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,760
Why would these ingredients

825
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,360
make him have stomach cramps?

826
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,920
It's strange.

827
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,840
Anyway, I'm grateful

828
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,040
that I don't eat vegetables.

829
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,160
No matter how I eat,

830
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,800
I'll have stomach cramps.

831
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:33,920
Master,

832
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,160
didn't you sleep well last night?

833
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,400
Why do you look sleepy?

834
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,160
The special food here is very delicious.

835
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,080
There are still some unopened cloths at night.

836
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,040
I smelled it

837
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,160
when I was riding at night.

838
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,800
Then I followed the scent

839
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,000
and went to find it.

840
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,640
