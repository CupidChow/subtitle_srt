00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,580
Welcome to Nusornrangsan.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,680
2008
- This is the last semester for all seniors

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,270
before we take one step closer to achieving our dreams

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,810
and do as Estee Lauder said:

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,160
“I never dreamed about success. I worked for it.”

6
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:32,110
the same way Diane von Furstenberg said about herself:

7
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,120
“I always wanted to be a femme fatale.

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,120
Even when I was a young girl,

9
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,580
I never really wanted to be a girl.

10
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,520
I wanted to be a woman.”

11
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,580
If you’re still not sure who you want to be,

12
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,140
Coco Chanel has a suggestion:

13
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:58,350
“A girl should be two things: who and what she wants.”

14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,620
The world may be full of different paths, stories, dreams,

15
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,110
and people beyond our control,

16
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,610
but at least there is one thing only we can do,

17
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,770
something Eleanor Roosevelt wants us to keep in mind:

18
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,260
“Remember no one can make you feel inferior without your consent.”

19
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:25,450
One last motto and my personal favorite comes from Ariana Huffington:

20
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:29,980
“Failure is not the opposite of success; it’s part of success.”

21
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:33,580
I wish you all an amazing first day of school.

22
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,940
Hey, no smoking in school!

23
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:47,610
You.

24
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,280
Wait, hey!

25
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,780
Sorry, Ploy.

26
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,200
Ploy.

27
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,280
Yes?

28
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,120
I’m talking to Ploypang.

29
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,740
Come help out with the school magazine during Thai class.

30
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,120
I’ve talked to Ms. Ubon, so don’t worry.

31
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,520
Yes.

32
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,100
Your homeroom teacher will be a bit late today.

33
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,420
Behave and be quiet, you guys.

34
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,770
Keep an eye on them, Ploy.

35
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,330
Of course.

36
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,490
Must be nice being a teacher’s pet, don’t you think?

37
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,390
You don’t even have to stay in class.

38
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,550
“Yes, Miss. Of course.”

39
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:49,490
Hey, Punk.

40
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,120
No need to be petty about it.

41
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,640
Prez is the busiest student in this school.

42
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,880
She’s our class prez and she runs the school magazine.

43
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:01,190
You’re also responsible for the yearbook, too, aren’t you, Prez?

44
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:01,960
Yeah.

45
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,410
Hold on.

46
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,110
I think you forgot one more title for her.

47
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,200
What’s that?

48
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,800
She’s also the President of the Kissing Teachers’ Ass-ociation.

49
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:22,200
Punk, stop making fun of the future of our nation!

50
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,180
Why can’t I?

51
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,380
What’s a brainless pretty face like you, then?

52
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,900
The trash of our nation?

53
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,720
You Punk!

54
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,280
Yeah?

55
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,000
You!

56
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,340
I’ll kill you!

57
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,380
Come get me!

58
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,440
Come back here!

59
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,550
Come at me!

60
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,580
Pretty, stop it!

61
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,830
Guys, Ms. Pisamai is here!

62
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,930
Oh, holy crap!

63
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:10,790
Oh, no.

64
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,220
Who was shouting?

65
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,550
Who was screaming?

66
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,720
Who was swearing?

67
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,280
Ploypang, tell me.

68
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,890
Who was it?

69
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,000
Uhh…

70
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:45,410
It was Padparadscha and Pandara.

71
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,410
Padparadscha. Pandara.

72
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,160
Follow me to the staffroom.

73
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,490
Snitch.

74
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,800
What you lookin’ at, you snitch?

75
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,260
What are you, a freaking seller?

76
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,170
Is that why you love selling your friends out?

77
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,220
What? On your way to sell another friend?

78
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,390
Pandara, are you allowed to speak right now?

79
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,700
Five more laps for you.

80
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,000
What?

81
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,570
Are you okay?

82
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:08,370
About that quip just now

83
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,120
or the kissing teachers’ butt joke before that?

84
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,510
All of those.

85
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,610
I’m fine.

86
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,470

88
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,870
are the right things to do, right?

89
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,870
I don’t care that some people don’t get it.

90
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:37,170

Why didn’t you tell me we’re selling this place?

95
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,010
Well, you saw it now.

96
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,390
But you wouldn’t have told me otherwise.

97
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,170
Are you planning to keep all the money to yourself?

98
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,170
You think I would do that?

99
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,290
I never know what’s going on in that head of yours, Ploy.

100
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,600
You don’t tell me anything anymore ever since we broke up.

101
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,390
I put my money into this place, too, you know?

102
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,170
Shouldn’t you keep me up to date about what’s going on here, at least?

103
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,670
This is a big deal, Ploy.

No.

I understand them, to be honest.

132
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:53,940
It must not be easy for them to accept an inexperienced boss like me.

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,100
You’re a school president,

188
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,500
a class president,

189
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,990
a stellar student.

190
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:54,240
You’ve always been exemplary.

191
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,750
Are you really going to take this student's side?

192
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,770
I’m not taking anyone’s side.

193
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,590
I really don’t know whose it is.

194
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,670
Fine.

195
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:11,460
Then tell me whom you think the cigarettes belong to.

196
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,940
I really don’t know.

197
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,160
If we can’t find the owner,

198
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:24,590
then I’ll have to deduct the points off of everyone in Class 2.

199
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:28,390
I won’t allow anyone to participate in the Sports Day event, too.

200
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,580
Don’t you think that’s unfair?

201
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,580
It isn’t, Ploypang.

202
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,380
Just give me a name.

203
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,280
Who does it belong to?

204
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,150
Thapchana.

205
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,530
I think it belongs to Thapchana.

206
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,630
I want to buy this place.

207
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,220
You want to buy this place?

208
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,220
Yes, I do.

209
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,670
Is this your place?

210
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,400
Yes.

211
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:17,610
The person who called me yesterday said his name was Ray…

212
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,690
I see.

213
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,110
Ray works for me.

214
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,410
He’s looking for a new place to turn into a studio for me.

215
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,050
I see.

216
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,970
Is that what you’re doing with it?

217
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,030
We have plenty of space for that here.

218
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,180
I’ll show you around.

219
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,440
This area here is spacious.

220
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,690
It’s perfect for anything.

221
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,230
The air flow here is great, too.

222
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,700
I’m sure the landlord wouldn’t mind.

223
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,700
What do you use it for?

224
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,190
I don’t know.

225
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,190
I thought you’d turn it into a workshop.

226
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,330
Why–Why don’t we go upstairs?

227
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,920
The second floor is also spacious,

228
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,580
but it’s currently a storage room.

229
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,490
Too bad.

230
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,910
I think it’d be a perfect gallery for ceramics.

231
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,030
Why do you have to bring the past up?

232
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,700
You remember?

233
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,360
I thought you forgot all about it.

234
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,500
Are you here to remind me how I couldn’t do what I said I would?

235
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,960
I don’t have to when it’s all too obvious.

236
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:43,620
You said your dream is to open your own gallery.

237
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,180
But that turned into a cafe in the end, didn’t it?

238
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,410
Maybe I changed my mind, you know?

239
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,920
Oh, of course.

240
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,700
You change your mind all the time, don’t you, Ploy?

241
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,880
What are you insinuating?

242
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:06,400
Ploy, don’t pretend you don’t know what you did.

243
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:08,580
What did I do?

244
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:11,950
Did I mean that little to you?

245
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,950
Whatever. I’m leaving.

246
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,180
Hey, hold on, Thap.

247
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:15,760
Thap.

248
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,930
Thap, I thought you’re buying this place?

249
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,230
Thap. Thap, hold on.

250
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,450
Thap. Thap, slow down. Listen to me.

251
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,560
I know you hold a grudge for what I did.

252
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,760
I’m sorry for everything that happened, alright?

253
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,870
I’m sorry I confiscated your ball.

254
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:33,540
I’m sorry I told the teacher I thought the cigarettes were yours.

255
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:35,950
I’m sorry I snitched on you before you skipped classes.

256
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:36,880
Ploy.

257
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,120
Are you trying to piss me off?

258
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,590
Stop acting like you’re innocent.

259
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,270
Do you think I would just forget that you cheated on me?

260
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,270
Cheated on you?

261
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,340
Me?

262
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,800
Yeah, you.

263
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,170
See you.

264
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,280
Not taking that?

265
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,850
I think that was one of your exes, actually.

266
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,460
Why would my exes call you?

267
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,700
I think someone put my number up for everyone to know.

268
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:28,760
Someone called and warned me about how you changed girlfriends like clothes.

269
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,760
Someone called and cursed at me, though.

270
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,950
Hey, that’s harassment, you know?

271
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,330
Do you want me to deal with them?

272
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,240
It’s alright.

273
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,880
I don’t listen to any of them anyway.

274
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,560
Because you trust me?

275
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,310
I trust myself.

276
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:58,430
I trust my judgement when I agreed to be your girlfriend.

277
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,110
Ploy.

278
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:10,770
About the brochure…

279
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:11,730
Hold on.

280
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,420
Hello?

281
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:20,000
Oh, of course. Please wait downstairs. I’ll be there.

282
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,750
Yes.

283
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,960
Be right back.

284
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,460
Ploy, it’s Mek.

285
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,380
I feel the same way.

286
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,650
I’m in love with you, Ploy.

287
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,280
Mek and I?

288
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,400
You’re out of your mind.

289
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,510
Stop lying and admit it.

290
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:23,110
I can’t admit it when it’s not true.

291
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,470
Fine. Keep denying that you’re a cheater.

292
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,290
It’s not like I can prove it now.

293
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,950
But at least admit that you’re a loser.

294
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,350
You can’t even run a cafe.

295
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:43,960
I thought an arrogant girl like you could do better than that.

296
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:49,270
Oh, and you’re so much better than I am?

297
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:51,810
Go and gloat somewhere else, you Thap-loser!

298
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,510
Don’t you dare show your face here again.

299
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,660
(Keep)

300
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,150
What a damn unlucky day.

301
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:30,817
One, two…

302
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,400
Let me see.

303
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,060
He looks great.

304
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:44,320
But I want to include the building in the background.

305
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:46,150
Of course.

306
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:49,160
Ready?

307
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,950
One, two…

308
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,220
Take a look.

309
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,890
I’m going to the toilet for a bit.

310
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,550
Sure.

311
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:03,400
You want to see?

312
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,106
Hey, this one looks great.

313
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,275
I think it’ll lure the younger students to open our school magazine for once.

314
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,871
You saying I’m pretty?

315
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,315
Fine.

316
00:25:17,733 --> 00:25:20,364
I’ll admit Prof was right when she recommended you.

317
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,466
Guess that’s everything good about you, Kram.

318
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,937
Your face, that is.

319
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,453
Ploy!

320
00:25:28,684 --> 00:25:29,475
I’m kidding.

321
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,266
Pass me the ball.

322
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,577
Football is not allowed around the building.

323
00:25:50,613 --> 00:25:53,777
It’s dangerous and a nuisance to other students—

324
00:25:53,813 --> 00:25:54,577
Come on.

325
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,302
A ball isn’t going to kill anybody.

326
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,671
Give that back.

327
00:26:02,168 --> 00:26:04,248
I have to confiscate this because you broke the rule.

328
00:26:04,782 --> 00:26:06,240
If you want it back,

329
00:26:06,657 --> 00:26:08,240
go get it at the staffroom.

330
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,088
Of course, Prez.

331
00:26:26,577 --> 00:26:27,448
Now confiscate that.

332
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:29,404
Have fun.

333
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:31,902
Thapchana.

334
00:26:32,151 --> 00:26:33,742
I hate you!

335
00:26:38,151 --> 00:26:39,740
It’s like you’re reading my mind.

336
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,577
I hate you, too, “Prez” Ploy.

337
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:48,213
Let’s go, guys.

338
00:27:08,053 --> 00:27:09,271
Hello, Dad.

339
00:27:09,813 --> 00:27:13,173
A teacher was passing by so I had to find somewhere else to use the phone.

340
00:27:13,217 --> 00:27:14,835
What did you say just now?

341
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:19,653
I was saying that you should stay with your mother for now, Ploy.

342
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,746
Don’t come to me yet.

343
00:27:24,933 --> 00:27:26,044
Why not?

344
00:27:26,764 --> 00:27:31,857
Your Aunt Ae just came to live with me, and she brought her dog Mali.

345
00:27:31,902 --> 00:27:34,764
It’s very chaotic over here right now. We’re still settling in.

346
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,364
Why don’t you come after you graduate?

347
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,515
Oh, I think Mali is getting hungry again.

348
00:27:42,542 --> 00:27:44,195
I have to go now, dear.

349
00:27:44,222 --> 00:27:44,675
Alright?

350
00:27:44,702 --> 00:27:46,720
Mali, you hungry?

351
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,182
Come on here, dear.

00:29:06,124 --> 00:29:08,000
(Senior Yearbook 2008)

354
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:14,097
Thap, come look at yourself.

355
00:29:14,142 --> 00:29:17,315
I can see all your teeth with your wide smile.

356
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,364
Thap, come on.

357
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:27,875
Look.

358
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:09,155
Wait…

359
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:11,946
That’s not my number.

360
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,546
And that isn’t Prof’s number.

361
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,773
Hey, Prof?

362
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,182
We’re in trouble. Our numbers got mixed up.

363
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:39,253
Whose numbers?

364
00:30:39,297 --> 00:30:40,373
Ploy’s.

365
00:30:40,791 --> 00:30:41,688
Which one?

366
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,786
All of our numbers!

367
00:30:43,822 --> 00:30:46,577
“Prez” Ploy, “Prof” Ploy, “Pretty” Ploy, “Punk” Ploy, “Plain” Ploy.

00:30:46,604 --> 00:30:48,373
You mean all five of us?

369
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,382
Yes.

370
00:30:50,888 --> 00:30:51,733
Shit.

371
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:53,964
Do they know?

372
00:30:54,017 --> 00:30:55,902
I don’t know. I don’t think they do.

373
00:30:55,928 --> 00:30:57,591
You and I certainly didn’t.

374
00:30:57,617 --> 00:30:59,590
I think they have no idea.

375
00:30:59,635 --> 00:31:01,662
That doesn’t matter now, does it?

376
00:31:01,697 --> 00:31:03,075
It’s been ages.

377
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,164
But what if someone tried to reach you but couldn’t?

378
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,226
And?

379
00:31:09,573 --> 00:31:11,422
It’s not a big deal, is it?

380
00:31:11,973 --> 00:31:13,804
I’ve been fine all these years.

381
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,573
It’s not like someone’s life was on the line.

382
00:31:16,302 --> 00:31:17,955
Are you sure about that?

383
00:31:19,555 --> 00:31:23,991
Everyone else must be living their best lives.

384
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,382
I don’t think they care.

385
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:29,937
Dee.

386
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,311
Dee, stop it. Please!

387
00:31:33,671 --> 00:31:35,137
Open up, Dee.

388
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,368
Pear.

389
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,364
Pear, baby.

390
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:40,693
Dee, please.

391
00:31:40,728 --> 00:31:42,933
Stop this.

392
00:31:43,182 --> 00:31:44,746
Pear, baby.

393
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,777
Dee, wait! Wait!

394
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,213
My bag.

395
00:33:04,631 --> 00:33:06,210
He stole my bag.

396
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,937
My bag.

397
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:10,124
Yes.

398
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:12,471
Yeah.

399
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,875
Muay Thai, huh?

400
00:33:20,648 --> 00:33:21,870
You want your bag?

401
00:33:22,142 --> 00:33:23,137
Take it.

402
00:33:23,182 --> 00:33:24,204
Take it.

403
00:33:50,844 --> 00:33:52,200
You want your bag?

404
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,128
Come on. Take it.

405
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:36,240
Hey, what the hell is this?

406
00:34:36,284 --> 00:34:37,840
Your girlfriend?

407
00:34:37,902 --> 00:34:38,568
Tell me!

408
00:34:38,613 --> 00:34:40,008
Can we do this later, Ploy?

409
00:34:40,017 --> 00:34:41,368
I’m working.

410
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,137
Please, sir.

411
00:34:43,173 --> 00:34:45,902
We have to talk now. I want to know now.

412
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,791
What the hell does this mean?

413
00:34:46,817 --> 00:34:49,180
I thought we’re dating. Are you two-timing me?

414
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:50,551
I didn’t even say we were dating.

415
00:34:50,586 --> 00:34:51,662
I chose her over you.

416
00:34:51,688 --> 00:34:55,040
It just didn’t click with you, Ploy.

417
00:34:55,084 --> 00:34:55,857
Please, sir.

418
00:34:56,391 --> 00:34:57,297
“Didn’t click”?

419
00:34:57,324 --> 00:34:58,773
“Didn’t click”?

420
00:34:59,057 --> 00:35:01,653
If we didn’t click, then what the hell was with you leaving comments,

421
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,764
liking my posts, stalking my Stories, and calling with me all night?

422
00:35:04,808 --> 00:35:06,284
You jerk!

423
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,586
You’re free to go!

424
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:15,555
Hey.

425
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:22,355
Which line is the unlucky line?

426
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,835
Can you just burn it off of my palm?

427
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,337
Why does every guy I’ve ever liked have to freaking ghost or dump me?

428
00:35:32,373 --> 00:35:33,875
Why?

429
00:35:34,204 --> 00:35:38,577
I’m in my 30’s and I haven’t even used my “weapon” yet!

430
00:35:39,146 --> 00:35:40,570
Your “weapon”?

431
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,493
This whole thing.

432
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,022
I haven’t used it!

433
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,266
And I’m so damn pretty, too!

434
00:35:46,293 --> 00:35:47,422
Sad, isn’t it?

435
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,600
Why is my life so freaking sad?

436
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,511
I think you’re drunk, young lady.

437
00:35:55,555 --> 00:35:57,200
Why don’t you come back for a palm reading when you’re sober?

438
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,222
Oh, see?

439
00:36:00,275 --> 00:36:02,320
Even you don’t want me!

440
00:36:02,355 --> 00:36:05,537
What the hell did I do in my past life

441
00:36:05,573 --> 00:36:08,977
for this one to be so, so, so, so cursed!?

442
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,573
Stop saying that word. I feel like you’re cursing me, too.

443
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:17,928
Fine.

444
00:36:17,964 --> 00:36:19,920
I’ll open my third eye and read your fortune.

445
00:36:20,755 --> 00:36:22,151
Concentrate.

446
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,022
Hmm…

447
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,208
I can see it pretty clearly.

448
00:36:27,591 --> 00:36:28,782
You’re loveless.

449
00:36:29,964 --> 00:36:31,960
You did something bad in the past.

450
00:36:32,008 --> 00:36:37,733
You have to fix this, otherwise your life will be miserable and you’ll die a virgin.

451
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:39,866
But…

452
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:43,066
if you want to fix this, there’s a ritual I can perform.

453
00:36:45,048 --> 00:36:49,164
(Donate via QR Code)

454
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:53,200
It only costs 900 baht— Oh?

455
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:55,155
What?

456
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:04,222
What I did in the past?

457
00:37:06,168 --> 00:37:08,977
When and what did I even do that?

458
00:37:39,573 --> 00:37:41,570
Because of the mix-up,

459
00:37:41,804 --> 00:37:44,880
Thap thought Mek was confessing his love to me.

460
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:50,471
Does that mean Thap broke up with you at the end of senior year because of this?

461
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:53,128
I think so.

462
00:37:55,155 --> 00:37:57,150
I don’t think we should be guessing this.

463
00:37:57,182 --> 00:37:59,653
Because if what you think is true,

464
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,124
this has been a 10-plus-year misunderstanding for you two, you know?

465
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:06,240
I won’t allow it.

466
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,755
You have to talk to Thap. Right now.

467
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:22,880
I think we got it.

468
00:38:22,915 --> 00:38:23,946
Let’s keep going.

469
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:26,604
Should we take a break first?

470
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,533
You haven’t had anything to eat at all, you know?

471
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,355
My stomach can wait.

472
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,840
Our client can’t.

473
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:34,462
We have to leave this studio in a few days, too.

474
00:38:34,506 --> 00:38:35,297
Come on.

475
00:38:35,653 --> 00:38:37,973
You haven’t found a new place yet?

476
00:38:38,577 --> 00:38:39,715
I haven’t.

477
00:38:39,742 --> 00:38:42,862
But if you don’t hurry up and work, I’ll find a new assistant soon.

478
00:38:42,897 --> 00:38:44,080
Oh, boy.

479
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,168
I’m ready now.

480
00:38:46,204 --> 00:38:47,280
Let’s do it.

481
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:49,146
Get to it.

482
00:39:01,155 --> 00:39:01,893
Hello?

483
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,608
I have something important to tell you.

484
00:39:05,644 --> 00:39:06,844
Now.

485
00:39:07,182 --> 00:39:09,955
Haven’t gotten over your bossy habit, have you?

486
00:39:09,991 --> 00:39:11,306
I’m busy.

487
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:11,991
Bye.

488
00:39:12,035 --> 00:39:13,262
Thap, wait.

489
00:39:17,084 --> 00:39:20,080
There was a mix-up of our phone numbers in the yearbook.

490
00:39:20,133 --> 00:39:22,471
You thought Mek wanted to tell me he loved me,

491
00:39:22,506 --> 00:39:23,857
but it wasn’t me at all.

492
00:39:23,884 --> 00:39:25,850
He meant to call a different Ploy.

493
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:31,173
Lay the next shot for me.

494
00:39:31,226 --> 00:39:32,373
I’ll be back.

495
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:34,755
Oh? Where are you going?

496
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:37,662
I’m heading to that cafe for sale.

497
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,671
You mean your ex’s place?

498
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,537
You don’t have to say everything that’s on your mind, you know?

499
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:47,911
Damn.

500
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:52,791
Lunch can wait, but his ex sure can’t, huh?

501
00:39:53,226 --> 00:39:55,857
Talking about being hung up…

502
00:40:00,373 --> 00:40:04,115
Even if it was because of the mix-up, I still won’t buy this place.

503
00:40:04,177 --> 00:40:04,986
What?

504
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,400
I thought you wouldn’t buy it because you’re still mad at me about this.

505
00:40:08,444 --> 00:40:10,640
This is the cause of it.

506
00:40:10,684 --> 00:40:11,991
I have nothing to do with it.

507
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:15,208
Hey, let’s all calm down.

508
00:40:15,244 --> 00:40:16,613
But I’m right.

509
00:40:16,657 --> 00:40:18,915
You were the one who answered my phone that day.

510
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,564
You misunderstood the whole thing all by yourself.

511
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,208
So who’s to blame?

512
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,280
So it was because of the mix-up in the yearbook.

513
00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:30,577
Exactly!

514
00:40:30,622 --> 00:40:32,360
Who was responsible for making it?

515
00:40:32,391 --> 00:40:32,746
It was—

516
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,555
It was you.

517
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:46,080
So you have to take responsibility for the mix-up, too.

518
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,786
Loser.

519
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,355
I really am a loser, like he says.

520
00:41:16,497 --> 00:41:18,350
But you know what’s even worse?

521
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:22,062
The fact that I know I’ve been a loser my entire life.

522
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,933
I’ver never done anything at all.

523
00:41:29,351 --> 00:41:30,930
It’s okay.

524
00:41:31,386 --> 00:41:35,848
I believe Thap will understand and forgive you one day.

525
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,080
Alright?

526
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,973
You were the one who answered my phone that day.

527
00:41:50,017 --> 00:41:52,560
You misunderstood the whole thing all by yourself.

528
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,746
So who’s to blame?

529
00:41:54,791 --> 00:41:56,560
I know the truth now,

530
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,982
but why doesn’t it make me feel any better?

531
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:13,182
Because the misunderstanding stems from love,

532
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,342
and love is no longer there,

533
00:42:15,822 --> 00:42:17,340
but your resentment still remains.

534
00:42:31,724 --> 00:42:32,888
Come to think of it,

535
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:36,986
I’m not the only person affected by this.

536
00:42:41,448 --> 00:42:43,813
(Pretty Ploy)

537
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,751
I knew you’d forgive her.

538
00:42:51,786 --> 00:42:53,635
Are you willing to buy her cafe now?

539
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,511
No.

540
00:42:55,555 --> 00:42:56,364
What?

541
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,604
Then what are you doing here?

542
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:01,173
I’m not the only victim here.

543
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:04,666
That mix-up broke my friend’s heart.

544
00:43:05,173 --> 00:43:06,660
That’s your responsibility.

545
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:09,564
What do you want me to do?

546
00:43:09,608 --> 00:43:11,964
Go back in time and sort the numbers out?

547
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:27,351
You have to help me make Mek forgive me so everything can go back to normal.

548
00:43:27,777 --> 00:43:28,773
- “Pretty” Ploy?
- “Pretty” Ploy?

00:43:54,684 --> 00:43:56,746
You like Mek?

551
00:43:56,773 --> 00:43:58,400
I thought you only wanted to use him to improve your grades.

552
00:43:58,444 --> 00:44:01,893
A nerd like Mek would never reject a girl like me.

553
00:44:01,937 --> 00:44:02,977
I hate stupid women.

554
00:44:03,004 --> 00:44:04,613
Mek is freaking hot now!

555
00:44:04,657 --> 00:44:06,435
I’ll definitely make him mine.

556
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,195
It’s been a while since we last met.

557
00:44:08,222 --> 00:44:09,688
Are you still thinking about me?
