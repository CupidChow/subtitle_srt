1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,380
You said your dream is to open your own gallery.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,670
(Fully Equipped Cafe For Sale)

3
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:04,780
But that turned into a cafe in the end, didn’t it?

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,880
Oh, and you’re so much better than I am?

5
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,800
Go and gloat somewhere else, you Thap-loser!

6
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:10,800
You have to talk to Thap. Right now.

7
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,880
So you have to take responsibility for the mix-up, too.

8
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,760
Is that so?

9
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:16,270
Is that okay?

10
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:16,870
Sure.

11
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,700
What the hell, Ploy?

12
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,310
If you want to go see another woman, just say so.

13
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,120
Why did you tell me that you want to be alone?

14
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,920
Seeing another woman?

15
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,140
I just met her today.

16
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,140
Leave me out of the mess between you two.

17
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,140
Do you really not know why I broke up with you?

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,210
It’s because you’ve never committed to me.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,710
Before blaming other people,

20
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,400
you need to reflect on yourself.

21
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,920
Take a good look at yourself.

22
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,770
Then you will know the answer.

23
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,430
How many guys have you broken up with?

24
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:08,000
I don’t know. I have stopped counting.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,570
Can you take me to a temple tomorrow?

26
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:11,980
I need to go pray to get rid of my bad luck.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,670
Please.

28
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,330
Yes.

29
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,330
Anyway, I need to get drunk tonight.

30
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,360
How are you feeling?

31
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,790
You shouldn’t have a second round. You should go home.

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,370
Get in.

33
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,840
Where are we going next?

34
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,730
Nowhere. I’m taking you home.

35
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,150
Sit straight.

36
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,570
Let’s go to Thonglor for the second round.

37
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,760
Let’s go.

38
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,760
Not Thonglor. Go to Klong Lot.

39
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,080
Please go to the destination I set.

40
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,400
Let’s go home.

41
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,790
I don’t want to go home.

42
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,090
Stop talking about Thonglor. We’re going to Klong Lot.

43
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,630
Hey.

44
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,310
Is it because I am blockheaded so no men want to be with me?

45
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,340
Mek.

46
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,570
I have something to tell you.

47
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,570
What?

48
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,730
If I tell you I love you, what will you do?

49
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,730
I don’t like airhead women.

50
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,120
I’m Pretty Ploy.

51
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,680
I might be one of the most frequently dumped women in the world despite being considered pretty.

52
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,680
How did this happen to me?

53
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,430
(My name is Padparadscha.)

54
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:37,440
(It’s the name of one of the rarest sapphires.)

55
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,310
(I grew up with the confidence in my beauty.)

56
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,220
Fabulous.

57
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:53,690
(Growing up with beauty privilege, my life has always been easy.)

58
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,680
(Except for finding a husband.)

59
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,260
Ploy, get up.

60
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:15,540
I am cursed both in real life and in my dreams.

61
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,410
Ploy, did you get the chicken?

62
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,160
I’m coming.

63
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:26,120
You always wake up late. This is why you can’t find a husband.

64
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,970
You know that she often comes home late because of her work.

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,180
Stop nagging her and take your medicine.

66
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,280
All I do is take medicine.

67
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:47,350
Penglee is also working but she managed to find a husband.

68
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:56,340
Will I get to see Ploy get married before I die?

69
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,650
Grandma, you don’t need to rush.

70
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,650
But Ploy you should hurry up.

71
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,580
Otherwise, you will be too old to have a baby.

72
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,480
Look at my children. They are so adorable.

73
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,450
Give it to me.

74
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:08,590
Give it to me.

75
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,520
Give it to me.

76
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,160
Let it go.

77
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,770
- Stop fighting. - 	Give it to me.

78
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:12,960
Let it go.

79
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,510
Stop it.

80
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,090
Let it go.

81
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,650
Honey, come and stop them.

82
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,230
Stop fighting.

83
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,460
Calm down.

84
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,040
If finding a husband was that easy, it would be great.

85
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,430
When I was young and had dozens of boys hitting on me,

86
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:31,380
They told me to be reserved and it wasn’t time for dating yet.

87
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,960
When I started to work, they told me that there were all kinds of men out there,

88
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,160
I needed to be careful when picking a boyfriend.

89
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,970
But now they tell me I need to get married soon because my biological clock runs out.

90
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,970
This is so confusing.

91
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,540
Hey, do you want to marry me?

92
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,900
What?

93
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:48,880
No way.

94
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:49,610
That’s creepy.

95
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,430
No way.

96
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,040
Cheers.

97
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,090
Hey.

98
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,180
I met Ploy.

99
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,130
Prez Ploy?

100
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,510
Yes.

101
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,370
Damn.

102
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,290
The predator met the prey.

103
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:13,920
No.

104
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,560
In this case, you are the prey.

105
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,530
No one is the prey.

106
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,480
Are you defending her?

107
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,080
Why? Do you want to get back with her?

108
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:37,590
Is Prez Ploy still dating Mek?

109
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,590
What dating?

110
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,100
They have never dated.

111
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,380
She never dated Mek, the boy that I flirted with?

112
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,200
No.

113
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,000
How many Mek do you know in your life?

114
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,710
They have never dated.

115
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,820
But you told me…

116
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,520
Mek called Prez Ploy that day.

117
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,170
He called the wrong number.

118
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,340
The numbers of all Ploy in the yearbook were mixed up.

119
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:23,150
Actually, Mek wanted to call you to confess his feelings.

120
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,240
He didn’t mean to call Prez Ploy.

121
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,980
(Jeh Chan Chicken Rice)

122
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:49,960
There are six siblings in a family, four boys and two girls.

123
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,900
The question is what is the probability that the two girls are standing on the

124
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,850
edges when all the siblings take photos together?

125
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,180
Try to solve it.

126
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,430
Why do the girls have to stand on the edges?

127
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,100
Why can’t they stand in the middle?

128
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,270
This is sexist.

129
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,860
This is a math question, not social studies.

130
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:08,870
Do it.

131
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:14,590
Mek, can you show me how to solve it?

132
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,170
Ploy.

133
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:19,180
Please, Mek.

134
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,400
You like Mek?

135
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,550
Didn’t you say you just flirt with him so he will help you with your study?

136
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:33,030
If you really like him,

137
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,610
Before you confess your feelings for him, you need to end things with other guys first.

138
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,350
Bank Chairball.

139
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,720
And Tew who is helping you with your art assignments.

140
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,180
If I end things with them and Mek rejects me,

141
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,650
I will fail all my classes.

142
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,370
Do you really like him?

143
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,670
If I can choose only one of them, I’ll choose Mek.

144
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:58,480
I’m positive that he can help me graduate high school.

145
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,470
You are overconfident.

146
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,320
What would you do if he rejects you?

147
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:06,450
Don’t you know who I am?

148
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:10,080
I am Padparadscha aka Pretty Ploy.

149
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,900
There’s no way that a nerd like Mek would reject me.

150
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,050
I don’t like airhead women.

151
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,770
(The numbers of all Ploy in the yearbook were mixed up.)

152
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,760
(Actually, Mek wanted to call you to confess his feelings.)

153
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,140
(He didn’t mean to call Prez Ploy.)

154
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:34,750
Here is the hot almond milk that you ordered.

155
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,120
What are you looking at?

156
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,770
I’m looking at the person who put a curse on me that I can never find love.

157
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,360
Ploy, why did you say such a nonsense thing?

158
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,970
I just found out that he liked me.

159
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:52,910
But he misunderstood that I pretended to like him.

160
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,180
So he put the curse on me.

161
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:00,290
Were your feelings for him back them real?

162
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,360
Yes.

163
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,610
I’d never had such a big crush before.

164
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:09,390
That’s why I believed that he cursed me.

165
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,390
I need to remove the curse.

166
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:16,920
Ploy, you don’t need to pay attention to your grandma’s words.

167
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,990
Your dad and I can take care of you for the rest of our lives.

168
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,740
Grandma’s nagging is one of the reasons.

169
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:32,110
But I also want to find a good love like you and Dad.

170
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:44,400
Earlier, you said you wanted us to help you make everything go back to normal.

171
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,090
What was your relationship with Mek?

172
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:47,930
Right.

173
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:53,690
Thap told me that Mek called me because he wanted to confess his feelings to you.

174
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,380
Do you still have feelings for Mek?

175
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,600
Wait a second, friends.

176
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,880
Calm down.

177
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,970
When I said I wanted things to go back to normal,

178
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,970
I meant I wanted he and I to be friends again.

179
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,110
My feelings for him are gone.

180
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,590
It was just a puppy love.

181
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,930
Why would I still hold on to it?

182
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:17,310
Do you remember that Mek? He was a nerd.

183
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,480
Look at me. I’m so pretty.

184
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:25,300
I think Mek might hold a grudge against me because he believed that I pretended to like him.

185
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:28,740
So he cursed me that I would never find love.

186
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:29,500
Pretty Ploy.

187
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,380
What you said is nonsense.

188
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:33,300
Hey.

189
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:36,290
You know that I went to many temples to pray for love.

190
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,060
How can a pretty woman like me not find a boyfriend?

191
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,940
A pretty woman like me should have been in dozens of relationships.

192
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,710
She is right.

193
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,720
It’s unlikely that a pretty woman like her can’t find a boyfriend.

194
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,240
I couldn’t picture that.

195
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:56,530
Me, too. I couldn’t picture you being a CEO and you being unemployed.

196
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,470
Is that your revenge on us?

197
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,240
Here she is.

198
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,110
Why don’t you sit on the bench?

199
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,840
I’m so freaking exhausted.

200
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:22,580
Here.

201
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:23,930
The shop was closing.

202
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,440
So I bought you the drinks before it was closed.

203
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,550
Thanks.

204
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,640
Why do you thank her?

205
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,530
If she didn’t give our names to the teacher, we wouldn’t be punished.

206
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:39,560
Even if Prez didn’t tell the teacher, she would ask our classmates anyway.

207
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,150
Don’t be too harsh to her.

208
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,150
Drink it.

209
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,900
Here is the money for the drinks.

210
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,480
Punk, take the drink.

211
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,780
What the heck is wrong with you?

212
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,970
Why is my straw so short?

213
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,530
It’s been more than ten years.

214
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,050
A lot of things have changed.

215
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,940
How are Punk Ploy and Plain Ploy doing?

216
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,510
Punk is living in Italy.

217
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,390
Plain got married several years ago.

218
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,750
We don’t talk much.

219
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,200
You two are lucky that you are still together.

220
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,170
What they say is true. High school friends are the best.

221
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,980
High School was the time when we dreamed together.

222
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,200
So what?

223
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,710
In the end, you have to wake up from the dream.

224
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,180
You are right.

225
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,940
It’s useless to talk about our past.

226
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:11,860
If Prez helps Pretty reconcile with Mek, will you buy her café?

227
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:17,970
Is she trying to take advantage of what is her responsibility?

228
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,380
It was all in the past.

229
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,310
Are you still in that dream?

230
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,000
That’s enough.

231
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:28,990
About Mek, I can help you.

232
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,560
Prof, are you sure that Mek will come to a place like this?

233
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,030
There he is.

234
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,340
Mek.

235
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,030
Pretty.

236
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,250
Let’s go to a new pub with me.

237
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:08,790
Of course, I’ll go.

238
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:09,810
Mek, come with us.

239
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,260
If you come with us, they will let us in for sure.

240
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,450
Mek, come with us.

241
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:14,880
Are you legally allowed to go in?

242
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,930
Mek.

243
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,580
You don’t need to wait until you are old to go into a pub.

244
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,630
All you need to do is bribe them.

245
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,630
This is Thailand.

246
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,360
Will you come?

247
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,000
Come with us. It will be fun.

248
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,460
Pack your bag.

249
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,380
I’ll go wait at Kram’s house.

250
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,570
I don’t like loud music.

251
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,940
Call me when you want to go home and I’ll send you a ride.

252
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,440
Do whatever you want.

253
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,880
Let’s go, Pretty.

254
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:40,960
Thank you.

255
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,660
Wait for me.

256
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,110
Noppatee.

257
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:04,390
He is so hot. I don’t think he wastes his time to curse you.

258
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,960
You are good at avoiding your responsibility.

259
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,580
Go talk to him so you…

260
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,970
I haven’t finished my sentence.

261
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:15,960
Go for it.

262
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,720
Let’s go.

263
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:21,590
Can I drink with you?

264
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:41,280
Mek, where are you going?

265
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:46,820
Mek.

266
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,390
Mek, where are you going?

267
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:56,670
Mek.

268
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,020
I’m Padparadscha from Class 2.

269
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,020
I walk away because I remember you.

270
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:13,600
Now, Mek Noppatee who was fooled by you is gone.

271
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,980
(In my high school, there were five classmates named Ploy.)

272
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,750
(My memory of Padparadscha is clearer than the other Ploy.)

273
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:31,590
(She was pretty but dumb.)

274
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:36,550
(Before I realized it, I couldn’t take my eyes off her.)

275
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,670
Can you help me with my study?

276
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:48,520
In the graph, the X and Y axes intersect at (0,2)

277
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:52,280
If f(x) = 0, X = -2.

278
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,270
This is the graph of the function intersecting the x-axis at (-2,0).

279
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:59,280
This is the graph if X = 2.

280
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,020
See the graph.

281
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,360
Do you understand it?

282
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,220
Padparadscha.

283
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,310
Mek.

284
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,830
We spend time together every day.

285
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,860
Don’t you ever develop any feelings for me?

286
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,360
Yes, but I won’t be wavered by it.

287
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,770
You said that to every guy.

288
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:34,160
What if I say this to you only, will you be wavered?

289
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,580
Do the exercise and show it to me tomorrow.

290
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,310
What the hell are you doing, nerd?

291
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,370
Come back.

292
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,760
It serves you right, pervert.

293
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,320
Yeah!

294
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,160
I can go home by myself from here.

295
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,180
I’m okay now.

296
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,630
It’s okay.

297
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,630
I need to go there to go home.

298
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:09,380
Huh? Your house is also in the same neighborhood as mine?

299
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,560
I never knew that.

300
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,300
We went past my house a while ago.

301
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,130
I’m going there to take a boat.

302
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,530
Let’s go.

303
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,530
Are you walking me home?

304
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,460
You like Mek?

305
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,360
Didn’t you say you just flirt with him so he will help you with your study?

306
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:35,240
If I can choose only one of them, I’ll choose Mek.

307
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,220
I’m positive that he can help me graduate high school.

308
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,590
What would you do if he rejects you?

309
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,860
Don’t you know who I am?

310
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:45,530
I am Padparadscha aka Pretty Ploy.

311
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:50,330
There’s no way that a nerd like Mek would reject me.

312
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:54,210
If you are that confident,

313
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,920
why don’t you confess your feelings to him today?

314
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,230
What will I get from doing that?

315
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,980
I’ll buy you lunch for the whole week.

316
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,180
Deal.

317
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:08,340
If I tell you I love you, what will you do?

318
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,400
I don’t like airhead women.

319
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,960
Mek.

320
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,320
How can you say that to me?

321
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,700
Even though I’m dumb, I am pretty.

322
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,700
Ploy, what happened?

323
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,020
I knew it.

324
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,770
A smart guy like Mek wouldn’t want to date you.

325
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,330
Don’t be sad. You still have Bank Chairball.

326
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,540
A pretty girl like you should date Bank Chairball, not Mek.

327
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:56,350
(I knew that the biggest fool back then was not Pretty Ploy but it was me.)

328
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,630
(Pretty Ploy)

329
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,800
Ploy, it’s Mek.

330
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,560
I’m sorry about the other day.

331
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,010
I feel the same way.

332
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,490
I’m in love with you, Ploy.

333
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,680
I thought she was dating me.

334
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:48,860
(I was a fool to forgive her for seeing me as her toy.)

335
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,350
Thapchana.

336
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:56,290
(I was even a bigger fool to think that I was her only toy.)

337
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:07,100
Mek, do you remember me?

338
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,280
Yes, so that I won’t forget my hard lesson.

339
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,080
Mek.

340
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,870
Pretty Ploy wants to apologize to you.

341
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,350
Can you forgive her?

342
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,700
You are the one who took her here to meet me?

343
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,540
How about this?

344
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:44,370
I will forgive you if you promise that you won’t take her to meet me again.

345
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:54,370
I’m sorry.

346
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,980
I didn’t think he would be this mad.

347
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:03,150
I think it might be true that Mek cursed you.

348
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:06,960
Why don’t you go to Taiwan?

349
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:09,250
It will be easier to ask the gods at Lungshan Temple to help you break the curse.

350
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,250
Hey.

351
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:18,210
Mek is so hot.

352
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,600
I will kill two birds with one stone.

353
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:25,880
I will not only ask him to forgive me

354
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,880
but I will also make him mine.

355
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,290
Pretty, are you out of your mind?

356
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,180
I’m in my right mind.

357
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,320
If you really feel bad for me, you need to help me.

358
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,760
Please, Prez Ploy and Prof Ploy.

359
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,470
I was talking with Pretty until two o’clock last night.

360
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,250
She asked me about every detail about Mek.

361
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,740
I think she is serious about this.

362
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:53,970
What are you going to do?

363
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:54,930
I…

364
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,780
Take the sign away and replace it with flowers.

365
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,070
So it will look more refreshing.

366
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,670
It will be easier to sell the café.

367
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:02,350
What?

368
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,000
Aren’t you going to wait for Thap’s decision?

369
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:09,410
I think if we help Pretty get what she wants, Thap will keep his promise.

370
00:25:09,866 --> 00:25:10,968
I don’t know.

371
00:25:11,004 --> 00:25:12,960
I’m not sure who I can trust.

372
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:17,173
If it’s too hard for you, remember that you always have me.

373
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,355
You always have me too.

374
00:25:20,382 --> 00:25:22,350
I know what you are doing.

375
00:25:22,382 --> 00:25:23,395
I’m rooting for you.

376
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,835
I’m rooting for you too.

377
00:25:43,324 --> 00:25:45,320
Kram is getting more handsome every day.

378
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,751
If he was not good-looking, he wouldn’t be selected to handle the bouquets.

379
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,693
Why don’t we tell Pretty Ploy to hit on him?

380
00:25:59,102 --> 00:25:59,848
Nonsense.

381
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,582
So we will have another good-looking member in our group.

382
00:26:22,782 --> 00:26:24,853
(Mek)

383
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:30,826
Hello, Mek.

384
00:26:30,862 --> 00:26:31,831
What’s up?

385
00:26:31,866 --> 00:26:35,875
Ploy, did you tell Padparadscha that my secretary resigned?

386
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:41,982
I’m not sure. We talked about many things last night.

387
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:42,933
Why?

388
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:45,413
Padparadscha applied for the job at my company.

389
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:48,142
Huh?

390
00:26:48,728 --> 00:26:50,720
Doesn’t she have a job?

391
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,137
I submitted my resignation this morning.

392
00:26:53,448 --> 00:26:55,146
I came here to find true love.

393
00:26:58,071 --> 00:27:00,186
You are unbelievable.

394
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,000
Does this mean you give me the job?

395
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,040
No.

396
00:27:10,204 --> 00:27:11,040
Please leave.

397
00:27:11,982 --> 00:27:13,980
I can’t give you the job.

398
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,333
Why?

399
00:27:15,377 --> 00:27:16,986
What are your reasons?

400
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,004
It’s about our past, isn’t it?

401
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:22,577
I never thought that you would be so petty.

402
00:27:22,595 --> 00:27:26,080
For me, the past is not something that happened and stayed only in the past.

403
00:27:26,124 --> 00:27:28,080
It’s the root of today.

404
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:32,568
A pretty woman like you can’t handle the work here.

405
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,813
Why? Is it my fault that I’m pretty?

406
00:27:35,848 --> 00:27:37,810
What the hell is the root of today?

407
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,968
You misunderstood me.

408
00:27:40,995 --> 00:27:43,582
Are you still misunderstanding me now?

409
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,511
You are not different from those who hold a double standard.

410
00:27:51,582 --> 00:27:55,208
Why don’t you believe that I can be both pretty and talented?

411
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:59,751
You never gave me a proper job interview or a probationary period before you

412
00:27:59,786 --> 00:28:00,871
judged me.

413
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,360
I think I have the right to say that you are good-looking but dumb.

414
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,533
Padparadscha.

415
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,488
Are you afraid that you may develop any feelings for me?

416
00:28:17,093 --> 00:28:21,342
We haven’t seen each other for years but you are still mad at me.

417
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,075
Mek.

418
00:28:30,471 --> 00:28:31,680
Mek, wait.

419
00:28:31,733 --> 00:28:32,604
Mek.

420
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,160
Padparadscha.

421
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,026
Your probationary period as a secretary is three months.

422
00:29:00,568 --> 00:29:03,262
(I will make him mine in three months.)

423
00:29:06,942 --> 00:29:08,257
This is driving me crazy.

424
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:12,897
Pretty resigned from her job and applied for Mek’s secretary.

425
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:17,937
I shouldn’t tell her that his secretary’s taking maternity leave.

426
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:22,160
This means she really changes her goal from asking for his forgiveness to making him her man.

427
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,955
What are you going to do?

428
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,168
I’ll do my best to help her.

429
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:32,240
Deep down, I think it was my fault.

430
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:35,511
If the numbers in the yearbook didn’t get mixed up,

431
00:29:35,546 --> 00:29:38,320
The relationship between Pretty Ploy and Mek might be different.

432
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,431
Your relationship with Thap too.

433
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,742
No.

434
00:29:43,813 --> 00:29:47,688
Sooner or later, my relationship with him would come to an end anyway.

435
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:52,737
As you see, I’m not the same Prez Ploy that you knew in high school.

436
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,964
Prez, it’s not cool to have a burnout when you are only in your early 30s.

437
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:03,084
I’ll give my passion to you.

438
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,120
I’m leaving.

439
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,386
Use your passion to burn everyone in today’s meeting.

440
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,795
You will find your passion again.

441
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,666
If you help Pretty, your passion will spark again.

442
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,991
Thank you, my bestie.

443
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,346
Thank you too.

444
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:27,715
Bye.

445
00:30:27,751 --> 00:30:28,470
Travel safe.

446
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,377
Hello.

447
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:50,524
Are you here to see Mek?

448
00:30:50,551 --> 00:30:51,795
Do you have an appointment?

449
00:30:52,435 --> 00:30:54,430
Are you Padparadscha?

450
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,791
How did you know me?

451
00:31:02,204 --> 00:31:05,982
This is Mrs. Matika, the CEO of this company and Mek’s mother.

452
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,404
His mom?

453
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,217
Hello, Mom.

454
00:31:13,244 --> 00:31:14,666
I’m Pretty Ploy.

455
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,666
Padparadscha, you are fired.

456
00:31:18,693 --> 00:31:20,660
Sure.

457
00:31:20,693 --> 00:31:21,546
Huh?

458
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:25,102
In the past,

459
00:31:25,137 --> 00:31:28,764
banks wanted to create an image that they were trustworthy, elegant, and secure.

460
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:32,382
So their offices were towering and had long stairs.

461
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,577
But today, bank offices maximize space utilization and are transparent and

462
00:31:38,622 --> 00:31:41,848
approachable to match the current image.

463
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:47,120
The person who will make the image of Make a House a Home more

464
00:31:47,164 --> 00:31:49,120
approachable is Kram Kramin.

465
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:53,955
Is he a popular star?

466
00:31:54,666 --> 00:31:56,088
I don’t recognize him.

467
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:58,577
Kram is an actor.

468
00:31:58,604 --> 00:32:01,697
His series air on television and are available on OTT platforms.

469
00:32:02,062 --> 00:32:04,320
The majority of Thais watch series.

470
00:32:04,613 --> 00:32:06,610
You came back to Thailand not long ago.

471
00:32:06,648 --> 00:32:09,591
I think you don’t know that he is not that well-known.

472
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:17,440
Kram is very popular on social media.

473
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:20,177
His engagement on social media is ten percent.

474
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,315
He’s also a friend of the house for several high-end brands.

475
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,568
Although I haven’t been back for long,

476
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:33,564
I know that we are a real estate company targeting upper-class consumers.

477
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:37,697
We also have a plan to expand our target market to the upper-middle class.

478
00:32:38,933 --> 00:32:44,248
Miss Atchaya, do you think how much our target market pays attention to TV series?

479
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:54,702
Let’s discuss again later.

480
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:05,111
Miss Paploy, you should be more respectful to other members of the executive board.

481
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,951
Don’t think that you can do anything because you are a major shareholder.

482
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:13,537
I never had such an idea.

483
00:33:13,573 --> 00:33:16,746
All I want is to do my best.

484
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,480
Mr. Chak, don’t you agree with me?

485
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:22,240
You are a whippersnapper.

486
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:27,146
Now, I understand why you disagree with me.

487
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:29,173
Even your insult is so outdated.

488
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:30,088
You!

489
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,044
What’s up?

490
00:33:35,031 --> 00:33:36,240
I’m free to talk.

491
00:33:36,773 --> 00:33:37,813
I’m not in the middle of anything important.

492
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,311
Yes.

493
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,115
Spill it.

494
00:33:43,004 --> 00:33:47,351
Girls, I met the queen bee.

495
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,164
Are you talking about Mek’s mom?

496
00:33:49,208 --> 00:33:49,866
Yes.

497
00:33:49,911 --> 00:33:52,666
She didn’t say anything. She just fired me.

498
00:33:52,702 --> 00:33:54,408
You need to come here and help me.

499
00:33:54,444 --> 00:33:56,400
I didn’t do anything wrong. I can’t let her do this to me.

500
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:57,564
You can’t go in.

501
00:34:01,404 --> 00:34:02,568
It’s too late.

502
00:34:02,595 --> 00:34:04,737
This is the new secretary that you fired earlier.

503
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,968
Do you really have to fire her?

504
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:14,373
Mek, do you remember that there was a problem with the yearbook?

505
00:34:14,417 --> 00:34:16,088
I asked everyone to help out.

506
00:34:16,133 --> 00:34:18,417
We barely made the deadline of the print house.

507
00:34:18,444 --> 00:34:20,410
The yearbook distribution was delayed until the school break.

508
00:34:25,191 --> 00:34:28,364
Everyone, do you see a red flash drive?

509
00:34:35,733 --> 00:34:36,577
Where is it?

510
00:34:45,893 --> 00:34:46,728
Do you need my help?

511
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:49,280
Just stay out of my way.

512
00:34:49,875 --> 00:34:51,280
Just stay out of my way.

513
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,893
Just stay out of my way.

514
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:59,208
Does someone lose this?

515
00:35:01,511 --> 00:35:02,524
Prez, is this yours?

516
00:35:02,551 --> 00:35:04,248
I found it in front of the staffroom.

517
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,533
Yes.

518
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:09,075
Thank you so much, Plain.

519
00:35:09,075 --> 00:35:11,070
I would be in big trouble if I lost it.

520
00:35:11,422 --> 00:35:13,164
My computer is dead.

521
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,400
Oh, I slip.

522
00:35:34,106 --> 00:35:35,217
I can’t catch it.

523
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,617
Sorry.

524
00:35:40,808 --> 00:35:42,080
The file is broken?

525
00:35:44,364 --> 00:35:45,688
That’s not my problem.

526
00:35:45,733 --> 00:35:48,782
You need to finish the yearbook by the deadline.

527
00:35:57,377 --> 00:35:59,370
We all were working together to make the yearbook.

528
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:02,391
We barely made the deadline of the print house.

529
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:07,137
I didn’t how our numbers got mixed up.

530
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:15,111
This is why we came here to see you and your mom.

531
00:36:15,155 --> 00:36:18,222
We want to tell you that you called the wrong number that day.

532
00:36:18,257 --> 00:36:21,377
You called Prez Ploy and Thapchana answered your call.

533
00:36:22,497 --> 00:36:25,040
Thap and I are just friends.

534
00:36:25,768 --> 00:36:28,782
Why do you come back into my life?

535
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:32,355
(If I say I want him, his mom will kick me out.)

536
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,160
Did you come back because you want to date my son?

537
00:36:34,204 --> 00:36:35,591
That’s right.

538
00:36:36,622 --> 00:36:37,590
No.

539
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:40,915
That’s right.

540
00:36:41,244 --> 00:36:43,240
Can I date him?

541
00:36:44,444 --> 00:36:46,382
She is so honest.

542
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:51,182
Ploy, I’m not Noppatee that you knew.

543
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,671
I don’t have time to play with you.

544
00:36:53,697 --> 00:36:55,075
I didn’t come here to play.

545
00:36:55,111 --> 00:36:57,070
I really want to date you.

546
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,391
As an old friend, I think we should stay friends like we have been.

547
00:37:03,182 --> 00:37:07,688
As a woman, you are not my type.

548
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,986
(Damn, he’s so mean.)

549
00:37:11,013 --> 00:37:12,800
(It feels like he shoots an arrow into my heart.)

550
00:37:14,088 --> 00:37:14,800
Alright.

551
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,071
My son doesn’t want to date you.

552
00:37:18,124 --> 00:37:20,782
He gave you the job because he wanted to give you a chance.

553
00:37:20,817 --> 00:37:25,360
You already confessed that you applied for the job because you have a hidden agenda.

554
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,906
Now, I have a justifiable reason to fire you.

555
00:37:39,351 --> 00:37:40,426
Goodbye.

556
00:37:46,568 --> 00:37:48,420
What’s wrong with her?

557
00:37:48,471 --> 00:37:51,013
She shows up and leaves any time she wants.

558
00:37:51,057 --> 00:37:54,106
I’ll tell security not to allow her into the building.

559
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,662
It’s okay, Mom.

560
00:37:55,688 --> 00:37:57,528
I don’t think she dares to come back.

561
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:06,444
What do you think of Paploy?

562
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,711
Paploy?

563
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,537
She is good.

564
00:38:11,564 --> 00:38:12,675
Her personality is nice.

565
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,791
I think so too.

566
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:20,373
I went to see a fortune teller.

567
00:38:20,444 --> 00:38:24,373
She said you and Paploy are a great match.

568
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:29,546
Didn’t you tell me that she is a loyal lover?

569
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:32,000
So are you.

570
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:34,977
Why don’t you date her?

571
00:38:35,013 --> 00:38:37,333
I think you two will get along well.

572
00:38:38,728 --> 00:38:39,431
Mom.

573
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,955
Palpoy is a loyal lover.

574
00:38:42,791 --> 00:38:44,373
That’s why she will never love me.

575
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:10,417
Prof, I include engagement details in the pitch deck.

576
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:13,315
In the file, I also put research on how mood and tone stimulate emotional

577
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,502
expression as a reference in it.

578
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,671
Thank you, Mek.

579
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:22,773
I’m sorry for the trouble that Pretty Ploy caused you.

580
00:39:22,826 --> 00:39:24,284
It’s okay. It’s not a big deal.

581
00:39:24,657 --> 00:39:28,257
I know that Padparadscha never takes anything seriously.

582
00:39:30,773 --> 00:39:31,386
Anyway,

583
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:35,724
have you discussed with your board about Kram?

584
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:45,795
They want to see the final storyboard from your company first.

585
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,346
I hope he will take the job.

586
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,604
It will be great if he does.

587
00:39:56,871 --> 00:40:00,622
This may be my last chance.

588
00:40:02,577 --> 00:40:03,182
Hey.

589
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:16,080
We are closed.

590
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,155
I came to give you a draft of the purchase agreement.

591
00:40:19,973 --> 00:40:20,462
Huh?

592
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:23,964
I’m going to purchase your café.

593
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,271
I always keep my promise.

594
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,688
But Pretty Ploy hasn’t…

595
00:40:27,733 --> 00:40:28,995
She is fighting hard for him.

596
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,782
The mood and tone represent the vibes of security and elegance which are the

597
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,471
main elements of your company’s image.

598
00:40:46,506 --> 00:40:48,470
We adjusted it according to your feedback.

599
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:51,164
That’s great.

600
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,982
Is there anything else you want to add?

601
00:40:55,448 --> 00:40:56,960
Good job.

602
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:03,573
Our president found an amazing partner to work on the project.

603
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:07,555
Even though Miss Paploy is just a rookie, the project will turn out great anyway.

604
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:13,182
Mr. Chak, a rookie is different from a professional.

605
00:41:13,351 --> 00:41:16,302
For me, Paploy is a professional.

606
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,124
For example, our contract.

607
00:41:18,177 --> 00:41:22,755
In the past, I had to wait for several months for you to send it.

608
00:41:22,791 --> 00:41:24,551
I don’t know why you kept delaying it.

609
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,320
What about now, Mek?

610
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:29,680
The contract is amended. We can sign it today.

611
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:34,524
This is what I call a professional.

612
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:37,822
Fine.

613
00:41:37,893 --> 00:41:39,528
Good luck.

614
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,946
He’s such an old coot.

615
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,471
He’s talking as if this is not his company.

616
00:41:54,248 --> 00:41:55,822
Thank you so much.

617
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:01,537
About the production contract, my legal team has prepared a complete draft.

618
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:19,146
Please follow me to the legal team’s meeting room.

619
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,626
Tomorrow, Mek has a final presentation with Paploy’s company.

620
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:34,240
I have a lot of experience as a project coordinator.

621
00:42:34,311 --> 00:42:36,871
Can you ask Prof to give me a job?

622
00:42:36,915 --> 00:42:39,040
If you ask her, she will definitely agree to it.

623
00:42:39,377 --> 00:42:41,324
Then I’ll forgive you for your mistake in the yearbook.

624
00:42:41,377 --> 00:42:42,488
Huh?

625
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,551
Let me introduce her.

626
00:42:46,613 --> 00:42:50,240
This is Padparadscha, the project coordinator for the rebranding project.

627
00:42:53,315 --> 00:42:56,373
Now, you can’t fire me.

628
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:09,084
Please follow me to the legal team’s meeting room.

629
00:43:15,208 --> 00:43:20,880
Mek, if you want to go to another room, you can text me.

630
00:43:35,511 --> 00:43:40,693
Directed by Snap25 Team

631
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:58,062
Why did the artist named PdR decline our offer?

632
00:43:58,106 --> 00:44:00,951
The board of Make a House a Home refuses to hire another artist.

633
00:44:00,977 --> 00:44:03,626
They are trying to sabotage Prof’s work.

634
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,048
I miss the time when we were in high school.

635
00:44:05,093 --> 00:44:07,982
Do you miss that time or Ploy?

636
00:44:08,017 --> 00:44:11,555
The artist named PdR is Punk Ploy Pandara.

637
00:44:11,591 --> 00:44:13,550
She said she saw your message.

638
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:14,924
But she will never accept your offer.

639
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,195
She added that she won’t forgive you for the number mix-up in the yearbook.

640
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,177
Have you ever given your all to fight for love?

641
00:44:20,248 --> 00:44:23,484
Mek, you are the first man whom I want to have a serious relationship with.

642
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:25,715
It’s okay if you don’t believe me.
